On Wednesday, Hunter Biden came to Capitol Hill and told Republicans that not only was he qualified for his job with Burisma, but he had a more impressive business background than any of them. “You guys have gone out and said I had no credibility, no ― that there’s no way that I should’ve been serving on the board of Burisma,” Biden said, according to a transcript released Thursday. “I just read you my resume,” he said. “I’d put my resume up against any of you, in terms of my responsibility.” It was one of several combative moments from a seven-hour deposition Republicans held Wednesday as part of their impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden. Republicans have not uncovered any official wrongdoing by the president despite months of searching for bribes and improper participation in his son’s business deals. During questioning, Republicans sought to undercut Hunter Biden’s insistence that he was qualified for the job, and they repeatedly asked him to detail the timeline of his addictions to alcohol and crack cocaine ― something he detailed in a 2021 book that Republicans have apparently never consulted. In response to their questions, Biden suggested Republicans were being hypocritical about their own problems with drugs and alcohol. Biden created an instant controversy when he took a high-paying position on Burisma’s board in 2014, while his father, then the vice president, served as the face of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine. State Department officials privately complained that the job created the appearance of a conflict of interest, and Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to announce an investigation, withholding military aid in an extortion scheme that triggered his first impeachment. Those same officials said, however, that Hunter Biden’s Burisma job had no effect on U.S. policy. Republicans have resurrected Trump’s corruption allegations and made them Exhibit A in their impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, claiming his son was useless to Burisma except as a conduit for bribes to his father. The younger Biden has had it both ways with Burisma. On the one hand, he admitted his last name helped him get the board position, saying high-profile Western board members allowed Burisma to send a defiant message to Vladimir Putin, who had launched an invasion of Ukraine. But he’s also insisted that he was qualified ― and he seemed to relish the chance to say so to Republicans directly, citing his Ivy League degrees and previous positions on corporate and nonprofit boards. “I don’t know anybody that was, at that time, that was teaching the No. 1 rated course at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service in the master’s program in terms of foreign policy and advocacy,” Hunter Biden said. “I literally was on 17 ― like, 12 different boards. I only listed like, you know, 10 of them. And so I had an enormous amount of reasons to be on it.” He repeatedly asked his own questions during the deposition. In response to queries about his father meeting his business associates for dinner, he asked Republicans if they had a problem with Donald Trump’s son-in-law landing a $2 billion deal with the Saudi government shortly after serving as an advisor to the president. “When Jared Kushner flies over to Saudi Arabia, picks up $2 billion, comes back, and puts it in his pocket, OK, and he is running for president of the United States, you guys have any problem with that?” (Democrats claimed that several Republicans nodded in agreement in response to the Kushner remark.) When Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) asked if Biden was on drugs when he was on the Burisma board, Biden asked a loaded question of his own. “Mr. Gaetz, look me in the eye. You really think that’s appropriate to ask me?” “Absolutely,” Gaetz said. “Of all the people sitting around this table, do you think that’s appropriate to ask me?” Biden said, seemingly alluding to allegations of drug use that have swirled around Gaetz. Biden wrote a month-by-month account of his addiction to crack cocaine in his 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things,” which included a chapter specifically about Burisma ― but it seemed as though Republicans had no familiarity with the material. “Yes, I was an addict,” Biden said. “What does that have to do with whether or not you’re going to go forward with an impeachment of my father other than to simply try to embarrass me?” Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) followed Gaetz with more questions about the timeline of his addiction and his work for Burisma, asking if Biden should have disclosed his problems to the company. Biden said that’s not how addiction works. “I can guarantee you, at least 30% of the people that you serve with suffer from alcoholism,” Biden said. “Do you think it’s incumbent upon them, if they suffer from alcoholism, that they immediately resign?” Biden said he had good days and bad days struggling with his addiction, and that his close associates knew about his efforts to recover ― as they themselves have testified in their own interviews with lawmakers. As for his actual board work, Biden said he brought expertise on corporate governance to a company that wanted to elevate its financial standards. “My responsibilities were like any other board member, to attend board meetings, to be aware of what the management was doing to try to strive for, you know, accountability, transparency, openness in terms of the reporting, to go through the financials and make certain that the financials were certified by a [certified public accountant],” Biden said. Republicans have repeatedly held up an anecdote from Devon Archer, a business associate of Biden’s who recruited him to Burisma’s board, as evidence that Biden got his father to help the company. Archer told lawmakers in a transcribed interview last year that he witnessed Burisma executives ask Biden to “call D.C.” in December 2015 and that he thought he might have called his father, though Archer admitted he did not witness such a call. House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) has suggested the call resulted in Joe Biden pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was supposedly investigating Burisma. But Hunter Biden said there was no such call. “I know there was never a phone call to my father. I can say that under oath,” he said. (Separately, Hunter Biden testified that he did help Burisma connect with a Democratic consulting firm that helped the company’s executives with visa and other issues.) Biden initially refused to sit for a closed-door deposition when Republicans sent him a subpoena last year, insisting instead on public testimony, before changing his mind and sitting for Wednesday’s interview. House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) said this week that he still wants to have a public hearing, but it’s not clear if Biden remains willing. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, noted in a statement after the deposition that the source of a key bribery allegation has been charged with fabricating the claim and lying to the FBI. Bribes had supposedly been paid by the head of Burisma to both Hunter and Joe Biden, and Republicans had touted the informant’s dubious claim as their very best piece of evidence.

Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who both sit on the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the White House must demand accountability after the mass deaths and ensure aid can reach those starving in Gaza as soon as possible. “People are starving in Gaza. And civilians are dying every day — including in this horrific incident in Gaza City today,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “This has gone on for far too long without sufficient action.” Gaza officials and Israel have traded blame for the death toll. The Gaza Health Ministry said Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd gathered near a convoy of aid trucks on Thursday. Officials described the gunfire as a “massacre,” saying more than 100 had died and more than 760 were injured as desperate Palestinians struggled to get food. It was the first major aid delivery to the area in a month. My statement on the path forward after today’s horrific events in Gaza. I want a negotiated longer term cessation of hostilities to get the hostages out, but right now Israel needs to pause military operations in order to get this humanitarian nightmare under control. pic.twitter.com/iQxY9wc4Di Israel admitted that its troops had fired warning shots but claimed troops fired only on people who approached the trucks in a threatening way. Israel instead attributed many of the deaths to a stampede. “We didn’t open fire on those seeking aid,” the chief military spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told The Associated Press. “Contrary to the accusations, we didn’t open fire on a humanitarian aid convoy, not from the air and not from land. We secured it so it could reach northern Gaza.” The episode quickly prompted international condemnation. Biden said Thursday that any negotiations for a cease-fire will be further complicated, expanding his timeline for any eventual deal. And State Department officials said they were looking into “exactly what took place” in Gaza. But the senators on Thursday urged the White House to act with haste after the mass deaths. Murphy added that the deaths Thursday were the result of “the complete breakdown in social order in Gaza,” saying the situation was “spiraling out of control” without humanitarian aid and a negotiated cease-fire. “To be clear, Hamas started this war and could end it tomorrow by releasing the hostages and surrendering those responsible for the October 7th attacks,” Murphy said. “However, the appalling scenes from Gaza City today and the staggering civilian death toll that has already occurred in Gaza are not in Israel’s nor the United States’ interest.” Murphy said Biden should use “all available leverage” to see Israel and Hamas reach a longer-term cease-fire. Van Hollen added Thursday that “enough is enough.” “America cannot be complicit in this ongoing humanitarian catastrophe,” he wrote. “We know what must be done, now we must do it.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

In a letter penned to the state’s legislature on Wednesday, more than 300 advocacy and LGBTQ organizations, including Freedom Oklahoma, GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, alleged that Ryan Walters, the state’s superintendent of public instruction, is “responsible for fostering a culture of violence and hate against the 2SLGBTQI+ community in Oklahoma schools.” They argued that Walters created a hostile environment at Oklahoma schools which contributed to the death of 16-year-old Nex Benedict, who was assaulted in a school bathroom earlier this month. Benedict had been bullied since last year, the Independent reported, shortly after Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) signed a law requiring students to use bathrooms that match the sex listed on their birth certificate. “Superintendent Walters’ reprehensible conduct shows a willful rejection of his duty to protect the health and welfare of the children in Oklahoma’s public schools and instead has created an environment that allows for hostility and harm for youth like Nex,” the letter stated. “We are outraged that a climate of hate and bigotry has been not only allowed to thrive, but encouraged by the person who is responsible for education in the state of Oklahoma. State officials must be held accountable for bringing the politics of hate into Oklahoma’s schools and making our most vulnerable youth pay the price.” Walters has faced calls for his ouster before. Last month, he faced backlash for passing an emergency rule to bar students from changing the gender marker listed on their school files. He also appointed Chaya Raichik, the creator of the far-right social media account Libs of TikTok, to a seat on Oklahoma’s library review committee earlier this year. Last year, Libs of TiKTok made a post targeting a librarian at an Oklahoma school, NBC News reported. The school district received bomb threats a day after Walters retweeted the Libs of TikTok post, prompting Oklahoma Democrats to push for an impeachment probe of the superintendent. Walters has also been scrutinized for his campaign’s affiliation with Ron “The Real Ron Ron” Causby, a far-right podcaster who has called for violence against transgender people. Walters reportedly participated in a fundraiser event at the influencer’s residence in 2022, according to Media Matters. In a statement sent to HuffPost, Walters dismissed the organizations’ recent call for his removal as a “standard tactic of the radical left” that will “stop at nothing to destroy the country and our state.” “Their woke desperate political game has led them to exploit the death of a young Oklahoman,” Walters said. “I will never stop fighting, I will not play woke gender games, and I will not back down to a woke mob.” Since Benedict’s death, other young people have come forward about the harassment faced by LGBTQ students in Oklahoma, the letter claims. LGBTQ youth mental health organizations have also reported a major increase in crisis calls since the incident, with many callers citing instances of bullying and harassment, the Advocate reported. So far this year, Oklahoma has introduced 54 anti-LGBTQ bills, according to the ACLU, including bans on gender-affirming care and restrictions on what pronouns teachers can use for their students.

Authorities arrested four men and three women in connection to the murder of Mahogany Jaquise Jackson, Birmingham police announced on Wednesday. According to a local Alabama outlet, Jackson was reported missing on Sunday after her mother and sister received a message from her on Facebook messenger. “She sent me a text message that said she was being held hostage and sent her location,’’ Gail Maddox, Jackson’s mother, said. The location Jackson sent was at Serenity Apartments in Birmingham’s Powderly community, but she was nowhere to be found when police arrived, according to the outlet. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Birmingham Police Chief Scott Thurmon said investigators were able to locate Jackson’s body on the side of a road with help from the public. Police located her body around 2:19 a.m. Monday and “determined she had been shot.” Police believe Jackson and all seven suspects knew each other. “I would say all these individuals were acquaintances, they were not strangers to one another,” Thurmon said. Giovonnie Clapp, 23; Blair Green, 25; and Si’nya McCall, 23; were charged with felony murder, kidnapping in the first degree, and sodomy in the first degree. Jeremiah McDowell, 18; Brandon Pope, 24; and Francis Harris, 25; were charged with capital murder/sodomy in the first degree and capital murder/kidnapping in the first degree. Teja Lewis, 25, was also charged with felony murder and assault in the second degree with injury/weapon. Clapp also faces assault charges. All suspects are being held without bond. Thurmon declined to release specific details about Jackson’s kidnapping but mentioned she was taken to several different locations, and the suspects recorded the sexual assault. “It was absolutely disgusting,” Thurmond told reporters.

In a new interview with CNN Thursday, Zendaya shared that meeting Butler — who dons transparent skin, black teeth and an eyebrow-less face for his role as the merciless villain Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen — during her first day on set in Budapest was “quite jarring.” “I was like, ‘Well, this is one way to get to know someone!’” she said of being introduced to Butler in-costume. Feyd-Rautha was previously played by musician Sting in David Lynch’s 1985 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel. “It was also funny because once you get to know Austin, you see that he’s obviously very warm and very kind. From just five seconds ago, being this terrifying creature, and then being like, ‘Hey, how are you? Good to see you!’” she told CNN. Leading man Chalamet echoed having a similarly “crazy” reaction to seeing Butler’s drastic transformation. The “Bones and All” star recalled being nervous when he met Butler in a stunt warehouse to rehearse one of their fight scenes, considering the two had to be “pretty aggressive” with each other “right off the bat.” “(It was) a lot of rehearsal. A lot of practice in LA, before even getting over to Hungary,” Chalamet said. “But it was a dream.” Earlier this week, Butler spoke about how he approached playing the “demonic” character. “The thing with a villainous character — I’d never played a character quite like it, and I didn’t want to judge him,” he said on “The Tonight Show.” He added: “It was a lot of imagining what his childhood was like, and thankfully seeing the first film, Stellan Skarsgard’s character, the Baron, he’s amazing... I just imagined what it would be like growing up with him as my father.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon is set to hold a hearing on the timing of the trial on Friday. If she agrees to Smith’s timeline, the former president would be forced to defend himself just before the Republican National Convention begins and the party officially selects its presidential nominee. The RNC will be held from July 15 to 18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. BREAKING: Jack Smith proposes a new Florida trial date of *July 8* pic.twitter.com/LTKwprj0T5 Trump’s attorneys rejected Smith’s timeline in a filing of their own Thursday, saying the former president would not receive a fair trial while he was simultaneously campaigning for the presidency. He pushed for the trial, to be held in Florida, to begin after the 2024 presidential election, but also offered up Aug. 12 as an alternative start date. “As the leading candidate in the 2024 election, President Trump strongly asserts that a fair trial cannot be conducted this year in a manner consistent with the Constitution, which affords President Trump a Sixth Amendment right to be present and to participate in these proceeding,” his lawyers wrote. “Consistent with the Introduction and reiterating the position that a fair trial cannot be held until after the 2024 Presidential election is concluded.” Trump was indicted last June over his handling of classified documents after he left the White House. Smith’s team has accused the former president of hoarding the files at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida and resisting government efforts to see them returned. The charges include counts of willful retention of documents, making false statements and obstruction of justice, among others. Trump has been charged with 40 counts in total.

Smith’s team this week rebuffed Trump’s claims that he had been unfairly targeted, saying there has “never been a case in American history in which a former official has engaged in conduct remotely similar to Trump’s.” But the former president has regularly lambasted the indictment — and the three others now pending against him — as political witch hunts. His attorneys have pushed claims that he is protected from prosecution, leaning on unprecedentedly broad interpretations of presidential immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court said it would hear arguments on some of those immunity claims in relation to the federal charges he faces related to the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.

On Wednesday, WeightWatchers confirmed that Winfrey would not be standing for reelection on its board of directors in May, thus concluding her nine-year tenure with the company. In a statement on WeightWatchers’ website, Winfrey said she planned to donate her shares in the company to the National Museum of African American History and Culture while remaining “a vocal advocate in advancing [the] conversation” around weight management. “I look forward to continuing to advise and collaborate with WeightWatchers and CEO Sima Sistani in elevating the conversation around recognizing obesity as a chronic condition, working to reduce stigma, and advocating for health equity,” she said. Thilo Semmelbauer, who is WeightWatchers’ chairman of the board, called Winfrey “an inspiring presence and passionate advocate” for all of the company’s members, adding: “What I know for sure, we will dearly miss her presence on the Board.” Winfrey bought a 10% stake in WeightWatchers and joined its board in 2015. Since then, she’s been one of the company’s most prominent celebrity spokespeople and appeared in a number of ad campaigns. By 2017, she’d reportedly lost 42 pounds while on the program. In December, however, Winfrey confirmed that she’d begun taking weight loss medication as a “maintenance tool” after consulting with her doctor. “The fact that there’s a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for,” she told People. “I’m absolutely done with the shaming from other people and particularly myself.” Winfrey notably did not specify which weight loss drug she’d taken, and WeightWatchers has recently begun evolving its program to account for those taking prescription medications as a method to shed weight.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fat-joe-donald-trump-sneakers_n_65e0c47fe4b0d2a2475872b8","Rapper Fat Joe Criticized For Getting A Pair Of Donald Trump-Branded Sneakers","kimberley richards","2024-02-29","Rapper Fat Joe has received backlash on social media after announcing that he owns a pair of golden high-tops from former President Donald Trump’s panned sneaker brand. The Bronx, New York, native showed off one of the shoes in an Instagram Live video that was later posted to his account Monday. The “Lean Back” rapper defended his decision to obtain the shoes, saying that he only did so because he is a sneaker collector. “Me, as a sneaker collector, I had to get my hand on the Trumps,” he said in the video, comparing sneaker collectors to art collectors who may not support or be aware of an artist’s politics. “Listen, I have thousands and thousands and thousands of sneakers,” he said, before someone off camera held a Trump-branded shoe box in front of Fat Joe’s face. The rapper, born Joseph Antonio Cartagena, said in the Instagram Live video that despite having the shoes, he’s a “die-hard Democrat” and not a fan of Trump. “I’m not a Trumper, I dislike Trump, I’m not voting for him — not now, not never,” said Fat Joe, who then held one of the sneakers up to the camera. “But I’m a sneaker collector into the art, so I had to find these.” The rapper later insisted that he didn’t pay for the shoes, saying that he was given a pair because he’s “the biggest in the game.” Fat Joe has previously voiced his support for Democrats Joe Biden and Barack Obama. Prior to Trump’s election in 2016, he told MSNBC that the country “can’t have that guy in office.” A representative for Fat Joe did not immediately return a request for comment. Fat Joe explains why he bought Donald Trump’s new sneakers. pic.twitter.com/L3kUDGUCzw People on X, formerly Twitter, criticized the Bronx rapper this week, with some accusing him of “promoting” the shoes linked to Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential ticket. “We know he a sneaker head but he didn’t have to promote them,” one X user wrote, adding that “he could have put them away in silence.” Meanwhile, an Instagram user suggested under Fat Joe’s post that the Bronx native was essentially supporting Trump’s campaign as it seeks to attract voters of color. “Don’t support his campaign!!! So you can collect a freakin sneaker???” the Instagram user wrote. “So dumb. It literally the dumb shit they think about us. And you proved it true. #disappointed.” Trump launched the golden sneakers, named “The Never Surrender High-Tops,” for $399 — a day after a judge in New York found that he lied about his wealth for years. He was ordered to pay $355 million in penalties in the civil fraud verdict. The former president publicly unveiled the shoes at Sneaker Con in Philadelphia earlier this month. Despite Trump promoting the shoes, a website selling the sneakers says in small print that they “are not designed, manufactured, distributed or sold by Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.” Trump’s shiny shoes were mocked on “Saturday Night Live” last weekend. Host Shane Gillis acted as a man who gains the ability to make people believe his shameless lies after he is gifted the Trump-branded sneakers. (Check out the full “SNL” sketch below.)

James Lankford (R-Okla.) is using a sports metaphor to describe what happened to him when his fellow Republicans, with the urging of former President Donald Trump, rejected a carefully negotiated border security and foreign aid bill in early February. “When I called the play as the quarterback that day, and my own line turned around and sacked me, that was definitely a surprise to me. Because everybody was fully aware what the play call was,” Lankford said in an appearance this week before the conservative Ripon Society in Washington, D.C. Lankford was one of three main negotiators on the bill, along with Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.). After Republicans in September rejected sending more weapons to Ukraine to defend itself against a Russian invasion, and instead demanded that any aid be tied to border security changes, the trio started writing a bill of their own. The final product would have enhanced the president’s ability to shut down the U.S. border in certain circumstances, and would have provided about $60 billion in aid to Ukraine. But many Republicans said it did not go far enough, and some openly worried it would give President Joe Biden a political win in an election year. Trump publicly urged Republicans not to agree to the proposed deal, saying it would benefit Democrats and Biden. House Leader Mike Johnson (R-La.) obliged, saying that even if the bill passed the Senate, he would not bring it up for a vote in the House. “Please, blame it on me,” Trump said in a Las Vegas appearance. Some senators said they were shocked by the bill’s provisions, including the circumstances under which a border shutdown would be allowed. “This is worse than bad negotiation. It’s betrayal,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called the bill “INSANE” in a social media post. But Lankford said Tuesday that none of the Republican senators could honestly claim surprise at the bill’s provisions, because he had briefed them on it well in advance. “I met personally with every single Republican, sat down with him, talked him through all the details, five weeks before it came out, as we’re finalizing text,” Lankford said. “We went through every section of it — the good, the bad and the ugly, both the salad and the steak.” “Everyone knew what was in that bill,” he said. “Everybody knew what was in it.” In the end, only three other Republicans besides Lankford voted to advance the compromise: Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Mitt Romney (Utah). The Senate later passed — with 70 votes — a bill to send aid to Ukraine without any border provisions, but it has not been taken up in the House yet. Ukrainian forces have since lost the strategic eastern town of Avdiivka, a loss attributed to having to ration ammunition and artillery. The next four years will change America forever.

Lankford said what happened with the border bill reflected a party base that increasingly prefers getting nothing over having to compromise to get something. “For me, the challenge that we have right now is this sense of an activist base that says ‘I want everything or I want nothing, and nothing is better than something.’ [That] does not not align with many people across the country,” he said. “Because many people across the country are saying, ‘These are hard problems.

There may be more distinguished members of this body throughout our history, but I doubt there were any with any more admiration for the Senate.” To describe McConnell as an institutionalist, however, is to give him an incredibly short shrift. No single man has done more to shape modern American politics, and the modern Senate, than McConnell. He helped create the era of big-money politics; shaped the Supreme Court’s archconservative majority; and ratcheted up Senate obstruction to new levels. All of those came together to define his relationship with former President Donald Trump, the man who would ultimately take over the GOP McConnell built. McConnell’s disdain for Trump — and for the business mogul’s isolationist and protectionist policies — has been obvious at times, but he continued to justify working with him to achieve broader conservative goals, even as Trump brought American democracy to the brink. He rarely backed up his tough talk about opposing Trump with hard actions, and is now stepping aside as Trump is poised to seize control of the GOP yet again. McConnell’s defenders have long portrayed him as holding up the grandest traditions of the upper chamber. But even his longstanding opposition to weakening the filibuster could not stand once it got in the way of an otherwise attainable bit of political power. Well before McConnell was a household name, his name was on a 2003 lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission seeking to overturn the McCain-Feingold reform law, which put restrictions on campaign financing. He had led multiple filibusters against it before its final passage. McConnell’s opposition to the campaign finance reform law flowed from his work raising money for the Republican Party in the 1990s. As momentum built towards reform following the 1996 presidential campaign, McConnell promised, “That will not happen.” But the reform bill did pass in 2002, and was reluctantly signed by President George W. Bush. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld most of the law. But dissents from the conservative justices laid the groundwork for Citizens United vs. FEC. That case and others led to the super PAC era in American politics, in which donors can give infinite sums — sometimes even anonymously — to PACs that support their chosen candidate. McConnell does not deserve sole credit here. Democrats, eager to gain fundraising advantages, also contributed: The California Democratic Party, for instance, also sued to overturn parts of McCain-Feingold. But Americans for Tax Reform head Grover Norquist credited McConnell for essentially waging a solo battle against campaign finance reform in the 1990s and 2000s. “Mitch McConnell changed the direction of the world,” the conservative political activist wrote on social media. “He stopped the destruction of the Republican Party by opposing, delaying and weakening and ultimately defeating the drive for ‘campaign finance reform’ that would have left union bosses as the sole power in America.” That battle, along with McConnell’s own prowess at raising campaign money, helped solidify his support among his GOP colleagues as he sought to lead the caucus. McConnell became the GOP’s Senate leader in 2006, but most Americans first saw his impact in 2009, when Obama entered the presidency amid lofty rhetoric about bipartisanship. McConnell ensured that rhetoric would not become reality. He made the GOP’s main strategy one of obstruction, pressuring Republican senators not to break off and support Obama administration policies — even if some would later go on to support bipartisan deals on immigration and gun control during Obama’s second term. The use of the filibuster — a procedural hurdle requiring bills to receive 60 votes instead of 50 to pass — went from a tactic to an expectation. He put it bluntly in an interview in October 2010: “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.” His obstructionist goals culminated in 2016, when he refused to meet with or consider Obama’s nomination of then-D.C. Court of Appeals Judge Merrick Garland to serve on the Supreme Court (more on this later). Once Trump became president, however, the reputation McConnell had earned as a master tactician faltered. His long-hyped, long-awaited attempt to repeal Obamacare went down with the late Sen. John McCain’s thumbs-down “no” vote in July 2017. “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!” Trump tweeted. But Trump and McConnell’s efforts to stop Democrats’ expansion of health insurance had permanently failed. Republicans successfully passed tax cuts favoring corporations and the wealthy — the GOP equivalent of low-hanging fruit — later in 2017, but that was the last of their legislative accomplishments. Arguably, McConnell’s most lasting legacy is how he reshaped the nation’s courts — and blew up Senate norms to put as many conservatives into lifetime federal judgeships as possible. He will forever be remembered for denying a Supreme Court seat to President Barack Obama. In February 2016, barely an hour after Justice Antonin Scalia had died, McConnell made the unprecedented announcement that he would block any Obama nominee to fill the vacancy, saying voters should first choose the next president in November and allow the winner to appoint the next justice. Trump won in November, and when Democrats filibustered his appointment of Neil Gorsuch, McConnell used the Senate’s rarely invoked “nuclear option” and eliminated the filibuster — an institution he had long defended — for Supreme Court nominees. Thanks entirely to that change, Republicans were able to confirm Gorsuch. Three years later, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September 2020, McConnell ignored his own precedent and raced to fill the vacancy with Amy Coney Barrett just weeks before Joe Biden was elected. McConnell delivered both of those vacancies to Trump, who reliably filled them, along with a 2018 vacancy, with conservative picks. Without McConnell, Trump would have filled just one seat, and today’s Supreme Court wouldn’t have its current 6-3 conservative supermajority — responsible for the court’s most stunning decisions in recent years, including the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Asked Wednesday to name McConnell’s greatest accomplishment, Senate Republicans said the same thing again and again: his hand in reshaping the Supreme Court. “Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Coney Barrett,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told HuffPost. “For sure.” McConnell is also how Trump was able to put more than 230 people into lifetime federal court seats, a massive number of judges to confirm in a single presidential term. McConnell made judicial confirmations his top priority as Senate majority leader, and he worked closely with Trump’s White House and the Federalist Society to keep the pipeline of district and appeals court nominees flowing. Virtually all were male, white right-wing ideologues. By the end of Trump’s term, he had filled almost every vacancy on a U.S. appeals court. Nearly one in every three U.S. appeals court judges was a Trump pick by the end of 2020. “Mitch’s tenure has had many legacies, but no legacy is more consequential than the nomination and confirmation of hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a member of the Judiciary Committee who has butted heads with McConnell, told HuffPost Wednesday. “That is a lasting benefit to the American people, for which I’m deeply grateful.” McConnell had to do business with Trump to win the courts. The relationship between the two Republican leaders was always rocky. Trump ran in the 2016 GOP primaries as a hard-right insurgent against the party elite, including McConnell. His victory forced longtime party leaders to find common ground where they could. For McConnell, that meant blunting Trump’s populist and anti-internationalist instincts while getting what he could out of him. Trump appointed McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, to be his Transportation Secretary, a conciliatory move following Trump’s election-year attacks on the Senate leader. McConnell, meanwhile, covered for Trump’s most inflammatory conduct, brushing off the continued operation of his business as it received millions from foreign governments and claiming ignorance of Trump’s bizarre tweets. After their legislative ups and downs, the relationship between the two Republicans became increasingly frosty, until it ultimately fractured with Trump’s 2020 re-election loss to Biden. When Trump lied and claimed that he had won, McConnell humored him, stating that Trump was “100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.” Then came the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. As Trump directed a mob of supporters to march on the Capitol as electoral votes were being counted, McConnell and the rest of Congress were forced to flee from the violent assault. In a speech from the floor of the Senate after the insurrectionists were cleared, a furious McConnell said that the Senate would not “bow to lawlessness or intimidation” from “thugs, mobs or threats.” The next day, McConnell reportedly told journalist Jonathan Martin that he was “exhilarated” by the fact that Trump had “finally, totally discredited himself.” “He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger,” McConnell told Martin, according to his book, “This Will Not Pass.” But Trump had not discredited himself — not in the eyes of his followers, nor in the eyes of the conservative media that relies on those followers to profit. All Trump had done was to load the metaphorical gun and leave it for McConnell to pull the trigger. McConnell refused. Trump’s second impeachment trial in the Senate, this time for incitement of insurrection, would be the first impeachment of a president who’d already left office. This bit of unprecedented procedure gave McConnell an excuse to let Trump slide. Seven Republicans joined the entire Democratic Party caucus to vote to convict Trump — 10 votes short of the total needed for conviction. McConnell was not among them. “There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day,” McConnell said afterwards. “The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.” But McConnell claimed that a post-office impeachment was unconstitutional. This proved highly consequential: Had Trump been convicted, the Senate could have banned him from seeking office in the future, preventing him from running for president again. And then Trump announced he would run again in 2024. His third presidential campaign would focus on valorizing the insurrection he inspired on Jan. 6 and getting revenge on all his enemies — real or imagined, Democrat or Republican. And yet McConnell is in talks to endorse Trump, whom he has labeled as “despicable” and “practically and morally responsible” for Jan. 6. McConnell’s relationship with Trump, in all its ups and downs, shows what lies at the heart of the soon-to-be-departing Republican leader’s career: Personal humiliations, policy losses and threats to the constitutional order were all part of the price he paid for Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

On the same day McConnell announced his forthcoming retirement as leader, the Supreme Court said it would hear arguments on April 22 on Trump’s absurd claim of “absolute immunity” from prosecution for his actions surrounding Jan. 6. The decision to take up the case for arguments could fatally delay Trump’s prosecution, helping him win re-election, whereby he could become immune from prosecution or even pardon himself.

The show takes a group of reality stars and famous folks and places them in a castle in Scotland to compete for a prize fund. The twist is that among the main cast are “traitors,” deceitful players manipulating non-traitors, or “faithfuls.” That in itself is enough to sell me on watching the show, but one cast member had me hooked week after week. This show, which airs on Peacock, was made for Phaedra Parks. For 10 episodes, Parks has masterfully played the game and reminded viewers why we love seeing her on our screens so much. The former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star has, hands down, been the best traitor Season 2 has seen. And though she doesn’t win it all this season, I make a case on this week’s episode of “I Know That’s Right” for why she should’ve come out on top. For weeks, each time a contestant made an argument for Parks — who’s also a new cast member on Bravo’s “Married to Medicine” — being a traitor, she showed them why it’s not smart to go toe-to-toe with her. That was proved when fellow traitors ― “Big Brother” winner Dan Gheesling and “Survivor” star Parvati Shallow ― at risk of banishment, turned on Parks. They were both voted out. Then it was proved again most recently when “The Bachelor” star Peter Weber, known as “King of the Faithfuls,” organized a campaign to rally the remaining house members to vote Parks out of the castle. Parks walked Weber’s accusations down like the lawyer she is — and she cut every opponent with razor-sharp one-liners and comebacks. Parks maintained her cool the entire game and managed to talk her way out of elimination until right before the finale.

In a statement shared with HuffPost on Friday, the sheriff’s office said the body of Madeline Soto was located in a wooded area about 4:30 p.m. local time and that her family has been notified. Speaking at a news conference earlier Friday, Sheriff John Mina had said authorities were “confident” Madeline was dead after they reviewed disturbing video evidence that appeared to show her mother’s boyfriend, 37-year-old Stephan Sterns, throwing items into a dumpster behind their apartment building in Kissimmee. Madeline’s mother, Jenn Soto, told police she thought Sterns was taking her daughter to school but later found out that the girl never arrived there and she reported her missing. Police had previously said Sterns had dropped Madeline off near her school, but they later learned he never dropped her off at all, Mina said. Video footage appears to show that when Sterns returned to the apartment complex, Madeline was in the car. Police say they think she was already dead at that time. According to Mina, investigators searching the dumpster found Madeline’s backpack and her school-issued laptop. Stern was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of sexual battery and possession of child sexual abuse material. According to an emergency arrest warrant shared with HuffPost, police alleged that Sterns was in possession of several images that were criminal and sexual in nature and videos that depicted an underaged girl. It’s unclear whether the girl in the videos was Madeline, but authorities said in an earlier news release that the “crimes were committed at the family home in Kissimmee.” Madeline’s mother is not considered a suspect in the investigation.

Attorneys for Trump and other co-defendants accused Willis of corruption, saying she improperly hired attorney Nathan Wade as one of three special prosecutors in the sprawling racketeering suit. Willis and Wade admitted to having a past romantic relationship in February after it was unearthed in January. “I think it’s been very much made clear by the argument made today that there are several legal issues to sort through, several factual determinations I have to make, and those aren’t ones I can make at this moment,” Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee said Friday after listening to closing arguments from both sides. “And so I will be taking the time to make sure that I give this case the full consideration it’s due.” Willis has forcefully defended herself from accusations of impropriety. John Merchant, an attorney for co-defendant Michael Roman, argued that the district attorney hired “her boyfriend” and paid him with public funds; thus when the pair had taken trips together, Merchant suggested it had been on the public’s dime. “She put her boyfriend in the spot, paid him, and then reaped the benefits of it,” Merchant said Friday. Roman is a Republican opposition researcher who worked on Trump’s failed 2020 presidential campaign. Willis maintained that she and Wade split costs evenly throughout their relationship, which she said began in the spring of 2022 — after she’d hired Wade, in November 2021. (The relationship ended last summer, Willis said.) When the relationship started has been a main source of contention, as defendants’ attorneys claim that it began in 2019, long before Willis hired Wade. “They knew it was wrong, they hid it, and even when they were called out on it they tried to create an excuse for it by saying it happened after the fact,” Merchant said. McAfee hinted at the questions he considers to be outstanding during an exchange with Fulton County Chief Deputy District Attorney Adam Abbate. “The original and the core financial allegations — there is a relationship, and money has changed hands. There is maybe still an open question of where the ledger stands, but I think it was conceded that the balance could run in the district attorney’s favor,” McAfee told Abbate. “It’s no longer just a theory that money changed hands, it’s no longer just speculation and conjecture,” the judge added. Abbate responded to say that “whether the money had any financial benefit or gain to the district attorney that is all speculation and conjecture.” “Absolutely all speculation and conjecture,” Abbate emphasized. The defendants’ attorneys argued before the judge that a former college friend of Willis vouched for the idea the Willis-Wade relationship began earlier than admitted. Ashleigh Merchant, an attorney for Roman who is married to John Merchant, alleged that a text message from Wade’s former law partner, Terrence Bradley, further proved that point. But Bradley only proved to be an ineffective witness. He evaded questions on the stand earlier this week, saying that he had just been “speculating” in the text message when he said he “absolutely” thought Willis began dating Wade before she hired him. “There’s absolutely no evidence that contradicts that the relationship did not begin around March 2022,” Abbate told the judge Friday.

As of Friday afternoon, Animal Haven in Manhattan received nearly $50,000 in memory of Dipper, who was adopted by Stewart and his family from the shelter over a decade ago, said Animal Haven Executive Director Tiffany Lacey. “In Jon’s message, he never said, ‘Donate to Animal Haven.’ And literally almost minutes after that aired, the donations started coming in,” Lacey told HuffPost of Stewart’s on-air tribute. “I think that it’s a testament to the fact that so many people have lost animals. He touched a nerve that everybody knows the feeling of.” On Monday’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Dipper was memorialized by Stewart as “the best” canine companion after he and his children met the pooch during a fundraiser for the shelter. “They put the dog in my lap, and we left that day feeling really good. We’d helped this great organization, and we also left with this 1-ish-year-old brindle pitbull,” he said while choking back tears. “We named him Dipper, and in a world of good boys, he was the best.” “My wish for you,” he told viewers, “is that one day you find that dog, that one dog. It’s just, it’s the best.” Lacey said the on-air tribute came as a “total surprise” to everyone at the shelter. “We didn’t know that Jon was going to mention us,” she said. In addition to a wave of financial donations following the “Daily Show” episode, the shelter has seen an increase in adoption inquiries and purchases from its online wish lists, she said. “At this time we are overcapacity like so many other shelters, and have well over 100,” Lacey said, tallying the dogs and cats now at Animal Haven. “The money will go directly to care for our current 60 dogs, puppies looking for a home, via vet care, training, food, medicine, treats and love.” In honor of Dipper, the shelter said that it is reducing its adoption fees by $100 for all dogs through March. The hope, the organization said in an online statement, is “that we can fulfill Jon’s wish of helping you find ‘that one dog.’” “Everything kind of surges when something like this starts to happen so I’m hoping the end result, when we look back after a couple of weeks, [is that] our adoption numbers will be up,” Lacey said.

The woman’s stepmother told officers that the victim “was being held against her will” at a motel, and detectives found her at the Evergreen Motel in Inkster, a western suburb of Detroit, according to the police announcement. According to police, officers heard the woman screaming and crying from inside a motel room before they rescued her. The unidentified woman, who is in her 30s, was taken to a hospital for a medical evaluation before being reunited with her family. Investigators who searched the motel seized drugs, cellphones and a firearm, according to the news release. A suspect was also identified in the case, but no one was taken into custody. Detectives are trying to determine if human trafficking was involved, according to the news release. “This may turn out just to be a domestic violence type of deal. This may turn out to be a big human trafficking thing. And it may turn out to be that she finally decided she wanted to go home and just called her stepmom,” Michigan State Police Lt. Mike Shaw told WDIV-TV in Detroit. Investigators are also working to determine what happened when the woman disappeared seven years ago, Shaw told WWJ-TV in Detroit. “It may take us nowhere. It may not be something that we can charge criminally, but at least we got her out of the situation,” he said.

Click here to subscribe. With royal rumors swirling this week, it seems like most internet users’ preferred form of exercise is jumping to conclusions. Folks have been playing a game of “Where’s Waldo” with Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales. On Jan. 16, the palace informed the public that Kate had undergone a “planned” abdominal surgery, as detailed by HuffPost senior reporter Carly Ledbetter. In a statement, the palace said that “based on the current medical advice,” Kate probably won’t return to public duties until after Easter. But people riding the two horsemen of the online apocalypse — X, formerly known as Twitter, and TikTok — have dismissed the official story, instead producing a deluge of memes and theories about Kate’s absence. “yeh so basically Kate Middleton hasn’t been seen in months like she’s actually missing. word on the conspiracy street is that she’s doing 1 of many things - gone for a BBL, growing out her bangs, lost at the Wonka experience. also she’s possibly banksy x” pic.twitter.com/IP20NIKgGl The Kate Middleton reveal on Masked Singer is going to make all of us look silly. BREAKING: Kate Middleton has been spotted at the Willy Wonka experience in Glasgow pic.twitter.com/R4Nf8HMCrP kate middleton’s bbl, rhinoplasty, and facelift is healing. i will not entertain any other conspiracy theory until (if) she reappears. everyone’s speculating on why kate middleton and king charles are out of the public eye i think the answer is obvious ..they got freaky fridayed The speculation comes after news that King Charles had been diagnosed with cancer on Feb. 5. In January, the king underwent surgery after seeking “treatment for an enlarged prostate” earlier that month. (Kate was also receiving her operation at that same hospital.) Although the palace has not disclosed the precise nature of Charles’ illness, they have confirmed it is not prostate cancer. Some folks online have pointed out the contrast between the British press’ dedication to preserving Kate’s privacy and their treatment of Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex — recalling the racist vitriol that myriad tabloids directed toward the duchess. I remember very well when the British press and public demanded to know every detail about Meghan’s childbirth. But when the white duchess goes into hiding for over 2 months they stay mute and claim she deserves privacy and peace. #KateMiddleton pic.twitter.com/EmYOFyIrvT I have no problem with Kate Middleton taking time to recover from whatever is going on with her. I think it’s wonderful, because every day that she enjoys privacy & respect regarding whatever ails her, is further proof that Meghan Markle was intentionally bullied & abused. It needs to be said that the British press’s respect and deference shown to Kate Middleton would have *never* been extended to Meghan in a million years. To all the people vehemently defending Kate Middleton’s privacy, do Meghan Markle next… pic.twitter.com/6jeUNT8wub In December 2021, Meghan won a legal battle against the Daily Mail, claiming that the publication “violated her privacy” by publishing a letter she sent to her father in 2018. Moreover, in December, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, was awarded $180,000 in a lawsuit against tabloid conglomerate Mirror Group Newspapers, alleging that they hacked his phone. Nonetheless, on Thursday, the palace sought to put to bed the rumors regarding Kate’s status.

Lisa Murkowski And Susan Collins Back Nikki Haley In GOP Presidential Race","igor bobic","2024-03-01","WASHINGTON ― Nikki Haley got her first Senate endorsement on Friday from Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski, a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump. “America needs someone with the right values, vigor, and judgment to serve as our next President — and in this race, there is no one better than her,” Murkowski said in a statement ahead of the Alaska GOP primary on Tuesday. “Nikki will be a strong leader and uphold the ideals of the Republican Party while serving as a President for all Americans,” the senator added. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) swiftly followed, telling the Bangor Daily News that she considered Haley to be “extremely well-qualified.” “She has the energy, intellect, and temperament that we need to lead our country in these very tumultuous times,” Collins told the outlet. Both Murkowski and Collins voted to convict Trump in his Jan. 6 impeachment trial. Collins has offered only mild criticism of the former president in recent months, and spoke out against Maine’s decision to leave him off the GOP primary ballot. Murkowski, meanwhile, has been sharply critical of the former president’s tone and conduct, saying recently that his rhetoric is “poisoning our country.” She and Collins are only Haley’s second and third congressional endorsements so far. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) is the lone House member backing her 2024 campaign. Republicans who oppose Trump are on an island in their party right now. Trump swept all four early GOP presidential nominating states and he has the backing of more than 130 Republicans in the House and over 30 Republicans in the Senate, despite facing 91 criminal charges across several jurisdictions. Haley acknowledged earlier this week it’s “very possible” the GOP has fully become the party of Trump. The next four years will change America forever.

The “Cruel Intentions” star has officially parted ways with her agents at Creative Artists Agency (CAA), as well as with her publicity team at Narrative PR, according to reports from Deadline and inside sources who confirmed the news Friday to The Hollywood Reporter. Blair has apparently also dropped Troy Nankin as her manager and parted with attorney Cheryl Snow, as suggested by changes Thursday to her official profile on IMDb Pro. Her newly listed representatives — manager Ben Gaynor and attorneys Berlandi Nussbaum and Joshua Reitzas — did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Blair, who signed with CAA in 2021, made these changes after facing severe backlash for her comment. The actor deleted and apologized for remarks under an Instagram video that slammed Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) for voting against a bill that purportedly would prevent immigration into the U.S. by people who “facilitated” the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Gaza-based Hamas militants. Tlaib said the bill was “unnecessary” and “redundant with already existing federal law.” “Deport all these terrorist supporting goons,” wrote Blair in the since-deleted comment. “Islam has destroyed Muslim countries and then they come here and destroy minds. They know they are liars. Twisted justifications. May they meet their fate.” Many social media users were outraged by the statement. Since the Oct. 7 surprise attack by Hamas, in which an estimated 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage, the Israeli military has killed more than 30,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Much of northern Gaza has been bombarded, and evacuees jammed into the southern areas face starvation as aid deliveries are blocked. The next four years will change America forever.

President Joe Biden on Friday approved humanitarian air drops into Gaza. “In my comment, I mistakenly and inadvertently conflated Muslims with Radical Islamists and fundamentalists, a terrible err in my words, and resulted in hurting countless people I never meant to, and I deeply regret this,” Blair wrote on Instagram on Feb. 13. The actor was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2018 and recently joined Biden at a ceremony for the 33rd anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heath-ledger-death-director-stephen-gaghan_n_65e21440e4b013678e152525","Director Who Was Working With Heath Ledger Reveals New Details About Actor's Death","curtis m. wong","2024-03-01","Writer-director Stephen Gaghan is sharing new details about a movie he was planning to make with Heath Ledger at the time of the “Brokeback Mountain” actor’s death. Appearing on author Malcolm Gladwell’s “Revisionist History” podcast this week, Gaghan recalled his experience developing a film adaptation of Gladwell’s 2005 book, “Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,” with Leonardo DiCaprio in mind for the starring role. While working on the “Blink” script, Gaghan was introduced to Ledger, and ultimately decided that he was better suited for the part. “I’d just had a real connection with him that was kind of unusual and really special to me,” he explained. “I had a feeling that I just love this guy, and I was going to make a bunch of movies with him.” Sadly, those plans came to a halt when Gaghan received a phone call from Ledger’s father and one of the actor’s close friends, who informed him that Ledger had been found dead in New York. “I got a phone call, they were on speakerphone, and it was Heath Ledger’s father, who I had never met,” he told Gladwell. “The dad and the guy who was closest to him in his professional life, they were there with the body. Our script was in bed with him and your book was on the bedside table.” He went on to note: “I think my number was on the script. These guys are, as you can imagine, in shock, and they dialed that number.” Ledger died Jan. 22, 2008, of an accidental overdose that involved several prescription medications. At the time of his death, the 28-year-old had recently completed filming on “The Dark Knight,” and would later posthumously receive an Academy Award for his portrayal of the Joker. Gaghan, whose Hollywood credits include 2000’s “Traffic” and 2005’s “Syriana,” said that he’d never spoken publicly about Ledger’s death prior to his chat with Gladwell. At the time of the phone call, Gaghan and his wife, Minnie Mortimer, were traveling through an airport. “I literally just collapse. It’s never happened to me before or since,” he said. “My feet went out from under me. I just literally sat down because I was like: ‘What? What?’ ... My wife was looking at me. I remember her face and I was just speechless. I just listened and listened and listened. It was just really, really sad. And it’s still sad.” Though the “Blink” adaptation fell by the wayside after Ledger’s death, Gaghan said that he reread the film’s script in advance of his podcast interview, and hinted that it might someday be worth revisiting.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/court-rules-against-sentence-booster-in-jan-6-cases_n_65e2328be4b0d2a2475954c7","Court Rules Against Provision Used To Beef Up Sentences For Jan. 6 Attackers","jonathan nicholson","2024-03-01","A Washington, D.C., court said Friday that a lower court was wrong to apply a provision boosting the punishment for a Texas man convicted in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol — a ruling that could raise questions about many other Jan. 6 defendants’ sentences. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the so-called sentencing enhancement did not apply to one of Larry Brock’s six convictions for his participation in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Brock was briefly on the Senate floor during his 38 minutes in the U.S. Capitol during the attack — which the lower court found was enough to be considered “substantial interference with the administration of justice,” making him eligible for a harsher sentence. The appeals court disagreed. “We hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes,” said Judge Patricia Millett in a written opinion. The case may be significant because that enhancement has been used by federal prosecutors in many other cases involving Jan. 6 insurrectionists. The Washington Post reported it could mean more than 100 could have to be resentenced. The court sent Brock’s case back to district court so the sentence for his felony conviction for obstructing an official proceeding could be reassessed, this time without the enhancement. His initial sentence on that charge was 24 months in prison. But the court left intact Brock’s five other convictions, with concurrent sentences of six to 12 months each and 24 months of probation. Millett wrote in her opinion that the electoral certification process that the Jan. 6 rioters sought to interrupt was not the same as a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding whose disruption would could be seen as obstructing justice, and thus Brock did not qualify for enhanced penalties. “The multi-step process of certifying electoral college votes—as important to our democratic system of government as it is—bears little resemblance to the traditional understanding of the administration of justice as the judicial or quasi-judicial investigation or determination of individual rights,” she wrote. “To the extent that law enforcement is present, it is there to protect the lawmakers and their process, not to investigate individuals’ rights or to enforce Congress’s certification decision. After all, law enforcement is present for security purposes for a broad variety of governmental proceedings that do not involve the ‘administration of justice’—presidential inaugurations, for example, and the pardoning of the Thanksgiving Turkey.” Former president Donald Trump has said the Jan. 6 convicts have been mistreated, likening them to “political prisoners,” and a cottage industry has sprung up in right-wing circles portraying the convicts as victims of political oppression. Brock is one of the highest-profile Jan. 6 insurrectionists, having been caught on camera as one of the older attackers in the Senate chamber wearing a combat-style helmet and a tactical vest. The appeals court said Brock, one of many former military personnel who participated in the attack, told other rioters to “calm down” and not to sit in the Senate president’s chair because it would be disrespectful. But the court also noted that before the attack, Brock called the 2020 election stolen and fraudulent on social media, and told a fellow veteran there needed to be a “plan of action” if Trump was not certified the 2020 winner.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-hunter-biden_n_65e2123fe4b005b858343f93","Nudes For Nothing: Marjorie Taylor Greene Doesn't Ask Hunter Biden About Alleged Sex Crimes","arthur delaney","2024-03-01","WASHINGTON ― Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) passed up her chance to ask Hunter Biden about the compromising photos she had showed during committee hearings. Greene attended an hourslong deposition with President Joe Biden’s son on Wednesday but was among many lawmakers who asked no substantive questions, according to a transcript released Thursday evening. One of Hunter Biden’s vocal antagonists on Capitol Hill, Greene has repeatedly used her time during committee hearings to display images of him apparently engaged in sex acts with prostitutes. Greene said the photos showed that the younger Biden had committed crimes — namely, violations of the Mann Act, a federal law that forbids transporting a person across state lines for illegal sexual activity. “This is showing Hunter Biden paying for a victim’s United flight,” Greene stated during a July hearing, saying that the flight went from Los Angeles to the Washington area. She held up posters with censored images of a naked Biden with unnamed women alongside images of documents that she said indicated he had paid them for sex. “I believe this is a violation of the Mann Act. This is Hunter Biden’s, this is his proof that he bought the ticket. He bought it for this woman right here,” Greene said. The accusation has nothing to do with the corruption allegations that Republicans have chased in their impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden. But Greene claimed that she’s trying to expose the double standards of a Justice Department that had not prosecuted an obvious crime and had failed to “vindicate the rights of these women.” When the House oversight committee in January voted to recommend holding Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress for refusing to sit for a deposition, Greene displayed the pictures again. “This is important evidence of human trafficking, Mann Act violations that we had questions for the president’s son about,” Greene said. The images came from Hunter Biden’s hard drive when he was in the depths of an addiction to crack cocaine while earning millions of dollars from a Ukrainian energy company and other foreign sources. Republicans have claimed that a Ukrainian oligarch used the younger Biden to influence his father, though their main bribery allegation collapsed last month when the Justice Department said that an FBI informant had made it up. In his memoir, Hunter Biden acknowledged that he had perused ads for escort services, though he claimed that he was only looking for drugs. During Wednesday’s deposition, it was Biden who first asked a question of Greene, challenging her to say whether she trusted certain FBI agents and informants involved in his case. The transcript suggests there was some cross-talk before Biden and Greene had a sarcastic exchange that went nowhere. “Are you a businessman, or are you involved in government, Mr. Biden?” Greene asked. “Here’s what I am,” Biden said. “I’m both an attorney, a businessman, and a concerned citizen, Ms. Greene. That’s what I am.” “Just an average citizen,” Greene said. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the House Judiciary Committee chair, then cut them off and directed a staff attorney to ask a question. Greene later chimed in during a round of questions from Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), prompting Biden to say, “Come forward, Ms Greene.” Gaetz then resumed his questioning. Other Republicans asked Biden about his past drug addiction, but nobody brought up his use of escort services. Biden conceded that he’s “made mistakes” but said that they had nothing to do with his father. He said he’s been sober since 2019. Investigatory material obtained and released by Republicans shows that the Justice Department did consider prosecuting Biden for Mann Act violations. He has since been charged with failing to pay his taxes on time and illegally owning a firearm. It’s possible he will face more charges. Hunter Biden has said that he believes Joe Biden’s enemies are trying to humiliate him into a relapse to destroy his father’s presidency. The next four years will change America forever.

CVS and Walgreens both confirmed Friday that they’ve completed the Food and Drug Administration’s certification process to start filling prescriptions for the pills, which can be used to terminate some pregnancies in the first trimester and account for more than half of abortions in the U.S. Walgreens “expects to begin dispensing within a week, consistent with federal and state laws,” said the pharmacy, which operates more than 8,000 locations across the country. Its rollout will begin in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California, and Illinois ― all states that have protected access to abortion in the wake of Roe v. Wade falling in 2022. CVS said it’s starting with a smaller rollout on a slightly later timeline. “We’ll begin filling prescriptions for the medication in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the weeks ahead and will expand to additional states, where allowed by law, on a rolling basis,” said the company, which operates more than 9,000 pharmacies nationwide. The New York Times was the first to report the news. Neither pharmacy will offer mifepristone by mail. That practice has been a source of debate in recent years, though a recent study found that using telehealth to obtain abortion pills through the mail is as safe and effective as seeing a doctor in person for the same purpose. President Joe Biden praised CVS and Walgreens for their announcements Friday and encouraged more pharmacies to seek the certification. “Today is an important milestone in ensuring access to mifepristone, a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for more than 20 years,” he said in a statement. “With major retail pharmacy chains newly certified to dispense medication abortion, many women will soon have the option to pick up their prescription at a local, certified pharmacy—just as they would for any other medication. I encourage all pharmacies that want to pursue this option to seek certification.” More than a dozen states have successfully outlawed abortion following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in 2022 removing federal protections for the procedure. Several other states are enforcing bans on abortion after just a few weeks into pregnancy, leaving the procedure accessible in about just of half of the states. Mifepristone is one half of the two-drug combination usually used in medication abortions, along with misoprostol. But mifepristone has been targeted more intensely for restriction, and even in states where mifepristone remains legal, political maneuvering has stymied access.

After Walgreens announced last year that it would seek certification to sell it in pharmacies, a group of 20 attorneys general from conservative states threatened legal action against the pharmacy if they proceeded with distribution in their states. That included four states where mifepristone is legal: Alaska, Iowa, Kansas and Montana. Walgreens acquiesced to the threat, with a spokesperson calling the matter “a very complex and in flux area of the law.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) chastised Walgreens for bowing to the pressure and canceled a a $54 million contract with the company.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arizona-republicans-legalize-murder_n_65e22084e4b0d2a247594783","Arizona Republicans Push Law That Critics Say Legalizes Murder","roque planas","2024-03-01","Arizona Republicans are rallying behind a proposed law that critics say would amount to legalizing murder. House Bill 2843 would expand the “Castle Doctrine,” which gives people the right to use deadly force when threatened by home intruders, to include trespassers. State Rep. Justin Heap (R) filed the bill to give people living in the border state wider latitude to use force against unauthorized migrants who cut through private property on their way into the United States. “It’s horrifying that Republicans want to allow people to legally shoot and kill migrants,” state Rep. Analise Ortiz (D) told HuffPost. “Especially when so many folks are seeking their legal right to seek asylum in the United States. It’s just wrong.” The bill stems from a decadeslong trend in conservative state legislatures to expand the right of individuals to protect themselves with firearms. Such “stand your ground” laws typically remove the obligation for people to retreat to safety when they feel threatened, and extend immunity to prosecution for those who commit a homicide in cases where they believe they face an attack. Heap said at a Judiciary Committee hearing last month that he filed the bill over concerns brought by local prosecutors who were “having issues in the case where you have farmers and ranchers who want to trespass someone from their property,” by which he meant “remove someone from their property.” He noted concerns about migrants and human traffickers specifically. But Heap’s proposal is more unique than that description suggests, according to Lindsay Nichols, policy director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Castle Doctrine laws, including Arizona’s, have not historically applied to areas outside a person’s home. “It’s a particularly alarming instance of this trend,” Nichols said. “The prospect of a world in which you can be executed without due process for accidentally stepping onto someone’s property is terrifying.” Dustin Williamson, the regional legal director at Everytown for Gun Safety, said Arizona’s expansive gun laws would make the proposal even more dangerous. “Arizona already has a dangerous Shoot First law on the books that allows people to shoot and kill others even if they know they can easily and safely walk away from a confrontation,” Williamson wrote in an email. “To prevent senseless acts of gun violence, lawmakers in the state should reject any attempt to broaden its self-defense laws to further encourage armed vigilantism.” The Arizona House of Representatives passed the bill last week on partisan lines and it has favorable odds in the Senate. Republicans control both houses of the Arizona legislature with slim majorities. The bill is unlikely to become law. Observers expect the state’s Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, to veto the bill if both bodies pass it. Hobbs’ office did not respond to a request for comment. Still, opponents say the proposal harnesses hostility over the hot-button issue of immigration to legalize activity that today constitutes murder. The real-life example of rancher George Alan Kelly is playing out in state court as Heap’s bill moves through the legislature. Heap did not cite the case specifically when explaining his proposal, but Kelly has made headlines for allegedly shooting into a group of unauthorized migrants traveling across his ranch. Prosecutors portray Kelly’s case as far from one of self-defense, however. Kelly, 75, has contended that a man within a group of migrants traveling along his property wielded a semi-automatic rifle. But the criminal complaint against Kelly says that no one within the group possessed a weapon and that Kelly fired without warning from a hidden position. Kelly changed his story about why he opened fire several times. He told sheriff’s deputies that he did not know how Gabriel Cuen Butimea, 48, died and had backed away from the body when he found it, according to court records. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

But the rich economies cumulatively responsible for much of the carbon in the atmosphere saw their average emissions drop down to 1973 levels, driven largely by a transition away from fossil fuel power plants. For the first time in history, zero-carbon sources of energy generated half the total electricity in the world’s advanced economies, according to new data from the Paris-based energy watchdog. Renewables like wind and solar accounted for an “unprecedented” 34% share of power generation. Nuclear power, which a separate IEA report last month forecast would hit record global production next year, made up the rest. Nearly two-thirds of the decline came from the electricity sector. Emissions fell even as the overall gross domestic product of the world’s advanced economies grew by nearly 2%, making 2023’s drop in greenhouse gas the largest percentage decrease outside of an economic recession. Despite a resurgence in countries like Germany that shut down their nuclear power stations, meanwhile, coal’s share of the electricity mix across the rich world plummeted to what the IEA called “an historic low” of 17%. Outside of the Great Depression, demand for coal fell to its lowest level since 1900. The new IEA data came out a day after the Biden administration announced plans to loosen forthcoming rules on planet-heating pollution from power plants, providing a carve-out for existing natural gas-burning facilities, which now generate the bulk of U.S. electricity. The Environmental Protection Agency promised to pursue a “stronger, more durable approach” with a different regulation. Electricity demand in the U.S. is growing for the first time since the 1990s, as the grid takes on powering not just electric cars and appliances, but data centers as well. The landmark climate laws President Joe Biden passed in 2022 are funneling billions toward renewables, new transmission lines, and battery factories. The first climate legislation likely to pass Congress this year, meanwhile, is a bill to make permitting and building new types of nuclear reactors easier.

Michael Meyden, 57, is facing three counts of causing another to ingest a controlled substance, application of a Schedule 4 controlled substance to another, and delivery of a controlled substance to a minor after detectives determined he allegedly exposed his daughter’s friends to a prescription drug, police said. Staff at a local hospital had notified police on Aug. 26, 2023, of three 12-year-old girls whose bloodstreams contained the drug. Meyden pleaded not guilty to all charges at his arraignment on Wednesday, according to The Oregonian. Police alleged that Meyden had laced mango smoothies with benzodiazepines, depressants that slow the nervous system, and served them to the three girls at his daughter’s sleepover, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by HuffPost. Detectives noted that when they interviewed the girls on the morning after the sleepover, one of them “walked slowly and used the assistance of her mother for balance, her eyelids were heavy, and she spoke slowly.” The girls told police that Meyden had been “very involved with their activities during the sleepover, ” that night and made them smoothies that had “tiny white chunks throughout and sprinkled on top,” the affidavit said. “Mr. Meyden was adamant that the girls drink out of their own cups,” detectives said. One of the girls told police she didn’t like the smoothie, but Meyden allegedly insisted she drink it and made her a second one to try. Police also alleged that after the girls went to bed in the home’s basement, Meyden visited them throughout the night to check if they were awake by waving his hands or putting his finger under their noses. One girl recounted that Meyden moved her body, but she “remained awake in fear that Mr. Meyden was going to do something. When Meyden left the room, one girl sent a text to her mom for help at around 1:43 a.m. “Mom please pick me up and say I had a family emergency. I don’t feel safe. I might not respond but please come get me (crying emoji), Please. Please pick up. Please. PLEASE!!” the message read. One girl called and texted several friends requesting a ride, police said in the affidavit. And one girl texted a family friend that “she felt unsafe because of her friend’s dad.” She wrote that she was “scared” and that the father “kept moving us away from each other but kept doing tests to make sure we weren’t awake.” She added that one friend woke up “for like 2 seconds,” but “kept her eyes closed and didn’t talk.” The family friend agreed to pick the girl up. It was not clear from the affidavit whether all the requests for help were sent by the same girl, or if multiple girls were texting for help. Meyden allegedly returned to the basement to check if the girls were asleep several times. The family friend who had received the message came to pick her up in the middle of the night. When the family friend arrived, she was greeted by Meyden, who she later told police “seemed drunk” after noticing his speech was slurred, according to the affidavit. The family friend told Meyden the girl had a family emergency and he allowed her to leave. The family friend drove the girl home, where she woke up the child’s parents so they could contact the other parents and tell them to pick the girls up. When the other parents arrived at Meyden’s home, they were met with resistance from the host when told they were taking the girls home, according to the document. Meyden allegedly said the girls were asleep and “insisted” the parents come back later. In an email to HuffPost on Friday, defense attorney Mark Cogan emphasized that Meyden is “presumed innocent,” adding, “We have not seen the evidence.” According to Cogan, the grand jury that indicted Meyden “convened in secret without a judge or defense counsel present.” “We ask everyone to withhold judgment until all the facts are known,” Cogan stated in the email.

The moment I can sense spring on the horizon, my mood gets better and my shopping cart fills up with warm-weather outfits. This year is no exception, and my hyperfixation clothing item is one that has seemed to captivate the internet, as well: The Snug Crop Tank from Old Navy. I’ve seen this top all over my TikTok For You Page ― and I totally understand the hype now that I have two of my own. And lucky for you, they’re on sale right now at a shockingly affordable price. This tank features a high, crewcut neckline and ribbed fabric. It’s form-fitting without being suffocating. If you hate crop tops, don’t let the name fool you: This isn’t a midriff bearing shirt. It skims the top of your waistband for an effortless look, but its stretchy fabric also allows you to tuck it in if you want to appear more polished. It works perfectly as a layering piece, but it’s high-quality enough to wear alone. Talk about versatility. Best of all, like most of Old Navy’s clothing items, it comes in a range of sizes and lengths. This tank starts at an XS and goes up to a XXL; it also comes in petite and tall. I’m 6 feet tall and take a size large normally, and a large tall worked perfectly for me. I’m a neutral girl, so I own it in black and white, but they also come in a bunch of other colors like olive, peach, red and more.

The “Pose” star and his sister, Mary Martha Ford, shared their loss Thursday on Instagram with a tribute. While the post included a carousel of happy family photos, it acknowledged just how devastated the siblings are at losing their mom at 79. “With heavy hearts we announce the passing of our loving mother, Cloerinda Jean Johnson Porter-Ford,” it read. “We were right behind her when she took her last breath, wrapped in our arms. Mommy lived life to the fullest despite physical limitations pressed upon her.” “She was the personification of true Christianity and her unconditional love is a template that the world could benefit from employing,” the post, which both siblings shared on their individual Instagram pages, continued. “Her example is what we continue to strive for.” Porter shared in his memoir “Unprotected” (2021) that his mother “was born with a degenerative neurological condition” that “no doctor or specialist has been able to name.” She initially relied on a walker but was relegated to a wheelchair in her later years. “We are heartbroken she is no longer here with us, but find solace that her suffering has ended,” he wrote Thursday. “Her fight was long and hard—she did it with grace and integrity. Mommy will remain forever in our hearts as she continues to guide us from above.” Porter was very close to his mother but had a difficult childhood. He told The Hollywood Reporter in 2021 that he was sexually abused by his stepfather as a child and came out as gay at 16 “in the middle of the AIDS crisis” — which wasn’t easy for him or his religious mom.

The president announced the move after at least 115 Palestinians were killed and more than 750 others were injured, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, on Thursday when witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire as huge crowds raced to pull goods off an aid convoy. Biden said the airdrops would begin soon and that the United States was looking into additional ways to facilitate getting badly needed aid into the war-battered territory to ease the suffering of Palestinians. “In the coming days we’re going to join with our friends in Jordan and others who are providing airdrops of additional food and supplies” and will “seek to open up other avenues in, including possibly a marine corridor,” Biden said. I condemn Thursday’s incident in Gaza in which more than 100 people were reportedly killed or injured while seeking life-saving aid.The desperate civilians in Gaza need urgent help, including those in the north where the @UN has not been able to deliver aid in more than a week. Access to food is a human right.As the hostilities in Gaza continue to escalate - access to food is scarce with reports of children starving to death.Humanitarian organizations must have unhindered access to people in need wherever they are. pic.twitter.com/2ZPdaqHRrg The president twice referred to airdrops to help Ukraine, but White House officials clarified that he was referring to Gaza. Israel said many of the dead were trampled in a stampede linked to the chaos and that its troops fired at some in the crowd who they believed moved toward them in a threatening way. The Israeli government has said it is investigating the matter. The head of a Gaza City hospital that treated some of those wounded said Friday that more than 80% had been struck by gunfire. Biden made his announcement while hosting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White house. “Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough,” Biden said. “Now, it’s nowhere nearly enough. Innocent lives are on the line and children’s lives are on the line. We won’t stand by until we get more aid in there. We should be getting hundreds of trucks in, not just several.” The White House, State Department and Pentagon had been weighing the merits of U.S. military airdrops of assistance for several months, but had held off due to concerns that the method is inefficient, has no way of ensuring the aid gets to civilians in need and cannot make up for overland aid deliveries. I spoke with Amir Al-Thani of Qatar and President Al-Sisi of Egypt regarding the conflict in Gaza and our effort to secure the release of hostages.We also discussed today's loss of civilian life, and the importance of expanding the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza in… pic.twitter.com/zmnOZwqzHt Administration officials said their preference was to further increase overland aid deliveries through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom border points and to try to get Israel to open the Erez Crossing into northern Gaza. The incident on Thursday appeared to tip the balance and push Biden to approve airdrops. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said that airdrops are difficult operations, but the acute need for aid in Gaza informed the president’s decision. He stressed that ground routes will be continued to be used to get aid into Gaza, and that the airdrops are a supplemental effort. “It’s not the kind of thing you want to do in a heartbeat. you want to think it through carefully,” Kirby said. He added, “There’s few military operations that are more complicated than humanitarian assistance airdrops” Pressure has been mounting for Biden to move more aggressively to ease Palestinian suffering, including from lawmakers of Biden’s Democratic Party. Even before Thursday’s deaths, Sen. Jack Reed, chairman of the Senate’s Armed Services Committee, wrote Biden this week to urge that the administration deploy a military hospital ship and support units to help treat Gaza’s wounded and open a sea route to Gaza for delivery of humanitarian aid. “Yesterday’s event, I think, underscores the need to find more creative ways of getting assistance in faster and at greater scale,” Kirby said. Egypt, France, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have already used airdrops to get aid into Gaza since the conflict started in October. Biden in his visit with Meloni at the White House also sought to assure European leaders that the U.S. remains behind Ukraine even as he’s been unable to win passage of a supplemental foreign aid package that includes $60 billion for Ukraine in addition to $35 billion for Israel and Taiwan. The legislation has passed the Senate, but Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to put it up for a vote in the House. Ahead of Meloni’s visit, White House officials said they don’t have good answers for allies about finding an end to the impasse with House Republicans and reopening the American spigot of aid to Kyiv that’s badly needed as Ukraine tries to fend off Russia’s invasion. Biden, along with top Democrats and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, strongly urged Johnson during a White House meeting this week to take up the foreign aid package, but Johnson responded by saying that Congress “must take care of America’s needs first.” The leaders also discussed efforts by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar to broker an extended cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, Italy’s priorities for a G7 presidency, migrant flows into Italy from North Africa, and their countries’ China policies. Biden said earlier this week that a cease-fire deal could be reached by Monday, before tempering his optimism after Thursday’s incident. But on Friday, Biden said he still held hope that a deal can be struck, possibly before Muslims around the globe begin observing the holy month of Ramadan that is expected to begin on March 10. “I’m still hoping so,” Biden told reporters on Friday evening before departing the White House for the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland. “We’re still working real hard at it. We’re not there yet.” Meloni said solving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza was Italy’s top priority. “We need to coordinate our actions to avoid an escalation, and this regard we fully support the U.S. mediation efforts,” she said. ___ Associated Press writers Colleen Barry in Milan, Seung Min Kim, Ellen Knickmeyer and Will Weissert contributed reporting.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-supreme-court-jan-6-trial_n_65e1ef59e4b013678e150311","‘Bush v. Gore 2.0’: Fears Grow Supreme Court Will Bail Donald Trump Out","igor bobic","2024-03-01","WASHINGTON ― The Supreme Court’s decision this week to hear arguments over Donald Trump’s claims for immunity from prosecution is fanning fears that the former president won’t go to trial before the November presidential election and could escape accountability for his efforts to overturn his loss in the last one. The 6-3 conservative high court could have simply declined Trump’s request for a hearing, letting stand a prior unanimous D.C. appeals court decision that flatly rejected his argument that everything he did related to Jan. 6, 2021 he did as an “official act” as president. Instead, the justices agreed to take up the case and set oral arguments for April 22 ― a two-month delay that will prevent Trump’s trial from starting in May, as had been previously scheduled. How long the court takes to reach a verdict after that hearing and whether it decides it needs to hear more information from the appeals court could delay the start of Trump’s trial even further. The delays in the case are starting to add up, unnerving Trump critics who fear that if his federal prosecutions stretch past November’s election and he manages to win another White House term, he could order the Department of Justice to put them on hold or simply dismiss them. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) called the case “a ginormous self-test” for the Supreme Court, invoking its controversial Bush v. Gore decision that ensured George W. Bush’s victory in the 2000 presidential election over then-Vice President Al Gore. “If they quickly rule 9-0 that there is not the kind of presidential immunity that Trump asserts, then it will be all to the good,” Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told HuffPost. “If not, then it stands to be Bush v Gore 2.0 with them inserting themselves into a presidential race.” “Delaying the January 6 trial suppresses critical evidence that Americans deserve to hear,” former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) wrote Friday on X, formerly Twitter. “Donald Trump attempted to overturn an election and seize power. Our justice system must be able to bring him to trial before the next election. SCOTUS should decide this case promptly.” “The hope of a trial in the Jan 6 case before the election is fading fast. Very fast,” former U.S. attorney and CNN commentator Preet Bharara added. Of course, the Supreme Court may move more quickly than expected. A ruling affirming the appeals court decision in May, for example, would allow jury selection for Trump’s trial in D.C. to begin sometime in the fall. It’s not clear, however, that a trial would conclude before the Nov. 5 presidential election or even January 2025, when the winner of the 2024 presidential election is due to be sworn in. The justices also have yet to rule in a separate case seeking to take Trump off the ballot in the state of Colorado due to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The oral arguments over that question, which the court is very likely to reject, took place nearly a month ago. “By not expediting this case, the MAGA Supreme Court once again proves they’re not there to defend the law—they’re there to protect Trump,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote Friday of the Jan. 6 election subversion case. “The Court has sped up trials when it wants—but not in this case,” he added. Trump appointed three justices to the court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Comey Barrett. Two other justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, are also reliable conservative votes who have ruled in his favor in past cases. Thomas has rejected calls to recuse himself in the Jan. 6 case — even though his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, was involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Republicans are counting on the court to side with Trump and make the whole thing go away. “This is an abuse of power and a persecution of President Trump, and I very much hope the Supreme Court puts a stop to it,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said during a NewsNation interview this week. Trump is charged with conspiring to defraud the United States; obstructing an official proceeding; conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiring to deprive millions of Americans the right to have their votes counted. If convicted, he could face decades in prison. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith on Thursday proposed a July 8 trial start date in a separate federal criminal case over former President Trump’s handling of classified documents. But the former president’s attorneys argued that “a fair trial cannot be held until after the 2024 Presidential election is concluded.” However, the DOJ said Friday that Trump’s criminal trials could take place near the election and that they would not be in violation of a rule that prevents the department from engaging in activities that could influence an election 60 days before it takes place. The government told U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge who is presiding over his classified documents case in Florida, that the rule doesn’t apply to cases that have already been brought.

(Watch the video below.) The high court decided to rule on Trump’s assertion that, as president, he was exempt from prosecution for his actions around the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. The court set arguments for late April, delaying the federal trial until at least summer. “Some people are blaming the Supreme Court for dragging it out on purpose to help Trump,” the “Tonight Show” host said. Then, Fallon imagined how the justices would respond. The speed of the reactions suspiciously corresponded to whether the judge was considered liberal or conservative. According to Fallon, Obama-nominated Justice Elena Kagan said, “We should be acting faster to move this along.” On the other end, Trump-nominated Neil Gorsuch said, “We... are ... going ... as ... fast .. as ... we c .... a.... n.” Check out the rest of the bit at 2:05: We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The February immersive event, “Willy’s Chocolate Experience,” took place in Glasgow, Scotland. It was supposedly inspired by Roald Dahl’s 1964 novel “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” which features the oddball chocolatier Willy Wonka. The event promised “captivating” live performances, “extraordinary props, oversized lollipops, and a paradise of sweet treats and interactive experiences,” according to the event’s website. Last weekend’s attendees got anything but that. Instead of the 45-minutes-to-an-hour experience promised on the website, Stuart Sinclair, a father who brought his children to the event, said it “took two minutes to get through to then see a queue of people surrounding the guy running it complaining,” according to his Facebook post. Instead of “a paradise of sweet treats and interactive experiences,” families and children said they got a mostly empty warehouse with scattered decorations and the scarce offerings of a quarter-cup of lemonade. Some attendees were so unhappy that they called the police. The Willy Wonka actors themselves have since said they got “AI-generated gibberish” scripts, and that they feel “really embarrassed” by the jobs they were hired for. Since the event, a Facebook group called “House of Illuminati Scam” has been created for disappointed participants seeking a refund. In a since-deleted social media statement, the event company House of Illuminati, which organized the Chocolate Experience, said it would “be giving full refunds to each and every person that purchased tickets.” Hopefully, you will never have to pay £35, or about $44, for your child to reportedly get three jelly beans from a disenchanted Oompa Loompa actor. But at some point in your life, you very well might buy tickets for an event that ends up being wildly different from what it advertised. Here are the warning signs that the event you bought tickets for might not be what it claims ― and what you need to prove so you can fight for a refund. On the Willy’s Chocolate Experience website, there are missing apostrophes and garbled terms like “cartchy tuns” and “catgacating.” Most organizations take the time to proofread what they advertise. “Scammers often have poorly designed websites, numerous spelling errors, or a lack of social media presence, which seemed to be a red flag for the Wonka experience,” said Mike Lemberger, Visa’s regional risk officer for North America. Bad actors take advantage of your enthusiasm for the popular movie or artist you want to see, so that you don’t look more closely at the details. The House of Illuminati event acknowledged on its website that its event was “in no way related to the Wonka franchise,” which in hindsight feels like a bad sign. If the event is not an authorized retailer for merchandise or is not officially associated with the franchise, that should set off alarm bells, said Melanie McGovern, director of public relations and social media for Better Business Bureau, a nonprofit that tracks bad advertisements and customer complaints in North America. “You don’t know what to expect if it’s not affiliated with the company that licenses and owns that image,” McGovern said. “You might not be getting what you think you’re getting. So that is definitely a red flag, and it’s very important for people to scroll to the bottom of a lot of websites to see all the information to make sure that it is what it says.” Lemberger said few or zero reviews can be a sign that the event is a scam. If you still want to buy tickets from a business that has little social media presence and is a first-time organizer of the event, call the organizer and the promotional company about your concerns, McGovern suggested. “Reputable companies will always answer your questions,” McGovern said. “They’ll work hard to earn your trust.” Try to find out if there have been any other complaints about events that the company has run. “If you see the same complaint over and over again, that could give you a pause to maybe say ‘I might not want to do this,’ or ‘I’m going to do it anyway,’” McGovern said. And double-check the name of the event and the organizers behind it. McGovern cited the example of how consumers complained to Better Business Bureau in 2021 about buying tickets for “Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience” ― an event that used virtual reality headsets ― thinking it was “Immersive Van Gogh,” a large-scale projected installation. When you buy a ticket for an event, you want to know what will happen if the venue suddenly changes, if weather conditions shift, or if a performer drops out. The terms and conditions on the event’s website will typically outline that information. “If the event details are vague, or if the organizer cannot provide specific information about the venue, performers, or event schedule, it might be a scam,” Lemberger said. It’s frustrating to have an underwhelming time at an event you paid significant money for. But there’s a difference between a disappointing experience and a potentially misleading one that can get you a refund. For Lemberger, the difference is that a disappointing experience still delivered its product or service as promised by the organizer. “On the other hand, a scam is something that is intentionally misleading in an effort to make money,” he said. If you believe you’re dealing with the latter category, here are actions you can take: “You should always reach out to the company where you made the purchase,” Lemberger said. “They may have policies in place to handle such situations and can handle it for you directly.” If the company refuses to provide a refund, you can dispute the charge with your bank. Save any receipts as proof of purchase and attendance, and take screenshots of what you believe the organizer sold as false advertisement to help your claim. “Customers will need to provide documentation they have around the situation, including all receipts, emails, photos and screenshots related to the purchase,” Lemberger said. “When you dispute something with your bank, your bank [will] work with the merchant’s bank to investigate the situation and side with the appropriate party.” But if you bought the tickets with cash or a debit card, you might be out of luck. Unless the event’s refund policy states otherwise, you probably will not be able to get your money back with cash or a debit card, McGovern said. If you’re in the U.S. or Canada, you can use Better Business Bureau to help you escalate your complaint and present it to the company on your behalf. “Then the company would come back with, ‘OK, we’ll refund your money,’ or ‘According to our terms and conditions, there are no refunds,’ and then we would go back to the consumer,” McGovern said. You can also file a consumer complaint to your local attorney general’s office. Ultimately, it takes extra homework and research to avoid getting fooled. Lemberger noted that in the case of the Willy Wonka-themed event, the illustrations that appear AI-generated created a false impression of what the event would be like.

The talk show co-host revealed during a segment of “The View” on Thursday that she has purposefully shared false stories in the past to see who was gossiping. Following a discussion about gossip, co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin had mentioned the method of planting false information to expose a gossiper when Goldberg chimed in that she was all too familiar with that approach. “We have done that, we have done that,” she said while looking at fellow veteran co-host Joy Behar. “We did that to see who was talking.” Behar, who initially looked confused by Goldberg’s remarks, appeared to recall the situation moments later. “Oh,” she said, seemingly trying to keep a straight face. Goldberg and Behar didn’t divulge further, and it’s unclear whether the EGOT winner was talking about a former on-set member, ex co-host or someone who currently works on the show. Behar said she was “sworn to secrecy” when Farah Griffin and another co-host, Sunny Hostin, pressed the two to spill more details. (See a clip of the entire discussion below.) Some of “The View” co-hosts have played coy about spilling the tea in another recent episode. Last month, Hostin and Behar were apparently passing notes to each other while taping the talk show. Goldberg was discussing a story about a wedding when she abruptly paused and glanced at her colleagues. “You guys are passing notes on television?” Farah Griffin asked. Goldberg then suggested that the two share their notes “with the rest of the class,” but they refused. Hostin admitted that her conversations with Behar are often “inappropriate.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The outspoken Oscar winner recently appeared in “The Greatest Love Story Never Told,” a documentary about Lopez making her latest album, “This Is Me…Now,” and its accompanying music film. Fonda shared “concern” about Lopez’s rekindled relationship with Ben Affleck. The newlyweds famously dated previously in the early 2000s, but endured so much tabloid fodder and attention that “Bennifer” broke off their engagement in 2004. Fonda, who starred opposite Lopez in “Monster-in-Law” (2005), is now worried about a potential repeat. “First of all, I want you to know that — I don’t entirely know why — but I feel invested in you and Ben, and I really, really, really want this to work,” she tells Lopez over the phone in a scene from the documentary, which premiered Tuesday on Prime Video. “However, this is my concern,” Fonda says. “Like, it feels too much like you’re trying to prove something instead of just living it. You know, every other photograph is the two of you kissing, the two of you hugging.” While Lopez argues they’re just “living our life,” the film does probe their contrasting views on the spotlight. It reveals Affleck gifted her a book for Christmas in 2021 of every letter and email they ever exchanged, only for Lopez to reportedly share them with others. Affleck had titled the book, “The Greatest Love Story Never Told,” inspiring the name of the film. “I had a very firm sense of boundaries initially around the press, while Jen I don’t think objected to it in the way I did,” he says in the film. “I very much did object to it. Getting back together, I said, ‘Listen, one of the things I don’t want is a relationship on social media.’” “Then I sort of realized it’s not a fair thing to ask,” Affleck continues. “It’s sort of like, you’re gonna marry a boat captain and you go, ‘Well, I don’t like the water.’ We’re just two people with different kinds of approaches trying to learn to compromise.” Lopez, who recently clarified what caused their first relationship to falter, rekindled their romance in April 2021. The couple got engaged one year later and eloped in July 2022, but held a more traditional wedding in Georgia at the end of that summer. Lopez explained in a new Apple Music interview with Zane Lowe that “it didn’t feel like we were going to make it” the first time around — and they simply weren’t “mature” enough at the time.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cdc-drops-5-day-isolation-time-for-covid-19_n_65e21988e4b0d2a24759403f","CDC Officially Drops 5-Day Isolation Time For COVID-19","mike stobbe","2024-03-01","NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who test positive for COVID-19 no longer need to stay in isolation for five days, U.S. health officials announced Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its longstanding guidance, saying that people can return to work or regular activities if their symptoms are mild and improving and it’s been a day since they’ve had a fever. The change comes at a time when COVID-19 is no longer the public health menace it once was. It dropped from being the nation’s third leading cause of death early in the pandemic to 10th last year. Most people have some degree of immunity to the coronavirus from past vaccinations or from infections. And many people are not following the five-day isolation guidance anyway, some experts say. “Our goal here is to continue to protect those at risk for severe illness while also reassuring folks that these recommendation are simple, clear, easy to understand, and can be followed,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the CDC’s director. However, some experts worry that the change may increase the risk of infection for those people who are more vulnerable to developing severe illness. WHY ARE THE GUIDELINES CHANGING? COVID-19 is not causing as many hospitalizations and deaths as it did in the first years of the pandemic. The change is an effort to streamline recommendations so they are similar to longstanding recommendations for flu and other respiratory viruses. Many people with a runny nose, cough or other symptoms aren’t testing to distinguish whether it’s COVID-19, flu, or something else, officials say. This may not be as stringent, but also emphasizes that all people with respiratory symptoms should stay home while they are sick, said Dr. David Margolius, the head of Cleveland’s health department. There’s been no recent change in the science of how long people with COVID-19 are likely contagious, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. “What has changed is how much COVID is harming us as a population,” Nuzzo said. WHAT ARE THE NEW GUIDELINES? If you have symptoms, stay home until your symptoms are mild and improving and it’s been a day since you’ve had a fever. But then you can remain cautious by wearing a mask and keeping a distance from others. There is no change to guidelines for nursing homes and health care facilities, however. The agency is emphasizing that people should still try to prevent infections in the first place, by getting vaccinated, washing their hands, and taking steps to bring in more outdoor fresh air. CDC recommends adults ages 65 years and over receive an additional updated 2023-2024 #COVID19 vaccine dose, which can provide additional protection to older adults, who are at highest risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Read the full release here: https://t.co/9x0OvqbHhl pic.twitter.com/9fki2Y606Z IS THERE OPPOSITION TO THIS CHANGE? Yes, and even some who understand the rationale for the change have concerns. “My biggest worry in all of this is that employers will take this change in guidance to require employees to come back to work ... before they are ready to, before they feel well enough, and before they are not likely to pose harm to their co-workers,” Nuzzo said. IS THIS THE FIRST CHANGE FOR COVID-19 ISOLATION GUIDELINES? No. The CDC originally advised 10 days of isolation, but in late 2021 cut it to five days for Americans who catch the coronavirus and have no symptoms or only brief illnesses. Under that guidance, isolation only ends if a person has been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications and if other symptoms are resolving. At the time, agency officials said the changes were in keeping with evidence that people with the coronavirus were most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alexander-smirnov-biden-impeachment_n_65e1f193e4b005b858341e98","Republicans Say FBI ‘Motivated By Politics’ In Case Of Lying Informant","arthur delaney","2024-03-01","WASHINGTON ― Republicans in Congress want answers from the FBI after basing their impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden largely on faulty information from an FBI informant. In a letter to FBI director Christopher Wray on Friday, Republicans asked for documents showing how they vetted the informant and how much they paid him ― and suggested the Justice Department arrested him to protect the Biden family. Federal prosecutors revealed the informant to be a dual U.S.-Irsaeli citizen named Alexander Smirnov last month when it announced charges against him for fabricating a bribery allegation against the president. Republicans publicized Smirnov’s bribery allegation despite Justice Department warnings that the raw material had not been vetted. Still, the department vouched for Smirnov, saying he’d been a trusted informant on the FBI payroll for years. “Only after Mr. Smirnov reported that President Joe Biden accepted a bribe from a Ukrainian energy company in exchange for using his official position to oust the Ukrainian Prosecutor General did the FBI apparently take a hard look at this CHS,” House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said in a letter to Wray. “This episode is just another example of how the FBI is motivated by politics,” Comer and Jordan wrote. Senior U.S. diplomatic officials have maintained for years that when Biden was vice president, his push for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor reflected U.S. policy and had not been done as a favor to his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Smirnov’s bribe claim, memorialized in an FBI document known as an FD-1023 form, reinvigorated Republican allegations that ousting the prosecutor reflected corruption by the Bidens. The revelation that Smirnov made it up dealt a death blow to their impeachment inquiry. The indictment revealed that investigators figured out Smirnov was lying when they checked his story after Republicans made his bribe bluff public. Prosecutors said he made up this allegation in 2020 because he opposed Biden’s bid for the presidency. Comer and Jordan insinuated the Justice Department was protecting the Biden family and demanded information about Smirnov as part of their impeachment inquiry.

In a photo first uncovered by the Anti-Defamation League in 2022, McClanahan can be seen standing next to a robed member of the KKK in a 2019 photo, giving a Nazi salute with the member while a cross burns behind them. McClanahan, who has attempted to run for multiple seats of office including a failed bid for U.S. Senate, said in a failed lawsuit against the ADL last year that the cross-burning was instead a “Christian Identity Cross lighting ceremony,” the Riverfront Times reported. The lawsuit added that McClanahan is not a full member of the KKK, but instead has been “provided an Honorary 1-year membership” to the group. In its statement, the Missouri GOP said they “condemn any association with hate groups and are taking immediate action to rectify this situation.” In a post on X, McClanahan said the “Missouri GOP knew exactly who I am” and called them a “bunch of Anti-White hypocrites.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The “Interstellar” actor let her social media followers in on a hilarious encounter with designer Donatella Versace last week, when Hathaway attended the luxury fashion label’s Fall/Winter 2024 show last week. For the occasion, the “Princess Diaries” star donned a skintight red leather Versace dress.

I’m fine, I’m fine,” Hathaway insisted, as she gamely struggled to pose. “It’s for Donatella! I’m so happy. Thank you for having me to Milan.” Hathaway poked fun at the moment by posting a video of the incident in a carousel of photos and videos last week. “Breathing? 😎 Sitting? 🙃 😂 love you @donatella_versace,” she captioned the post. It looks like Hathaway was eventually able to find a way to sit down, at least according to photos from the Versace show: While at the show, Hathaway encountered Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue and the reported inspiration for Meryl Streep’s menacing, complicated character in “The Devil Wears Prada,” which Hathaway also starred in.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Water flossers are a popular dental hygiene tool for many — and Waterpik is one of the most recognizable names in the game. The brand’s American Dental Association-approved tools are beloved by reviewers for their powerful plaque-busting abilities, but some of the more heavy-duty models can occupy more real estate, making them inconvenient for smaller bathrooms and unfeasible for traveling. Luckily, there’s a streamlined option available at Amazon right now — Waterpik’s cordless “Pearl” model — for less than $50, which is almost 30% off its typical price of $69.99. It has a 4.4-star rating on Amazon and 8,751 reviewers have given the device five stars. While most of Waterpik’s cordless water flosser are created fairly equal, this pared-down option makes a really smart buy for anyone who wants Waterpik’s powerful pressurized cleaning stream but doesn’t need a lot of bells and whistles. Based on the comparison chart on Waterpik’s website, the Pearl’s main difference from the brand’s normally twice-as-expensive “Advanced” model is that it lacks an LED charging light and isn’t safe for use in the shower, which don’t feel like dealbreakers to us. The Advanced offers three setting as opposed to the Pearl’s dual settings, but the Pearl pumps out 1,450 pulses per minute, which is more than the Advanced. (If any of these are dealbreakers, know that the Advanced model is priced at about $80 on Amazon right now.) What the Pearl does offer is a promise to banish 99.99% percent of plaque bacteria from your — ahem — pearly whites with an effectiveness rate double that of dental floss. It comes with four interchangeable tips and a 7-ounce water reservoir for up to 45 seconds of continuous cleaning, and the higher-capacity battery life will power the device for a maximum of 36 minutes. It also has global voltage compatibility and a compact 3-inch footprint, so you can whisk it in into your suitcase on your next trip without a second thought (as many of the reviewers below have done). See what some Amazon reviewers had to say about this compact device, or just scroll all the way down to get one for yourself during this dazzling sale. “My dentist recommended this product and I’m glad I purchased it. Works well, easy to use, and doesn’t take up too much room in my suitcase when I travel.” — Amazon Customer “I have braces and at times even with orthodontic flossers, it is hard to get in between my teeth or the brackets. This water flosser does the trick. The lowest setting is perfect for cleaning all of the small seeds or other food debris that gets caught in my brackets or between my teeth. It’s portable and cordless and the charge lasts a long time. I just fill it with warm water and it does a great job. One cycle will usually get all the debris loose but on occasion, I fill the reservoir again and give my mouth a second cleaning before brushing. Highly recommend.” — Patti Mcclure “My teeth are very close together which makes standard flossing difficult. I love this water pick as it is easy to use and does a good job.” — Clarence Thistle “This waterpik is made for travel. It only holds 45 seconds of flossing water. You have to refill water chamber if you need more flossing. Its easy to hold and use. It has 2 power levels for the water floss. Effective.” — Rachel “Having owned three previous non-waterpic dental water cleaners that ultimately failed, I can highly recommend the genuine Waterpic as the best and most durable, and the highest quality.” — natca1“My wife and I are dependent on the waterpik in our bathroom. We are pleased to be able to use a travel version. We are very happy with this product.” — Peter Keim By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

(Watch the video below.) In a chat posted to the Oscars’ YouTube channel on Friday, the conversation got around to superheroes and “The Dark Knight,” triggering Eilish’s revelation about the film’s Batman-playing star. “A couple years ago, I had a dream about Christian Bale, and it was in a little cafe in the sunlight, and it made me realize I had to break up with my boyfriend at the time,” she said. Her brother Finneas O’Connell laughed. “No, like, genuinely. I woke up and I was like [gasps] and I came to my senses,” Eilish continued. The clip cut to another segment featuring the siblings and host Amelia Dimoldenberg, so we got no further information. But pop culture blog Uproxx guessed by the timing it could be former beau Matthew Tyler Vorce who got the heave-ho. This we cannot confirm. Eilish recently revealed that she is attracted to women. The “bad guy” singer and her brother, who won a best-song Oscar in 2022 for “No Time To Die,” are nominated again for best original song, “What Was I Made For?” from “Barbie.” The two are scheduled to perform the song at the March 10 ceremony.

First, though, he exchanged some heated words with U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden. The judge admonished Brandon Fellows, a 29-year-old chimney repairman and tree cutter from Schenectady, reportedly saying he had never seen a defendant so contemptuous. “You have repeatedly made a mockery of these proceedings,” McFadden told Fellows on Thursday amid repeated interruptions, WUSA9 News reported. “There is no grand conspiracy here against you,” McFadden said, per The Washington Post. “It’s time for you to grow up!” Fellows reportedly displayed no remorse at his August trial, where he represented himself and claimed McFadden was running a “Nazi court.” His antics so alarmed the jury that they sent a note to the judge during deliberations to confirm Fellows did not have any of their personal identifying information. Fellows was convicted on one felony count and four misdemeanors relating to his participation in the riot. He continued to lash out at McFadden even after the trial, calling him a “modern day Nazi judge” in one court filing, which he signed as “your favorite Political prisoner.” Prosecutors displayed images for the jury of Fellows leaning back in a chair in the office of Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) to smoke marijuana, wearing sunglasses and a fake beard made of yarn as he propped his feet on a piece of furniture. He was caught on camera climbing into the Capitol building through a broken window shortly before 3 p.m. He went on to parade a “Trump 2020” flag through the doors to the Senate Wing. His path brought him to Merkley’s office, then to the Capitol crypt, before he exited the same way he came, harassing two U.S. Capitol Police officers on his way out, according to prosecutors. He then gave an interview to CNN right outside the building. Days after the incident, prosecutors said, Fellows made social media posts indicating he was proud to have taken part in the riot. “Brought my heart joy to see these members terrified for their lives,” he wrote in one post, according to prosecutors. “For what they have done and are doing to this country I hope they live in constant fear.” In an interview with Bloomberg the week after the riot, Fellows said he believed that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former President Donald Trump, and said he had “no regrets.” (No evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election has been found.) Fellows said he got most of his news from YouTube commentators like Ben Shapiro and right-wing outlets like Newsmax, which amplified the “stolen election” conspiracy theory. His stepfather told Bloomberg that Fellows’ mind was made up: “You can’t really change it with any kind of reality.” The next four years will change America forever.

Into Hard Truth About Trump","josephine harvey","2024-03-01","Fox News’ Jessica Tarlov swiftly cleared things up for her co-hosts on “The Five” after they accused Democrats of subverting democracy. “I love days when you guys think that you’re describing Joe Biden, but you’re actually describing Donald Trump,” the liberal commentator said. She went on: “So the person who didn’t want the American people to be able to speak in 2020 was Donald Trump. And he had his team of crackpot lawyers fan out across the country to bring forward frivolous lawsuits, when there had been recount after recount, to make sure that the American public was disenfranchised.” Jessica: I love days when you guys think that you are describing Joe Biden but you are actually describing Donald Trump. So the person who didn't want the American people to be able to speak in 2020 was Donald Trump… pic.twitter.com/vghpl2EEiF She was responding to her conservative colleagues, who had spent minutes bashing Democrats and the media for criticizing the Supreme Court’s decision to review Trump’s presidential immunity claims, thereby delaying the former president’s federal election interference trial by at least several months. If the federal prosecutions against Trump are delayed beyond the November election, and Trump wins, he could order the Justice Department to drop the cases. Tarlov’s co-hosts had also slammed an Illinois judge for ruling that Trump is ineligible to appear on the state’s primary ballots under the U.S. Constitution’s so-called insurrection clause. “I mean, these people, I’m so sick of their saying he’s a threat to democracy, when everything they do is a threat to democracy,” Jeanine Pirro had said. Greg Gutfeld said the political left is trying to “compromise an election.” Jesse Watters claimed Democrats and the media were upset about the Supreme Court news because they’re “realizing that the judges of the Supreme Court aren’t on their schedule. And so they’re realizing that Joe Biden might have to win this himself.” “That’s what you saw last night, them realizing that this is going to be a free and fair election, to a certain extent,” he said. Trump is being prosecuted federally and in Georgia for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. He’s also been criminally indicted in two other cases. With his media and political allies dutifully in tow, he has cast the prosecutions as politically motivated and accused Democrats and President Joe Biden of weaponizing the justice system against him.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elsbeth-quirky-good-wife-carrie-preston_n_65e13e5ee4b0d2a24758b7dc","‘Elsbeth’ Has So Much Potential — If The Quirkiness Doesn’t Get Too Out Of Control","sarah hunter simanson","2024-03-01","“Would you consider an Elsbeth spinoff?” HuffPost first asked Carrie Preston in a 2013 interview. At the time, Preston’s recurring role as Elsbeth Tascioni on “The Good Wife” was a fan favorite, and it earned her that year’s Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Her response to the question was, “Of course, of course. I mean, no one is asking, but of course, I would say yes if they were.” Now, more than a decade later, the show premiered on CBS Thursday night. You probably already know this because ads for CBS’ newest procedural “Elsbeth” are everywhere, and the trailer makes it clear that while Elsbeth is still her lovably quirky self, she is stepping into a new role (and bringing her many patterned tote bags with her.) Instead of being Chicago’s lawyer savant, Elsbeth has moved to New York City to serve as an outside observer of the NYPD, fulfilling the consent decree requirement in a wrongful arrest lawsuit. Basically, her job is to observe the NYPD as the NYPD investigates crimes. But anyone who watched her guest star in 14 episodes of “The Good Wife” or five episodes of “The Good Fight” knows that Elsbeth is incapable of being a silent observer because she talks a lot and sees too much. Elsbeth’s ability to appear easily distracted by what’s around her (jewelry, bookcases, dresses, wallpaper, pictures of penguins) and her unusual way of speaking and trailing off mid-thought often leads people to underestimate her, to think she’s scatter-brained or “easily confused” or “easily entertained.” She isn’t someone willing to settle for the easy answer or a convenient criminal. In Elsbeth’s second episode of “The Good Wife” in Season 1, a character asks her, “How are you ahead of the police on this?” Elsbeth replies, “They’re not looking.” Even if they were looking, they wouldn’t see the world Elsbeth does, but is that enough to carry a show? But can Elsbeth pull it off? Can she make the transition from beloved guest star to titular lead character? Elsbeth’s ability to interpret what no one else around her sees is what viewers should expect of her character in the spinoff. They should also prepare for her unique perspective to create problems, especially with Captain C.W. Wagner (Wendell Pierce) and Detective Smullen (Danny Mastrogiorgio), and for her quirkiness to obfuscate her genius, at least temporarily. At a crime scene, Elsbeth’s “weird, savant stuff” reminds me of Adrian Monk or Shawn Spencer, the lead characters in some of USA Network’s most beloved, character-driven procedurals. Like them, I expect for her brilliance and quirkiness to drive the show. Also, her legal background gives the show’s writers even more dimensions to explore, which is why “Elsbeth” has the potential to become an inspired mash-up of “Psych,” “Monk” and “Suits.” Perhaps the series might also fill the void for everyone who binged or rewatched “Suits” in 2023 and is looking for their new show (especially for those in Robert Zane withdrawal because Pierce makes an excellent NYPD captain). Elsbeth’s quirkiness — a uniqueness Preston has referred to as “cayenne pepper” — adds spice and levity to “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight.” Her character usually appears when the situation is dire — when the lawyers need a lawyer or “The Firm” needs a lawyer — and her creative problem-solving elevates the game the lawyers are always playing in such a delightful and surprising way that viewers want more. This dynamic is also incredibly successful because, in addition to Preston’s phenomenal acting, Elsbeth is the polar opposite of the lawyers around her. The seriousness of Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) and practicality of Will Gardner (Josh Charles) and graceful grit of Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) balance her in scenes and storylines. But, when Preston is leading the show, will viewers begin to want less — less moments spent obsessing about New York as if she’s never been there (long-time fans remember the antisemitic bear in Season 5 of “The Good Wife”), less scenes in which she’s obsessing over objects or violating social norms, less time spent pondering theories out loud in an incomprehensible way? Preston is an incredible actor, so I think the real question is if the material she’s working with gives Elsbeth room to be a whole person instead of a quirky cliché. This line is hard to balance, but shows such as “Monk” and “Psych” did pull it off. This gives me hope that the confines of the procedural as a genre will provide enough structure to balance Elsbeth’s zaniness. But, based on the pilot’s many moments in which Elsbeth’s idiosyncrasies feel unnatural, I think the writers have more work to do to ensure that the spinoff is not chipping away at the full character the “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” worked so hard to develop. The secondary characters also need to be strong enough to hold this line, which, right now, it appears only Pierce is able to do. Elsbeth has to have cases interesting enough to showcase her intellectual thought processes, which I don’t think the pilot’s predictable first case gives her. The episode opens with the crime, which is a confusing choice for a pilot — at one point I paused the show to make sure I was actually watching “Elsbeth” (she doesn’t appear until six minutes into the episode) — but it is a style characteristic of procedurals. In this case, it’s not a question of “who did it.” The conflict is if Elsbeth — the only one who suspects foul play in a wealthy college student’s death — will be able to find the proof to prove it. There’s also the question of if she’s even allowed to assist in the investigation because she’s supposed to be an observer. But, as fans of Elsbeth know, she is capable of twisting definitions (and legalities) to justify her means. The difference in “Elsbeth” is the ends. “You’re not a defense lawyer anymore. The truth means putting people in jail,” Elsbeth is told at one point during the pilot. Earlier in the episode, she tells Captain Wagner that she took this job because after 30 years as a lawyer, she was tired of representing clients who she sometimes knew were guilty: “My work could be all about finding the truth and not just some better way of telling a lie for someone I was defending.” The consistently great part of Elsbeth’s appearances in both previous shows was her ability to tell better lies, to concoct better stories, to keep the people she’s representing out of legal trouble. What will her life look like when she does the opposite? How will she handle the nuances of knowing someone is guilty but finding that person likable? How will it feel when she’s responsible for putting someone in jail instead of keeping them out?

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jennifer-dulos-michelle-troconis-verdict_n_65de2542e4b005b85831e4b4","Michelle Troconis Found Guilty In Jennifer Dulos Murder Conspiracy","drusilla moorhouse","2024-03-01","A jury Friday found a Connecticut woman guilty of conspiring with her boyfriend to kill his estranged wife, a mother of five who disappeared in 2019. Michelle Troconis, 49, was also found guilty on five other counts of tampering with physical evidence and hindering prosecution connected to Fotis Dulos’ presumed killing of Jennifer Dulos, who was last seen dropping off their five children at school on the morning of March 24, 2019. The Duloses had been in the middle of a contentious two-year divorce battle and custody dispute, which placed strict restrictions on when and how Fotis Dulos could see the couple’s children. The six-member jury deliberated for three days after hearing more than seven weeks of testimony before finding that Troconis helped Dulos create an alibi for the time of the killing, and later helped him clean up and dispose of evidence of the crime. Troconis faces up to 50 years in prison, according to the Stamford Advocate, citing Connecticut state statute. Jennifer Dulos’ body has never been found, but she was declared officially dead by a state judge in October. Fotis Dulos was facing capital murder and kidnapping charges when he died by suicide in January 2020. Troconis could be heard audibly crying as the verdicts were read, leaning against her attorney Jon Schoenhorn. After he whispered that she could sit, she put her head on the table and sobbed, with attorney Audrey Felsen rubbing her back as the jury was polled. Connecticut Superior Court Judge Kevin Randolph set a bond of $6 million, denying her defense’s request that she remain free on her original bond of $2.1 million. Troconis was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. Jennifer Dulos’ family called the ruling a “crucial attribution of accountability” for “an unconscionable series of crimes” but emphasized that it is “not a victory” in a statement shared with HuffPost. “There can be no victory when five children are growing up without their mother,” said Carrie Luft, a close friend of Jennifer Dulos’ and the family’s spokesperson. Despite the “immense body of evidence” presented at trial, Luft pointed out that Jennifer Dulos’ body still hasn’t been found and expressed the family’s hope that the publicity from the trial will generate new leads. “In the meantime, Jennifer’s grace, goodness, and light live on through her children and through the honor of her memory,” Luft said. “This is not the trial of Fotis Dulos; this is the trial of Michelle Troconis,” Schoenhorn said in his closing argument Tuesday. But prosecutors first had to establish Fotis Dulos’ guilt to make the case that Troconis conspired with him in a murder — when the body of the victim has never been found. Randolph dealt an early blow to the prosecution when he excluded testimony of the chief medical examiner, who had previously said that Jennifer Dulos had suffered “non-survivable injuries.” Without a body to examine, Dr. James Gill based his conclusion on evidence provided by investigators, including blood in Jennifer Dulos’ garage and bloody clothes that matched her DNA. Ultimately, Randolph ruled, “the jury has heard more than Dr. Gill could testify to.” And Schoenhorn questioned whether prosecutors had proved that Dulos killed his wife. “It’s still unclear what happened,” he told jurors. “And unfortunately, this trial will not solve that puzzle. It will remain a mystery, an unfinished puzzle.” Prosecutors presented hundreds of puzzle pieces to jurors over the course of 25 days of testimony and more than 150 exhibits. On Tuesday, they had just one hour to assemble the pieces for the jury in closing arguments, which they did in two parts, before and after Schoenhorn argued for the defense. (There were no opening statements, in accordance with Connecticut state law.) Fotis Dulos’ alleged scheme required careful planning, multiple vehicles and hours of driving. Prosecutors said he drove 70 miles south from his Farmington home (where he also operated his luxury real estate development company) to Jennifer Dulos’ house in New Canaan, back up to Farmington (where he spent the afternoon at a property he was selling) and finally 10 miles to Hartford, this time driving his Ford Raptor with Troconis in the passenger seat. Based on a search warrant of Fotis’ phone, investigators were able to use location data to trace his movements that night and requested surveillance footage for the area, which was shown at trial. In the bed of the four-door pickup were numerous full black plastic garbage bags, whose numbers dwindled as he tossed them in various garbage bins along the way. Police said they were able to recover some of those bags and found inside a number of items linked to Jennifer Dulos and the crime, which were shown in court. The grim findings included a woman’s Vineyard Vines shirt and bra, both sliced down the middle and soaked in blood — later identified as Jennifer Dulos’ — a box cutter, two rain ponchos, a towel, four long zip ties, gloves and cleaning supplies that all appeared to be stained with blood. Troconis claimed that she rode with Dulos specifically to go to Starbucks and wasn’t paying attention because it was not unusual for him to dump trash from their construction projects. At one stop, surveillance footage showed both Fotis and Troconis opening their doors. While Dulos walks around the truck and places a garbage bag in the bin, Troconis is seen opening the passenger door and reaching down to the sidewalk. He then approaches her and slides what appears to be a large envelope into a sewer grate under her open door. Investigators later recovered the envelope and found inside two Connecticut license plates that had been altered with tape. The plates had been used on a car registered to Fotis. Cameras also captured him removing a “large, rigid object” consistent with a missing cargo liner from Jennifer’s Suburban and leaning it up against a building. It was never recovered. Authorities believe that Fotis Dulos was lying in wait and attacked Jennifer Dulos in her own garage in New Canaan when she returned from the school just after 8 a.m. on March 24. To get there, police believe he drove his employee Pawel Gumienny’s Toyota Tacoma pickup, with his own bicycle in the back, parked it near Waveny Park, and cycled to the New Canaan mansion. After killing her, he drove her body in her own Chevy Surburban back to the park, leaving her SUV for searchers to find later while he returned to Farmington in Gumienny’s pickup, investigators said. The murder conspiracy charge against Troconis relates to what she was doing that morning. According to prosecutors, she agreed to answer a prearranged call from Dulos’ friend in Greece to Dulos’ phone ― which he left in their home office ― but also to avoid having his movements tracked. Initially, Troconis and Dulos’ friend Kent Mawhinney (who is himself awaiting trial on a murder conspiracy charge in the case) said Dulos was with them in the office that morning. She also originally told police that she had woken up beside Dulos that morning, showered with him and had sex, but in a later interview admitted she had not seen him at all. Prosecutors said Troconis and Dulos were following what investigators referred to as “alibi scripts” — a term they were barred from using during the trial — to account for their movements that day. Schoenhorn said that Troconis’ inconsistent statements were a result of aggressive police tactics that affected her memory and confusion because English is not her native language. (She is originally from Venezuela.) Her police interviews were all conducted in English, but she used a Spanish interpreter throughout the trial. Jurors were shown video of her three police interviews in their entirety, hours of footage filmed at Jennifer Dulos’ house, and traffic and security video of the various vehicles driven by Dulos, Troconis and Gumienny on May 24. Troconis’ movements that afternoon were of particular interest to investigators and highlighted by prosecutors in their closing arguments. She made five trips back and forth from the home and office she shared with Dulos on Jefferson Crossing, to the empty property he was preparing to sell on Mountain Spring Road, two miles away. Dulos stayed there the entire time, close to 3 1/2 hours. During that time, prosecutors said, there were three different “fire events” at Jefferson Crossing. Based on a neighbor’s security video of smoke billowing from the chimney — and its absence — prosecutors alleged that Troconis was burning evidence. Although Schoenhorn countered that Troconis enjoyed having fires in the fireplace year-round, the prosecution emphasized that this was the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, a warm day and an odd time to light several different fires. Meanwhile, prosecutors said Dulos was cleaning Gumienny’s Tacoma, which he allegedly used to transport his wife’s body, and bagging up the evidence. When Gumienny showed up unannounced at the Mountain Spring Road property to pick up his truck, Troconis took his keys to dissuade him from taking it. He insisted, however, because he needed it to transport his dirt bike home. Gumienny was a key witness for the prosecution and was granted immunity to testify. When he returned to Farmington with his Tacoma after Memorial Day weekend, Gumienny testified that Dulos and Troconis took it without his knowledge or consent to a car wash to have it cleaned and fully detailed — twice. Then Gumienny said Dulos repeatedly urged him to replace the Tacoma’s seats, which he eventually did, but held on to the original ones. Ultimately he handed them over to investigators, who said they found evidence of Jennifer Dulos’ DNA on the passenger seat. Dulos might have had an additional sinister intent when he borrowed Gumienny’s truck. Just before Jennifer Dulos’ disappearance, Fotis Dulos shaved his head — a deliberate attempt, investigators believed, to mislead any witnesses into thinking he was Gumienny, who had a similar hairstyle. Gumienny said he even made a joke about it when he found Dulos and Troconis at a property they claimed to be cleaning the afternoon Jennifer Dulos disappeared. “You shaved your head. You’re wearing dirty old work clothes. You trying to be as handsome as me?” Gumienny testified he told Dulos. Troconis had a greater motive than just helping her boyfriend, prosecutors said. She hated Jennifer Dulos, Supervisory Assistant State’s Attorney Michelle Manning said Tuesday, and wanted to end the “two years of torture” she endured, including being barred from her home during Dulos’ visitations with his children. “The frustration turned to anger and hatred,” Manning said, quoting Troconis’ own interviews when she described Jennifer Dulos as “manipulating,” “angry” and “toxic.” In one of the most dramatic moments of the seven-week trial, Gumienny recounted what Troconis said when Jennifer Dulos refused to allow their children to say goodbye to the ill family dog before Fotis Dulos had him put to sleep in the spring of 2019. “That bitch should be buried next to the dog,” Gumienny testified. In the final closing argument, Assistant State’s Attorney Sean McGuinness repeated Troconis’ derogatory comment but said this case was about “a mother’s worst nightmare.” “It is about a mother being taken away from her children, in life or in death,” he said. It is about Dulos’ children, “who went to bed on May 24 not knowing where their mother was, and she has still not arrived.” In a statement shared with HuffPost, Schoenhorn said he is “extremely disappointed in the outcome” of the trial and reiterated his previous contention that Troconis’ inconsistent accounts were partly the result of her police interviews being conducted in English without a Spanish interpreter, saying that “played a major role in the verdict.” “I think it was unfortunate that the interrogations were conducted in a manner and in a language that led her to contradict herself, and I understand how that would be used against her,” he said, blaming “hindsight bias” for the jury’s finding that Troconis knew in advance that Fotis Dulos would kill his wife. Paul J. Ferencek, state’s attorney for the Stamford/Norwalk Judicial District, commended the jury and offered condolences to Dulos’ family in a press release after the verdict, promising that their work on the case isn’t over.

I assure you the State of Connecticut and this office will never stop looking,” Ferencek said. Troconis also faces a contempt hearing on March 5. During the trial, a friend of Jennifer Dulos told prosecutors that a sealed report related to the Duloses’ custody battle had been displayed on Troconis’ laptop in a very large font that could be read by people in the courtroom. In response, Judge Randolph restricted the use of computers in the courtroom to attorneys. Troconis is scheduled to be sentenced on May 31. The court clerk originally proposed May 24, which Schoenhorn suggested would be “inappropriate” — it marks the fifth anniversary of Jennifer Dulos’ death.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-mass-deportation-local-police_n_65e1df88e4b013678e14f39f","Donald Trump Says Local Police Will Play Key Role In His Mass Deportation Plan","marita vlachou","2024-03-01","Former President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested that local police will play a key role in delivering his campaign pledge of carrying out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants if he wins re-election this November. “Look, we have to deport a lot of people, and they have to start immediately,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity Thursday in an interview held near the U.S.-Mexico border, where the former president made a campaign stop. Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary contest, said he would give local police officers immunity to carry out his plan. “They understand who these migrants are. They know them by their first name, their last name, they know where they come from,” Trump said. “It’s going to be the local police are going to turn them over and we’re going to have to move them back to their country.” Trump has made immigration a major focus of his 2024 presidential campaign, using tough rhetoric and pledging to bring “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history” if he returns to the White House. His allies, including Steve Bannon, have also been pushing the extreme measure. “Mass deportations are going to start, if you don’t like that, then don’t vote for President Trump,” Bannon said Thursday on his “War Room” podcast. Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge David Ezra on Thursday blocked a Texas law, originally set to take effect next week, which would allow police to arrest those who cross into the country illegally and would also enable local judges to order their deportation. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has appealed the ruling. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who joined Trump Thursday at his visit to the U.S. southern border, said he will continue fighting to protect his state from what he described as President Joe “Biden’s migrant crisis.” “Texas has the right to defend itself because of President Biden’s ongoing failure to fulfill his duty to protect our state from the invasion at our southern border,” Abbott said. “Even from the bench, this District Judge acknowledged that this case will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.” Texas has the constitutional right to defend itself because of President Biden's ongoing failure to fulfill his duty.We will not back down in our fight to protect Texas.This case will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. pic.twitter.com/o7ugwxViMU Abbott has endorsed Trump and the former president said he is considering the governor as a potential running mate. Biden visited the border Thursday as well hoping to score a win on the issue after Trump encouraged his party’s congressional lawmakers to block a bipartisan bill, which would have imposed the toughest border enforcement measures in decades, by, among other things, making it harder for people to claim asylum.

Trump, however, failed to mention his role in the legislation getting tossed out, claiming instead that “the United States is being overrun by Biden migrant crime.” Trump has falsely stated that illegal immigrants are responsible for the majority of crimes committed in the U.S. despite studies showing undocumented immigrants are responsible for less murders than American citizens.

(AP) — A man who fatally shot a 20-year-old woman after the SUV she was riding in mistakenly drove into his rural driveway in upstate New York was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in prison. Kevin Monahan, 66, was convicted of second-degree murder in the death last April of Kaylin Gillis. She was riding in a caravan of two cars and a motorcycle that was trying to leave after pulling into Monahan’s long, winding driveway while looking for a party at another person’s house in the town of Hebron. “I think it’s important for people to know that it’s not OK to shoot people and have them killed for turning down your driveway,” Judge Adam Michelini said. Apart from the wider deterrent effect, Michelini said it’s important that Monahan remain behind bars rather than be free to harm more people. The judge added up to 4 more years for tampering with the murder weapon, and scolded Monahan for showing no remorse. “You murdered Kaylin Gillis. You shot at a car full of people and you didn’t care what would happen and you repeatedly lied about it. You deserve to spend the maximum time in prison allowable under the law,” the judge said. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum. The defense asked for leniency. Monahan declined an opportunity to speak. And then he was led away, to applause and a shout of “coward” from the gallery. Gillis’ death drew attention far beyond upstate New York. It came days after the shooting of 16-year-old Ralph Yarl in Kansas City. Yarl, who is Black, was wounded by an 84-year-old white man after he went to the wrong door while trying to pick up his younger brothers. On the night of Gillis’ death, the group of friends had realized their error and had turned around when Monahan fired a second shot, striking Gillis in the neck as she sat in the front passenger seat of an SUV driven by her boyfriend. Monahan maintained the fatal shot was an accident and that the shotgun was defective. He also said he believed the house about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Albany was “under siege” by intruders, and said he came out to fire a warning shot to try to scare the group away while his wife hid inside. Prosecutors argued that Monahan was motivated by an irrational rage toward trespassers. A jury deliberated for less then two hours before returning guilty verdicts in January against Monahan for murder, reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence. Gillis’ father, Andrew Gillis, has described his daughter as someone who loved animals and had dreams of becoming a marine biologist or a veterinarian.

We will never see her beautiful face, hear her laughter,” Gillis said in court Friday before Monahan’s sentence was announced.

Although Twitter has rebranded to X, the humor lives on. Every week, we round up the most hilarious quips from parents on the social media platform to spread the joy. Scroll down to read the latest batch, and follow @HuffPostParents for more! My 6yo is chanting all the words that rhyme with sucker and this is going to end badly in about 3 seconds When I was growing up, water was the only approved drink between meals. Yesterday my son asked for milk after playing outside at my parents' and my dad poured his grandson a giant cup of CHOCOLATE milk.🧐IT WAS NOT EVEN ANYONE'S BIRTHDAY OR ANYTHING. Apparently my 9yo daughter's imaginary friend is the ghost of an 8yo girl named Rose who died of the bubonic plague 200 years ago and I’m sure this is a completely normal developmental stage........ Sorry kids I missed your childhood, I was busy trying to catch up on emails from your school I was going through an old keepsakes box of mine and found a 4 colored pen. I asked my 6 year old if she’d like to have the cool pen I used when I was a kid. Her eyes lit up, then I gave it to her and she frowned. “Oh, I thought it was going to be one of those feathers,” she said “Do you think in heaven you can pee anywhere you want?” My daughter, asking the big questions Be warned that if you buy your 5 year old a watch, you are going to get minute by minute updates on what the current time is Forgot about the 12-20 months stage of having a baby where your house is just littered with random objects they picked up, carried around, and dropped for no reason like you live inside a claw machine. I forgot to tell my 4yo that today is Leap Day before she left for school and squandered an opportunity to make a big deal out of nothing Young children sneeze with the intent of destroying the world I called to my son from another room and he yelled “just text me” and that’s all you need to know about parenting teens. My daughter asked if babies come from Walmart and I was like pretty much. Me: “Come here” is spelled C-O-M-E not C-U-MMy kid: Does it really matter how I spell it?Me: Yes! 11yo: Do you know where my sunglasses are?Me: The car?11yo: No, I looked. Two days later, while driving my kid to school. 11yo: My sunglasses! My kids are playing doctor’s office and the receptionist just said, “the doctor will see you in five seconds” and this is the least realistic game I’ve ever seen. The aggressiveness of my teenager sitting down on the couch is equal to him being dropped on it from 4,000 feet in the air. Like why. just an update my kids are on their 99th cold this winter “I like mommy’s car better”-My daughter in the backseat of my truck having to use a Home Depot receipt to wipe her nose. Parents: If you ever need a reminder about the power of peer pressure, my 13 year-old son went from never eating vegetables to now eating literal dried seaweed because his friend told them all that seaweed will help grow a moustache.

Trump, who is the current Republican front-runner, also faces a federal indictment in Florida related to his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House. His attorneys said they want that trial pushed back until after the election. Haley said Trump has the right to defend himself, but that the cases should not be drawn out and must be addressed quickly. “I think voters are going to want to know what they’re walking into, and if they’re walking into a president who’s still going to have to be in court or if they’re walking into a presidency where he can get rid of a court case. Voters are going to want to know that,” Hayley said. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

While Hayley added that no president should be legally immune to anything, and they must “live under laws too,” she has previously said that it would be bad if Trump winds up “sitting in a jail cell.” “For me, the last thing we need is an 80-year-old president sitting in jail because that’s just going to further divide our country,” she told CNN back in January. “This is no longer about whether he’s innocent or guilty. This is about the fact: How do we bring the country back together?” She added that that does not mean she would preemptively pardon Trump, like President Gerald Ford did for Richard Nixon.

Beginning this week, the IRS will start sending out noncompliance letters to more than 25,000 people who earn more than $1 million per year and 100,000 people with incomes between $400,000 and $1 million who failed to pay their taxes between 2017 and 2021. The campaign announced Thursday is part of the agency’s ongoing effort to pursue high wealth tax cheats — mandated in part by funding provided through Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act passed into law in 2022 and a directive from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to IRS leadership not to increase audit rates on people making less than $400,000 a year annually. “When people don’t file a tax return they’re required to, it’s not fair to those hardworking taxpayers who responsibly do their civic duty under the laws of our nation,” IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel told reporters Thursday morning. “And when people don’t file their taxes, they need to know there’s a consequence.” The IRS in recent months has announced a slew of new campaigns aimed at targeting high-wealth individuals who misuse the tax system or fail to pay their obligations. For instance, last week IRS leadership said the agency will start up dozens of audits on businesses’ private jets and how they are used personally by executives and written off as a tax deduction. And earlier this year, the agency announced it had collected roughly half a billion dollars in overdue taxes from delinquent millionaires. The next four years will change America forever.

Ron DeSantis Is Trying To Clean Up His Book-Banning History","michael arceneaux","2024-03-01","Tempting as it is to want to completely ignore the charmless curmudgeon that is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, we should not ignore his slight omission that his “book ban” campaign has gone too far. DeSantis, at a Feb. 15 news conference, supported a state House proposal designed to limit what he called “bad-faith objections” to various school library books and instructional materials. He said these objections were an abuse of the process, performed to “score cheap political points.” “We obviously have to give parents the ability to be able to ensure that this smut doesn’t get into their schools,” the Republican governor said. But he noted: “Although we like people wanting to be involved in what’s going on, to just show up and object to every single book under the sun, that is not an appropriate situation here, and we have seen that occasionally.” Florida reportedly logged 1,218 book objections during the 2022-2023 fiscal year, resulting in the removal of 386 books ― often titles that are very Black, hella gay, pro-trans, and/or anti-slavery and anti-segregation. Despite his call for the Florida Legislature to “fine-tune the process” to prevent what he described as activists saddling school districts with unnecessary work, he continued to argue that the mashup of bills and state education department policy that effectively allowed for the banning of books was not a book ban bill ― saying that was a “false narrative.” “A lot of the things that people say in the media that were, quote, ‘objected to’ were actually on the summer reading list of the Florida Department of Education, so this is all a big fraud,” DeSantis claimed at the news conference. He added, “No district in Florida has removed any dictionaries or thesauruses.” That’s not true, though. It is unsurprising that a man who launched a 2024 presidential campaign built on the theme that God directly called on him to run can’t admit fault, but nonetheless, these comments are an acknowledgment that his bill, HB 1069, in its original form is not working. This tacit admission from DeSantis is likely rooted in his ongoing delusions of one day becoming president. As reported by ABC News days before DeSantis spoke out, a source close to him confirmed that he had privately expressed interest in running for president again as early as 2028. And multiple other people close to him added that he plans to keep a small political team around him. How much money will DeSantis waste on consultants to lie to him that he still has a shot at becoming president of the United States someday before he ultimately accepts that the only DeSantis in his house with any shot at moving into the White House to launch their white Christian nationalist remix of the Kennedy dynasty is his wife? Who knows, but while I’m not often in the habit of saving boring bigots money, I have some free game for the failed presidential contender: You cannot run away from your own policies that easily. After all, it was only in 2022 when DeSantis, along with his political adviser Christopher Rufo, best known for launching a campaign against the teaching of “critical race theory” in public schools (spoiler: it never has been), were already exploiting LGBTQ biases when they decided to pivot and exploit racial animus for political gain next with legislation like the “Stop WOKE Act.” Much like the made-up beef about critical race theory to limit discussion of racial history and identity in schools and workplaces, DeSantis, Rufo and other conservative activists like them stoked fear about queer and trans people under the false pretense of parental control. As The New Yorker’s Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote in “The Political Strategy of Ron DeSantis’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Bill” at the time: “In American politics, ideology is often a smoke screen for individual ambition.” DeSantis wanted to usurp former President Donald Trump as the leader of the Republican Party and used Black history and LGBTQ people as his answer to Trump’s racist ramblings about Mexicans coming across the border to be predators. With DeSantis, queer and trans people were the predators — purposely maligning them as “groomers” and repeatedly arguing that parents “should be protected from schools using classroom instruction to sexualize their kids as young as 5 years old.” In the small minds of men like Ron DeSantis, you can’t discuss a non-heterosexual person without immediately thinking of their sexual acts. But let him tell it, and anyone who didn’t support his homophobic and transphobic legislation based on that dumb, creepy premise were alleged to be complicit in pedophilia. It’s exactly how he maligned Disney over its objections to all of his anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and legislation before then punishing them from the Governor’s Mansion. His campaign was pretty homophobic in tone at times, too. None of these stunts resulted in the same level of success for DeSantis as Trump achieved in 2016, but while DeSantis may want to forget a lot about the last two years of his life ― chasing what proved to be a humiliating defeat in the GOP primary, dropping out on Jan. 21 ― the rest of us should not let him. Whereas DeSantis failed in the primary, he succeeded in inspiring the entire Republican Party to not only target minority authors but also teachers, librarians and others who promote literacy without biased restrictions. Take West Virginia, where the House of Delegates just voted on a bill to allow the prosecution of librarians. But now, as he apparently considers another presidential run, Ron DeSantis wants to act like the level-headed man behind the mess he’s responsible for making. It doesn’t work that way, Meatball. His book ban bill is not a “false narrative” but an accurate description of a despicable policy that should hang around his neck for the rest of his life.",-0.0691995830216503,0.242132662897074

In a lawsuit filed at San Francisco Superior Court, billionaire Musk said that when he bankrolled OpenAI’s creation, he secured an agreement with Altman and Greg Brockman, the president, to keep the AI company as a non-profit that would develop technology for the benefit of the public. Under its founding agreement, OpenAI would also make its code open to the public instead of walling it off for any private company’s gains, the lawsuit says. However, by embracing a close relationship with Microsoft, OpenAI and its top executives have set that pact “aflame” and are “perverting” the company’s mission, Musk alleges in the lawsuit. “OpenAI, Inc. has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft,” the lawsuit filed Thursday says. “Under its new Board, it is not just developing but is actually refining an AGI to maximize profits for Microsoft, rather than for the benefit of humanity.” AGI refers to artificial general intelligence, which are general purpose AI systems that can perform just as well as — or even better than — humans in a wide variety of tasks. Musk is suing over breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and unfair business practices. He also wants an injunction to prevent anyone, including Microsoft, from benefiting from OpenAI’s technology.

Instead, Dellinger — one of the few thousand people who showed up to a Donald Trump rally the day before the South Carolina primary — believes Democrats may swap Biden for Vice President Kamala Harris, who Dellinger says is “not even a little bit qualified” to be president. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they tried to remove him and put in Kamala Harris and have her run,” she said. Talk to almost any Republican at a grassroots event and you’ll hear some version of this theory: that Democrats will end up nominating someone besides Biden at their August national convention. Some believe there’s even a nominee-in-waiting to replace the 81-year-old president — who hasn’t suggested he intends to step aside, despite mounting concerns about his age and health. Their predictions for who this person might be range from the plausible — California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who many see as a likely candidate in 2028 — to the totally ridiculous, like former President Barack Obama. This conspiracy, though, has some grounding in the real concerns that Democrats whisper about in private, and the grim warnings beginning to surface in polls of the election eight months away. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll released Thursday found Trump beating Biden in seven key swing states that helped Biden defeat Trump in 2020. Respondents largely found Biden to be too old, while many considered Trump, the likely GOP nominee, to be dangerous. Trump has helped to legitimize the notion that he won’t be facing Biden in November, even as polls show the former president gaining on Biden, which should be enough of a reason for Trump to hope the election is a repeat of 2020. “I personally don’t think he makes it,” Trump told Sean Hannity during a Fox News town hall back in December. Since then, Biden’s possible replacement has become the subject of wild speculation on the right. Organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) surveyed attendees at its annual confab last weekend about who they think will be the eventual Democratic nominee. A majority named former first lady Michelle Obama, who famously hates politicking in all its forms. Others cited Harris, Newsom and ex-Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Michelle Obama’s name kept coming up in conversations at Trump’s rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, last Friday. Trump supporters who spoke with HuffPost feared Democrats would tap Obama because she’d make a better candidate than Biden. (Despite her dislike of politics, Obama is one of America’s most popular political figures.) “I believe if she does it, she’ll win because society is just more about looks and no substance. We just look at popularity more than anything else,” said Doug Smith, a postal worker from Rock Hill. CPAC even dedicated a panel — with the deranged title “Cat Fight? Michelle vs. Kamala” — to dissecting the imaginary political rivalry between two of the party’s most prominent Black women. Radio host Monica Crowley warned Republicans to be ready for Obama to swoop in and clinch the nomination: “Michelle Obama is the worst-case scenario because she poses the most threatening challenge to Trump,” she said. Biden’s campaign, in an email to HuffPost, called this theory “bizarre” and said it was “happy to confirm that’s not the case.” Republicans, however, may be taking some of their cues from real election influencers who are slowly beginning to question the wisdom of another Biden run and suggesting a way that Democrats might coalesce behind someone else. This month, The New York Times’ Ezra Klein, one of the paper’s most prominent liberal columnists, argued it’s time for Biden’s inner circle to intervene and convince the president to allow delegates to get behind another nominee. Election analyst Nate Silver also wrote this month that Biden needs to campaign more aggressively or “stand down.” This week’s Michigan primary revealed warning signs for both Biden and Trump. Biden lost 13% of the Democratic primary vote to “uncommitted” voters protesting his Middle East policy and another almost 6% to Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson. Trump, meanwhile, lost 30% of the GOP primary vote to former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. The Trump supporters who spoke with HuffPost recently regarded the potential for another Democratic nominee with a mix of glee and also fear over whom Democrats might find to run, though some of their predictions would not be remotely possible. A South Carolina woman who would only identify herself as Debbie because she was afraid of online backlash from her remarks, believes that it’s really Barack Obama who’s eyeing a return to office for a third term, which is not allowed under the Constitution. In his speeches “he talks about a third term. He talks about controlling. He talks about all those things,” she said. Even though it’s illegal, she said she wouldn’t put such a scheme past Democrats, who are “sneaky little bastards.” She also touched on another theme that’s widespread on the right — that Biden isn’t even in charge at the White House. “Is he even running? I just think it’s all a sham. I think they’re trying to figure out what is going on and how people are going to react.” Joe Schaub, a 67-year-old from Columbia, South Carolina, said it’s clear that Biden is simply too old now to do the job. “He was a schmuck senator,” Schaub said. “Now he’s old and dumb. That’s a bad combination. You just can’t replace old.” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

After Al-Nassr defeated Riyadh rival Al-Shabab 3-2 on Sunday, video footage appeared to show Ronaldo cupping his ear and repeatedly thrusting his hand forward near his pelvis, in a gesture that seemed to be aimed at Al-Shabab fans. Background chants of “Messi,” referencing Ronaldo’s longstanding soccer rival Lionel Messi, could be heard. The Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation (SAFF) committee announced the ban on social media early Thursday morning local time. Al-Nassr’s next league game is at home to Al-Hazm on Thursday. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United star will also have to pay a fine of 20,000 Saudi Riyals ( $5,333) to Al-Shabab, to cover the costs of the club filing the complaint, and half of that amount to the federation. The committee said that the decision was not open to appeal. While the incident was not captured by television cameras, the actions of Ronaldo, who scored a first-half penalty in the game, were widely criticized in Saudi Arabia by former players and commentators.

It is not the first time that the Portuguese forward has been at the center of controversy since joining Al-Nassr. Last April, upon leaving the field after a game against Al-Hilal, Ronaldo appeared to grab his genitals as fans chanted Messi’s name. On that occasion, Al-Nassr said that the forward had sustained a groin injury in the match. Ronaldo, who moved to the Riyadh-based club in December 2022, has a league-leading 22 goals. His scored the opener against Al Shabab, a first-half penalty. Al Nassr is also in the quarterfinals of the Asian Champions League, a tournament it has never won.

Police records show that Thompson had physically abused Gonzalez several times throughout their relationship, including when she was pregnant. Thompson strangled Gonzalez and “recklessly caused bodily injury” in a December 2022 incident, according to court records. She told her family she wanted to leave him, but she was terrified. “He was so angry that she wanted to get away from him,” Mileny Rubio, Gonzalez’s sister, told a local Dallas outlet. “She would always tell me that she wanted to leave, but that she couldn’t.” Gonzalez knew she couldn’t continue the pregnancy because she did not want to be tied to her abuser for the rest of her life. But she lived in Dallas, Texas, where by last spring, abortion had been banned for nearly a year. So she drove to Colorado ― at least an 18-hour journey there and back ― to get an abortion. The day after Gonzalez returned, Thompson found out about the abortion and confronted her in a gas station parking lot. Surveillance video, described in a police report, shows Thompson put Gonzalez in a chokehold before she was able to shrug him off. That’s when Thompson pulled out a gun and shot Gonzalez in the head. The video shows Thompson firing several more bullets into Gonzalez’s body before fleeing. He was charged with murder and is awaiting trial. Gonzalez, like so many other domestic violence victims in Texas, faced an increased risk of violence from her abusive partner and a higher likelihood he would kill her because of the state’s decision to loosen gun laws and completely restrict access to abortion. Her story reflects the three systemic crises converging in Texas that are creating a deadly new normal for women. Each has resulted from a deliberate policy created by right-wing state lawmakers. The leading cause of death among pregnant and postpartum women in the U.S. is homicide, most often by an abusive partner with a gun. Pregnant and postpartum women are more than twice as likely to be murdered than to die from sepsis, hypertensive disorders or hemorrhage. “Pregnant and postpartum women are more than twice as likely to be murdered than to die from sepsis, hypertensive disorders or hemorrhage.” Experts tell HuffPost other states with abortion bans are also seeing an increase in domestic violence, but Texas stands out for a few reasons. The state was the first to severely restrict abortion in 2021, forcing women to stay pregnant nearly a year before Roe fell and exposing domestic violence victims to more violence with fewer ways to escape. At the same time, the Lone Star state has the largest rate of gun sales in the country and continues to have lax firearm restrictions. The state is so firearm friendly that gun rights groups chose it as the testing ground for a Supreme Court case that will determine if domestic abusers get to keep their guns. In the last decade, the amount of women shot and killed by an abuser has nearly doubled in Texas. Even though Gonzalez was able to get an abortion, her abuser still had access to a firearm. Women who travel more than 150 miles to get an abortion are more likely to experience physical violence from an abuser than those traveling less than 50 miles. Gonzalez, who leaves behind three young children, traveled at least 500 miles on the last trip of her life. HuffPost spoke with a dozen people working in advocacy services in the state ― ranging from abortion funds and family attorneys, to shelter directors and hotline staff ― who believe that the state’s abortion bans coupled with its lax gun laws are fueling intimate partner violence. Survivors and advocacy workers are terrified that this new normal will lead to more dead women in Texas: The state has made it easier for a man to obtain a gun to kill his partner than it is for a woman to access abortion care. For Holly Bowles, a sexual assault victim advocate working in Texas, the hardest part of her job is telling someone they’re pregnant. Bowles and her colleagues at SAFE Alliance, which is based in Austin, normally see people in the immediate aftermath of an assault. They serve around 6,000 Texans every year who have experienced emotionally and physically devastating violence. The nonprofit works with survivors of child abuse, human trafficking, intimate partner violence and sexual assault. Their hotline, which hears from around 2,000 callers a month, connects people to housing assistance, legal services — or to advocates like Bowles, who can support a victim through a rape kit exam or legal trial. Around half of the survivors Bowles supports have experienced intimate partner violence, or are still in active situations. Most of the victims she sees can take emergency contraception after they finish the forensic exam, but for women in abusive relationships, some may already be pregnant from a prior assault by their partner. And they might not know it. Recently, a staff member on Bowles’ team was sitting with a woman during a rape kit exam when the advocate had to tell her she was pregnant. “This was actually the fifth time I believe that her partner had gotten her pregnant intentionally so that she would stay,” said Bowles, who works as the director of SAFE’s sexual assault victim advocacy program. Before Roe v. Wade fell in 2022, Bowles could connect victims with abortion clinics or even schedule an appointment for them. Now with a total abortion ban in effect in Texas, as well as a law criminalizing those who help people seeking care, Bowles has to tread extremely carefully. “It’s very difficult to think about, in that immediate moment, what we can and can’t talk about,” she said. “We’re very limited in the things that we can do if someone does find themselves in that situation because of the laws in Texas.” Since the Supreme Court repealed Roe, calls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline about reproductive coercion ― an umbrella term that includes when an abusive partner controls pregnancy outcomes, coerces someone into unprotected sex or tampers with birth control methods ― have doubled across the country. Pregnant women were already more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner in states where abortion was restricted before Dobbs, according to a new study published in the Journal of American College of Surgeons. With 21 states now severely restricting or banning abortion altogether, “This problem is only going to be exponentially worse,” said senior author of the study Dr. Justin Cirone, a trauma surgeon and assistant professor of surgery at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Millions of Texans are dealing with the repercussions of these bans, but victims of domestic violence are particularly vulnerable. An estimated 324,000 pregnant people are abused each year by an intimate partner, and research suggests that abortion access plays a critical role in reducing intimate partner violence. For some victims, pregnancy can mean an increase in the severity of violence. For others it can actually initiate abuse in a relationship that was not violent beforehand often because of the financial and emotional stress pregnancy can create. In Texas, specifically, calls citing firearms in situations of intimate partner violence have increased dramatically (47%) between 2022 and 2023. Adding a firearm into the mix increases the likelihood that the victim dies: Women are five times more likely to be killed in a situation of intimate partner violence if a gun is present. The Supreme Court could make it even easier for domestic abusers to access firearms legally sometime this year. Following SCOTUS’ unprecedented reinterpretation of the Second Amendment in 2022, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a conviction of a Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, who was found with several firearms despite a previous arrest for domestic violence. Under federal law, the protective order for domestic abuse against Rahimi stripped him of his right to possess the guns found in his home. The court of appeals overturned Rahimi’s conviction, ruling that the federal law violates people’s constitutional right to bear arms. The Supreme Court is set to make a decision in the case later this year. Gun reform advocates and anti-domestic violence groups have worked tirelessly to close what many refer to as the “boyfriend loophole” ― a statute in the Violence Against Women Act that has allowed unmarried partners who are convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence to buy or own firearms. The Biden administration narrowed the loophole but did not fully close it, though many states have their own laws banning convicted domestic abusers from owning guns. If SCOTUS sides with Rahimi, the consequences for victims of intimate partner violence will be deadly. “This [case] is essentially putting firearms into the hands of abusive partners and that equation means lethality for survivors,” Crystal Justice, the chief external affairs officer at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, told HuffPost. “Lives will be lost if the wrong decision is made in the Rahimi case.” Recently, Marta Peláez started noticing more and more pregnant women and mothers with newborns seeking services at her San Antonio organization, the Battered Women and Children’s Shelter. She kept hearing from staff that more women were coming in with babies, and they needed help getting necessities like diapers and formula. When Peláez looked at the intake data, there was a 12% increase in pregnant women or women with a baby under 12 months seeking services from 2022 to 2023. “To me, there is a big chance that this is because of their impossibility to get an abortion, plus the dynamics of how pregnancy plays a role in domestic violence,” she said. Peláez is witnessing firsthand what statisticians are finding in their research. Birth rates in states with abortion bans have increased since Roe fell, according to the Institute of Labor Economics. Texas had the largest birth rate increase in the country in 2023, in part because the state is so large and there are longer travel times to the nearest abortion clinics. The year before, Texas had nearly 10,000 more births than expected in the last nine months of 2022 ― correlating to the state enacting the six-week ban in 2021. When victims of intimate partner violence are forced to stay pregnant, they are likely to face more violence from their abusive partner and a heightened lethality of violence. Even if a survivor makes it through pregnancy and the postpartum period, and even if she’s able to escape at some later date, she’ll always be linked to her abuser through their child. Research suggests that abortion access helps reduce domestic violence. The Turnaway Study, landmark research published in 2020, followed 1,000 women over the course of 10 years and analyzed the long-term impact of abortion access. The study found that after 2 1/2 years, the women who were denied abortions were more likely to experience violence from the men involved in the pregnancies because they have ongoing contact with them, even if they are no longer in a romantic relationship. “You can’t trust your partner, you can’t ask someone for help, your neighbors are now hunting you ― it makes the entire world unsafe,” Lisa Pous, a survivor of intimate partner violence whose pronouns are she/they, told HuffPost. “How are we supposed to leave [our abusers]? What is the point of leaving?” “To me, these laws say that my government doesn’t care if I die, the same way my partner didn’t.” Pous was able to escape a 13-year abusive relationship in 2006 with the support of SAFE. Now, she’s the founder and director of the organization’s Survivor Peer Support program which offers emotional support and other resources to victims of intimate partner violence. The program works with 300 survivors every year, with a small but mighty staff of five, including Pous. Their time is spent speaking with people in active domestic violence situations as well as survivors who are trying to get back on their feet. When the state passed the six-week abortion ban in 2021, survivors were confused and scared. Pous and her staff organized several talking groups so that people could ask questions and discuss their feelings about the law. “We can’t tell the difference anymore between who’s harming us,” Pous said, referring to the Texas government and abusers. “To me, these laws say that my government doesn’t care if I die, the same way my partner didn’t.” Pregnant people who have the resources are traveling out of Texas to get abortion care. But victims of intimate partner violence don’t have the money or freedom to travel; financial abuse is present in 99% of domestic violence relationships. Those who try to find resources and travel support through abortion funds are taking tremendous safety risks if their abuser finds out. “The amount of times I’ve heard from clients who say, ‘He can’t know I had an abortion,’ or ‘I can’t have this child because I’ll be tied to this person forever,’ or ‘The last time I was pregnant, that’s when it was the worst.’ It was all the time,” said Anna Rupani, executive director at Fund Texas Choice, an abortion fund that offers travel support. It’s routine, Rupani said, to ask if it’s safe to call clients because so many are experiencing domestic violence. Cathy Torres told HuffPost sometimes her staff at the Frontera Fund will field calls where the client is whispering over the phone because her abuser is in the next room. The majority of Torres’ clients at Frontera Fund, an abortion fund based in the Rio Grande Valley, are undocumented, which brings its own set of barriers. “If someone is undocumented, abusers will say, ‘OK, I’ll call ICE on you or I’ll call customs,’” Torres said. “That has always been the case, always. But now they’re just emboldened.” Time and time again, interpretations of state law very rarely end up supporting the pregnant person. Last year, a Texas man used the state’s six-week abortion ban to bring a $1 million wrongful death suit against three women for allegedly helping his ex-wife self-manage an abortion. The husband was emotionally abusive, according to court documents, and routinely threatened the wife including promising to drop the lawsuit if she had sex with him. The three friends who helped the woman get abortion pills wrote in a countersuit that the ex-husband “did not file this lawsuit because he is interested in ‘protecting life’... Instead, he wanted to control a life.” Many victim advocates in Texas are now experiencing the same dreadful reality physicians are facing when it comes to abortion care: turn patients away, or give the standard of care and risk legal ramifications or the loss of funding. All of the people working in advocacy services that HuffPost spoke with were afraid of Texas law enforcement, and deeply concerned about confidentiality. “The biggest priority we have all the time is privacy and confidentiality,” one Texas advocacy worker, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid repercussions from the state, told HuffPost. “Now we’re being even more careful, we’re telling staff members: ‘Do you know about tracking devices on your phone?’ Because just the way we counsel people to be safe around their abusers, I feel like as an agency we have to do the same thing with our government now.” Dr. Leila Wood, a professor at the Center for Violence Prevention and School of Nursing at the University of Texas Medical Branch, said physicians and advocates are at risk of experiencing a concept called “moral injury.” “I see providers talking about the same thing in all of these pockets, which is the idea of: ‘I’m having to do something that is counter to my protective caring instincts with this vulnerable population’ or ‘I have to risk my own safety and security,’ and it’s a decision that people make differently,” said Wood, who has led statewide research on intimate partner violence in Texas. Bowles, the sexual assault advocate with SAFE, has a hard time getting victims to be forthcoming in those initial conversations after she tells them they’re pregnant from intimate partner rape. She’s always worried that the detailed medical records the forensic exam nurses take could be turned over to law enforcement for investigation if a pregnant rape victim contemplates abortion. Now, Bowles asks nurses to step out of the room before discussing next steps. “We’re not violating [Texas’ abortion ban] or S.B. 8 in those conversations, but we put so much more thought and caution into how we give information to survivors because of that risk,” Bowles said. Conversations with victims about reproductive health care could threaten an entire organization’s ability to help other victims. Many of the groups HuffPost spoke with don’t just provide anti-domestic violence services, they offer other critical community needs like housing and legal services for immigration or child custody disputes. “Our programs receive state and federal dollars. Drawing attention to these issues is not necessarily super safe for us,” said a former employee of a large anti-domestic violence nonprofit in Texas. Pous, the survivor of domestic violence who is now at SAFE, said many of the victims she works with feel trapped ― first by their abuser and now by their home state. She said it feels like a repetition of their entire life, working so hard to escape an abuser just to be met with more violence once they’re back on their feet. She’s proud of the work she’s doing, and she will continue to support survivors as best as she can, but she’s exhausted and worries for the future. “A lot of us really thought we were finding ways out of violence,” she said. “When the laws changed, we realized… we may never make it out.”",-0.128526170576569,0.294742135931388

The goats roamed the streets of Arlington after escaping from the enclosure in the Crystal Canyon Natural Area, a park where the city brought them to “help clear underbrush and other invasive plants” to reduce fire danger in the area, according to the Arlington Police Department. Body camera footage shared by police shows officers helping to wrangle the herd as goats evade them and head down the street in one neighborhood. “Oh, it’s a mess,” said one officer in the video as the herd darts off the road and onto grass past a police vehicle. “Go, goats, go back to where you came from, please. Who knew we were goat wranglers, now?” The goats trot down another road before being led off the street. The herd was eventually guided back to their enclosure, police said. Officials believed that “a runner or a jogger” may have let the goats go, KTVT reported. The herd is in the park as part of a partnership between the city and Open Space Development, a Texas company that says the goats “work exceptionally well in eradicating invasive species” in herds “professionally and humanely managed by a dedicated team.” The next four years will change America forever.

Trump’s past written comments about his “hands-on” approach to running his businesses and his frugality will be among four dozen quotes introduced as evidence against him, ABC News reported on Thursday. Prosecutors will use them to show how Trump wasn’t a hands-off executive who didn’t really know the finer details of his companies, said Weissmann. The case centers on payoffs that were made to porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal before the 2016 election to keep quiet over alleged sexual encounters with the then-reality TV personality. “What they want to show is he is a hands-on boss, that he is frugal, he watches every dime, that’s going to be theory of their case.

She Won't Talk To Me — What Can I Do?","judith sebesta","2024-03-01","I have always been fascinated by forgiveness. For something so fundamentally crucial to us flawed humans, understanding it seems daunting — a concept both complicated and nebulous. I’m also fascinated by “Sex and the City” (like so many other 40- to 50-somethings, I suspect). The series sometimes foregrounded forgiveness, as did the 2008 “SATC” film, in which both Carrie and Miranda face betrayal by their respective partners. Later in the film, Carrie discovers that Miranda withheld information from her about Big’s betrayal, and she — in current terms — ghosts Miranda. Soon after, Miranda confronts Carrie and begs for forgiveness. Carrie responds, “You badger me to forgive you in three days — and you won’t even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago.” When Miranda protests that it is not the same thing, Carrie counters simply, “It’s forgiveness.” But is it that simple? I always assumed so. I’ve also (upon reflection, somewhat self-righteously) prided myself on how freely I forgive, believing that doing so helps the offended as much as the offender. But then, I haven’t been on the side of needing forgiveness until recently, when I became responsible for the death of my sister’s beloved dog. My sister and her husband live three hours north of me. When they needed to attend a funeral in a city two hours south of me, I offered to watch their dog, Peggy Sue. She was recovering from an injury and needed more care than my sister’s pet sitter could give. I did not know Peggy Sue well, as she was a relatively recent addition to their family; extremely shy and timid, she rarely interacted with me when I visited. But I have always considered myself a huge dog lover, as well as an experienced dog guardian/sitter. In fact, when my sister and I were teens, we ran an informal neighborhood business, J&J Pet Sitting. And I have been a “dog mom” to multiple dogs in my adulthood, including my current golden retriever, Hudson. My sister and brother-in-law arrived on a Monday to drop off Peggy Sue. This was the first time that they visited my present home, but I had described my small yard and “see-through” iron fence — the bars of which were strong but vertical, spaced about 4 inches apart. My sister expressed some concerns about the fence, suggesting that I would need to keep her dog on a leash, and I agreed. However, upon arriving at my home, she reversed this advice, as it seemed physically impossible for Peggy Sue to squeeze through the bars. I imagine you can guess what happened. About two hours after my sister and her husband departed, I took Peggy Sue, sans leash, into my yard, staying close by her. My neighbor Fernando, walking by, stopped to ask if I had gotten a new dog after the passing, at the ripe old age of 18, of my second dog, Dinah, in April last year. As I began to answer, Peggy Sue shot through the bars of the fence — and was gone. My neighbor and I looked at each other, equally astonished. I felt rooted to the spot, horrified, but quick-acting Fernando took off after my sister’s dog. To try to defend the seemingly indefensible, I should point out that Dinah, who had been exactly the same size as Peggy Sue, never escaped the yard herself; in fact, none of the dogs I have had or cared for was an “escape artist.” I was unaware at the time that Peggy Sue was, or how desperately she would want to escape and, I assume, find my sister. The next two hours are a blur to me. I joined Fernando in chasing after Peggy Sue, who was faster and more elusive than I ever could have imagined possible. We saw the little dog run as far as a commuter train station across from my neighborhood, and an expansive parking lot between, before disappearing into an apartment complex to the east. For a time, she kept coming into view, eventually running back into my community and even, multiple times, near my house. But each time she darted away again. As word — both verbally and through social media — quickly got around my close-knit, very dog-friendly community, kind neighbors helped search, occasionally reporting sightings of her in and around the area, but they were unable to catch her. Crying by that time, I called my brother and sister-in-law, who live a few miles away, to assist in the search. However, as the sun began to set, reports of sightings dissipated and soon ended altogether. My heart sinking, I knew it was time to call my sister, who by that time had arrived at her destination with her husband. After our difficult conversation, they decided to return to my house, arriving just before midnight. I apologized profusely for what happened, and the next 48 hours were a frantic whirlwind of searching, posting on social media, and contacting shelters and rescues. I made flyers and hand-delivered them to veterinarians in the area, in case someone found Peggy Sue and brought her in to check for her microchip. When my sister, her husband and I were back at my house, we barely interacted. I sensed that it was best to give them privacy in the guest room downstairs; I was unsure how my sister felt about me and the part I played in this. But as I sat, alone and despondent, in the living room upstairs, her heartbreaking, hysterical crying left no doubt in my mind how she felt about losing her dog. I hated causing her such pain. By Wednesday morning, with no signs of Peggy Sue, my sister and her husband returned home. I was unsure what the plan moving forward was; we did not speak before they left. I continued to search the area and check social media. Then, late that afternoon, a neighbor messaged me on Discord. He saw what he thought was Peggy Sue’s body on the service road of a nearby highway. He warned me that “it was a very difficult image to see” and that “I would maybe call professionals to identify/recover due to her condition.” Ignoring his advice, I rushed to the area. If you had told me before that week that I would soon be recovering the body of a dog from a busy road — and then driving it for three hours to deliver it to my grieving sister — I would have told you that I was incapable. But it’s amazing what we discover we can do when we have to. I will spare you the details of identifying Peggy Sue’s body, of getting it into the back of my SUV, of finding a way to store it until I could leave the next day to take it to my sister. I knew that my only path to possible redemption was returning the body to my sister and giving her closure. So much that week felt out of control, so I turned to controlling the few things I could, as difficult as they were. When I arrived at my sister’s house, my brother-in-law was outside alone to meet me. He thanked me for bringing the body home — and asked me not to contact them. So I have honored that request. I have disappeared from my sister’s life, and she from mine. As the weeks turn into months, my hopes of reconciliation — of forgiveness — diminish. But isn’t there a difference between committing an act intentionally and doing something accidentally, as I did? Isn’t the latter worthy of forgiveness? Or, since the tragic result is the same, do I not deserve it? As I contemplate this possibility, I find myself considering just what forgiveness is, and what we do when it eludes us. The Mayo Clinic defines “forgiveness” as “an intentional decision to let go of resentment and anger,” adding: “Forgiveness means different things to different people. ... The act that hurt or offended you might always be with you. But working on forgiveness can lessen that act’s grip on you.” But this is entirely from the perspective of the offended. What about the offender, the unforgiven — like me? Could I lessen my act’s grip on me? A quick search online suggests that a therapist or spiritual adviser would urge anyone seeking forgiveness to review the situation, admit responsibility, apologize, forgive themselves, and have patience. These are things that you can control, and I have done all of them. Would I have done anything differently? Not in the aftermath of Peggy Sue’s escape — I was careful to ensure that I would have no regrets about my actions then — but before, I sure wish I had erred on the side of caution and kept Peggy Sue on her leash in my yard. But I can no longer control that. Coincidentally, soon after these events, the Amazon Prime Video series “Expats” dropped. I watched the first episode unaware of the focus of the show. The opening depicts snapshots of a doctor, three pilots and a 12-year-old boy, who are all responsible for accidental but fatal tragedies. The narrator intones: “These stories always focus on the victim. The person responsible for the calamity is never mentioned. ... But I want to know about the perpetrators. I want to know about the people who caused the tragedies. People like me. Are they ever forgiven?” Now I was “people like me.” I cried through the episode. I worry about how this is affecting other family members, namely my brother, my sister-in-law and especially my elderly father (my mom passed away in 2022) — if they feel caught in the middle. Thankfully we do talk, if not about my sister and the death of her dog, and our relationships seem undamaged. I think what I have been feeling is akin to grief. I think I have been experiencing some of its classic stages, including denial, anger and depression. I know that due to my culpability, I will not be afforded the kind of sympathy reserved for those not responsible for the cause of their grief. Still, I grieve. I grieve the loss of that sweet little dog, never again to enjoy my sister’s love and the pleasures of this life. A few well-meaning family members and friends have tried to console me with “it was just a dog” or “dogs are lost/hit by cars all the time.” But that logic fails to work on this dog lover, who as an adult has grieved the deaths of four of her own canine companions, albeit all in relatively old age. I grieve the loss of my sister, which perhaps I feel all the more keenly with my mom’s recent passing. Not quite “Irish twins” but still only 19 months apart, my sister and I have always had a special bond; besides our parents, one of whom now is gone, no one has known me as long, and she always seemed there to protect me. And I grieve the loss of who I was: someone who felt secure in the knowledge that I had never knowingly caused anyone grief. One of my favorite phrases is “it is what it is.” And so, unwillingly, I guess I must face the final stage of grief: acceptance. But as the character Red in one of my favorite films, “The Shawshank Redemption,” argues: “Hope is a good thing, maybe even the best of things. And good things never die.” I admit that I hope my sister sees this essay and it convinces her to forgive me or, at the very least, reach out to try to begin to repair our broken relationship. If nothing else, this essay has helped me process what happened and move through the stages of grief. But I also hope that, if others out there reading this have been through something similar and are silently suffering, they might feel less alone because of it.

Greg Abbott As Potential VP Pick","marita vlachou","2024-03-01","Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, said on Thursday that he is considering Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) as a potential running mate. In a joint interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump said the governor is “absolutely” included on his vice presidential shortlist. “Certainly, he would be somebody that I would very much consider,” Trump said in a joint appearance with Abbott. Trump praised Abbott as a “spectacular man,” adding that he was honored to receive his endorsement this past November. Abbott, though, told CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday that he remains focused on Texas and helping Trump win re-election in his current position as governor. “That means helping him find the right vice presidential candidate who will help President Trump get elected and then help him be successful when he does get elected,” Abbott said. “I think there’s so many people other than myself who are best situated for that.” Abbott also told CBS Wednesday he intends to run for re-election as his current term is set to expire in 2026. Asked who else is part of his VP shortlist, Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who withdrew from the GOP presidential race last year and has since campaigned with him, was another contender. “I mean, he was OK as a candidate, but he didn’t want to talk about himself. He’s a very good man,” Trump said, according to The Hill. “For me, he’s unbelievable. He’s a surrogate.” In a Fox News town hall earlier this month, Trump acknowledged Scott, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds (R), South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic presidential candidate who has since left the party, were all “solid” choices for him to consider. The next four years will change America forever.

Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) on Thursday dismissed House Republicans who have “tried and tried and tried and failed” to smear President Joe Biden ― especially when, Garcia said, the Trumps are “the real White House crime family.” Garcia criticized GOP lawmakers for their “political stunt” and “joke” impeachment inquiry against the president just one day after Hunter Biden’s closed-door deposition on his business dealings, which he said his father was not engaged in. Garcia –– who said Republicans have “zero evidence” tying Hunter Biden to any such dealings with his father –– delivered a message to GOP lawmakers as he spoke on the House floor next to a picture of Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, who both served as advisers in the Trump administration. “I want to remind everyone about the real White House crime family,” Garcia said of Kushner, former President Donald Trump’s son-in-law. He continued: “Why did Saudi Arabia give Jared Kushner $2 billion –– billion with a B –– just months after he left the Trump White House? And why did the Saudis spend hundreds of thousands of dollars at Trump properties while he was still the president?” Garcia has previously commented on the Saudi-backed private equity fund that gave $2 billion to Kushner’s investment firm six months after he left the White House. He continued: “We also know that Jared Kushner used his cushy White House job to secure a $100 billion arms deal for Saudi Arabia, and did other favors as well.

Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) should have charged a two-drink minimum for his roasting of Donald Trump while he questioned Hunter Biden in the impeachment inquiry this week. The congressman clearly wasn’t buying into House Republicans’ muddled efforts to prove that President Joe Biden illegally benefited from Hunter Biden’s business dealings when he was vice president. So Swalwell had some fun with it in the closed-door deposition. He skewered the previous White House occupant for nepotism, reported profiting off foreign governments while in office, and business deals that a court ruled were shady ― and worthy of hundreds of millions in fines. Here’s Swalwell’s exchange with Hunter Biden, according to the transcript released Thursday. SWALWELL: Any time your father was in government, prior to the Presidency or before, did he ever operate a hotel? BIDEN: No, he has never operated a hotel. SWALWELL: So he’s never operated a hotel where foreign nationals spent millions at that hotel while he was in office? BIDEN: No, he has not. SWALWELL: Did your father ever employ in the Oval Office any direct family member to also work in the Oval Office? BIDEN: My father has never employed any direct family members, to my knowledge. SWALWELL: While your father was President, did anyone in the family receive 41 trademarks from China? BIDEN: No. SWALWELL: As President and the leader of the party, has your father ever tried to install as the chairperson of the party a daughter-in-law or anyone else in the family? BIDEN: No. And I don’t think that anyone in my family would be crazy enough to want to be the chairperson of the DNC. SWALWELL: Has your father ever in his time as an adult been fined $355 million by any State that he worked in? BIDEN: No, he has not, thank God.

Navalny was buried at a cemetery in the snowy southeastern outskirts of the capital after a short Russian Orthodox ceremony, with vast crowds waiting outside the church and then streaming to the fresh grave of President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critic with flowers and anti-government chants. Although riot police set up barricades at both the church and cemetery, no detentions were reported. Navalny’s widow, Yulia, who was not seen at the funeral, thanked him for “26 years of absolute happiness.” “I don’t know how to live without you, but I will try to do it in a way that you up there are proud of me and happy for me,” she wrote on Instagram. The service followed a battle with authorities over the release of his body. His team said several Moscow churches refused to hold the funeral for the man who crusaded against official corruption and organized massive protests. Many Western leaders blamed the death on the Russian leader, an accusation the Kremlin angrily rejected. Navalny’s team eventually got permission from the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God Soothe My Sorrows, which was surrounded by crowd-control barriers. As his coffin was removed from the hearse and taken inside the church, the crowd waiting outside broke into respectful applause and then chanted: “Navalny! Navalny!” Some also shouted, “You weren’t afraid, neither are we!” and later “No to war!” “Russia without Putin!” and “Russia will be free!” Western diplomats, including U.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, were among those who attended, along with presidential hopefuls Boris Nadezhdin and Yekaterina Duntsova. Both wanted to run against Putin in the upcoming presidential elections and opposed his war in Ukraine; neither was allowed on the ballot. Images from inside the church showed an open casket with Navalny’s body covered with red and white flowers, and his parents, Lyudmila and Anatoly, sitting beside it. Navalny’s closest associates live outside Russia and made comments in a livestream of the funeral on his YouTube channel, their voices occasionally cracking with emotion. “Those people who follow what is happening, it is of course obvious to them that this man is a hero of our country, whom we will not forget,” said Nadezhda Ivanova of Kaliningrad, who was outside the church with other supporters. “What was done to him is incredibly difficult to accept and get through it.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged those gathering in Moscow and other places not to break the law, saying any “unauthorized (mass) gatherings” are violations. After the short church service, thousands marched to the nearby Borisovskoye Cemetery, where the police were also out in force. With the casket open, Navalny’s mother and father stroked and kissed his head. A large crowd gathered at the cemetery’s gates, chanting: “Let us in to say goodbye!” The coffin was then lowered into the ground. In keeping with his irreverent sense of humor, music from the “The Terminator 2” was played, a movie his allies said he considered “the best in the world.” Mourners streamed by his open grave, tossing handfuls of soil onto the coffin as a large crowd waited at the cemetery’s entrance. As dusk fell, workers shoveled dirt into the grave while Lyudmila Navalnaya watched. A mound of flowers, funeral wreaths, candles and a portrait of Navalny sat nearby. She had spent eight days trying to get authorities to release her son’s body following his Feb. 16 death at Penal Colony No. 3 in the town of Kharp, in the Yamalo-Nenets region about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscow. Even on Friday, the morgue where the body was being held delayed its release, according to Ivan Zhdanov, Navalny’s close ally and director of his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Authorities originally said they couldn’t turn over the body because they needed to conduct post-mortem tests. Navalnaya made a video appeal to Putin to release it so she could bury her son with dignity. Russian authorities still haven’t announced the cause of death for Navalny, who was 47. His team cited paperwork Lyudmila Navalnaya saw that listed “natural causes.” At least one funeral director said he had been “forbidden” to work with Navalny’s supporters, his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on social media. They also struggled to find a hearse. “Unknown people are calling up people and threatening them not to take Alexei’s body anywhere,” Yarmysh said Thursday. Navalny had been jailed since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow to face certain arrest after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. His Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his regional offices were designated as “extremist organizations” by the Russian government that same year. Yulia Navalnaya accused Putin and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin of trying to block a public funeral. “We don’t want any special treatment — just to give people the opportunity to say farewell to Alexei in a normal way,” she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Moscow authorities refused permission for a separate memorial event for Navalny and slain opposition leader Boris Nemtsov on Friday, citing COVID-19 restrictions, according to former presidential hopeful Duntsova. Nemtsov, a 55-year-old former deputy prime minister, was shot to death as he walked on a bridge adjacent to the Kremlin on the night of Feb. 27, 2015. Yarmysh also urged Navalny’s supporters around the world to lay flowers in his honor Friday. “Everyone who knew Alexei says what a cheerful, courageous and honest person he was,” Yarmysh said Thursday. “But the greater truth is that even if you never met Alexei, you knew what he was like, too. You shared his investigations, you went to rallies with him, you read his posts from prison. His example showed many people what to do when even when things were scary and difficult.” ___ More AP coverage of Alexei Navalny: https://apnews.com/hub/alexei-navalny By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/georgia-fani-willis-trump-case_n_65e1b213e4b013678e14da07","Legal Arguments To Begin Over Fani Willis' Future In Trump Case","kate brumback","2024-03-01","ATLANTA (AP) — After several days of extraordinary testimony, the judge in the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump is set to hear arguments Friday over whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be removed from the prosecution over a romantic relationship. Lawyers for Trump and other defendants in the election case argue Willis’ romance with a special prosecutor she hired creates a conflict of interest. They say Willis paid outside lawyer Nathan Wade large sums for his work and then improperly benefited when he paid for vacations for the two of them. Willis and Wade have acknowledged the relationship, which they said ended last summer, but they have argued it does not create any sort of conflict and has no bearing on the case. The pair said they didn’t begin dating until the spring of 2022, after Wade was hired, and that they split travel expenses. Since the relationship was revealed in early January, the subject dominating the court’s time and the public’s attention has not been the crimes prosecutors allege Trump and his allies committed while trying to overturn the election, but rather the intimate details of Willis and Wade’s relationship. The hearings have at times wandered into surreal territory: Atlanta’s mayor watching from the gallery as a former Georgia governor testified, Willis’ father talking about keeping stashes of cash around the house and details of romantic getaways. Willis’ removal would throw the most sprawling of the four criminal cases against Trump into question as the former president seeks a return to the White House. But it wouldn’t necessarily mean the charges against him and 14 others would be dropped. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee heard details of Willis and Wade’s personal lives and conflicting accounts of when they started dating, but it remains unclear whether he will find the relationship caused a conflict of interest that merits removing the prosecutors from the case. At a hearing preceding testimony, McAfee noted that under the law, “disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.” He said he wanted testimony to explore “whether a relationship existed, whether that relationship was romantic or non-romantic in nature, when it formed and whether it continues.” Those questions were only relevant “in combination with the question of the existence and extent of any personal benefit conveyed as a result of the relationship,” McAfee said. Georgia State University law professor Anthony Michael Kreis, who has followed the case closely, said a lot will depend on which standard McAfee uses: an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict. “The standard I think that’s applicable is an actual conflict of interest where the evidence produced shows that Fani Willis profited off the investigation and the charging decisions that she brought against the 2020 election interference defendants,” he said. Because Willis and Wade said the relationship ended before they sought an indictment in the election interference case, it’s hard to argue the due process rights of Trump and his co-defendants were violated, Kreis said. But if McAfee applies an “appearance of conflict” standard, that could mean trouble for Willis and Wade “because the shadow has been cast over the whole thing,” he said. If Willis and her office are disqualified, a nonpartisan council supporting prosecuting attorneys in Georgia would be tasked with finding a new attorney to take over. That person could either proceed with some or all of the charges against Trump and others, or drop the case altogether. Even if a new lawyer moved forward on the path charted by Willis, the inevitable delay would seem likely to lessen the probability of the case getting to trial before November’s presidential election when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee. A Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others in August on charges related to efforts to keep the Republican incumbent in power even though he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors, while Trump and 14 others have pleaded not guilty. Willis and Wade’s relationship was first exposed in a motion filed by an attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman that sought to have the indictment dismissed and to bar Willis and Wade and their offices from continuing to prosecute the case.

Lawyers for Roman, Trump and some of the other defendants in the election case repeatedly tried during last month’s hearing to prove the prosecutors were not being truthful about when their relationship began. Robin Yeartie, Willis’ former friend and employee, testified she saw the pair hugging and kissing long before Willis hired Wade. But Wade’s former law partner and onetime divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley, expected to be a key witness for lawyers trying to disqualify Willis, was at times evasive during testimony, saying he had “no direct knowledge of when the relationship started.” Trump’s attorneys filed an analysis of location data from Wade’s cellphone that they say supports the assertion Willis and Wade began dating before he was hired. An investigator’s statement says Wade’s phone was in the neighborhood south of Atlanta where Willis was living at least 35 times in the first 11 months of 2021. Wade had testified he visited Willis’ condo fewer than 10 times before his hiring.

Brown shared the “crazy story” with Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” Thursday. The “Stranger Things” star announced her engagement to Bongiovi, the son of musician Jon Bon Jovi, in April last year. Brown said she and Bongiovi had bonded over diving and got their diving licenses together, prompting his decision to propose to her under the sea. “We were on vacation and he was like ‘Mill, you gotta be up at 8 a.m., we’re going on a dive,’” she said. “So we go under, and we’re like many meters down, and he ... gives me like a shell, and I like turn it over, and it’s a ring,” she went on. Unable to speak underwater, Brown said she struggled to communicate that she was saying yes. He put the ring on her finger, and she tried to show it to him on her hand. “As I go to show him, the ring falls off my finger. Plummets, like so fast. It was like a cinematic movie,” she continued. She said Bongiovi “threw himself” into the deep in pursuit. “The diver was like, ‘You can’t do that,’ like your ears ― you literally, your brain will explode,” she said. “He does a cinematic, like, grab, opens, and he saved the ring,” she added. She said she felt the moment was a reflection of who he is, “and I feel like we’re always gonna have each other’s back, and if anyone drops the ball, we got it.” When they surfaced, Brown said, her fiancé explained that he had asked for her mom’s ring, but Brown’s mom had said “absolutely not,” predicting he would drop it. He gave her that ring above the surface. Watch the interview below.

But one look at the staggering (and growing) list of banned books will give you a sense of what those messages are: 1982’s “The Color Purple” by Alice Walker, a sprawling novel about a queer Black girl who overcomes decades-long physical and sexual abuse through the love and support of Black women. 2019’s “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe, an illustrated story of a young protagonist exploring their identity outside the binary. 2009’s “Tricks” by Ellen Hopkins, the tale of a group of teenagers who fall prey to drug use and turn to sex work. 2017’s “Dear Martin” by Nic Stone, the story of a Black teenage boy who’s wrongfully arrested and grapples with racial injustice and Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy. 2006’s “Sold” by Patricia McCormack, a story about a young girl who is sold into slavery in India. These narratives are not completely unrelated to many young readers’ real-life experiences — and a quick glance at the news or reading the words of young people themselves could confirm that. In “The ABCs of Book Banning,” the Oscar-nominated short documentary from directors Sheila Nevins, Trish Adlesic and Nazenet Habtezghi, young people reveal their frustrations with the draconian concept of restricting their access to literature. The argument from the adult side has often been that book bans, or rulings like the British Board of Film Classification’s recent decision to increase the rating of the 1964 family film “Mary Poppins″ from “U” for Universal to PG due to “discriminatory language,” are necessary to protect kids. But are either of these tactics effective in a world where many adults, including some parents and politicians like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, want to restrict knowledge of some aspects of history entirely? As evident in “The ABCs of Book Banning,” children are more aware of — and, in many cases, more directly impacted by — the world around them than they’re given credit for. Racial profiling, gender identity and LGBTQ rights are all themes of which they are already painfully aware. The film makes it increasingly clear that many children and teens can actually handle conversations about these topics. Some adults, though, are unwilling to have them, whether a movie comes with a “parental guidance” suggestion or not. Opponents of the bans, like teachers and authors, have railed against them, fearing they serve to limit the facts from young people and “control the narrative.” In February, the Washington Post reported that managers of an Asheville, North Carolina, bookstore took in eight tons of picture books restricted by the laws in Florida, which has the highest number of banned books in the U.S. They also managed to send some books to people in the Sunshine State who requested them. In “The ABCs of Book Banning,” Ridley, a 9-year-old student in Jacksonville, struggles to understand the decision to ban “And Tango Makes Three,” Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell’s 2005 illustrated book about two male penguins who welcome a child through another penguin’s egg. “It’s about two penguins that are gay with each other and, even though they have their differences from the other penguins, they could still have a child, take care of it,” Ridley said. “They could do pretty much everything but lay an egg. They’re still human.” What’s especially critical here is that Ridley is able to note the universality and humanity of an illustrated story that centers animals. “Everyone deserves these beautiful books; to read, to learn, etcetera,” Ridley continues. “They teach them about culture, what they can be. They should be able to be what they want to be. But they can’t be without knowing what it means.” Kierran, 15, reckons with what it means to ban author Art Spiegelman’s 1986 graphic novel, “Maus,” detailing a character’s experience in the Holocaust. “I feel like if you’re trying to ban this book, you’re trying to ban Jewish history,” Kierran says plainly. “That’s like saying, ‘Well, this didn’t happen,’ which will probably just eventually lead to the same thing happening again because people don’t know it even happened in the first place.” Then the teen gets right to the meat of the issue: “Because you’re stealing knowledge. Why would you want to steal knowledge?” Kierran’s final question, to which there’s no response, lingers long after the film ends. If adolescents are able to properly discern queer themes, concentration camps and the potential of history repeating itself, they might be open to a dialogue around why, say, “hottentots” is a prejudicial term. That’s the word young “Mary Poppins” viewers encounter twice in the Disney film, and for a long time it was deemed entirely acceptable by a racist white Hollywood. It’s a racial slur historically targeting the Khoekhoe, an Indigenous people from South Africa. The word is uttered by Admiral Boom (Reginald Owen), a supporting character. To be fair, the movie’s increased rating is deserved. It also creates a vital opportunity for adults to talk to young people about why the term is so harmful. Leshu Torchin, a senior lecturer of film studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, recently told The New York Times that the new rating indicates that “children could watch a film, and if not with their parents to help contextualize things, could come away either thinking certain language is OK, or come away from it feeling harmed by what they’ve just seen.” That makes sense, in theory. But considering many adults’ efforts to outright restrict children and teens from learning history (or even present-day events) as depicted accurately in books, it’s hard to feel confident that those conversations will happen in many homes. Poet and author Nikki Giovanni, who appears in “The ABCs of Book Banning,” believes no book or hateful term should be restricted at all. That includes her own, 2005’s “Rosa,” a children’s picture book about activist Rosa Parks that has been subject to bans. “To ban it is to give it power over you,” she says. “There’s no word that should have power over you. If it’s a word, you can use it. Everyone may not like it. Everybody may not want to hear it. But you can’t give a word a power. Words have to be free.” Giovanni then puts the onus on the consumers: “We’re the ones that have to decide what to do with the words that we’re hearing and the words that we’re saying.” There’s woefully been no consensus around what that decision should be. It feels like every year now in our evolving social climate adults keep bumping into new ways to contend with or simply erase these issues, particularly when it comes to art for kids and teens. In 2021, Disney+ made the conscious choice to add a disclaimer to 18 episodes of “The Muppet Show” that contain culturally insensitive images. So the streamer maintains the episodes and its TV-G rating that suggests it’s suitable for all audiences, but encourages essential dialogue for educational purposes. Part of that warning reads as follows: “Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.” That seems more effective, assuming adults go on to have those conversations, than, say, revising inappropriate text and imagery, as the late Roald Dahl’s estate did with his children’s books just last year. As Kierran said, attempts to erase history are counterproductive. You can confront it, discuss it and try to prevent it from happening again. Because what’s to stop kids from learning and using offensive terms on their own if 1) they don’t know they’re offensive or 2) don’t understand their historical context? And what message does it send to kids when many books that are considered problematic — among a staggering 3,362 cases, according to PEN America last year — are usually ones that don’t center white, cisgender, and/or straight characters and storylines? Their themes might be uncomfortable for some. But that’s not the same as being harmful. And that lack of distinction could have a detrimental impact on young readers. “By putting restrictions on who gets to claim shelf space, school boards are telling marginalized kids — especially those who are LGBTQ+ and/or kids of color — that their very existence is invalid,” Pooja Makhijan reported in Parents magazine last year. “That’s exactly what these book bans are meant to imply.” At a time when media literacy is devastatingly low, we should be bolstered by the fact that many children and teens are hungry for information, historical narratives and stories from people who both share and don’t share their experiences. The more they learn, the more inquisitive and vocal they are. That should be encouraged and engaged with, not dismissed, which would only result in a new generation of ignorance. “If you were the person who helped ban this book, why?” Yeye, 9, asks about “Rosa” in “The ABCs of Book Banning.” “Do you feel like Rosa Parks is a bad person? Do you think that people should not know about her legacy? Why do you choose to do this?

Her husband, Michael, works at an IT firm. Annual household income: $230,000 Monthly household take-home pay: $9,700 Monthly child care costs: $4,000 for the nanny, plus $1,600 for two weeks of summer camp, and $160 per month for membership to an infant gym where kids can be dropped off.

I’m checking my computer at least until 7:40 p.m. And that’s an improvement, whereas last year, I was working till 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. two to three times a week. “When people want you to go back into the office, it’s also, ‘Well, do you expect me to stay in the office those hours?’ The type of job that I work, people can be done trading, but my books or my risk assessment-type tasks are not done. The traders or the salespeople are gone, [but] we still need to clean and tidy and prepare for the next day. So it’s definitely a balance.” Her husband’s hours are shorter. “I’m required to work probably eight to nine hours a day. He only has to work seven, and then three days out of those five he only has to work six. He can also flex his time. In his industry, he’s not required [to do] overtime or stay late.

It’s a give and take to just make sure it’s balanced for our kids or us, because it is a lot to manage.” Child care arrangements: “We have a full-time nanny right now, which is just amazing.” Maloney’s husband leaves early for work, and Maloney is with the kids from around 6 a.m. - 9 a.m., when the nanny arrives. The nanny stays with the children until 3 or 3:30 p.m., when their father returns from work. The family has only had the nanny since Maloney returned to work from her maternity leave after having the twins. When they had their first child, “My girlfriend was pregnant at the same time, and her abuela watched our son. We loved that.” He ended up at a nearby Montessori school, and his younger brother followed him there after a brief stint in a day care center. “When Josie [their eldest daughter] came home [from the hospital] and I was on maternity leave, I was like, ‘Look, let’s just bring [the boys] home. We can save money.’ And I was actually debating quitting and just becoming a stay-at-home mom. I think the reason I went back [was] because Josie was born in 2020 and she was a COVID baby. So when I went back [to work], there was no talk of me having to go into the office, and I was like, ‘This is amazing. We’ll just make that work.’ I worked from home with them, with some help here and there, but mostly it was me and them for a year to maybe two years.” Maloney described what this period of working from home looked like: “I baby-wear, I breastfeed, I have a standing desk, and we raised our children to be independent but not unattended. I would be baby-wearing while on a call, and I could make my kids breakfast. We would do home-school in the morning and then they would go out. I also had neighbors’ support, so like the neighbor [might] help and take them for a walk. Then my husband came home early, because he didn’t take his full paternity leave. He would be home at noon, so I was really only working for four or five hours by myself. That was the first year. Then from there, the kids and I and Josie, we all had just like a schedule and it actually worked really well for us.” Given the circumstances, her managers were supportive. “It’s not like people didn’t know that they were home. It was in the midst of COVID. Our baby was born with several heart problems. She would be more susceptible to have a severe reaction to COVID, so my managers were all aware. I was like, ‘Look, they’re home because it’s not safe. And that’s that.’” Eventually, Maloney sent her daughter to the same Montessori school her sons had attended. “She really liked it.” “When I had the twins, I did the same thing. I was like, ‘OK, I’m done. I’m staying home.’ It’s actually a running joke. Every time I have a kid, I’m like, ‘All right, I’m not going back to work, not doing it.’ At the end of my maternity leave, I was like, ‘Hey, let’s try just a little bit.’” Maloney had imagined she’d feel comfortable stepping away from her job once she had accumulated six figures in her retirement account, a goal she has now surpassed, but the family had just purchased a home that needed much more renovating than they initially anticipated, so going back to work seemed to make sense. While she pays the nanny more than she takes home with her paycheck, Maloney saves “aggressively” and uses FSA and HSA accounts. The family’s insurance also comes through her job. While the dollars don’t seem to add up, her financial contribution to the family remains substantial. For now, she said, “I’m just gonna keep working and just manage expectations on what our dream life would be.” Maloney’s husband had a stay-at-home mom, but “I didn’t grew up in a household like that. My mom, my dad — my grandmother worked until she was 70. The idea of not working, to me, is baffling.” Yet she can still imagine a point in the future where she cares for the children full time and runs “hobby businesses ― business that we’re not dependent on, but I’ll still have something to structure my mind.” Then again, when she imagines the future costs of her kids’ braces and their college education, it’s difficult to imagine making do with less income. “Sometimes like when I’m having a bad day or I’m like, ‘What am I doing?’ I just need to remember, I’m a mom that’s working. I’m not a working mom.” Her kids have always been the first priority. When she returned to work after having her first, she negotiated being able to leave the office at 3 p.m. in order to pick up her son, completing the rest of her work from home. “I was able to just go in, work till 3, get most of my structured reports done, and then pick my son up, or have my husband pick my son up, and still be a part of dinner and bedtime.” “I know that my priorities are always going to be my family. It’s just being able to say to someone, ‘This is not healthy or worth the struggle. The chokehold of this job is not worth my family’s dynamic of what we value and what we need.’” Maloney’s leave with the twins coincided with summer, so the family spent time last year vacationing and camping together. She decided not to pay her daughter’s preschool tuition again that fall, and all the children have been at home ever since. (The older two boys are home-schooled.) When her husband’s paternity leave ended in October of 2023, they hired the nanny. While the nanny enables her to work, Maloney said, “I’m still a mom while working. It’s not like when I’m home I’m not participating. I’m the default parent in a lot of aspects. I’m the rule setter, I’m the home-school planner. I am that parent. To some extent, I feel like mentally it’s about the same as if I was at home with three kids. And to some people, that’s probably crazy.” It was a bit easier during the lockdown, when others were understanding of small, child-related interruptions in the workday. Maloney says she has noticed that there is less patience for these now. It’s harder to pretend that she doesn’t hear the conversation happening right outside the door to her home office. “When people understood that I was processing two conversations it was much easier to be like, ‘OK, one minute. Let me just talk to this [person] and handle that, and I’ll be with you.’ It was a lot more grace and understanding, and just flexibility.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

People just say the most inappropriate things to us, it’s crazy.” Once, a stranger asked her husband if he was sure the children were all his. Others have insinuated that the family must rely on government assistance. “I feel like a lot of people don’t see when you have large families, the sacrifices you make at the beginning of your marriage before you even have those kids. Most of our friends still have student loans. There’s a lot of debt going on. They don’t rearrange their entire life to just be debt free. That’s a lot of freaking work.” Maloney and her husband did that work, and now, she says, “When our kid needs ear tubes put in or another kid who grows like a freaking weed [and] needs to buy new shoes, or cleats — all of that stuff.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. For those who have them, ingrown toenails need little introduction. They occur when the corner of the nail grows and curves into the skin, the result of too-tight shoes, incorrect trimming or injury to the nail. They cause inflammation that is notoriously uncomfortable: Ingrown nails can make it painful to simply wear shoes, and even cause pain when the affected nail so much as brushes against bedsheets. Discomfort from ingrowns can permeate even banal aspects of everyday life, and as a result, many folks with ingrown toenails learn to simply live with this inflammation and pain. I spent years hoping-slash-deluding myself into believing that my own ingrown big toenails, caused by years of too-tight cleats and heels, were not that disruptive to my life and would eventually improve on their own. Yet one day last year, I brushed one of my ingrowns against my carpeted floor and found myself doubled over in pain. I was forced to acknowledge that my ingrowns were not sustainable, and they were not going to get better by themselves. I combed the internet for the best home treatment for ingrowns, and found the CurveCorrect ingrown toenail treatment kit on Amazon. I’m protective over my money and was wary of spending $45 for the kit, but after reading through testimonials from reviewers who, too, were initially skeptical but were ultimately “gobsmacked” and “delighted” at its results, deeming it “worthy every penny,” I decided to take the plunge — and I’m so happy that I did. The kit is designed to treat and correct the root of the problem: a nail that is literally growing and curving incorrectly. It works by using thin tension braces, which act like springs, to slowly and gently straighten the nail. The brace also relieves pressure from the ingrown, helping ease discomfort within days, according to CurveCorrect and the experience of myself and many reviewers. The brace attaches to the affected nail using a high-bond adhesive. “For a simple, non-infected toenail that tends to become ingrown near where the nail grows out beyond the nail bed, this type of product could be helpful,” Dr. Howard E. Friedman, a podiatrist at Suffern Podiatry in New York State, told HuffPost. Of course, it’s always a good idea to visit a podiatrist if you’re experiencing pain from an ingrown toenail. If your ingrown is particularly severe, it will require surgery or an in-office procedure in order to correct it. You should not opt for home treatment if your ingrown shows signs of an infection, fungus or open wound, or if your nail has extreme curvature (greater than 180 degrees). In addition, folks with limited mobility may benefit from a second person’s help to apply the brace. The kit is not suitable for children under 8 years old. For more information, check out CurveCorrect’s website. For my purposes, I found the CurveCorrect brace to be a game-changer. Within a week of applying the brace, my ingrowns had noticeably improved and flattened. A year later, after having worn the braces for several months, I still can’t quite believe how much better my nails feel and look. Both my big toes are now even and flat, and they don’t hurt anymore, which feels like something of a miracle. Before applying the brace, I — and many reviewers — recommend that you read and re-read the instructions. The home treatment is simple enough, but should be done carefully. The main thing to keep in mind is not to push your nail to correct too quickly, so you should err on applying the brace toward the wider end of your toenail to start, where the brace will be longer and thus hold less tension. Very slight discomfort is normal when you first apply the brace, but pain is not normal. If pain does occur, take the brace off immediately. Then, if you want to continue, apply the brace with less tension — cut it longer — and apply it further down your nail, towards the wider end of the nail. As for preventing future ingrowns? “The best prevention is to allow the corners of the nails to extend beyond the nail fold and cut the nail straight across. Most ingrown nails that I see are due to people who cut the nail too short,” said Friedman over email. “Only ballerinas and sprinters need short toe nails.” Check out what reviewers have to say about the CurveCorrect kit, or grab your CurveCorrect kit now from Amazon. “I wish I’d taken a ‘before’ picture...these strips works exactly as I hoped (but doubted) they’d work! They take a little practice to get on just right. You need a steady hand, a bright light, and a gentle squeeze on the glue bottle so you don’t apply too much glue. If you get the strip applied properly, it’ll last a week or two before it comes off. They do stay a little “catchy” on the ends, even with filing, so I apply a bandaid over the strip to make sure my socks don’t catch and encourage the strip to come loose. My big toes had such a tight curl at the end that the corners were nearly meeting in the middle. After wearing for only a few days there was a noticeable change. After a week or week and a half, the nail has a very natural gentle curve at the end. I’ll wear the strip/brace until it reaches the end of the nail. I may reapply another strip closer to the nail bed to encourage correct growth until I feel certain that my nails won’t revert back to the curve. The strips don’t hurt to wear and have relieved any pain from the nails biting into my toes. I can’t be any happier with this product!!!” — Michelle  “I don’t gush about products, and am hesitant to believe gushy, exclamation point laden reviews. But this darned little system worked for mr, almost instantly. Advice - read the various reviews that go into detail re what to expect and best way to succeed. I am elderly, stiff of joint, too much belly, and can’t see worth beans. I read reviews, read through the instructions twice, and set up a sort of dry run to see where I might run into trouble. If you can possibly find one, get a helper. BUT, it can be done alone if you follow the directions. When placing the first glue laden end of the brace strip, I advise starting with the side of your toenail that is more difficult to see and reach. My ingrown nail on the big toe hurt a lot at each corner where the nail was digging in as well as on the bottom of the toe. In less than an hour after the brace was glued into place, nothing hurt. I kept poking and squeezing, not quite willing to believe. This was a toe that was so sore that even the sheet on it would increase the pain. Shoes were limited to thongs and clogs. Three days after I applied the little strip, I went for a pedicure, fully expecting the brace strip to fall off in the swirling foot bath. Nope. The tech filed down the blunt ends a bit then treated the nail like the other nine. 52 hours later and all is well.” — Stephanie L. “I highly recommend this product. I learned about it online and had only other reviews to convince me if it works or not. I took the chance and I am so glad I did. My guess is you will be, too, but they have a satisfaction guarantee so it’s really no risk. I always thought the shape of my toes was just one of those things that I couldn’t change about myself and that occasional pain & pressure from my toenails getting longer was inevitable. I put these braces on two days ago. Within 2 hours on the first day I could already feel tremendous relief on my left foot- like the edge of my toenail was being gently lifted away from my toe...not at all painfully the way it feels when something is beneath the nail pushing it up. I wore socks and shoes yesterday and the braces didn’t snag or feel uncomfortable. I didn’t know if I got the edges all the way glued down so I was worried, but they were fine. Today I can feel the differences on both feet, and my left foot already seems like I have a whole different toenail shape. It used to start wide at the base and then get narrower toward the tip but now it’s the same width all the way up and I am 100% PAIN FREE for the first time in probably 10 years.The difference is so noticeable that I’ve come to realize my former version of “normal” was actually barely tolerable and I’d simply grown accustomed to it. I hate that it took me this long to find a product that could help. But I also LOVE that this product exists.” — Julie H. “I was very dubious about this product initially. I’ve had ingrown toenails on both big toes for around 15 years and I’ve tried everything in the past including removing both nails, seeing podiatrists etc, all whom have said the only way to fix permanently was to have the ingrown part surgically removed to stop that area of the nail growing back. Whilst this may seem like a good option for some, I just didn’t want to have narrow big toenails, so I declined each time and carried on with my severely curved nails. As the ingrown part did not hurt I guess I just put up with it! Last year my nails also started to grow ridged and very thick, which was awful for me and I needed to come up with another plan. After researching loads of products/tools/creams/remedies etc I came across this product and thought I’d give it a go. I was not disappointed. In fact I was shocked at how good it has worked. I’ve needed to use 3 times (on both toes), but after just the first time i could see huge improvements in just a couple of weeks. The strips stayed on for around 4-5 weeks each time, and now I can say for the first time in years and years, I finally have semi-flat big toe nails and I’m DELIGHTED with this product. I had to pay for shipping to the UK as the product is not available here, but it was worth every penny. I just wish I had found it years ago. Be patient with the process, follow the instructions VERY CAREFULLY, in fact read them over and over before you start and it will make sure the application works and fits first time. Don’t hesitate, this product has changed everything for me, I can now wear pretty open toed shoes and sandals without embarasment for the first time in over a decade. Very Happy.” — Mrs P By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Exercise is good for many different reasons. It directly affects all of the factors that go into a long, healthy life — mobility, heart health, brain health, muscle strength and more, said Jonathan Zins, a physical therapist at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. Exercise also contributes to the cycle of healthy aging. And, according to experts, there are a few types you should do if you are hoping to boost your longevity. Here’s what they are: Cardiovascular exercise — like running, biking, dancing, boxing and more — is full of benefits that can help you age well. Cardiovascular activity focuses on strengthening your heart. “Nothing else really can strengthen it better than a cardio workout,” said Sandra Corcione, a personal trainer at FITloft Gym in New Jersey. Specifically, aerobic exercise can lower your risk for heart disease (which is the No. 1 killer of American adults). It also helps lower blood pressure and your risk of diabetes, which are two heart disease risk factors. Beyond this, cardiovascular exercise also is good for brain health, Zins said. “The brain responds very quickly to exercise. Just three hours of aerobic exercise a week can greatly increase brain perfusion — so, getting more blood supply up to the brain and reducing inflammation.” Working out may even help prevent some cases of dementia, Zins noted. In fact, according to the U.K.-based Alzheimer’s Society, you can reduce your risk of dementia by roughly 28% by doing regular exercise. When doing aerobic exercise, you want to be out of breath, Zins added. Your heart rate should be at 60% to 80% of your heart rate max, which can be calculated online or through a fitness tracker. For example, if your max heart rate is 185 beats per minute, a heart rate of 111 to 148 would put you in that 60% to 80% target. Or you can do the “talk test” to determine where your heart rate is. “If you’re having difficulty having a conversation because you have to take lots of breaths to get your oxygen supply up, that’s a good sign that you’re working at a moderate to vigorous intensity. But if you’re able to have a conversation... you know the intensity is really not high enough,” Zins said. “Weightlifting helps you maintain bone mass, bone density and muscle mass,” according to Corcione, which are three areas known to deteriorate as you age. What’s more, strength training can help with falls, which are an unfortunate reality for many older people. “The reason why falls are so bad is because we can get broken bones,” Zins explained. “An 80-year-old is estimated to have about 40% of the muscle strength as a 20-year-old, but that’s not just because our muscles magically disappear when we get older. A lot of that is because we stop moving when we get older, and we stop using our muscles.” “There’s a very well-established body of evidence saying that progressive resistance training is safe and effective in older adults,” he continued. If you’ve never lifted weights before, he suggests working with a health care professional to get started safely. Additionally, you can look into strength training classes in your community. Experts can help you determine the right weight for you to lift. Something too light won’t challenge you, while something too heavy could lead to injury. “Falls are the greatest cause of [injury-related] death in folks over 65 and 1 in 3 older adults are going to fall every single year,” Zins said. Falls can also lead to impaired mobility in older folks, “and when we’re not mobile, we’re not able to live our lives how we want to,” he added. “Mobility is essential for living a good life.” Exercise helps keep you mobile and, specifically, balance training can be an effective way to avoid falls. Balance training is varied but can include activities like tennis, standing on one leg and tai chi, Zins said. However, it’s important that you don’t dive into balance training if you are older or feel like your balance is already off. “I would say go to a physical therapist, where they can give you an individualized plan, and then follow that up with just a community exercise class that works specifically on balance,” Zins explained. “Because nobody wants to be fearful of losing their balance when they’re in the comfort of their own home.” Social connection is a major part of aging well and living a long life, Zins stressed. When compared to people who live with family or in a community, people who live alone live shorter lives. If you can join an exercise class in your community, you’ll benefit not only from the exercise, but from social connection, too. In reality, many folks don’t like certain workouts — whether it’s strength training or balance work or aerobic exercise — and don’t do exercise at all as a result.

Whatever activity keeps you moving regularly and consistently is the workout you should prioritize. Don’t let a distaste for strength training keep you from exercising altogether. If you like dancing, do that. Or if you are a fan of running, do that. No matter what you decide to do, it’s important to commit to enough exercise each week. “Our catchphrase is 150 plus two, so 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise, plus two days of strength training is going to be the recommendation,” Zins said. “The key here is to stay consistent with that activity ... the gains happen when you consistently do something for years and throughout your life, even as you get older,” Corcione noted.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/beauty-influencers-transparent-costs-of-procedures_l_65dcdcebe4b0e4346d53575b","These Beauty Influencers Are Getting Real About The Costs Of All Their Procedures","brittany wong","2024-03-01","Last month, a video went viral showing aesthetician nurse Miranda Wilson pointing out every cosmetic procedure she had done in 2023. In the clip, the 30-year-old beauty influencer says she had Botox twice last year ($1,000 total), masseter Botox once to achieve a more defined jawline ($1,200), two lip flips ($100 each) and traptox ― or Barbie Botox, as it’s been called ― once ($1,600), for shoulder slimming and tension relief. Wilson then moves on to injectables: She gets Volbella lip injections once a year to maintain her lip shape ($650) and two vials of Sculptra injected to restore volume in her face ($1,600 total). Lastly, to rejuvenate her skin, three or four times a year she gets vampire facials, which involve taking a sample of your own blood, extracting the plasma and then injecting it back in your face with microneedling. (The treatment, less frighteningly called microneedling with PRP, runs anywhere from $500 to $1,300 per session.) The video received more than 1 million views ― and a wide range of reactions. Though some applauded Wilson for her transparency, others said they found the endless upkeep inherent in such a beauty regimen to be “incredibly sad.” “This woman (absolutely gorgeous) is the perfect example of when men say a woman is ‘naturally beautiful’ but really they’ve had all of these procedures,” one person wrote of the clip on X (formerly Twitter). This woman (absolutely gorgeous), is the perfect example of when men say a woman is “naturally beautiful” but really they’ve had all of these procedures. pic.twitter.com/c2nB5UjaGr Wilson isn’t the only one lifting the veil on costly med-spa procedures. Along with influencers, celebrities including Kylie Jenner and Ariana Grande all fessed up to lip fillers and Botox in the last year. (Jenner doing so after years of vehemently denying she’d ever touched her face.) Though the admissions are relatively small ― no one is admitting to a Brazilian butt lift (BBL), a BBL reversal (yes, they have those now) or a face-lift ― it’s a welcome relief after years of celebrities either denying having work done or chalking their youthful appearances up to a skin care product they’re promoting or upping their water consumption. (Or, in Olivia Munn’s case, lots of water and Japanese potatoes.) Dawn Montieth is among the influencers getting frank about her noninvasive cosmetic procedures. An aesthetic injector in Southern California with more than 78,000 followers on TikTok, Montieth said she created her “What I’ve Had Done” video because she didn’t want to gatekeep procedures. Being honest with her followers also felt more ethical than pretending her perfect skin and taut jawline were simply the results of miracle beauty products you could find at Sephora. “When you’re on social media, it’s easy to get caught up in the allure of flawless influencers, but it’s crucial to remember that what we see is often just the highlights and not the full picture,” she said. Many influencers who undergo treatments stay quiet about them to preserve the lucrative deals they have with beauty brands; if you mention that you just got $600 worth of Restylane lip filler and then hawk a $30 “plumping” lip gloss the next day, you might as well kiss any future brand deals or sponsorships goodbye. But Montieth thinks most influencers ― and celebrities ― who are tight-lipped are just self-conscious and worry about the judgment they’ll receive if they’re frank about cosmetic work. “That’s why I wanted to create a safe and honest space to openly share my experiences,” she said. “By shedding light on these topics, I want to empower others to make informed choices about their own beauty journeys.” (Of course, given her line of work, it’s also good for business to promote such procedures.) Sabryna Salmon, a 30-year-old content creator from Los Angeles, created a two-part series pointing out the procedures she had done before turning 30: Kybella under her chin and knees cost $500 or $600, but it was worth it, she says in one clip. Sculptra to get a rounder butt was definitely not worth it, since it requires around 10 sessions at $900 a pop. Salmon sees her videos as part of the de-influencing trend on TikTok: Since last year, many influencers have started creating videos in which they dissuade their followers from buying certain cult-favorite products they personally find subpar. “Some of these procedures can be expensive!” Salmon told HuffPost. “I’d hate to see anyone waste their hard-earned money.” She added, “I’m certainly not promoting anything, just lifting the veil on the reality of beauty procedures; at my heart I’m just a girl’s girl and happy to share.” #cosmeticprocedures #ipllaser #fillersinjection #botox Penny Gsell, a 27-year-old from Philadelphia, spends around $600 a year on procedures. In her “What I’ve Had Done” video, she rated the treatments on a scale of 1 to 10. At 9/10, lip filler is “a must.” “They’ve completely changed my confidence,” she says in her clip. Septorhinoplasty to straighten her nose and improve nasal breathing got a mere 5/10. Gsell said her goal is to remind young girls that what they see on their Instagram feeds can be just as deceptive as what she’d see in Teen Vogue and Cosmo when she was growing up and impressionable: Size 1 or 2 models whose photos were edited to the nth degree, even though they didn’t need it. “When I grew up and learned about cosmetic procedures, I knew that if I was to ever get anything done that I would never want a little girl to look at me and think, ‘I’ll never look like her’ or compare herself to me without knowing that I’ve had work done,” she told HuffPost. “I always like to add the disclaimer that what I speak about only pertains to me and work I’ve had done. Everyone is beautiful, and no one needs to have work done.” Gsell also wants to dispel the idea that people who get work done are “fake” or insecure. “You live one life in one body,” she said. “I believe if you want to get something done to your one body to make yourself feel the best you can in your one life, then you should absolutely be able to do so without judgment.” We are all about transparency so let me know what questions you have! #cosmeticprocedures #honestreviews #greenscreen Briana Merriweather, a 30-year-old from Alabama, made a video on her procedures for the same reasons as Gsell. (She told HuffPost she spent about $8,000 on various procedures last year.) “I used to compare myself to women on Instagram and feel so inadequate,” she said. “I’m committed to making sure my presence doesn’t make others feel inferior.” Her hope is that her honesty will inspire more influencers to be candid about their own cosmetic procedures. “Even those who may not appear to have had any work done are likely utilizing treatments like Botox,” she said. #greenscreen #fyp #beauty #beautytok #2023 #beautyprocedures #cosmeticprocedure #cosmetic #aestheticprocedures #girls #filler #veeners #teethehitening #viral #beforeandafter #tiktokshop An argument could be made that these videos are largely positive, helping to reset people’s ideas of reality so they’re not fooled by every Instagram model they see: These influencers are naturally beautiful, yes, but thousands of dollars worth of treatment certainly helps, too. There’s a reason those collages featuring pics of celebrities before and after plastic surgery are so popular: “You’re not ugly, you’re just poor,” the caption dependably reads ― this generation’s “maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s Maybelline.” People want reassurance that the 10s they see online are genetically gifted, just not that genetically gifted. But a case could also be made that influencers are normalizing these kinds of intensive treatments, setting already sky-high beauty standards even higher with each new viral procedure: fox eye lifts, buccal fat removal, Barbie Botox, lip flips ― the list of Instagram Face micro-adjustments you can get, with a Groupon discount, no less, grows by the day. In light of the “growing social acceptance” of such noninvasive procedures, plastic surgeons say demand for such treatments are at an all-time high; there was an increase of 26.2 million nonsurgical procedures, like lip fillers and Botox, performed in the United States last year alone. “There are definitely two sides to this trend,” said Charlotte H. Markey, the director of the Health Sciences Center at Rutgers University, Camden, and the author of “The Body Image Book for Girls.” “On the one hand, it can be helpful for people to see that the beauty they see online is not natural, that it’s a result of procedures,” she told HuffPost. “On the other hand, it can easily lead people, especially vulnerable people, to feel like their bodies are projects and that there’s a never-ending list of things they need to ‘fix.’” Because these procedures are priced more reasonably than, say, breast enhancements or liposuction, the allure of getting one (or five) is even stronger. In some ways, it levels the playing field, said Jess Sprengle, a licensed professional therapist who specializes in treating eating disorders. The mysteries of poreless skin, perfect facial balance and perfect teeth aren’t such mysteries when one influencer has unpacked the procedures she’s had done to achieve the look: Fraxel laser treatment, rhinoplasty, dermal fillers, veneers and the rest of it. “You might see a perfect-looking photo of someone and think, ‘Oh, I remember that X said they get procedures done, and it seems like this is common. I’m not going to look that way because I’m not getting those procedures,’” Sprengle said. “Of course, in the photo, they could also be using a filter.” Still, Sprengle wishes that as a culture, we could explore our obsession with youth and aesthetic perfection rather than skipping ahead to normalizing these procedures, especially for young people. “It’s not so dissimilar to the recent discourse around Ozempic and other weight loss drugs,” she said. “We’re seeing people talk at length about the negative side effects of the meds, and there’s increased normalization of very adverse symptoms because, well, the person got to be thin at the end of it, so it must be worth it!” Transferred to this topic, Sprengle said, there’s a strong message that the influencer “looks like this now and they’re beautiful and thriving!” None of the negatives, such as body image issues or obsession with youth, seem to matter as much.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-drinks-for-sleep_l_65d6485be4b007e3eb73f7ca","Do You Have Issues Sleeping? These Foods And Drinks Could Be To Blame.","emily laurence","2024-03-01","If you’re one of the millions of Americans who struggle with sleep, you’ve likely tried all the most-talked-about remedies. Maybe there’s chamomile tea in your pantry and melatonin supplements in your bathroom cabinet. You already know it’s not a good idea to consume caffeine in the late afternoon and that even though that glass of wine may help you initially drift off to sleep, you’re going to wake up in the middle of the night regretting it. Still struggling? You could be unknowingly consuming something that’s to blame. According to sleep doctors, there are more foods and drinks that can mess with sleep than people realize. Rounded up here are seven foods and drinks that sleep doctors recommend steering clear of if you struggle with sleep. Plus, they offer guidance on which foods will work for you, not against you. Digging into some hot chicken wings or curry at dinner could cause sleep problems when you head to bed. Dr. Abhinav Singh, a board-certified sleep medicine and internal medicine doctor, is medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center and a medical reviewer for Sleep Foundation. He told HuffPost that eating food that’s spicer than you’re used to can increase acidity in the stomach, which can cause acid reflux that can make sleeping difficult. Singh explained that gastric acid is already naturally higher at night, and if it continues to rise, it can disrupt sleep. Dr. Ruchir P. Patel, a sleep medicine doctor and medical director of The Insomnia and Sleep Institute of Arizona, agreed. “Eating spicy food close to going to bed can cause acid reflux, which can trigger the brain to wake up excessively.” In addition to triggering acid reflux, Singh said, spicy food can make people feel hotter, which can also disrupt sleep. Patel said many people don’t realize that tomato sauce can be an acid reflux trigger, which can disrupt sleep similarly to the effect of spicy food. That means having pizza or spaghetti for dinner could keep you up. In general, Patel said, it’s best to avoid eating food that’s high in sodium and saturated fat (like pizza, especially if it has pepperoni) three hours before bed because it takes longer to digest, which can then cause sleep problems. Like greasy pizza, burgers are another food that takes the body longer to digest. For this reason, Singh said, eating a big, juicy burger too close to bedtime could keep you up, especially if it has ketchup on it, which, again, can trigger sleep-disrupting acid reflux. If you want a burger that will help with sleep rather than disrupt it, choose a plant-based burger made with lentils, which Singh said are easier to digest, or, if you are going to have beef, go for as lean a cut as possible. You might want to resist having a bowl of ice cream for dessert if you’re dealing with sleep issues. Dr. Raj Dasgupta, the chief medical adviser for Sleep Advisor, told HuffPost that foods high in sugar, such as ice cream, can keep you up. “The high sugar content can cause fluctuations in your blood sugar, cause stomach issues and keep you alert at bedtime, preventing you from relaxing and falling asleep,” he said. Singh also said that chocolate ice cream in particular can keep you up. “Many people don’t know that chocolate has caffeine,” Singh said, adding that dark chocolate has more caffeine than milk chocolate. Singh explained that the high fat, high sugar and high caffeine in chocolate ice cream is a triple whammy in terms of disrupting sleep. In movies, TV shows and children’s books, kids are often given a glass of milk before bedtime. But in real life, Patel said, this can make falling asleep harder. “Milk can trigger acid reflux,” he said, adding that this can happen to both children and adults. Patel explained that the lactose in milk can be problematic. If you are prone to acid reflux but want to have milk in the evening, his advice is to choose a plant-based milk, which is lactose-free and shouldn’t cause symptoms. Though most people know that caffeine can disrupt sleep, Patel revealed that not everyone realizes they’re consuming something with caffeine in it. “Some fancy water brands, like vitaminwater, can have up to 50 milligrams of caffeine,” he said. Singh added that some electrolyte drinks or powders can also contain caffeine. Sucking on a peppermint after dinner or sipping peppermint tea seems pretty innocuous. But Singh said that this can cause sleep problems for some people. Why? Like many other foods on this list, he said that peppermint can trigger acid reflux, a link most people aren’t aware of. Now that we know greasy foods, spicy foods and ice cream are off the menu, what can you eat that will work in your favor? All three sleep doctors recommend eating a dinner that includes complex carbs, fiber and lean protein. Examples of complex carbs high in fiber are most vegetables, brown rice, lentils, beans, whole wheat bread and quinoa. Examples of lean protein are poultry and fish.

Log in to hide these messages. Dasgupta explained that these types of food support healthy digestion, which in turn is good for sleep. Scientific research backs this up, showing that a diet high in fiber, complex carbs, protein and unsaturated fats is connected with good sleep. Singh says that meal timing matters, too. If you are going to eat close to bedtime or want a nighttime snack, he recommends keeping the portion small, under 300 calories. “A handful of nuts is a good nighttime snack because it has fiber and unsaturated fats,” he said. What we eat and drink has a powerful effect on the body, including how well (or not) we sleep. If you have trouble falling or staying asleep, avoid the seven foods and drinks on this list to see if it makes a difference. Soon you might not need that melatonin after all.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/food-cities-vacation-chefs_l_65c4f457e4b069b665de795a","Chefs Reveal The 9 Destinations You Need To Visit If You Love To Eat","jillian wilson","2024-03-01","For many people, bookmarking restaurants and bars is a beloved part of trip planning. And if you’re someone who considers dining and drinking an experience more than a necessity, then you may want to plan your entire vacation around destinations with unbelievable fare. But while viral TikTok videos and skewed restaurant reviews can sometimes lead you astray, there’s one group of people who certainly know where to go: chefs. These experts aren’t just pros at their craft, but they know their way around a menu, whether it’s a fine dining meal, huge food market or a street food cart. We asked chefs from across the country for their favorite places to travel to for good food (aside from the town where their restaurants are located) that they feel are attainable and affordable. Here’s what they said: Amanda Shulman, the chef and owner of Philadelphia’s Her Place Supper Club and co-owner of Philadelphia’s My Loup, recently returned from her honeymoon in Thailand where she said the food was incredible. She recommended “any single street food cart that serves plump Thai pork sausages stuffed with vermicelli noodles — a sour fermented pork sausage, grilled over charcoal until it is swollen and glistening, nearly popping out of its casing.” “Fatty and tangy and incredible, I grabbed them whenever I could,” Shulman said. “In Chiang Mai, there’s a roadside restaurant called Neng’s Earthen Jar Roast Pork filled with clay barrels rendering fat pork bellies until the skins are shatteringly crisp,” Shulman continued. In Northern Thailand, laarb, which is “finely minced pork dressed in fish sauce, chilis, herbs and rice powder,” and khao soi, a rich curry noodle soup, are mainstays on many menus. Shulman recommended Aroon Rai, a small restaurant in Chiang Mai for these items. In Bangkok, Shulman said “Sorn was one of the best fine dining experiences I’ve ever had. Every bite was unabashedly delicious, the technique was evident and tight, and I’ll be dreaming of swiping warm roti into beef curry maybe forever.” “The modern London dining scene is, I think, the most exciting dining scene anywhere in the world,” said Ed Szymanski, the chef and owner of Dame and Lord’s in New York City. London has restaurants that feature high-quality produce coming from France, Spain and Italy, as well as seafood from the northern parts of the U.K. “All of these things come together to create this very diverse dining scene,” Szymanski said. Many restaurants serve modern British cuisine, including Planque, St. JOHN and Noble Rot, but the city’s food options don’t stop at British food. You can find great Pakistani, Indian, Spanish, Italian food, and more. Or, for an all-in-one spot for local food and drinks, visit Borough Market where “you walk around and get some snacks, and you can have oysters shucked right in front of you, have a glass of champagne, and then go and have a sausage roll after that,” he said. An oft-overlooked cuisine is Guatemalan food, which is known for its stews, and all things corn and beans, like corn tortillas, tostadas, tamales, empanadas, and pupusas loaded with cheese and beans, said Sofia Deleon, the owner of El Merkury in Philadelphia and the Guatemalan rum brand Tenango Rum. She added that the cuisine naturally has lots of gluten-free and vegetarian options, too. “One of my favorite places to go when I visit is Mercado Central, the central market, because it’s a one-stop shop for everything [in Guatemala City],” Deleon said. Here you can find produce stands, meat purveyors and vendors selling handwoven items, in addition to food stands selling fresh tostadas loaded with avocado, parsley and cheese, and traditional Guatemalan desserts like a condensed milk treat known as canillita de leche. Ceviche used to be a popular food throughout Guatemala but has since decreased in popularity. In Antigua, though, (which is about 1.5 hours from Guatemala City), she recommends you order ceviche at Hugo’s Ceviches. The restaurant “has been around forever, and it’s the one place that still maintains their standard and is really good,” she noted, adding Hugo’s Ceviches is also known for their micheladas made with Gallo, Guatemala’s local beer, along with the regular fixings like chilis and Worcestershire sauce. Also in Antigua is La Cuevita de Los Urquizú, which comes highly recommended by Deleon as well. “What’s nice about this place is ... it’s almost like a buffet where you can buy things by the pound, and they have 50 to 75 varieties of very traditional foods that you would otherwise not get to try if you went anywhere else,” she said. For traditional sweets, visit Doña María Gordillo in Antigua, which has been around since the 1800s. “Originally, based on Spanish-style sweets, but then it was adapted to Guatemalan flavors, so they have everything from the tamarind balls to chilacayote en dulce, which is like a type of Guatemalan pumpkin” in addition to tasty egg tarts. New Orleans has some of “the most diverse and delicious food experiences — there’s not enough stomach space to devour all the good the city has to offer,” Shulman said. The city is beloved for its food culture, which comprises Southern, Creole, Cajun and French cooking — think jambalaya, gumbo, beignets, and more. One affordable item on menus across the city are po’boys, a sandwich that’s traditionally made with fried shrimp, roast beef or fried oysters, and served on crusty bread. For a good po’boy, followed by lemon Hubig’s Pies (a sweet New Orleans hand pie), Shulman recommends Frady’s One Stop. For the New Orleans’ classic muffuletta (an Italian sandwich made with an olive salad, cured meat, cheese on a round roll) visit Central Grocery, according to Shulman. Additionally, she suggests Cane & Table, a seasonally-focused restaurant that specializes in Caribbean and Cuban food, and Dakar, which serves Senegalese food. Or for something more special, try Mosquito Supper Club, which is Shulman’s “crush of a restaurant — sitting at the bar and eating pickled shrimp and other small bites was a magical experience.” Cape Town, South Africa, is a destination that’s full of complex local flavors along with fresh produce, and lots and lots of great wine, said Deleon. Plus, it’s relatively inexpensive and totally beautiful, she noted. Specifically, the region is known for its Chenin Blanc wines, a type of white wine that is light and crisp. One of Deleon’s favorite places to drink South African wine is Babylonstoren Wine Estate, a winery where everything is grown in-house, from the olives for the olive oil to the grapes for the wines. In addition to wine, Deleon said Cape Town is known for its Cape Malay food, “which is a mix of Malaysian and Indian and South African flavors.” You’ll find curry on many menus throughout the city, she said, and you’d be remiss not to try it. One spot for curry she recommends is Curry Club, where you can choose from a menu of chicken curries, lamb curries and veggie curries, ranging from mild to spicy. Mexico City is another great place to eat, according to Szymanski. “There’s an unending list of places to go in Mexico City.” “Mexico City is one of the largest and most eclectic cities in the world, and the rich tapestry of street vendors, markets, high-end restaurants and mezcal bars means there’s always a fun discovery around the corner,” said Szymanski. Mexico City is known for a range of food, including its fresh tacos, making taquerias a must, according to Szymanski. Among his taqueria recommendations is El Torito, where they serve two kinds: suadero (which is like a beef brisket) and tripa (tripe) or a mix of both. The area is also known for its barbacoa (slow-cooked lamb). And mezcal, a Mexican liquor made from agave, is worth being sought out, too. Additionally, you should just “follow your nose and eat the street tacos that look good, eat the quesadilla, go to a market in Mexico and eat the thing that looks good. You have to trust your instincts and wait in line if there is a line because there’s a good chance someone else knows something that you don’t.” “Mexican cuisine is such a huge part of American cuisine that I am always drawn to Mexico,” Gregory Gourdet, chef and founder of Kann and Sousòl in Portland, Oregon, told HuffPost via email. “I was blown away by my first trip to Oaxaca in 2021. The history and culture is so rich.” In Oaxaca, you’ll find foods such as moles, which is a traditional Mexican sauce, barbacoa, tlayudas (a traditional Oaxacan dish made of a crunchy tortilla topped with things like beans, meat, veggies and cheese), and tamales, in addition to the local fruits and vegetables that are grown there, said Gourdet. As far as where specifically to go in the city, Gourdet said, “Criollo and Alfonsina are both incredible restaurants.” You can also visit the Zapotec village of Teotitlan del Valle to take part in traditional cooking classes at El Sabor Zapoteco, he noted. Additionally, the city is home to sprawling food markets that are must-visits during any trip. And beyond this, it’s a good destination for those with certain allergies, too. “My dietary distinctions include being gluten and dairy-free, and corn-based Oaxacan cuisine is extremely accommodating. I was often told I was missing out by not indulging in the legendary local cheese, however,” Gourdet said. “I can almost guarantee you that nobody will have chosen the place that I was going to propose speaking about which is Corsica. Specifically, the northern half of Corsica, which is referred to as Haute Corse,” said Tyler Akin, the chef-partner of Le Cavalier in Wilmington, Delaware, and Bastia, a coming soon coastal Mediterranean restaurant in Philadelphia. Corsica is an island, so it’s natural to think that seafood is the focal point. And while you can find great options (Akin suggests stopping in the town of Centuri for spiny lobster and sea urchin), the food here centers on cooking traditions from the mountainous region. “Unlike Sardinia to the south, you see these alpine cheese traditions and more land-animal-driven cuisine than seafood-driven cuisine,” Akin said. This includes high-quality charcuterie products, chestnuts and mushrooms. Akin said it’s best to go to Corsica during the offseason. “It’s really cool to be one of very few people there anytime but [specifically] May through October because you have an opportunity to really connect with the people.” “One of the highlights there for me was the charcuterie that was produced,” said Akin, who added that a favorite producer of his was Les Delices de Castellu, which has “these incredibly natural products, wild boar salamis, and the signature sausage of Corsica which is figatellu.” Additionally, he said you should try migliacciu, which are pancakes stuffed with a ricotta-like cheese known as brocciu. Another must-visit? Patrimonio, which is Corsica’s wine region where natural, organic wines are the focal point. In the university town of Corte, seek out baked goods from Casanova Patisserie, which makes a little cheesecake called falculelle and fresh fruit ice cream, and Fritelle Curtinese for the best beignets on the island and a herb pie made with lard, maquis herbs and maquis herbs. When you think of Austin, you likely think of tacos and barbecue — and that’s for good reason. These foods are woven into the history of the area and can be found all throughout the neighborhoods of the city. Andrew Taylor, the chef/owner of Big Tree Hospitality in Portland, Maine, which operates Eventide Oyster Co., the Honey Paw and Hugo’s, along with some artisan food markets, said Austin is the place that’s stood out to him most when it comes to food destinations. ”[I’m] just really impressed with the food ... it actually reminded me a little bit of Portland in that it’s not a huge town but it felt like the quality of restaurants, the breadth of the restaurant scene was exceptional and punched way above its weight,” Taylor stated. There are barbecue institutions like Franklin Barbecue and la Barbecue in Austin itself, in addition to options outside of town, too. He added that it’s hard to find a bad meal in Austin, but if you are looking for places to dine, he has a few tips. “We took a little trip out like 45 minutes from Austin [to] Lockhart, Texas ... and the barbecue there was just the best I’ve ever had in my life. We went to Kreuz Market, which was just outrageous, Smitty’s and Terry Blacks, were just all incredible,” he said. For tacos, he recommends Nixta where everything, from the tortillas to the braises, are handmade, and Veracruz, which is a food truck vibe. And there is much more than tacos and barbecue in Austin. Taylor noted that he tried great Japanese food, Mexican food, Caribbean fare, and more.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-diplomat-spying-cuba_n_65e1ae38e4b005b85833f304","Career U.S. Diplomat Abruptly Admits To Spying For Communist Cuba For Decades","joshua goodman , jim mustian","2024-03-01","MIAMI (AP) — A former career U.S. diplomat told a federal judge Thursday he will plead guilty to charges of working for decades as a secret agent for communist Cuba, an unexpectedly swift resolution to a case prosecutors called one of the most brazen betrayals in the history of the U.S. foreign service. Manuel Rocha’s stunning fall from grace could culminate in a lengthy prison term after the 73-year-old said he would admit to federal counts of conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government. Prosecutors and Rocha’s attorney indicated the plea deal includes an agreed-upon sentence but they did not disclose details at a hearing Thursday. He is due back in court April 12, when he is scheduled to formalize his guilty plea and be sentenced. “I am in agreement,” said Rocha, shackled at the hands and ankles, when asked by U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom if he wished to change his plea to guilty. Prosecutors, in exchange, agreed to drop 13 counts including wire fraud and making false statements. The brief hearing shed no new light on the question that has proved elusive since Rocha’s arrest in December: What exactly did he do to help Cuba while working at the State Department for two decades? That included stints as ambassador to Bolivia and top posts in Argentina, Mexico, the White House and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. “Ambassador Rocha,” as he preferred to be called, was well known among Miami’s elite for his aristocratic, almost regal, bearing befitting his Ivy League background. His post-government career included time as a special adviser to the commander of the U.S. Southern Command and more recently as a tough-talking Donald Trump supporter and Cuba hardliner, a persona friends and prosecutors say Rocha adopted to hide his true allegiances. Peter Lapp, who oversaw FBI counterintelligence against Cuba between 1998 and 2005, said the fast resolution of the case benefits not only the elderly Rocha but also the government, which stands to learn a lot about Cuba’s penetration of U.S. foreign policy circles. Typically in counterintelligence cases, the defendant is charged with espionage. But Rocha was accused of the lesser crimes of acting as a foreign agent, which carry maximum terms of between five and 10 years in prison, making it easier for prosecutors and Rocha to reach an agreement. “It’s a win-win for both sides,” said Lapp, who led the investigation into Ana Montes, the highest-level U.S. official ever convicted of spying for Cuba. “He gets a significant payoff and the chance to see his family again, and the U.S. will be able to conduct a full damage assessment that it wouldn’t be able to do without his cooperation.” “There are details that can really only come from the defendant,” he added. But the abrupt deal drew criticism in the Cuban exile community, with some legal observers worrying it amounted to a slap on the wrist. “Any sentence that allows him to see the light of day again would not be justice,” said Carlos Trujillo, a Miami attorney who served as U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States during the Trump administration. “He’s a spy for a foreign adversary who put American lives at risk.” A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Rocha was arrested by the FBI at his Miami home on allegations he had engaged in “clandestine activity” on Cuba’s behalf since at least 1981 — the year he joined the U.S. foreign service — including by meeting with Cuban intelligence operatives and providing false information to U.S. government officials about his contacts. Rocha made a series of recorded admissions to an undercover FBI agent who posed as a Cuban intelligence operative who reached out to Rocha on WhatsApp, calling himself “Miguel” and saying he had a message “from your friends in Havana.” Rocha praised the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro as “Comandante,” branded the U.S. the “enemy” and bragged about his service for more than 40 years as a Cuban mole in the heart of U.S. foreign policy circles, prosecutors said in court records. “What we have done … it’s enormous … more than a Grand Slam,” he was quoted as saying. Federal authorities have said little about what Rocha actually did to aid Cuba, and FBI and State Department investigators have been conducting a confidential intelligence damage assessment that could take years. But a recent Associated Press investigation found there were plenty of missed red flags over the years. Those included a tip that a longtime CIA operative received warning in 2006 that Rocha was working as a double agent. It was never pursued. And separate intelligence revealed that the CIA had been aware as early as 1987 that Castro had a “super mole” burrowed deep inside the U.S. government, and some officials suspected it could have been Rocha. Lawrence Gumbiner, a retired career diplomat, said the fact that Rocha went undetected for so many years underscores the sophistication of Cuba’s intelligence services. “It’s a day for reflection for all of us who knew and worked with him,” said Gumbiner, who served as acting U.S. ambassador to Cuba in 2017 and 2018. “Although the full extent of the damage he caused isn’t yet revealed, it’s hard to believe he didn’t pass along some very serious information that compromised our intelligence services and our own efforts against the Castro regime.” ___ Mustian reported from New York. ___ Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/ By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Trump is accused of illegally retaining classified documents after leaving the White House. He denies the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. Trump’s attorneys noted in a filing that the trial would be taking place during the RNC, which is being held July 15-18 in Milwaukee. Despite his legal woes, Trump remains the clear favorite to win the GOP nomination and take on President Joe Biden in November. The next four years will change America forever.

U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon is due to hold a hearing on the trial’s possible start date on Friday. Collins asked Yoshino if Cannon should consider Trump’s campaigning when making a decision. “I think in an ideal world, she should not,” Yoshino replied. “I mean, no one is above the law. This is a criminal proceeding. She should just set the dates as it were.

The late-night host noted how Republican 2024 front-runner Trump needs to “come up with the full $454 million penalty or a bond to cover it” if he wants to appeal his civil fraud ruling in New York. “In other words, a man who became famous for never paying anyone back has to convince a bonding company he will definitely pay them back, and it’s not happening,” said Kimmel. “He owes like a whole Powerball Lottery jackpot,” he continued. “He may very well have to sell off his properties to cover it. But that’s a worst-case scenario.” So, Trump’s “first move is to see how much he can get for Eric on Craigslist,” joked Kimmel. “He has him listed in the ‘Tools’ section.” Kimmel later proposed another way forward for the four-times-indicted Trump. “Wouldn’t it be great if Trump has to sell Mar-a-Lago to some billionaire liberal?” he asked. “Maybe Oprah-Lago would be a solution?” Watch the video here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Republican 2024 front-runner repeated his usual fear-mongering rhetoric when he claimed, without offering any evidence to back up his assertion, “They’re coming from jails, and they’re coming from prisons, and they’re coming from mental institutions, and they’re coming from insane asylums, and they’re terrorists. They’re being let into our country, and it’s horrible.” Trump then focused on what he considered a highly important issue: The languages talked by those who go to the U.S. Trump, confused: We have people who don’t speak languages. We have nobody that even speaks those languages. Nobody speaks them pic.twitter.com/5OfQU9xIAb “Nobody can explain to me how allowing millions of people from places unknown, from countries unknown, who don’t speak languages,” he confusingly railed. “We have languages coming into our country. We have nobody that even speaks those languages. They’re truly foreign languages. Nobody speaks them, and they’re pouring into our country, and they’re bringing with them tremendous problems, including medical problems, as you know.” CNN’s fact-checking reporter Daniel Dale told anchor Kaitlan Collins that Trump has made a similar claim “about people arriving speaking languages that no one‘s ever heard.” Dale recalled, “He said in a previous, recent speech, ‘We didn‘t even have one translator who could understand this language. I‘ve looked into this, seems to be just conjured out of thin air. It‘s nonsense.” “Conjured out of thin air.” CNN cuts out of Trump’s speech after he tells “several lies”. They have their fact-checker, Daniel Dale, standing by, who immediately goes to work. CNN has finally wised up. Every single network must do this when Trump is speaking. (Video: CNN) pic.twitter.com/9GAOnygmMe Critics on X (formerly Twitter) scratched their heads over Trump’s “don’t speak languages” logic. If no one speaks these languages, how does he know about them? Wait what? Languages that no one speaks? Are they speaking in tongues? Maybe he got confused between the border and his meeting with the Christian Nationalists right beforehand.That must be it! The next four years will change America forever.

The “Late Show” host noted that special counsel Jack Smith “begged” the Supreme Court to rule on the issue “in a timely manner” back in December. He added that SCOTUS “didn’t say jack” for over two weeks, as well, after a federal appeals court rejected Trump’s claim that he’s immune from prosecution for alleged criminal acts he committed while in office. “That makes it a total of 19 weeks of delays,” Colbert said of the trial. “These proceedings have been frozen for so long, they legally count as children in Alabama.” He later questioned if justices realize “just how damaging” they are to the court’s legacy for stalling “over this urgent threat to our democracy.” Colbert pointed to a 2022 survey that found “just 18%” of Americans who said they “have a great deal of confidence in the court,” The Associated Press reported. He mentioned that the Supreme Court gains its legitimacy and power from public approval before issuing his announcement. “They don’t have an army or a police force or apparently an HR department, they have to rely on moral authority, but they have abdicated that moral authority, which is why, tonight, using the power vested in me as a late night host, I am hereby declaring the Supreme Court unconstitutional,” he said.

We did much better in 2020 than we ever even thought about doing in 2016,” Trump said during an address on immigration from Eagle Pass, Texas. “And very bad things happened and from that moment, it was a whole different ballgame in Texas and all over,” he added, appearing to nod to his baseless stolen election claims. Cavuto interrupted the feed. “We’re continuing to monitor this,” said Cavuto, who in the past has not shied away from criticizing Trump or Republicans, unlike other personalities on the conservative network.

The actor, who made his return to the World Wrestling Entertainment ring last month, shared a touching tribute to his father on Instagram on Friday, writing that he was “delivering flowers to heaven to my old man.” “My regret in this life is that I never had a chance to say goodbye to him, because he died suddenly,” he wrote in the caption of the post. “I regret not reconciling our complicated father/son s**t before I lost him. Raised me with tough fatherly love and an even tougher hand. The more I live life, the more grateful I am for it.” Johnson’s post featured an old video clip of his father in the wrestling ring, with a little Rock seated in the audience, watching. Rocky “Soul Man” Johnson and fellow wrestler Tony Atlas became the first Black World Tag Team champions in 1983, back when the WWE was called the World Wrestling Federation. In his tribute on Instagram, Dwayne Johnson, who made his own debut in the wrestling ring in the 1990s, celebrated his dad as a trailblazer. “He came up the hard way, and trail-blazed for all of us men of color — in any sport & level of entertainment,” he wrote. “But it was also very important to him to pave the way for all men, any color - it didn’t matter.” In 2020, the “Jumanji” actor shared a video on Instagram of the eulogy he delivered at his father’s funeral. He said his father broke into pro-wrestling in the mid-1960s and into the ’70s, when the country’s “racial tension and divide was very strong.” The Instagram post also featured a letter he dedicated to his father, in which he wrote that the late wrestling Hall of Famer was “taken too fast.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

(AP) — Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Friday shortened the prison sentence of former Kansas City Chiefs assistant coach Britt Reid for a drunken driving crash that seriously injured a 5-year-old girl. Parson’s commutation converted the remainder of Reid’s three-year prison sentence to house arrest, subject to several conditions. Reid had been sentenced in November 2022 after pleading guilty to driving while intoxicated causing serious bodily injury. He is the son of Chiefs coach Andy Reid. Parson is a longtime Chiefs season ticket-holder holder who celebrated with the team at its recent Super Bowl victory parade in Kansas City. A Parson spokesman said the governor considered several factors when making his commutation decision. “Reid had completed his alcohol abuse treatment program and has served more prison time than most individuals convicted of similar offenses,” Parson spokesman Johnathan Shiflett said. Reid’s house arrest will continue until Oct. 31, 2025, with requirements for weekly meetings with a parole officer and peer support sponsor and attendance at behavioral counseling. He also will be required to work at least 30 hours a week and complete 10 hours a month of community service, among other things. The Chiefs declined to comment about Parson’s commutation of Reid. Prosecutors said Reid was intoxicated and driving about 84 mph (135 kph) in a 65 mph zone when his Dodge truck hit the cars on an entrance ramp to Interstate 435 near Arrowhead Stadium on Feb. 4, 2021. A girl inside one of the cars, Ariel Young, suffered a traumatic brain injury. A total of six people, including Reid, were injured. One of the vehicles he hit had stalled because of a dead battery, and the second was owned by Ariel’s mother, who had arrived to help. Reid had a blood-alcohol level of 0.113% two hours after the crash, police said. The legal limit is 0.08%. The Chiefs reached a confidential agreement with Ariel’s family to pay for her ongoing medical treatment and other expenses. An attorney who represented Ariel’s family did not immediately respond to messages Friday. Reid’s sentencing reprieve was one of three commutations and 36 pardons announced Friday by Parson, who also denied 63 clemency requests. Parson, a former sheriff, has now granted clemency to more than 760 people since 2020 — more than any Missouri governor since the 1940s. Parson has been been working to clear a backlog of nearly 3,700 clemency applications he inherited when taking over as governor in 2018, but he also has considered some new requests. Many of those granted clemency by Parson were convicted decades ago of drug crimes, theft or burglary and had completed their prison sentences long ago. But two notable exceptions were Mark and Patricia McCloskey. The St. Louis couple who gained national attention for waving guns at racial injustice protesters were pardoned by Parson on July 30, 2021, just six weeks after Mark McCloskey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and Patricia McCloskey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment.

The Feb. 22 judgment came after the Justice Department reportedly sued the “Empire” star in 2022 for failing to pay $578,000 in income taxes between 2010 and 2019. According to court documents cited by multiple news outlets, Howard told a Justice Department attorney that it’s “immoral for the United States government to charge taxes to the descendants of slaves.” “Four hundred years of forced labor and never receiving any compensation for it,” Howard was quoted as saying in a November voicemail. “Now you have the gall to try and prosecute and charge taxes to the descendants of a broken people that you are responsible for causing the breakage.” The recording cut off at this point, but Howard called back to continue his message. “In truth, the entire United States should, by default, become the property of the descendants of slaves,” he reportedly said. “But since you do not have the ability [or] the courage to do it, let’s try this in court. … We’re gonna bring you down.” Representatives for Howard did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Howard had allegedly attempted to avoid being served with the Justice Department lawsuit. Prosecutors said that the government first tried to find him at a motel in Jackson, Mississippi, before further attempts were made at properties in Philadelphia, Chicago and La Habra, California.

But the actor allegedly failed to cooperate with the Justice Department or appear at hearings, resulting in last week’s default judgment against him. Howard has been in legal trouble before. In 2015, he acknowledged in a Rolling Stone interview that he had “slapped” his wife in 2001, an incident that led to a guilty plea for disorderly conduct. Howard was also once accused of assaulting a flight attendant, though the charge against him was later dropped. The Oscar-nominated actor notably appeared in the 2008 film “Iron Man” but was replaced for “Iron Man 2,” with Howard suggesting that salary issues were to blame.

Lauren Boebert, whose three-year tenure representing Coloradans has been marred by allegations of hypocrisy. Writing on his website Truth Social, the former president called Boebert “a Proven Conservative and Effective Leader” and a “trusted America First Fighter” who has his “Complete and Total Endorsement.” Boebert was first elected in 2020 to represent Colorado’s 3rd congressional district, encompassing the western half of the state. She rose to right-wing fame by touting her love for guns and Trump’s MAGA movement while capitalizing on conservative anger over COVID-19 health restrictions as the owner of a restaurant that has since shuttered. After a narrow re-election win in 2022, Boebert decided to run to represent the state’s 4th congressional district in 2024 instead — a large swath of eastern Colorado that draws more consistently Republican votes. She also has sought to position herself in a softer light in recent months. Last summer, set on her mission to impeach President Joe Biden, Boebert’s tense relationship with fellow Trump Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) sparked an ugly scene on the House floor in which Greene called Boebert a “little bitch.” Then in September, Boebert suffered a spectacular fall from grace when she was forcibly removed from a stage production of “Beetlejuice” at a Denver performing arts theater. The congresswoman and her date were caught on video kissing, groping and vaping during what was billed as a family-friendly show. The next four years will change America forever.

For an elected official who has championed “family values” and baselessly accused members of the LGBTQ+ community of sexually inappropriate behavior around children, the incident was embarrassing, and Boebert later apologized.

Earlier this week, her eldest son, 18-year-old Tyler Boebert, was arrested on felony charges; he allegedly robbed a woman with a brain tumor of her last $75, police said.

International mediators have been working for weeks to broker a deal to pause the fighting before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins around March 10. A deal likely would allow aid to reach hundreds of thousands of desperate Palestinians in northern Gaza who aid officials worry are under threat of famine. The Israelis “have more or less accepted” the proposal, which includes the six-week cease-fire as well as the release by Hamas of hostages considered vulnerable, which includes the sick, the wounded, the elderly and women, said the official. “Right now, the ball is in the court of Hamas and we are continuing to push this as hard as we possibly can,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House to brief reporters. Officials from Israel and from Hamas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A senior Egyptian official said mediators Egypt and Qatar are expected to receive a response from Hamas during the Cairo talks scheduled to start Sunday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not publicly authorized to discuss the talks. There is increasing criticism over the hundreds of thousands struggling to survive in northern Gaza, which has borne the brunt of the conflict that began when the Hamas militant group attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seizing around 250 hostages. U.S. military planes began the first airdrops of thousands of meals into Gaza, and the militaries of Jordan and Egypt said they also conducted airdrops. The European Union’s diplomatic service said many of the dozens of Palestinians killed or wounded in the chaos surrounding an aid convoy on Thursday were hit by Israeli army fire and urged an international investigation. It said responsibility for the crisis lay with “restrictions imposed by the Israeli army and obstructions by violent extremist(s) to the supply of humanitarian aid.” Israel’s chief military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Israel organized Thursday’s humanitarian convoy, “and claims that we attacked the convoy intentionally and that we harmed people intentionally are baseless.” Residents in northern Gaza say they are searching rubble and garbage for anything to feed their children, who barely eat one meal a day. Many families have begun mixing animal and bird food with grain to bake bread. International aid officials say they have encountered catastrophic hunger. “We’re dying from starvation,” said Soad Abu Hussein, a widow and mother of five who shelters in a school in the Jabaliya refugee camp. At least 10 children have starved to death, according to hospital records in Gaza, the World Health Organization said. Gaza’s Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll from the war has climbed to 30,320. The ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures, but says women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed. In Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah, where more than half of the territory’s people now seek refuge, an Israeli airstrike on Saturday struck tents outside the Emirati hospital, killing 11 people and wounding about 50, including health workers, the Health Ministry said. Israel’s air, sea and ground offensive has reduced much of densely populated northern Gaza to rubble. The military told Palestinians to move south, but as many as 300,000 people are believed to have remained. Roughly one in six children under 2 in the north suffer from acute malnutrition and wasting, “the worst level of child malnutrition anywhere in the world,” Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the World Food Program, said this week. “If nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza.” People have overwhelmed trucks delivering food aid and grabbed what they can, Skau said, forcing the WFP to suspend deliveries to the north. In the violence Thursday, hundreds of people rushed about 30 trucks bringing a predawn delivery to the north. Palestinians said nearby Israeli troops shot into the crowds. Israel said they fired warning shots toward the crowd and insisted many of the dead were trampled. Doctors at hospitals in Gaza and a U.N. team that visited a hospital said large numbers of the wounded had been shot. The Health Ministry said two more bodies were recovered Saturday from the scene, raising the death toll to 118. It said the wounded remained at 760. Ahmed Abdel Karim, being treated for gunshot wounds in his feet, said he had spent two days waiting for aid trucks to arrive. “Everyone attacked and advanced on these trucks. Because of the large number, I could not get flour,” he said. He was shot by Israeli troops, he said. Radwan Abdel-Hai, a father of four young children, heard a rumor late Wednesday that an aid convoy was on its way. He and five others took a donkey cart and found a “sea of people” waiting. “Tanks started firing at us,” he said. “As I ran back, I heard tank shells and gunfire. I heard people screaming. I saw people falling to the ground, some motionless.” Abdel-Hai took shelter in a nearby building. When the shooting stopped, many dead were on the ground, he said. “Many were shot in their back,” he said. Abu Hussein, the widow, said more than 5,000 people — mostly women and children — living with her in the Jabaliya school have not received aid for more than four weeks. A group of people went to the shore to try to fish, but three were killed and two were wounded by gunfire from Israeli ships, she said. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mansour Hamed, a 32-year-old former aid worker living with more than 50 relatives in a Gaza City house, said some are eating tree leaves and animal food. It has become normal to find a child emerging from the rubble with a rotten piece of bread, he said. Acknowledging the extreme need for food, U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. would look for other ways of delivery “including possibly a marine corridor.” Also Saturday, Israel said three soldiers were killed and 14 injured Friday when they inadvertently triggered explosives in a booby-trapped building outside Khan Younis in southern Gaza. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-wins-missouri-caucuses_n_65e37073e4b013678e156f2d","Trump Wins Caucuses In Missouri And Idaho, Sweeps Michigan GOP Convention","jonathan j. cooper","2024-03-02","COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Former President Donald Trump continued his march toward the GOP nomination on Saturday, winning caucuses in Idaho and Missouri and sweeping the delegate haul at a party convention in Michigan. Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador who is his last major rival, was still searching for her first election-year win. The next event on the Republican calendar is Sunday in the District of Columbia. Two days later is Super Tuesday, when 16 states will hold primaries on what will be the largest day of voting of the year outside of the November election. Trump is on track to lock up the nomination days later. The steep odds facing Haley were on display in Columbia, Missouri, where Republicans gathered at a church to caucus. Seth Christensen stood on stage and called on them to vote for Haley. He wasn’t well received. Another caucusgoer shouted out from the audience: “Are you a Republican?” An organizer quieted the crowd and Christensen finished his speech. Haley went on to win just 37 of the 263 Republicans in attendance in Boone County. Michigan Republicans at their convention in Grand Rapids began allocating 39 of the state’s 55 GOP presidential delegates. Trump won all 39 delegates allocated. But a significant portion of the party’s grassroots force was skipping the gathering because of the lingering effects of a monthslong dispute over the party’s leadership. Trump handily won Michigan’s primary this past Tuesday with 68% of the vote compared with Haley’s 27%. Michigan Republicans were forced to split their delegate allocation into two parts after Democrats, who control the state government, moved Michigan into the early primary states, violating the national Republican Party’s rules. Voters lined up outside a church in Columbia, home to the University of Missouri, before the doors opened for the caucuses. Once they got inside, they heard appeals from supporters of the candidates. “Every 100 days, we’re spending $1 trillion, with money going all over the world. Illegals are running across the border,” Tom Mendenall, an elector for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said to the crowd. He later added: “You know where Donald Trump stands on a lot of these issues.” Christensen, a 31-year-old from Columbia who came to the caucus with his wife and three children age 7, 5, and 2, then urged Republicans to go in a new direction. “I don’t need to hear about Mr. Trump’s dalliances with people of unsavory character, nor do my children,” Christensen said to the room. “And if we put that man in the office, that’s what we’re going to hear about all the time. And I’m through with it.” Supporters quickly moved to one side of the room or the other, depending on whether they favored Trump or Haley. There was little discussion between caucusgoers after they chose a side. This year was the first test of the new system, which is almost entirely run by volunteers on the Republican side. The caucuses were organized after GOP Gov. Mike Parson signed a 2022 law that, among other things, canceled the planned March 12 presidential primary. Lawmakers failed to reinstate the primary despite calls to do so by both state Republican and Democratic party leaders. Democrats will hold a party-run primary on March 23. Trump prevailed twice under Missouri’s old presidential primary system. Last year, Idaho lawmakers passed cost-cutting legislation that was intended to move all the state’s primaries to the same date in May. But the bill inadvertently eliminated the presidential primaries entirely. The Republican-led Legislature considered holding a special session to reinstate the presidential primaries but failed to agree on a proposal in time, leaving both parties with presidential caucuses as the only option. “I think there’s been a lot of confusion because most people don’t realize that our Legislature actually voted in a flawed bill,” said Jessie Bryant, who volunteered at a caucus site near downtown Boise. “So the caucus is really just the best-case scenario to actually get an opportunity to vote for a presidential candidate and nominate them for the GOP.” One of those voters was John Graves, a fire protection engineer from Boise. He said the caucus was fast and easy, not much different from Idaho’s usual Republican primary. He anticipated the win would go to Trump. “It’s a very conservative state, so I would think that Trump will probably carry it quite easily,” Graves said. “And I like that.” The Democratic caucuses aren’t until May 23. The last GOP caucuses in Idaho were in 2012, when about 40,000 of the state’s nearly 200,000 registered Republican voters showed up to select their preferred candidate. ___ Cooper reported from Phoenix.

Jackie, a female, and Shadow, a male, are bald eagle mates who share a nest in Southern California’s San Bernardino Mountains. The nest is about 145 feet up in a pine tree with a view of Big Bear Lake. Since 2015, the nonprofit Friends of Big Bear Valley has had a webcam providing a livestream of the goings-on inside the nest ― and lately, things have gotten especially interesting. Jackie laid three eggs in January, and The Associated Press reported Thursday that the chicks could hatch soon. On early Saturday afternoon, nearly 20,000 viewers were tuned in to a YouTube livestream, participating in what multiple news outlets are calling “hatch watch.” The Saturday stream showed one of the eagles dutifully incubating the eggs as rain and wind buffeted the nest, but the parents-to-be are no strangers to inclement weather. Last month, the two were seen protecting the eggs in shifts amid a fierce snowstorm. At one point, Jackie stayed atop the eggs without a break for just under 62 hours.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) isn’t biting his tongue concerning U.S. policy toward Israel. The progressive senator has continued to support President Joe Biden on his campaign for re-election, but made an impassioned appearance Friday on “Alex Wagner Tonight” — and slammed the “absurd” policy of funding what Sanders called “an unprecedented disaster.” The ongoing conflict erupted when Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and abducted around 200 others on Oct. 7. Conditions in Gaza have worsened into a humanitarian catastrophe since: Gaza’s health ministry says over 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children. Sanders said Friday that the hunger and death in the region “makes my stomach turn.” “We are talking about hundreds of thousands of children facing starvation,” he told Wagner. “We’re talking about Israeli bombs making it impossible for humanitarian aid to get to places that it is needed, that the borders are being blockaded and aid is unable to get through.” Biden approved airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza Friday, after more than 100 Palestinians were killed and 750 others were injured when Israeli troops fired at civilians scrambling for goods from an aid convoy. The first 38,000 airdropped meals arrived Saturday. “So I think what the president is doing is an important step forward, but we need to do more,” Sanders told Wagner of the aid. “We need to tell Netanyahu and his right-wing government that they’re gonna have to open those borders.” Israel has barred the entry of food, water and medicine into Gaza since the latest hostilities began, save for scarce aid pallets entering from Egypt at the Rafah crossing in the south. The United Nations says a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are now facing starvation. The next four years will change America forever.

In survey results released Saturday by The New York Times and Siena College, 47% of 980 registered voters said that they “strongly disapprove” of Biden’s handling of his job, the highest figure for this rate in any Times/Siena poll during his presidency. The national poll, conducted in February, also shows Biden’s 43% of support trailing behind Trump’s 48%, a potential warning sign for the Democratic president. At 81, Biden has faced criticism for being the oldest sitting president in U.S. history. He has also received pushback for his handling of the current conflict in Gaza, where health officials say that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s assault since October. Meanwhile, 77-year-old Trump has more successfully unified support within his party as he seeks to retake the White House, despite his recent legal losses and upcoming trials.

The ruling came just one day after PFLAG National went to court to try to stop Paxton’s office from getting the information. Travis County District Court Judge Maria Cantú Hexsel said in an order that providing the information would harm PFLAG and its members in several ways, including violating their rights of free speech, association and protection from unreasonable searches. Additionally, the judge said, it would be a “gross invasion” of privacy. A hearing was scheduled for March 25 to give the attorney general’s office a chance to make the case for why Friday’s order shouldn’t continue. This round of litigation stems from a request Paxton’s office made in February for “documents and communications” about PFLAG CEO Brian Bond’s statement to court last year that members were setting up contingency plans after the state imposed a sweeping ban on gender-affirming care for minors. In a statement Thursday, Paxton’s office said the information is highly relevant to investigations into whether medical providers are committing insurance fraud to circumvent the ban. The ACLU, which is representing FPLAG in court, said it will seek a permanent block on Paxton’s demand “so that PFLAG can continue supporting its Texas members with transgender youth in doing what all loving parents do: supporting and caring for their children.” The next four years will change America forever.

Michael Sparks, 46, of Kentucky, jumped through a shattered window moments after another rioter smashed it with a stolen riot shield. Sparks then joined other rioters in chasing a police officer up flights of stairs, one of the most harrowing images from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. A federal jury in Washington, D.C., convicted Sparks of all six charges that he faced, including two felonies. Sparks didn’t testify at his weeklong trial. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly is scheduled to sentence him on July 9. Sparks was the “tip of the spear” and breached the Capitol building less than a minute before senators recessed to evacuate the chamber and escape from the mob, Justice Department prosecutor Emily Allen said during the trial’s closing arguments. “The defendant was ready for a civil war. Not just ready for a civil war. He wanted it,” Allen told jurors. Defense attorney Scott Wendelsdorf conceded that Sparks is guilty of the four misdemeanor counts, including trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. But he urged the jury to acquit him of the felony charges — civil disorder and obstruction of an official proceeding. Wendelsdorf accused prosecutors of trying to unfairly blame Sparks for the violence and destruction perpetrated by other rioters around him. The lawyer said Sparks immediately left the Capitol when he realized that Vice President Mike Pence wouldn’t succumb to pressure from then-President Donald Trump to overturn Biden’s victory. “Michael Sparks may have started the game, according to the government, but he was out of the game on the sidelines before the first quarter was over,” the defense attorney told jurors. Sparks traveled to Washington with a group of co-workers from an electronics and components plant in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. They attended Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House on Jan. 6. After the rally, Sparks and a co-worker, Joseph Howe, joined a crowd in marching to the Capitol. A cameraman’s video captured Howe saying, “We’re getting in that building,” before Sparks added that if Pence “does his job today, he does the right thing by the Constitution, Trump’s our president four more years.” Sparks and Howe, both wearing tactical vests, made their way to the front of the mob as outnumbered police officers retreated. “Michael Sparks was more prepared for battle than some of the police officers he encountered that day,” Allen said. Sparks was the first rioter to enter the building after Dominic Pezzola, a member of the Proud Boys extremist group, used a police shield to break the window next to the Senate Wing Door. Other rioters yelled at Sparks not to enter the building. “He jumped in anyway,” Allen said. A police officer pepper sprayed Sparks in the face as he leaped through the broken window. Undeterred, Sparks joined other rioters in chasing Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman as he retreated up the stairs and found backup from other officers near the Senate chamber. Sparks ignored commands to leave and yelled, “This is our America! This is our America!” Sparks believed that he was defending the Constitution on Trump’s behalf and that Pence had a duty to invalidate the election results, according to his attorney. “His belief was wrong, but it was sincere,” Wendelsdorf said. Allen said Sparks knew that he broke the law but wasn’t remorseful. “I’ll go again given the opportunity,” Sparks texted his mother a day after the riot. Sparks and his co-workers returned to Kentucky on Jan. 7, 2021. By then, images of him storming the Capitol had spread online. On his way home, Sparks called the Metropolitan Police Department and offered to turn himself in, according to prosecutors. He was arrested a few days later. Sparks and Howe were charged together in a November 2022 indictment. Howe pleaded guilty to assault and obstruction charges and was sentenced in October to four years and two months in prison.

Kanchha Sherpa, 91, was among the 35 members in the team that put New Zealander Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay atop the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) peak on May 29, 1953. “It would be better for the mountain to reduce the number of climbers,” Kanchha said in an interview in Kathmandu on Saturday, “Right now there is always a big crowd of people at the summit.” Since the first conquest, the peak has been climbed thousands of times, and it gets more crowded every year. During the spring climbing season in 2023, 667 climbers scaled the peak, but that brought in thousands of support staff to the base camp between the months of March and May. There have been concerns about the number of people living on the mountain for months on end, generating trash and waste, but authorities have no plans to cut down on the number of permits they issue to climbers. There are rules that require climbers to bring down their own trash, equipment and everything they carry to the mountain or risk losing their deposit, but monitoring has not been very effective. “It is very dirty now. People throw tins and wrappings after eating food. Who is going to pick them up now?” Kanchha said. “Some climbers just dump their trash in the crevasse, which would be hidden at that time but eventually it will flow down to base camp as the snow melts and carries them downward.” For the Sherpas, Everest is Qomolangma or goddess mother of the world, and is revered by their community. They generally perform religious rituals before climbing the peak. “They should not be dirtying the mountain. It is our biggest god and they should not be dirtying the gods,” he said “Qomolangma is the biggest god for the Sherpas but people smoke and eat meat and throw them on the mountain.” Kanchha was just a young man when he joined the Hillary-Tenzing expedition. He was among the three Sherpas to go to the last camp on Everest along with Hillary and Tenzing. They could not go any further because they did not have a permit. They first heard of the successful ascent on the radio, and then were reunited with the summit duo at Camp 2. The next four years will change America forever.

Only the section from the base camp to Camp 1 over the unstable Khumbu Icefall changes every year. Kanchha has four children, eight grandchildren and a 20-month-old great-granddaughter. He lives with family in Namche village in the foothills of Mount Everest, where the family runs a small hotel catering to trekkers and climbers.

(AP) — A powerful blizzard raged overnight into Saturday in the Sierra Nevada as the biggest storm of the season shut down a long stretch of Interstate-80 in California and gusty winds and heavy rain hit lower elevations, leaving tens of thousands of customers without power. Up to 10 feet (3 meters) of snow is expected in some areas. The National Weather Service said early Saturday that widespread blowing snow was creating “extremely dangerous to impossible travel conditions.” The combination of snow and high winds was most intense in the Sierra Nevada, with more than 3 inches (7 centimeters) of snow falling per hour and wind gusts over 100 mph (161 kph). “High to extreme avalanche danger” is expected in the backcountry through Sunday evening throughout the central Sierra, including the greater Lake Tahoe area, the weather service said. California authorities on Friday shut down 100 miles (160 kilometers) of I-80 due to “spin outs, high winds, and low visibility.” They had no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border just west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California. Pacific Gas & Electric reported around 7 a.m. Saturday that 27,000 households and businesses were without power. A tornado touched down Friday afternoon in Madera County and caused some damage to an elementary school, said Andy Bollenbacher, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Hanford. Some of the ski resorts that shut down Friday said they planned to remain closed on Saturday to dig out with an eye on reopening Sunday, but most said they would wait to provide updates Saturday morning. Palisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of Tahoe and site of the 1960 Winter Olympics, closed all chairlifts Saturday due to snow, wind and low visibility. The storm began barreling into the region on Thursday. A blizzard warning through Sunday morning covers a 300-mile (482-kilometer) stretch of the mountains. Some ski lovers raced up to the mountains ahead of the storm. Daniel Lavely, an avid skier who works at a Reno-area home/construction supply store, was not one of them. He said Friday that he wouldn’t have considered making the hour-drive to ski on his season pass at a Tahoe resort because of the gale-force winds. But most of his customers Friday seemed to think the storm wouldn’t be as bad as predicted, he said. “I had one person ask me for a shovel,” Lavely said. “Nobody asked me about a snowblower, which we sold out the last storm about two weeks ago.” Meteorologists predict as much as 10 feet (3 meters) of snow is possible in the mountains around Lake Tahoe by the weekend, with 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 meters) in the communities on the lake’s shores and more than a foot (30 centimeters) possible in the valleys on the Sierra’s eastern front, including Reno.

Ayesha Curry, a cookbook author and restaurateur, announced that she’s pregnant Friday in the latest issue of a magazine published by her lifestyle brand, Sweet July. She said in the cover story that she and the Golden State Warriors star had not previously planned to expand their family, but that they changed their minds about wanting more children last year. “For me, the decision came from always finding myself looking around and feeling like somebody was missing,” she said. “It started to turn my brain a little bit. Maybe somebody was missing. So we set out on this journey, knowing that this would complete our family.” She later shared how she’s approaching pregnancy differently this time around, saying that she’s “protecting my peace.” “This is such a sacred time in life that I know I’m never going to get back so I’m being a little selfish,” she said. “I’m keeping some things to myself.” Ayesha and Stephen Curry already have three children: daughters Riley, 11, and Ryan, 8; and son Canon, 5. The couple, who wed in 2011, have talked about their parenting journey on several occasions. In 2016, Stephen Curry told Parents magazine in a video interview that he’d learned to be prepared for “anything” as a dad. “You’re going to be thrown a lot of curveballs,” he said at the time.

Three planes from Air Forces Central dropped 66 bundles containing about 38,000 meals into Gaza at 8:30 a.m. EST, according to two of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity before a public announcement. The airdrop is expected to be the first of many announced by President Joe Biden on Friday. The aid will be coordinated with Jordan, which has also conducted airdrops to deliver food to Gaza. At least 115 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more wounded in the Thursday attack as they scrambled for aid, the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said. Israel says many of the dead were trampled in a chaotic crush for the food aid, and its troops fired warning shots after the crowd moved toward them in a threatening way. In the coming days, the United States will carry out airdrops of aid to Gaza, redouble our efforts to open a maritime corridor, and expand deliveries by land.The aid flowing into Gaza is nowhere near enough.We all need to do more. And the United States will do more. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Friday that the airdrops were being planned to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance in a safe way to people on the ground. The C-130 cargo plane is a widely used military aircraft to deliver aid to remote places due to its ability to land in austere environments and cargo capacity. A C-130 can airlift as much as 42,000 pounds of cargo and its crews know how to rig the cargo, which sometimes can include even vehicles, onto massive pallets can be safely dropped out of the back of the aircraft. Air Force loadmasters secure the bundles onto pallets with netting that is rigged for release in the back of a C-130, and then crews release it with a parachute when the aircraft reaches the intended delivery zone. The Air Force’s C-130 has been used in years past to air drop humanitarian into Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti and other locations and the airframe is used in an annual multi-national “Operation Christmas Drop” that air drops pallets of toys, supplies, nonperishable food and fishing supplies to remote locations in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau. Since the war began on Oct. 7, Israel has barred entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies, except for a trickle of aid entering the south from Egypt at the Rafah crossing and Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing. The United Nations says a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people face starvation. Aid officials have said that airdrops are not an efficient means of distributing aid and are a measure of last resort.

The sinking of the Rubymar comes as shipping through the crucial waterway for cargo and energy shipments moving from Asia and the Middle East to Europe has been affected by the Houthi attacks. Already, many ships have turned away from the route. The sinking could see further detours and higher insurance rates put on vessels plying the waterway — potentially driving up global inflation and affecting aid shipments to the region. The Belize-flagged Rubymar had been drifting northward after being struck by a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile on Feb. 18 in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a crucial waterway linking the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Yemen’s internationally recognized government, as well as a regional military official, confirmed the ship sank. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as no authorization was given to speak to journalists about the incident. The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, which watches over Mideast waterways, separately acknowledged the Rubymar’s sinking Saturday afternoon. The Rubymar’s Beirut-based manager could not be immediately reached for comment. Yemen’s exiled government, which has been backed by a Saudi-led coalition since 2015, said the Rubymar sank late Friday as stormy weather took hold over the Red Sea. The vessel had been abandoned for 12 days after the attack, though plans had been made to try and tow the ship to a safe port. The Iran-backed Houthis, who had falsely claimed the ship sank almost instantly after the attack, did not immediately acknowledge the ship’s sinking. The U.S. military’s Central Command previously warned the vessel’s cargo of fertilizer, as well as fuel leaking from the ship, could cause ecological damage to the Red Sea. Ahmed Awad Bin Mubarak, the prime minister of Yemen’s internationally recognized government, called the ship’s sinking “an unprecedented environmental disaster.” “It’s a new disaster for our country and our people,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Every day, we pay for the Houthi militia’s adventures, which were not stopped at plunging Yemen into the coup disaster and war.” The Houthis have held Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, since 2014, expelling the government. It’s fought a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 in a stalemated war. Satellite pictures analyzed by The Associated Press from Planet Labs PBC showed smaller boats alongside the Rubymar on Wednesday. It wasn’t immediately clear whose vessels those were. The images showed the Rubymar’s stern sinking into the Red Sea but still afloat, mirroring earlier video taken of the vessel. The private security firm Ambrey separately reported Friday about a mysterious incident involving the Rubymar. “A number of Yemenis were reportedly harmed during a security incident which took place” on Friday, Ambrey said. It did not elaborate on what that incident involved and no party involved in Yemen’s yearslong war claimed any new attack on the vessel. A satellite image taken Friday from Maxar Technologies showed new blast damage on the Rubymar not previously seen, with no other vessels around it. Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters over the Israel-Hamas war. Those vessels have included at least one with cargo bound for Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, and an aid ship later bound for Houthi-controlled territory. Despite over a month of U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi rebels remain capable of launching significant attacks. That includes the attack on the Rubymar and the downing of an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars. The Houthis insist their attacks will continue until Israel stops its combat operations in the Gaza Strip, which have enraged the wider Arab world and seen the Houthis gain international recognition.

(AP) — A movie director who was shot by Alec Baldwin during a movie rehearsal — and survived — testified Friday at trial that he was approaching the cinematographer when he heard a loud bang and felt the bullet’s impact. “It felt like someone had taken a baseball bat to my shoulder,” said Joel Souza, who was wounded by the same bullet that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the New Mexico set for the upcoming Western movie “Rust” on Oct. 21, 2021. Souza never filed a complaint but was called to testify as prosecutors pursue charges of involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence against movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who maintains her innocence. Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer on “Rust,” was separately indicted by a grand jury last month. He has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is scheduled for July. Prosecutors are reconstructing a complex chain of events that culminated in gunfire on a film set where live ammunition is expressly prohibited. Souza said his workday began before dawn with the realization that six camera-crew members had walked off set. Hutchins put out urgent calls for replacements, and filming was back underway by late-morning in an outdoor scene involving horses and wagons. Work after lunch started with positioning a camera in preparation for an extreme close-up take of Baldwin drawing a gun from a holster inside a makeshift church. Souza said he moved in behind Hutchins for a closer look at the camera angle but never saw the gun that shot him. “I got up behind her just to try to see on the monitor, and there was an incredibly loud bang,” Souza said. “This was deafening.” Baldwin and his handling of firearms on set are coming under special scrutiny in questioning by prosecutor and defense attorneys. On Thursday, prosecutors played video footage of Baldwin pressuring the movie armorer to hurry up as she reloads guns between scenes. “One more, let’s reload right away,” Baldwin says at the close of a scene. “Here we go, come on. We should have had two guns and both were reloading.” Gutierrez-Reed can be seen quickly loading a revolver. Expert witness Bryan Carpenter, a Mississippi-based specialist in firearms safety on film sets, said Baldwin’s commands infringed on basic industry safety protocols and responsibilities of the armorer. “He’s basically instructing the armorer on how to do their job ... ‘Hurry up, give it to me fast,’” Carpenter said. “Rushing with firearms and telling someone to rush with firearms is not — not normal or accepted.” On Friday, defense attorney Jason Bowles pressed Souza to remember whether the script explicitly called for Baldwin to point the gun toward the camera, where he and Hutchins were standing. “And do you know whether, from the script, whether that firearm was supposed to be pointed towards the camera?” Bowles inquired. “It’s not a matter of the script, really. For that specific shot, it was literally supposed to be the gun being pulled out sideways,” Souza said. Prosecutors say Gutierrez-Reed is to blame for unwittingly bringing live ammunition on set and that she flouted basic safety protocols for weapons — partly by leaving the church rehearsal while a gun still was in use. Defense attorneys say it wasn’t Gutierrez-Reed’s decision to leave. Souza said he only recalled seeing Gutierrez-Reed inside the church after he was shot. “I remember at one point looking up and her standing there ... distraught,” Souza said. “I remember her saying, ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Joel.’ And I remember somebody just screaming at her, and they just ushered her out.’” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dad-daughter-letters-writer-addiction_n_65d53b67e4b007e3eb7373e0","My Dad Disappeared When I Was A Kid. Years Later, I Got A Letter That Changed Both Our Lives.","geralyn broder murray","2024-03-02","During the summer I turned 14, I came home to a typewritten letter waiting for me on my bedspread. My dad had entered a drug treatment program — part of his rehabilitation was writing to his family about what he’d been through, and to apologize if necessary. Apologies were necessary. My father had disappeared five or six years before, after a custody battle and then a failure to pay child support. Since then, we’d moved away, and my mother remarried and had a second child. The few memories I had of my father were mostly of a swimming pool that made my eyes bloodshot, animals that I loved and an awful skin rash I picked up when he’d taken me to Hawaii without telling my mother. In that first letter, he explained his addiction and the consequences it had on his life, and how when trouble descended, he’d been incapable of dealing with it, so he’d stayed loaded. Now finished with an 28-day rehab program, he planned to remain in Monterey, California — a city with a historically calming effect on him since his stint at Fort Ord when he was 18. He closed the letter: “There will be a new twist to what I do, how I do it and who I choose to do it with. I am feeling stronger every day, but I didn’t get sick in one day and I don’t think I’ll get well in one month either. Would like to hear from you. Hope you understand.” I was 14. I didn’t understand. But I had a father that wanted to hear from me, so I wrote back. And then he did. And then I did. For 17 years. His letters gave me what I’d been missing during the first 14 years of my life. Every typewritten page, every piece of personal stationery with his left-handed scrawl, managed to fill another gaping hole in my heart with something like love. When I began writing for my high school newspaper and sent him my clippings, my dad, an aspiring writer with a deep wish for a published work of his own, was over the moon with praise. When I was 16, he wrote: “I enjoyed your articles and I think you show great promise.” At 17, a note from him arrived that read, “Another excellent piece! You have found your calling. I am impressed.” When I was not quite 18, he wrote to me and shared that the fun of writing had left him. He explained he was trying to remember the simple joy of getting words down on the page. “I consider you a writer,” his typewritten words on thin vellum paper proclaimed, “and any suggestions you might care to share on this or other subjects would be most welcome.” He considered me a writer. More than anything, he considered me. When my graduation from high school coincided with my mother’s second divorce, there was no money to spare for college tuition. My father — who’d finally begun paying my mother that back child support — offered to send it straight to me. This made going to college possible, eventually making me the first in my family to graduate with a degree from higher education. At 19, he bought me my first car, a used 1981 Honda Prelude. He laid out the agreement in another letter: “If you are going to drink, you may not drive under any circumstances. Wearing the Dad hat is still awkward and I am falling all over myself, please try and understand. I love you and respect you, all I want to know is how we can continue to improve our relationship.” Every letter ended the same: Much love, Dad. I used the car to get to school and work and to fulfill the requirements for my major in journalism, the choice of which was greatly influenced by my father. Once, when I mentioned changing my major to psychology, citing my love of people and desire to help them, he countered that my gift for writing was something that would help many people — and that it was a gift not everyone had to give. Plus, he was paying, so journalism it was. When I got caught up with my social life in college, ending up with average (or below average) grades, a letter arrived promptly, reminding me what I was in school to do. “If being average is OK with you at this point, you might as well french fry your hair and get over to Burger King! No one ever set out to be average!” he wrote. “The world has become an average planet and has just about sealed its fate with average people doing average work. We need excellence and we need it from you. It will take people like you — young people with original ideas — to take charge.” Reader, my grades improved, if only slightly. During college and after, I drove the Prelude from my apartment in Los Angeles to his house in Monterey so often, the car could almost find its way there without me. Dad, his wife Karen and I stayed up too late watching movies and, after Karen went to bed, Dad and I sat by the fireplace for hours and talked about the world, about writing, about life. What he didn’t share fireside arrived by mail. “It’s 2 a.m. and I feel like running. I don’t mean jogging either,” one letter read. “Sometimes, I just want to cut and run. That was my pattern. It didn’t matter if things were going well or poorly, the feeling would come over me and splitting was the only thing I could think of. I’ve simply run out of places to run so now I’m running in place.” In another letter he wrote, “I’m wrapped in the summer fog. It’s wet and heavy and is holding me inside and away from the beach and pool. Possibly, I’ll be able to write today. This is the way it always begins.” After college, I worked as an advertising copywriter. I was 26 and making $26,000 a year writing jingles. Yet, from my father’s letters, you’d think I’d won a Pulitzer. “I want you to know that I am proud of you and pleased that you are becoming what I’ve only dreamed of becoming, a writer,” he wrote. “At least one of us is going to make it.” I knew writing commercials for Subway sandwiches and Lee jeans didn’t make me special, but the words he’d sent me from his Smith-Corona did. Like every other twenty-something, I questioned the government and policy and the world. He had thoughts on all of it. Once he fished me out of a terrible relationship in person; for almost everything else, he counseled me by snail mail and eventually, email. “I know you are afraid,” he wrote, “which is not entirely a bad thing. A little reservation, concern, awareness and appreciation of the subtleties can add to your grace of movement and decision-making abilities. Go with your strength — writing, observing, making sense of disorder and assisting others by this very talent.” He added, “In your search for something positive, look in the corners. The true leaders are often anonymous. You have inherited a mixed bag of blessings and bombs. Pick your spot, dig in and make your mark.” By the time he met my now-husband, my father was already in a dark depression, yet he emerged long enough to be elated at my choice of mate. He was 57, struggling financially and trying to reinvent himself professionally. The last Christmas we spent together, December 2000, he hand-delivered what I didn’t know would be his last letter. He wrote about a new musician he’d recently discovered — Eva Cassidy — and how she’d reminded him that some moments capture our attention in a way we never forget, like the first time you hear the crack of a bat or taste fresh crab or see a shooting star. He hoped Eva would inspire me, that she would remind me how the arts hold the power to do this for us. Six months later, my father took his life.  After he died, everyone asked whether he had left a note. None had been found, but then I remembered: Yes, he had left a note. He’d left 48 of them.  Twenty-two years later, thanks to those letters, my father is still very much alive in my heart my life and the lives of my two children. If there comes a day I forget about his love for the Dodgers, Hunter S. Thompson or Miles Davis, if his passion for swimming in the ocean or remaining curious slips my mind, all I have to do is get out the yellow file with the 48 priceless pages on which his words remain, and I know they will bring him back to me, again and again.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-timing-trump-jan-6-trial-october_n_65e25845e4b005b858346cbf","Supreme Court Schedule Could Put Trump On Trial All Through Campaign’s Final Month","s.v. date","2024-03-02","WASHINGTON ― With the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to take up Donald Trump’s claim that he is immune from prosecution for his coup attempt, the former president ― and near certain Republican presidential nominee ― could be spending every weekday of the campaign’s final month sitting in a Washington, D.C., courtroom. Instead of visiting key states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, where his efforts to regain the White House will likely be decided, Trump might instead be sitting before U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, listening to his former aides testify about his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss. Instead of long speeches at rallies, Trump’s campaigning could primarily consist of his signature rants about “election interference” and a “witch hunt” as he stands outside the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Court House ― just blocks from the U.S. Capitol, which a mob of his followers attacked on Jan. 6, 2021, as part of his last-ditch attempt to retain power. “You’re going to have the spectacle of his former officials, one after the other, day after day, testifying about what he did,” said George Conway, a conservative lawyer who worked on the civil lawsuit that led to former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment and, more recently, helped writer E. Jean Carroll sue Trump for sexually abusing and defaming her. Whether such a scenario would help Trump or hurt him is unclear. Trump’s campaign aides did not respond to HuffPost queries, but much of his 2024 campaign has already been based on his supposed victimhood at the hands of the “deep state,” and it has let him glide toward winning the nomination over a field of rivals. And whether the October trial scenario comes to pass depends entirely on how quickly the Supreme Court justices issue their ruling after the scheduled oral arguments on April 22. The high court historically has moved quickly on questions about the presidency. In 1974, just 16 days after hearing oral arguments, justices ruled unanimously that President Richard Nixon had to turn over recordings he had made in the White House. Those tapes revealed he was aware of the cover-up in the Watergate scandal, and Nixon wound up resigning days after the tapes were made public. In December 2000, the Supreme Court ruled just one day after oral arguments that Florida could not conduct a statewide hand recount of presidential ballots, thereby giving the presidency to Texas Gov. George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore. If the Supreme Court rules in a similar fashion in Trump’s appeal, the case could be back in Chutkan’s hands by early May. She has previously said she would not penalize Trump’s legal team for appealing the immunity question and would give them the three months they had remaining in early December before the trial was to have started. The resulting early August trial date potentially means it would be wrapped up and a verdict issued by Election Day on Nov. 5. “This case can still go to trial if the Supreme Court moves quickly, and they should,” said Norm Eisen, a former White House lawyer in the Obama administration who worked with House Democrats in the first Trump impeachment in 2020. If, however, the court does not rule until the very end of its term in late June or early July, Chutkan’s three-month clock would push a trial start date to late September or early October. At that point, Trump’s lawyers would be out of legal arguments to delay the case any further but are almost certain to continue their political argument: claiming that it would be unfair to proceed so close to the election. Some legal experts worry that in a presidential contest, those arguments would be difficult for Chutkan to resist. “No judge is going to start a trial four weeks before the election, especially with the possibility trial might extend beyond Election Day,” said Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. To date, however, Chutkan has indicated that she will not treat Trump differently than any other criminal defendant coming before her. “The fact that he’s running a political campaign currently has to yield to the orderly administration of justice,” Chutkan said at a hearing last August. “Regardless of what is going on with his, I hate to say, his day job, this is a criminal case…. I cannot and I will not factor into my decisions the influence it will have on a political campaign on either side.” That a federal trial on the election conspiracy charges will happen at all is based on the assumption ― shared by many if not most legal experts ― that the high court will uphold a February appellate court ruling that Trump does not have immunity from prosecution over his actions while president. That it could start before the election is largely based on the presumption that justices will not send the case back to Chutkan with a demand that she hold a fact-finding hearing. Eisen said the wording of the Supreme Court’s order Wednesday accepting the case suggests that its decision will be based on the assumption that the accusations in the Jan. 6 indictment are true. “They talk about making the determination based on allegations,” he said. “That’s a reference to making the determination based on the indictment.” Conway, though, said that even if the court does send the case back to Chutkan to determine, for example, whether his attempts to overturn the election were “official” presidential duties or not, she could hold a hearing on that specific question relatively quickly over the summer, bringing in the same witnesses who will later appear at the trial. “It would be a mini-trial,” Conway said, which would have the same effect of bringing forward incriminating testimony just as the campaign season heats up. “That’s probably not going to be good for him.” The next four years will change America forever.

A New York state indictment, meanwhile, accuses him of falsifying business records to hide payments made ahead of the 2016 election to silence accusations of extramarital affairs.

So I became curious and asked the BuzzFeed Community: “Teachers, what are the automatic tell-tale signs that a parent or kid’s behavior exhibits ‘red flags’ parenting styles?” Hundreds of teachers provided their expertise and experience on the matter. Here’s what they had to say below: ""'We don't believe in bedtimes.' That's great, but your kid is massively sleep-deprived. 'We don't believe in limiting junk food.' That's great, but your kid is constipated from a steady diet of Goldfish crackers and nothing else. 'We believe in only using natural products.' That's great, but your kid's diaper rash isn't responding to your all-natural organic cream, and you need to see a doctor. It's great to have parenting ideals, but your child's needs have to come first."" —lobsterlemonlime —Natalie, 2nd grade teacher, Oklahoma ""Watching his interactions with his mom and siblings during our conference, it finally dawned on me that he was just not getting any positive attention or affection at home. And I suddenly felt so sad for him. He was really into video games, and I noticed he always wanted to talk to me about them at school. So, I started making it a point to be interested in this any time he wanted to talk. We also continued with his behavior chart, and soon, the tantrums stopped completely. I was able to develop a close and trusting relationship with him just by observing that his parents couldn’t give him the attention he needed."" —Julie, Elementary Teacher, Arizona —Sarah —savithri1189 —lameshurbay By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The sound is great for price paid. Way better than raw tv alone. The base is just enough to feel like a small personal theater placed under the bed. It’s perfect.” — Ozark “My LG Surround finally gave up at the beginning of a movie yesterday. So I went out and bought this Vizio 5.1 Surround system and All I can say is Wow. I am pleasantly surprised at the sound I get at this price point. I love that the surround speakers don’t have to be connected to the Bar under the TV. I have them behind the couch along with the Sub. The surround sound fills the room quite nicely and the sub allows us to “feel” the movie on the couch. The dialog feature is great too. It allows you to boost the voice without it being drowned by the rest of the sound. It’s plenty loud in our lil 500sq ft living room. My daughter says it’s clearly loud enough as she heard it even outside. It took about 15 minutes to get going and hooked it to the optical digital audio on the TV and adjusted the a offset and we were good to go. It has a true theater experience in our living room. We are completely satisfied with the purchase.” — Wolfy “I like the sound of this speaker system. The bass is deep enough to rattle the room when we’re watching movies or listening to music. I don’t like the fact that tha surround speakers are wired. When I purchased this system, I thought it was all wireless.” — DEEKEEBEE “I should have gotten this surround sound much sooner. Good things does come in small packages. Clear audio and this small subwoofer hits hard. It does make one feel like they are in a theater. If you’re looking to purchase one, I recommend this. Don’t waste your money on much expensive surround sound, this little facka will suffice.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/drug-recriminalization-oregon_n_65e299c5e4b013678e155b92","Oregon Lawmakers Pass Bill To Recriminalize Drug Possession","ap","2024-03-01","SALEM, Ore. (AP) — A bill recriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs was passed by the Oregon Legislature on Friday, undoing a key part of the state’s first-in-the-nation drug decriminalization law as governments struggle to respond to the deadliest overdose crisis in U.S. history. The state Senate approved House Bill 4002 in a 21-8 vote after the House passed it 51-7 on Thursday. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. Tina Kotek, who said in January that she is open to signing a bill that would roll back decriminalization, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. “With this bill, we are doubling down on our commitment to make sure Oregonians have access to the treatment and care that they need,” said Democratic Senate Majority Leader Kate Lieber, of Portland, one of the bill’s authors, adding that its passage will “be the start of real and transformative change for our justice system.” The measure makes the possession of small amounts of drugs such as heroin or methamphetamine a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail. It enables police to confiscate the drugs and crack down on their use on sidewalks and in parks. Drug treatment is to be offered as an alternative to criminal penalties. The bill also aims to make it easier to prosecute people who sell drugs. It increases access to addiction medication, and to obtain and keep housing without facing discrimination for using that medication. Decriminalization of personal-use amounts of drugs, OK’d by voters in 2020 under Ballot Measure 110, was supposed to move hundreds of millions of dollars of marijuana tax revenues into drug treatment and harm reduction programs. That didn’t translate into an improved care network for a state with the second-highest rate of substance use disorder in the nation and ranked 50th for access to treatment, according to an audit report released in 2023. And with Oregon experiencing one of the nation’s largest spikes in overdose deaths, Republican pressure intensified, and a well-funded campaign group called for a ballot measure that would further weaken Measure 110. Researchers have said it was too soon to determine whether the law contributed to the overdose surge, and supporters of the decriminalization measure say the decadeslong approach of arresting people for possessing and using drugs didn’t work. Lawmakers who opposed the bill voiced those concerns. Some called it a return to the war on drugs that disproportionally impacted and imprisoned millions of Black men. Democratic Sen. Lew Frederick, of Portland, one of four Black senators, said the bill had too many flaws and that testimony on the bill heard again and again was that substance use disorder requires primarily a medical response.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obit-iris-apfel_n_65e286c2e4b005b858347510","Iris Apfel, Fashion Icon Known For Her Eye-Catching Style, Dies At 102","beth j. harpaz","2024-03-01","NEW YORK (AP) — Iris Apfel, a textile expert, interior designer and fashion celebrity known for her eccentric style, has died. She was 102. Her death was confirmed by her commercial agent, Lori Sale, who called Apfel “extraordinary.” No cause of death was given. It was also announced on her her verified Instagram page on Friday, which a day earlier had celebrated that Leap Day represented her 102nd-and-a-half birthday. Born Aug. 29, 1921, Apfel was famous for her irreverent, eye-catching outfits, mixing haute couture and oversized costume jewelry. A classic Apfel look would, for instance, pair a feather boa with strands of chunky beads, bangles and a jacket decorated with Native American beadwork. With her big, round, black-rimmed glasses, bright red lipstick and short white hair, she stood out at every fashion show she attended. Her style was the subject of museum exhibits and a documentary film, “Iris,” directed by Albert Maysles. “I’m not pretty, and I’ll never be pretty, but it doesn’t matter,” she once said. “I have something much better. I have style.” Apfel enjoyed late-in-life fame on social media, amassing nearly 3 million followers on Instagram, where her profile declares: “More is more & Less is a Bore.” On TikTok, she drew 215,000 followers as she waxed wise on things fashion and style and promoted recent collaborations. “Being stylish and being fashionable are two entirely different things,” she said in one TikTok video. “You can easily buy your way into being fashionable. Style, I think is in your DNA. It implies originality and courage.” She never retired, telling “Today”: “I think retiring at any age is a fate worse than death. Just because a number comes up doesn’t mean you have to stop.” “Working alongside her was the honor of a lifetime. I will miss her daily calls, always greeted with the familiar question: “What have you got for me today?,” Sale said in a statement. “Testament to her insatiable desire to work. She was a visionary in every sense of the word. She saw the world through a unique lens – one adorned with giant, distinctive spectacles that sat atop her nose.” Apfel was an expert on textiles and antique fabrics. She and her husband Carl owned a textile manufacturing company, Old World Weavers, and specialized in restoration work, including projects at the White House under six different U.S. presidents. Apfel’s celebrity clients included Estee Lauder and Greta Garbo. Apfel’s own fame blew up in 2005 when the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in New York City hosted a show about her called “Rara Avis,” Latin for “rare bird.” The museum described her style as “both witty and exuberantly idiosyncratic. Her originality is typically revealed in her mixing of high and low fashions — Dior haute couture with flea market finds, 19th-century ecclesiastical vestments with Dolce & Gabbana lizard trousers.” The museum said her “layered combinations” defied “aesthetic conventions” and “even at their most extreme and baroque” represented a “boldly graphic modernity.” The Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, was one of several museums around the country that hosted a traveling version of the show. Apfel later decided to donate hundreds of pieces to the Peabody — including couture gowns — to help them build what she termed “a fabulous fashion collection.” The Museum of Fashion & Lifestyle near Apfel’s winter home in Palm Beach, Florida, also plans a gallery dedicated to displaying items from Apfel’s collection. Apfel was born in New York City to Samuel and Sadye Barrel. Her mother owned a boutique. Apfel’s fame in her later years included appearances in ads for brands like M.A.C. cosmetics and Kate Spade. She also designed a line of accessories and jewelry for Home Shopping Network, collaborated with H&M on a sold-out-in-minutes collection of brightly-colored apparel, jewelry and shoes, put out a makeup line with Ciaté London, an eyeglass collection with Zenni and partnered with Ruggable on floor coverings.

In a 2017 interview with AP at age 95, she said her favorite contemporary designers included Ralph Rucci, Isabel Toledo and Naeem Khan, but added: “I have so much, I don’t go looking.” Asked for her fashion advice, she said: “Everybody should find her own way. I’m a great one for individuality. I don’t like trends.

Under the proposed regulation, breaking, damaging or losing wheelchairs or other mobility devices would qualify as a violation of the Air Carrier Access Act, a law that bars airlines from discriminating on the basis of disability. In 2023, airlines mishandled more than 11,000 wheelchairs and scooters, according to the department. The proposed changes would also require airlines to provide annual training for employees who physically assist disabled passengers. “There are millions of Americans with disabilities who do not travel by plane because of inadequate airline practices and inadequate government regulation, but now we are setting out to change that,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement on Thursday. “This new rule would change the way airlines operate to ensure that travelers using wheelchairs can travel safely and with dignity.” The new regulation is among several that the DOT has brought forward in recent years to bolster protections for disabled passengers and make air travel more accessible. In 2022, the DOT published a “bill of rights” for disabled passengers. Last year, the department issued a regulation requiring, among other things, that new single-aisle aircrafts with a minimum of 125 seats have larger, wheelchair-accessible bathrooms with accessibility features. While disability rights advocates are excited to see efforts made to improve air travel, many are worried the new regulations will run up against a deadline that could prevent them from moving forward. Under the Congressional Review Act, executive branch agencies are required to report their rulemaking activities to Congress to give lawmakers a chance to strike down new rules. A provision within the also allows for a new Congress to review and act on rules from the previous session during a specific time period. Mia Ives-Rublee, the director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress, told HuffPost she and others in the disability community are worried that the proposed rules for airlines, as well as pending regulations that have been proposed by the Department of Justice and other agencies to support disabled Americans, could be wiped away if Donald Trump retakes the presidency. “If there is a change in administration for the following year, that administration could just strip all those changes with sort of a stroke of a pen,” Ives-Rublee explained. “So we want to try and get these things done as soon as possible, and that means that we need the… agencies to act as soon as possible so that we aren’t running into that deadline.” In an emailed statement to HuffPost, a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation said that the proposed changes will be published in the Federal Register and will be open to public comment for 60 days. “The Department views this issue as a priority and will work expeditiously to review the public comments and determine how to proceed consistent with federal requirements,” the spokesperson said. Ives-Rublee adds that while she’s happy that the regulations have been proposed, she wants to see the department branch out and address other, more immediate transportation-related concerns of the disability community, such as the shortcomings of paratransit and public transportation systems.

Similarly, paratransit services are specialized, door-to-door transportation for disabled people, but data shows that people experience long wait times, unreliable service and lack of compliance with standards set by federal disability law when using paratransit. “It is important that the airlines fix what they’re doing, and these regulations are important,” Ives-Rublee said. “I’m just saying there are also other regulations that need to be completed, or even just reviewed, to address the concerns of folks who utilize public transportation and paratransit that have significant needs.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), one of the country’s largest LGBTQ+ rights groups, filed complaints with the Department of Education and the Department of Justice following Benedict’s death on Feb. 8. Benedict died one day after a fight with three other Owasso High School students, putting a spotlight on the culture of fear and harassment facing LGBTQ+ students in Oklahoma and beyond. “This letter is to notify you that the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), is opening for investigation the above-referenced complaint that you filed against the Owasso Public Schools (the District),” wrote Karen Mines, the Education Department’s regional director, in a letter to HRC. “Your complaint alleges that the District discriminated against students by failing to respond appropriately to sex-based harassment, of which it had notice, at Owasso High School during the 2023-2024 school year.” The letter also notes that the Office for Civil Rights will investigate whether the district failed to follow Title IX guidelines when responding to sex-based harassment. Current Title IX law includes language that protects transgender students in any school or educational program that receives federal funding. Brock Crawford, a spokesperson for the Owasso Public School District, confirmed by email that the district received a notice of the investigation from the Office for Civil Rights. “The district is committed to cooperating with federal officials and believes the complaint submitted by HRC is not supported by the facts and is without merit,” Crawford said in the email. In the days since news broke about Benedict’s death, dozens of organizations have accused Oklahoma’s state superintendent, Ryan Walters, of creating a hostile environment for LGBTQ+ and two-spirit students. The conservative superintendent has faced backlash for appointing Chaya Raichik, the woman behind the far-right social media account Libs of TikTok, to a voluntary seat on the state’s library review committee. In 2022, Libs of TikTok targeted one of Benedict’s eighth-grade teachers, Tyler Wrynn, prompting them to resign because of the harassment. On Wednesday more than 300 advocacy and LGBTQ+ organizations called for Walters’ immediate removal, stating that his choice to appoint Raichik, as well as his emergency rule to block a trans Oklahoma teen from changing his gender on his school records, have created a “culture where rampant harassment of 2SLGBTQ+ students has been allowed to go unchecked.” The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-republicans-seek-political-cover-behind-useless-ivf-resolutions_n_65e267fae4b0d2a247596cba","House Republicans Seek Political Cover Behind Useless IVF Resolutions","alanna vagianos","2024-03-01","House Republicans are all talk and no action on protecting Americans’ access to in vitro fertilization, after the Alabama Supreme Court granted embryos the same legal status as children last month. Several House Republicans introduced two measures this week following the sweeping court ruling as a way to express strong support for IVF protections. Both resolutions list critical facts about IVF, note the importance of patient access and applaud fertility specialists for the work they do. One of the two even goes on to condemn the judicial ruling out of Alabama. But neither have any legislative power. Resolutions are non-binding statements that primarily serve as tools for political posturing. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) announced her resolution on Thursday, which expresses “support for continued access to fertility care and assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization.” The resolution was co-sponsored by five other House Republicans: Reps. David Schweikert (Ariz.), Anthony D’Esposito (N.Y.), Jeff Van Drew (N.J.), Jen Kiggans (Va.) and Don Bacon (Neb.). Four out of the five co-sponsors represent districts that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, and are likely vulnerable to losing their seat in November. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.) published her resolution, with Republican co-sponsors Reps. Michelle Steel (Calif.) and Juan Ciscomani (Ariz.), on Friday morning. The resolution states that the House “remains committed to commonsense policies that enable families to grow” as well as “recognizes the fundamental truth that life is precious.” “As someone who struggled with infertility and personally witnessed the miracle of IVF, I strongly believe that IVF should remain protected and accessible,” Steel tweeted along with Chavez-DeRemer’s announcement of the non-binding resolution. D’Esposito responded to HuffPost’s request for comment in an emailed statement. “Democrats’ misleading smear campaign cannot distort the fact that I’ve been fighting on Capitol Hill since day one to ensure women are empowered to make their own individual healthcare decisions by opposing any attempt to institute a nationwide abortion ban and advancing legislation that supports women’s access to important fertility resources like IVF treatments,” D’Esposito said. The House Republican took office in January 2023 and voted to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, legislation based on a misleading premise that sought to “interfere with evidence-based medicine,” as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists described it. None of the other eight representatives responded to HuffPost’s request for comment. Republicans have found themselves scrambling to distance themselves from the Alabama ruling in the wake of national public outrage over its sweeping effect. Access to IVF is an issue over 80% of Americans support, including a majority of Republican voters. Campaigning on far-right policies that galvanize a strong but extreme subsection of the GOP base may prove risky for Republicans. Without the guardrails of Roe v. Wade, reproductive health care restrictions that are broadly unpopular can be enacted by GOP-led states. The next four years will change America forever.

Mace, Steel, Schweikert and Bacon were co-sponsors of the 2021 Life at Conception Act, an anti-abortion bill that aimed to grant full legal rights to embryos from “the moment of fertilization.” The Senate version of the bill had a carve-out to protect IVF, but the House version did not. The House bill had 166 Republican co-sponsors when it was first introduced in 2021, and 124 co-sponsors when it was re-introduced in 2023. “House Republicans are flagrant hypocrites who have spent their entire tenure in the majority attacking reproductive rights at every turn,” Courtney Rice, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told HuffPost. “Now, they are hiding behind toothless resolutions and empty public statements because they know their relentless attacks on reproductive freedoms will cost them at the ballot box.” Similar to House Republicans’ approach, Senate Republicans have been reluctant to discuss their support of IVF, particularly after Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) blocked a bill this week that would have protected access to IVF on the federal level. Democrats have a companion measure they are still pushing in the House.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elijah-mcclain-paramedic-sentenced_n_65e26cdee4b005b858346ec5","Paramedic Gets 5 Years In Prison For Elijah McClain’s Death In Rare Case Against Medical Responders","colleen slevin , matthew brown","2024-03-01","DENVER (AP) — A Colorado paramedic was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for the death of Elijah McClain in a rare prosecution of medical responders that has left officials rethinking how they treat people in police custody. The convictions of Peter Cichuniec and a fellow paramedic sent shock waves through the ranks of paramedics across the U.S. and thrust their profession into the acrimonious fight over social justice sparked by the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Cichuniec and Jeremy Cooper were both convicted in December of criminally negligent homicide for administering the sedative ultimately blamed for killing McClain, a 23-year-old Black massage therapist, in 2019. Cichuniec was also convicted the more serious charge of second-degree assault for giving a drug without consent or a legitimate medical purpose. McClain’s mother, Sheneen, raised her fist in the air as she left the courtroom following Friday’s sentencing, as she’s done after previous hearings. Cichuniec had faced up to 16 years in prison on the assault charge, and the five-year sentence was the minimum the judge could have given Cichuniec under sentencing guidelines. Someone from Cichuniec’s family called out, “Love you Pete” as he looked back and waved at them before leaving court in handcuffs. In testimony before the sentence was handed down by Judge Mark Warner, Sheneen McClain said she once dreamed of being a firefighter and considered them heroes “until the day they took my son’s life.” “You are a local hero no more,” she said as Cichuniec sat with his attorneys at a nearby table. “Next time, think for yourself and do not follow the direction of a crowd of cowards.” She added that the other paramedics could have intervened “simply by just saying, ‘Stop hurting my patient.’” Cichuniec — who has been in custody since his conviction and was handcuffed and shackled for the hearing — asked the judge for mercy. He wiped away tears as family members and friends testified as character witnesses on his behalf, and later told the judge he had spent his 18-year career as a firefighter and paramedic putting his own life on the line and putting other lives before his own. “I have never backed down from a call and I’ve had more things happen to me than you can imagine,” he said. “It sickened me when the prosecution said during their closing argument that I showed no remorse for Elijah. ... There was absolutely no intent to cause any harm to Elijah McClain.” Cichuniec’s wife said after the hearing she was “relatively relieved” by the outcome since it was the most lenient sentence her husband could have received. “It’s almost better knowing,” Katy Cichuniec said. Firefighters and officials from their union have criticized the state’s prosecution of Cichuniec and said it was discouraging firefighters from becoming paramedics, decreasing the number of qualified personnel in emergencies and thereby putting lives at risk. “Convicting Pete for the death is not justice. It’s the very definition of a scapegoat,” said former Aurora Fire Lieutenant John Lauder, who recently retired after working with Cichuniec over two decades. “But for the grace of God, it could be us in jail. The result of this decision will have a negative impact on patient care throughout the nation. Will paramedics now be held be held responsible for outcomes beyond their control?” McClain’s death received little attention initially but gained renewed interest as mass protests swept the nation in 2020, with his name becoming a rallying cry for critics of racial injustice in policing. McClain was stopped by police after a 911 caller reported he looked suspicious walking down the street waving his arms and wearing a face mask on Aug. 24, 2019, in the Denver suburb of Aurora. McClain, who had been listening to music with earbuds, seemed caught off guard when an officer put his hands on him within seconds of approaching him. That began a struggle including a neck hold and a restraint that lasted about 20 minutes before McClain was injected with 500 milligrams of ketamine. He suffered cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital and was taken off life support three days later. Experts testified that the sedative ultimately killed McClain, who was already weakened from struggling to breathe while being pinned down after inhaling vomit into his lungs during the struggle with police. Prosecutors said the paramedics did not conduct basic medical checks of McClain, such as taking his pulse, before giving him the ketamine. The dose was too much for someone of his size — 140 pounds (64 kilograms), experts testified. Prosecutors say they also did not monitor McClain immediately after giving him the sedative but instead left him lying on the ground, making it harder to breathe. The case highlighted gaps in medical procedures for sedations of people in police custody that experts said must be addressed so more deaths can be prevented.

Trump is challenging a groundbreaking decision by the Colorado Supreme Court that said he is disqualified from being president again and ineligible for the state’s primary, which is Tuesday. The resolution of the case on Monday, a day before Super Tuesday contests in 16 states, would remove uncertainty about whether votes for Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, will ultimately count. Both sides had requested fast work by the court, which heard arguments less than a month ago, on Feb. 8, The Colorado court was the first to invoke a post-Civil War constitutional provision aimed at preventing those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. Trump also has since been barred from primary ballot in Illinois and Maine, though both decisions, along with Colorado’s, are on hold pending the outcome of the Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court has until now never ruled on the provision, Section 3 of the 14th amendment. The court indicated Sunday there will be at least one case decided Monday, adhering to its custom of not saying which one. But it also departed from its usual practice in some respects, heightening the expectation that it’s the Trump ballot case that will be handed down. Except for when the end of the term nears in late June, the court almost always issues decisions on days when the justices are scheduled to take the bench. But the next scheduled court day isn’t until March 15. And apart from during the coronavirus pandemic when the court was closed, the justices almost always read summaries of their opinions in the courtroom. They won’t be there Monday.

Separately, the justices last week agreed to hear arguments in late April over whether Trump can be criminally prosecuted on election interference charges, including his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The court’s decision to step into the politically charged case, also with little in the way of precedent to guide it, calls into question whether Trump will stand trial before the November election. The former president faces 91 criminal charges in four prosecutions. Of those, the only one with a trial date that seems poised to hold is his state case in New York, where he’s charged with falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to a porn actor. That case is set for trial on March 25, and the judge has signaled his determination to press ahead.

I’m just scrolling, minding my own business, and just saw a headline that had to do with my own family,” she began her video message on Instagram. “The headline basically says there is no more joy in my husband. Now, I can just tell you, that is far from the truth.” She continued, “Stop scaring people to think that once they get a diagnosis of some kind of neurocognitive disease that ‘That’s it. It’s over. Let’s pack it up. Nothing else to see here, we’re done.’ No. It is the complete opposite of that, okay?” Heming Willis said despite experiencing “grief and sadness,” her family’s “new chapter” is filled with love, connection, joy and happiness. She added: “That’s where we are. So stop with these stupid headlines. These stupid clickbaity things that freak people out. Stop doing that. There’s nothing to see here, okay?”. The British model got married to the “Pulp Fiction” actor in 2009 after two years of dating. The pair share two daughters: Mabel Ray Willis, 11, and Evelyn Penn Willis, 9. He’s also a dad to daughters Rumer Glenn Willis, 35; Scout LaRue Willis, 32; and Tallulah Belle Willis, 30; whom he welcomed with ex-wife Demi Moore. Heming Willis’ more than 925k followers showed support for her in the comments section of her post. “Completely unfair. There is so much joy ❤,” one person wrote. Another said, “THIS!! I often told people that my mom and I lived such a full life with her dementia. It is not the end, it’s a NEW CHAPTER so well said.” “There is JOY!!! Thank you for talking about this. I actively try to push against the tragedy narrative every day,” someone else added. Heming Willis doubled down on her request for the media to be “mindful” of how they report about dementia in the caption of her post. “To whom it may concern, please be mindful how you frame your story’s [sic] to the public about dementia and dig deeper.

And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate cease-fire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table” Harris said Sunday in Selma, Alabama. Harris made her appearance at the Edmund Pettus Bridge for a speech on the anniversary of “Bloody Sunday.” “This will get the hostages out and a significant amount of aid in. This would allow us to build something more enduring to ensure Israel is secure and to respect the right of the Palestinian people to dignity, freedom and self-determination,” she added. Harris’ remarks followed President Joe Biden’s recently watered-down optimism for the 6-week cease-fire, as well as his Friday approval of sending humanitarian aid into Gaza. Earlier this week, a White House official said that the Israelis “have more or less accepted” the cease-fire proposal, which both Israel and Hamas militants would need to agree to. Harris’ push for the cease-fire also comes days after Israel Defense Forces killed more than 100 people and injured more than 750 others who gathered outside of food aid trucks for food. “The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses,” said Harris. “As President Joe Biden said on Friday, the United States is committed to urgently get more lifesaving assistance, to innocent Palestinians in need. Yesterday, the Department of Defense carried out its first airdrop of humanitarian assistance. And the United States will continue these airdrops. And we will work on a new route, by sea, to deliver aid,” she added. The current conflict most recently stems from Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in Israel where the Palestinian militant group killed 1,200 people and took approximately 250 others hostage ― but tensions between Israel and Gaza, as well as Israel’s atrocities against the people in the region, began further back. Since Oct. 7, Israel has killed more than 30,200 people and injured more than 71,000 others in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Many more are facing starvation. “Vice President Harris’s push for a temporary cease-fire, or what the administration used to call a humanitarian pause, is half a step forward,” IfNotNow national spokesperson Eva Borgwardt said in a statement emailed to HuffPost.

A veteran of the football world, Mortensen was a two-time Pulitzer Prize nominee and recipient of the Pro Football Writers of America’s Dick McCann Award. ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro reacted to Mortensen’s passing in a statement on Sunday, saying, “Mort was widely respected as an industry pioneer and universally beloved as a supportive, hardworking teammate.” “He covered the NFL with extraordinary skill and passion, and was at the top of his field for decades,” Pitaro continued. “He will truly be missed by colleagues and fans, and our hearts and thoughts are with his loved ones.” Mortensen got his start as a newspaper reporter and made his first appearance on ESPN in 1991. He sparked the NFL’s 2015 “Deflategate” scandal after reporting that the New England Patriots had surreptitiously used underinflated balls during the AFC championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. In 2016, the Torrance, California, native shared that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer. He announced his retirement from ESPN in a post on X, formerly Twitter, in September last year, writing that he wanted to “focus on my health, family and faith.” He is survived by his wife, Micki Mortensen, and their son, Alex Mortensen.

In a letter sent Friday to Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger, Susan DeCarava, president of NewsGuild of New York, said that union-backed journalists who raised concerns about the paper’s approach to covering Gaza were being “targeted for their national origin, ethnicity and race, creating an ominous chilling-effect across the newsroom and effectively silencing necessary and critical internal discussion.” The Times launched an internal leak probe, which was first reported on by Vanity Fair, after The Intercept published an exposé in January revealing that the newspaper’s flagship podcast, “The Daily,” had canceled a planned episode of a Times investigative report alleging Hamas militants “weaponized sexual violence” when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7. According to the exposé, the episode was shelved after the December report could not pass a fact check and had faced questions of credibility from staff and the public. A Times spokesperson denied the allegation to The Intercept after the exposé’s publication and defended the original reporting in statements to other outlets. In response to the exposé, the Times’ leadership launched a weekslong investigation to find the alleged whistleblower who leaked information to The Intercept. In her letter, DeCarava said that guild members “asserted their protected right to union representation” when they were called into meetings with management’s investigators. “What we have learned about these meetings is shocking,” she wrote. “Rather than simple information-gathering, the meetings became a vehicle for the harassment and intimidation of our members.” NewsGuild president Susan DeCarava sent a letter to NYT publisher A.G. Sulzberger today accusing Times management of targeting journalists “for their national origin, ethnicity and race” in the leak investigation pic.twitter.com/BPb7DlW4xZ According to DeCarava, staff who are part of the company’s Middle Eastern and North African employee resource group experienced “particularly hostile questioning” from Times management, including queries related to their involvement in the group as well as their opinions on the paper’s coverage. Management’s investigators reportedly also ordered those employees to provide the names of all active members in the group and demanded copies of personal communications between colleagues about their concerns related to the paper’s Gaza coverage, according to a separate statement sent Friday to guild members. Some of the employees who were called in for questioning “had no connection to the production of The Daily episode, except for the fact that they raised concerns” to standards editors about the original reporting, according to DeCarava’s letter. “These members went above and beyond to follow company policies in bringing feedback internally to Standards, as The Times encourages its journalists to do,” she wrote. Last week, The Intercept published a follow-up story questioning the credibility of the Times’ sexual violence investigation. The story revealed that the Times hired Anat Schwartz to co-author the December report, despite being an Israeli filmmaker with no journalism experience who was found to have engaged with genocidal anti-Palestinian rhetoric on social media. A Times spokesperson told The Daily Beast that Schwartz’s social media activity was “unacceptable” and being reviewed by the company. The Intercept’s follow-up said that while the Times’ editorial process specifically in the sexual violence report has drawn scrutiny, staffers at the legacy paper have long been concerned over the direction of the Times’ Israel-Hamas coverage. “As a union, we do not tolerate harassment and racial targeting of our members,” DeCarava wrote in her letter. “We demand that The Times cease what has become a destructive and racially targeted witch hunt.” The next four years will change America forever.

(Ahem... The word you were looking for was “himbo,” Mr. Skarsgard.) “We didn’t have to be anything but look cute and be silly,” he added. “There’s only one thing that was asked of us and that was, ‘Have fun because if we don’t have fun, it won’t be a film.’” In the film, Skarsgard played one of three men who might be the father of lead character Sophie, played by Amanda Seyfried.

On Thursday, the country singer showed off her new hairdo on Instagram. “Color my hair, do what I dare! 💅,” Twain captioned the photo of herself sporting wavy rose gold strands. While Twain, 58, has never shied away from switching up her hairstyles — including donning neon red hair at last year’s Grammy ceremony — her fans couldn’t help but react to the star’s most recent change, with some claiming they “don’t even recognize” her. One fan wrote, “This look gives me kardashian vibes,” while another added, “I don’t even recognize you.” Someone else said, “Lovely…but…it doesn’t look like you anymore.” Other fans accused the “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” crooner of secretly going under the knife. “I think ya might have done more than color your hair sis😂. Your looking good!!!” someone commented. Another added, “I wish she would [stop] doing work on her face. So unnecessary!” Many of Twain’s more than 2 million followers stepped in to defend her against the negative comments. “Waiting for all the boomers in the comments “I MISS THE OLD SHAINIA” 🙄 mama looks 🔥🔥🔥,” one person wrote. Another said, “SERIOUS QUESTION!! DOES THIS WOMAN AGE?? 🔥.” Reps for Twain didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Though the Canadian singer-songwriter has not publicly addressed the surgery rumors, she previously ruled out the idea of undergoing cosmetic procedures.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/caitlin-clark-breaks-ncaa-scoring-record-basketball_n_65e4cb6ce4b013678e15b5cd","Iowa Basketball Star Caitlin Clark Breaks NCAA Division I Scoring Record","eric olson","2024-03-03","Caitlin Clark stood alone at the free throw line on Sunday and made the foul shots that left her standing alone atop the all-time NCAA Division I scoring chart. The flash and pizzazz of her game have made her the biggest name in all of college basketball. Yet it was two free throws after a technical foul that pushed Clark past the late Pete Maravich’s 54-year-old record in No. 6 Iowa’s 93-83 win over No. 2 Ohio State. Clark entered the game in Iowa City needing 18 points to pass Maravich’s total of 3,667, amassed in just 83 games over three seasons at LSU (1967-70). She finished with 35 to run her total to 3,685 in 130 games. Maravich’s mark fell four days after Clark broke Lynette Woodard’s major college women’s record with 33 points against Minnesota on Wednesday. Best known for her long 3-pointers, Clark was called on to go to the foul line after Cotie McMahon was assessed a technical for giving her a little push during a dead ball with less than a second to go in the first half. Clark had no immediate reaction after the second shot went through, as if it hadn’t sunk in yet. Asked in a television interview at halftime if she was aware of the record when she stepped to the line, Clark said: “Not really. When they announced it and everybody screamed, that’s when I knew.” Then the celebration was on, with Clark jumping around and pumping her fists in the air. She had gotten off to a slow start Sunday. Her first shot was a 3-pointer that bounced off the rim. She missed a layup and from deep on the right wing before making a 3 from the left side for her first basket. After starting 2 for 7, she made 3 of her next 4 shots — including three straight 3s, each deeper than the previous. Woodard was among the attendees at Carver-Hawkeye Arena to help Clark celebrate senior day. Also on hand were basketball great Maya Moore, who was Clark’s favorite player, and Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan. “It’s a great time for women’s basketball,” Woodard said in a television interview. “Caitlin is leading the way. As she was chipping away, I said records are made to be broken. Also, they’re made to be honored. Because of her, my records are being honored. She’s gone beyond that now, she’s gone beyond Pete ... I passed her the baton to go ahead and burst through that ceiling, and I’m so happy for her.” On Thursday, Clark announced she would enter the 2024 WNBA draft and skip the fifth year of eligibility available to athletes who competed during the COVID-19 pandemic. She is projected to be the No. 1 overall pick by the Indiana Fever, and the WNBA already is seeing a rise in ticket sales. Logitix, which researches prices on ticket resale platforms, reported an average sale price of $598 for a ticket to Sunday’s game purchased since Feb. 1. Kiran Nanjappa, who was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and now lives in Denver, said he paid more than $200 for his ticket. “She’s a truly once-in-a-lifetime player,” he said. “I’ve been watching Iowa basketball for 40 years, and I’ve never seen a player like her, men’s or women’s. I’ll just say this — I paid more to see her today than I paid to see Michael Jordan three times at the end of his career. And I never thought I’d say that.” Clark is all but assured of one or two more appearances at the arena in Iowa City. Iowa is projected to be a No. 2 seed for the NCAA Tournament, meaning it would be at home for the first two rounds. Pearl Moore of Francis Marion owns the overall women’s record with 4,061 points from 1975-79 at the small-college level in the AIAW. Moore had 177 points at Anderson Junior College before enrolling at Francis Marion. Clark is 376 points behind Moore, and she has only two to nine more games left in an Iowa uniform depending on how far the Hawkeyes advance in the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments. The fall of Maravich’s record is subject to scrutiny. Maravich’s all-time scoring mark is one of the more remarkable in sports history. There was no shot clock or 3-point line in his era. The 3-point line was adopted in 1986. Maravich averaged 44.2 points per game. He scored more than 60 in a game four times, topping out at 69 against Alabama on Feb. 7, 1970. Clark averages 28.3 points for her career. Her career-best output was 49 points against Michigan on Feb. 15, when she passed Kelsey Plum as the NCAA women’s Division I career scoring leader. Clark has 55 games with at least 30 points, the most of any player in men’s or women’s college basketball over the last 25 years. She has six triple-doubles this season and 17 in her career.

In an interview with People published Saturday, Asghari insisted that he’s not down to “talk badly about each other” post-divorce, despite being the one who ended his and Spears’ relationship. “I’ve always hated people leaving a certain relationship — and at some point they told each other they love each other and they sat at the same table and ate food [together] — so I never understood when people part ways [and] they talk badly about each other,” he said. “That’s something I’m never going to do because I had nothing but an amazing experience and a great life, and that’s always going to be part of my life, a chapter of my life,” he continued. The actor went on to call his former ties to the pop star a “blessing.” “It was a blessing to be able to share life with someone for a long time. And people grow apart and people move on,” Asghari said. Reps for Spears didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Asghari and Spears first started dating in 2016 after he appeared in the music video for her song, “Slumber Party.” The model tied the knot with the “Toxic” singer in June 2022. They ended their marriage 14 months later, after Asghari filed for divorce from Spears in August last year, citing “irreconcilable differences.” In Spears’ bombshell memoir, “The Woman in Me,” which she finished writing before Asghari filed for divorce, she called him a “gift from God.” After news broke of the pair’s divorce, the Grammy-winning artist revealed she was “shocked” by the split on social media.

An Israeli Strike Killed Them Both.","wafaa shurafa , samy magdy","2024-03-03","RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — It took 10 years and three rounds of in vitro fertilization for Rania Abu Anza to become pregnant, and only seconds for her to lose her five-month-old twins, a boy and a girl. An Israeli strike hit the home of her extended family in the southern Gaza city of Rafah late Saturday, killing her children, her husband and 11 other relatives and leaving another nine missing under the rubble, according to survivors and local health officials. She had woken up at around 10 p.m. to breastfeed Naeim, the boy, and went back to sleep with him in one arm and Wissam, the girl, in the other. Her husband was sleeping beside them. The explosion came an hour and a half later. The house collapsed. “I screamed for my children and my husband,” she said Sunday, as she sobbed and cradled a baby’s blanket to her chest. “They were all dead. Their father took them and left me behind.” She closed her eyes, leaned her head against the wall and patted the bundle in a calming gesture that, finally, she’d had the chance to give. (GRAPHIC PHOTO BELOW: Image depicts death) Israeli airstrikes have regularly hit crowded family homes since the start of the war in Gaza, even in Rafah, which Israel declared a safe zone in October but is now the next target of its devastating ground offensive. The strikes often come without warning, usually in the middle of the night. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on the Hamas militant group because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in dense residential areas. But the military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The military did not immediately comment on this strike. Of the 14 people killed in the Abu Anza house, six were children and four were women, according to Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the hospital where the bodies were taken. In addition to her husband and children, Rania also lost a sister, a nephew, a pregnant cousin and other relatives. Farouq Abu Anza, a relative, said about 35 people were staying at the house, some of whom had been displaced from other areas. He said they were all civilians, mostly children, and that there were no militants among them. Rania and her husband, Wissam, both 29, spent a decade trying to get pregnant. Two rounds of IVF had failed, but after a third, she learned she was pregnant early last year. The twins were born on Oct. 13. Her husband, a day laborer, was so proud he insisted on naming the girl after himself, she said. “I didn’t get enough of them,” she said. “I swear I didn’t get enough of them.” Less than a week earlier, Hamas-led militants had stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack, rampaging through communities, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and taking around 250 hostages, including children and a newborn. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. The war has killed over 30,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Around 80% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled their homes, and a quarter of the population faces starvation. The ministry said last month that more than 12,300 Palestinian children and young teens had been killed in the war, about 43% of the overall toll. Women and children together make up three quarters of those killed. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its tallies. Israel claims to have killed over 10,000 Hamas fighters but has not provided evidence. For the children who survive, the war has made life hellish, humanitarian workers say, with some in northern Gaza beyond the reach of care. “The sense of helplessness and despair among parents and doctors in realizing that lifesaving aid, just a few kilometers away, is being kept out of reach, must be unbearable, but worse still are the anguished cries of those babies slowly perishing under the world’s gaze,” UNICEF regional director Adele Khodr said in a statement Sunday. Until Saturday, the Abu Anza family had been relatively fortunate. Rafah has been spared the immense destruction of northern Gaza and the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israeli tanks and ground troops have fought militants block by block after waves of airstrikes. Rafah is also in the shrinking area of Gaza where humanitarian aid can still be delivered. But Israel has said Rafah will be next, and the roughly 1.5 million people who have sought refuge there will be relocated, without saying where. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-bloody-sunday-march_n_65e49b66e4b0d2a24759c0f9","Kamala Harris To Join In Marking 59th Anniversary Of Bloody Sunday","associated press","2024-03-03","SELMA, Ala. (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to be among those marking the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the day Alabama law officers attacked Civil Rights demonstrators on the iconic Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The demonstrators were beaten by officers as they tried to march across Alabama on March 7, 1965, in support of voting rights. A march across the bridge, which is a highlight of the commemoration in Selma every year, is planned for Sunday afternoon. Sunday’s march is among dozens of events during the annual Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee, which began Thursday and culminates Sunday. The events commemorate Bloody Sunday and the signing of the Voting Rights Act. “During her speech, the Vice President will honor the legacy of the civil rights movement, address the ongoing work to achieve justice for all, and encourage Americans to continue the fight for fundamental freedoms that are under attack throughout the country,” the White House said in announcing her visit. Harris joined the march in 2022, calling the site hallowed ground and giving a speech calling on Congress to defend democracy by protecting people’s right to vote. On that anniversary, Harris spoke of marchers whose “peaceful protest was met with crushing violence.” “They were kneeling when the state troopers charged,” she said then. “They were praying when the billy clubs struck.” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland was also expected to participate in Sunday’s events, the Department of Justice announced. Images of the violence at the bridge stunned Americans, which helped galvanize support for passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The law struck down barriers prohibiting Black people from voting. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, a Democrat of South Carolina who is leading a pilgrimage to Selma, said he is seeking to “remind people that we are celebrating an event that started this country on a better road toward a more perfect union,” but the right to vote is still not guaranteed. Clyburn sees Selma as the nexus of the 1960s movement for voting rights, at a time when there currently are efforts to scale back those rights. “The Voting Rights Act of 1965 became a reality in August of 1965 because of what happened on March 7th of 1965,” Clyburn said. “We are at an inflection point in this country,” he added. “And hopefully this year’s march will allow people to take stock of where we are.” Clyburn said he hopes the weekend in Alabama would bring energy and unity to the civil rights movement, as well as benefit the city of Selma. “We need to do something to develop the waterfront, we need to do something that bring the industry back to Selma,” Clyburn said. “We got to do something to make up for them having lost that military installation down there that provided all the jobs. All that goes away, there’s nothing to keep young people engaged in developing their communities.” ___ Associated Press reporters Stephen Groves in Washington, D.C., and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.

Can You Help Me Find Them Using These Clues?","kathryn sheldon","2024-03-03","If there’s one thing a cold, gray, post-holiday January in New York City demands, it’s an escape to a warmer climate (should you be lucky enough to be able to afford it and make it work). After close to 20 years in the city, I’d never been to Puerto Rico — even though it’s just a few hours away by plane — and neither had my boyfriend, Alex, so we decided on San Juan for our first vacation together. On January 8, we took a walk along the Paseo del Morro. It’s a scenic and historic path along the walls of Old San Juan, offering incredible views of the seaside and encounters with the many cats that hide from the sun among the rocks along the water. The path eventually leads up to the Castillo San Felipe del Morro, a large fortress constructed between 1539 and 1790. Desperate to find some relief from the near 90-degree heat, we stopped at the top of a grassy hill overlooking the Atlantic Ocean to let the breeze cool us off. I’m a photographer by trade, and when I travel, I like to use film, so on this particular trip I had only brought my grandmother’s old Pentax K1000. Using film instead of digital is a way for me to slow down, pay attention to what I’m seeing and take the pressure off the need to shoot a high volume of images. I had just brought my camera up to my face to shoot a large ship that was passing by when Alex noticed two people standing at the end of the pier far below us. “Are those people getting engaged? They’re getting engaged!” he said, pointing. I snapped maybe six or eight images in a row as he recorded the moment on his phone. We looked around to see if anyone else was witnessing this serendipitous occasion, but we were the only ones. We let the couple take their time, not wanting to impose on such an intimate moment. When the proposal appeared to be done, we made our way over to them, introduced ourselves, and I told them I had captured their engagement with my camera. They were delighted, so I asked for one of their emails and told them I would send the photos after they’d been developed. I wasn’t entirely sure if the images would even come out, as we had been a fair distance away and my light meter had stopped working, but I assured them if I had gotten anything good, I’d be in touch. We chatted a bit longer and then we congratulated the couple again and parted ways. As Alex and I continued walking, we remarked how thrilling it was to have just witnessed this random couple’s proposal. It made me wonder exactly what it was about seeing two strangers get engaged that felt so exciting. We didn’t have any investment in their lives — knew hardly anything about them, and likely never would. Regardless, it was an incredibly significant moment for them, and to see something that rare and meaningful and unexpected happen right in front of us felt a bit like seeing a shooting star. Extraordinary moments like these feel like a gift, especially in a world where so much is currently going wrong. Seeing two people making a commitment to each other — whatever that looks like for them and however they choose to honor it going forward — is a beautiful thing. It felt like I had been given a little reminder from the universe that despite how bad things can seem, love is real and we should do whatever we can to encourage and respect and celebrate it. Alex and I returned back to New York City and last week, almost two months after our trip, I finally got my film back. Not only did the images of the engagement turn out, but I had one of every part of the proposal: getting down on one knee, their embrace after, all of it. Although the couple was far from where I was shooting, their beautiful experience was perfectly documented in my photos. I couldn’t wait to share what I’d shot with the couple. I opened up my Notes app on my phone to retrieve the email they had given me but it wasn’t there. Somehow their contact info had gotten deleted. I was devastated. “What do we do now?” I asked Alex. We weren’t sure. How could we find two strangers with only a scant amount of information? We didn’t know, but we wanted to try. So... this is us trying. Maybe someone reading this essay might know this couple and can help me get in touch with them so I can share my photos of their special day. Here’s what we know: The couple (we believe they were two women but we didn’t ask about their gender identities, so we can’t be sure) got engaged on the afternoon of January 8, 2024 at the Castillo San Felipe del Morro in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. I think they were from Baltimore, or, if not, somewhere else in the Maryland or D.C. area. One of them was named Melissa. I feel lucky to have been in the right place at the right time to witness this couple’s proposal and I’m hoping a little more luck — and a bit of help from one of you — might finally get my photos to them. If you know these individuals (or you’re the couple featured in the photos), email Noah.Michelson@HuffPost.com and we’ll get you in touch with Kathryn.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pakistan-new-prime-minister-shehbaz-sharif_n_65e4771be4b013678e15a6b7","Shehbaz Sharif Becomes Pakistan's New Prime Minister","munir ahmed","2024-03-03","ISLAMABAD (AP) — Lawmakers in Pakistan’s National Assembly on Sunday elected Shehbaz Sharif as the country’s new prime minister for the second time as allies of imprisoned former premier Imran Khan in parliament shouted in protest, alleging rigging in last month’s election. Khan is currently serving prison terms in multiple cases and has been barred from seeking or holding office. Sharif replaced him as prime minister after his ouster in a no-confidence vote in parliament in April 2022. Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said Sharif secured 201 votes, defeating Omar Ayub of the Sunni Ittehad Council who got 92 votes. The winner only needs 169 votes to get a majority. Ayub was backed by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI, whose candidates could not get enough seats to form a government on their own. The PTI refused to hold talks with its rivals to form a coalition. Following days of negotiations, Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party and his supporters formed an alliance after the Feb. 8 election, which was overshadowed by militant violence, a nationwide mobile phone shutdown, Khan’s exclusion from the vote, and an unusual delay in announcing the result. Authorities said cutting communications was necessary to avoid attacks on candidates and security forces. However, the delay drew criticism from Khan’s party, which insists the vote was rigged to stop it from getting a majority. The party claims it has evidence that its victory “was stolen during the vote count,” a charge the Election Commission denies. Sharif, in his acceptance speech in parliament Sunday, said: “We were subjected to political victimization in the past but never took any revenge.” Without naming Khan, he said the previous ruler jailed many political rivals, including himself and his ally Asif Ali Zardari. He also accused Khan’s supporters of attacking military installations while protesting his ouster in 2022, adding that now parliament and the courts would decide whether those involved in attacking the military installations deserved a pardon. Holding portraits of Khan, some lawmakers stood in front of Sharif when he began his speech, shouting “vote thief” and “shame.” Sharif denounced their actions, saying they were causing chaos in parliament. He also said they should present their evidence of vote rigging to the relevant authorities. Sharif then addressed the opposition saying, “I am offering you reconciliation. Let us sit together to work for the betterment of Pakistan.” But he was greeted with more protests and shouts. The premier also spoke of repairing ties with the United States. Relations between the two countries have been strained after Khan accused the U.S., Sharif and the Pakistani military of conspiring to keep him out of office, following his ouster. Sharif also said his biggest challenge was the economic situation as Pakistan has been relying on foreign loans to run the economy. His government faces multiple issues, including how to respond to a surge in militant attacks, improve relations with the neighboring, Taliban-run Afghanistan, repair crumbling infrastructure, and resolve year-round power outages. It must also maintain political stability as Khan’s party has vowed to continue protests against the alleged vote-rigging. After losing to Sharif, Ayub addressed the parliament, commending “my leader” Khan for his “bravery” while facing the cases against him. He denounced the arrest of “thousands of Khan’s supporters” last year after they took to the streets following his ouster. Ayub repeated the allegations of vote rigging and demanded a probe into last month’s poll. He said PTI votes were tampered with and “votes were stolen” to stop Khan’s party from forming a government. He said Sharif can rule the country but “he cannot win hearts and minds because he came to power through a rigged vote.” Last week, Khan wrote a letter to the International Monetary Fund, urging it to link any talks with Islamabad to an audit of February’s election. Khan’s move, which Sharif criticized in his speech, comes days before the IMF releases a key installment of a bailout loan to Pakistan. Pakistan has been relying on bailouts to prop up its foreign exchange reserves and avoid default, with the IMF and wealthy allies like China and Saudi Arabia financing the country to the tune of billions of dollars. Under his previous term as prime minister, Sharif had to struggle for months to get a $3 billion bailout from the IMF. The new prime minister has said he will seek a new IMF bailout after the end of March when the current one expires. The next four years will change America forever.

Her name is Carbon Monoxide. “But you can call me C. Mo,” she introduces herself in a Bravo-style title card. “As in see mo’ life-threatening health problems.” She’s just one of the noxious cast members on “Hot and Toxic,” a fictional parody invented as part of a new environmental campaign against using natural gas for cooking and heating. The setup is darkly funny. An unsuspecting homeowner moves into the house of her dreams, only to discover the place comes with an intolerable group of unexpected roommates whose astrological signs match the pathological outcome of being around them for too long. “I don’t know, bro,” laments the guitar-strumming jock named after the chemical Benzene. “I guess it’s because I’m a Cancer and I… also cause it.” Another cast member interjects. “Shut up!” she says. “My sign is Cancer.” Amid a collective epiphany, the group says in unison: “We’re all Cancer!” It’s the latest advertisement from the advocacy group Gas Leaks, which makes creative videos aimed at promoting the shift away from fossil fuels. Gas Leaks first shared the new video with HuffPost. The organization ― which is a sponsored project of the Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, through which the billionaire family funnels millions from its 19th century oil fortune into nonprofits calling for the phase out of fossil fuels ― made a splash in October with an ad depicting gas appliances as Halloween horror movie monsters. Now Gas Leaks says it will spend $1 million to promote the video in markets like California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York, where more than half of households use gas for cooking. ″$1 million is a lot for the climate movement, but it’s pennies for the fossil fuel industry,” said James Hadgis, a filmmaker and Gas Leaks’ executive director. “Right now people are overwhelmed by information, there’s so much misinformation and disinformation,” he added. “We thought leaning into comedy is a way to both make people laugh and reveal truth, and send people the message that there’s nothing ‘natural’ about natural gas.” The natural gas that burns blue on stovetops emits tiny particles of nitrogen dioxide, which irritates the respiratory system, and contributes to asthma and cancer-causing pollutants such as benzene. While Consumer Reports found that ventilation helps, reviewers concluded the best way to minimize exposure to dangerous pollutants was to switch to an electric stove. Nearly 70% of American homes already use electric appliances for cooking, federal statistics show. But less than 5% of electric ranges sold in the U.S. use the induction technology touted by chefs as preferable to gas. Cooking with gas generates roughly 0.1% of total U.S. emissions each year, according to an analysis of federal data by the University of California, Davis. But gas stoves leak roughly 1% of the gas they use as unburned methane, a powerful heat-trapping gas. At this rate, yearly leaks from all natural gas stoves in the U.S. take an equivalent toll on the climate as the annual carbon dioxide emissions from 500,000 passenger vehicles, according to a recent peer-reviewed study from researchers at Stanford University and the laboratory PSE Healthy Energy. Gas used for heating, meanwhile, generates between six and 16 times as much planet-heating pollution, and the same pipeline network that feeds furnaces supplies stovetops. Advocates looking for ways to make slashing planet-heating emissions a more visceral concern have played up gas appliances’ toxic air pollutants as a way to increase public support for regulations restricting fossil fuel use.

It can be hard to convince my 4- and 2.5-year-old kids to engage with the tub, so I often resort to gimmicks to make it seem like more of a treat. (Sometimes, these ploys backfire. See: the gorgeous Japanese bath crayons that work a little too well for everyday use and had me scrubbing the sides of my tub with a little more elbow grease than usual.) So naturally, when I was at a local pharmacy with my kids a few weeks ago and the girls spotted a large display of colorful oversized bath bombs, I didn’t think twice about getting them. They were cute and inexpensive, and I appreciated that the jumbo, individually-packaged bombs contained a small treasure (which turned out to be things like necklace charms) — something that I suspected would entice the kids into sitting down and letting me wash their hair or scrub food off their faces without screaming. Turns out I was right. After we did one bomb-accompanied bath time, it was obvious that I’d need to be keeping more on hand for emergencies, tantrums and special occasions, so I hit the internet in search of the ones I’d purchased locally and happily found a treasure trove of them at Target. The bath bombs in question were from Da Bomb, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company that was founded in 2011 by two preteen sisters, ages 10 and 11 at the time, who loved using bath bombs but were disappointed when the bombs had dissolved, so they made sure to include a surprise in each one. Now, the sisters are in college and their wares can be found a host of major retailers. Target offers the affordable tchochkes in a variety of sizes and themes, including ones aimed towards fans of franchises like Spiderman, Barbie and Hot Wheels. There are also some tropically-influenced options and small variety packs that are perfect for moms like myself who are interested in having a bulk stash on hand. Reviews vary, but most of the ones I scoped out on Target had at least 4 stars and glowing reviews numbering in the hundreds. Take a look at what some reviewers had to say about these magical little orbs, or just scroll down to add several to your cart to keep in your bath time arsenal. “I got this for Christmas and the fragrance was amazing. I could smell it in the hallway when I was running my bath. It made the bath yellow which looked like pee. But I loved it, the surprise is great, just wanting to figure out where to enter the code on the surprise inside.” — DT76 “This was in my daughter’s stocking and she loved it. I liked the smell, but not sure what the scent was. I did think that it would change color as it fizzed, but it was really just yellow. It has a colorful plastic heart in the middle which my daughter loved, and she was asking for more bath bombs the next day.” — Katie “My kids love these & they smell good” — JessicaK By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. We love a good coffee shop drink, and enjoy the sweet flavors, latte art and silky foam of a barista-made espresso drink. If you’re looking to level up your at-home coffee game, the good news is you don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars on fancy coffee equipment. If you want to froth up milk for a cappuccino or a latte at home, all you need is an electric whisk — and Walmart has one for less than $13. The Zulay Kitchen milk frother turns milk and cream into foam for coffee and tea drinks. It can also be used to prepare matcha tea (by whisking matcha powder into water), make egg white foam for cocktails and so much more. It’s available in a rainbow of colors, and pricing varies by color; the cheapest option at the moment is a hot pink iteration for $10.99; the most expensive is an all-black version for $24.99. It comes with a simple stand to prop it up on your counter when you’re not using it, but it’s also compact enough to go in a drawer for storage. To clean it, simply dip the stainless steel whisk head into hot, soapy water and rise. With more than 500 5-star reviews, it’s safe to say this milk frother has some fans. Reviewer PioneerWomanfan commented that they use it every day to make their coffee feel special. Reviewer Blackbarbie04 wrote it’s comfortable to hold, lightweight and has a lot of power. And reviewer Lola, who bought the milk frother because it was on sale and wasn’t sure what to expect, was pleasantly surprised. “This milk frother has a lot of power for a little gadget and worked great the first time I used it.” The manufacturer claims that the frother achieves a speed of 12,500 rotations per minute and can make foam in seconds. “It made the foamiest foam I have ever seen,” wrote reviewer aritipbia. “Within like 15-20 seconds.” Pick up the Zulay Kitchen milk frother at Walmart. It requires two AA batteries to work (which aren’t included), so you’ll also want to pick some up if you don’t have any.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lebron-james-40000-career-points_n_65e428e2e4b013678e1599f6","LeBron James Makes NBA History By Extending Career Scoring Record","dan greenspan","2024-03-03","LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James reached 40,000 points Saturday night, still going strong in his 21st NBA season as he tries to put the career scoring record out of reach. James drove past Michael Porter Jr. and hit a layup with 10:39 left in the second quarter of the Los Angeles Lakers’ 124-114 loss to the Denver Nuggets for the historic basket. “Being the first player to do something, it’s pretty cool in this league, just knowing the history, the greats that’s come through the league, and then you see some of the greats on the floor tonight, it was great to compete,” James said. “But for me, the main thing, as always, is to win, and I hated that it had to happen in a defeat.” LeBron James scores the bucket to become the first player in league history to score 40,000 career points 👑DEN-LAL Live on ABC pic.twitter.com/I84Xd5hiWf James did it in 1,475 regular-season games, reaching double-digit points in each of the last 1,205 of them. He has largely avoided major injuries in that time, while also playing another 3 1/2 seasons worth of games in the playoffs en route to four titles in 10 NBA Finals appearances, all with unfathomable pressure placed on him to be the next transcendent player before ever stepping on the court as a professional. “For the first time in a long time, I’ve seen the commercial that was played before my first game,” James said. “I think they mentioned all the greats to ever play the game of basketball, like Big O and Michael and Kareem and Kobe, and forgot who all else was in that commercial. And then it was like, ‘the next one, LeBron James.’ “I didn’t see that commercial when it happened, but when I was watching it today, I was like what the hell? That expectation on an 18-year-old kid like that, that was insane to think about.” Even with those expectations, James put in the work and has now accomplished something that seemed impossible. James’ relentless march saw him pass the previous record of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 38,387 points on Feb. 7, 2023 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. All that scoring happened without James’ necessarily wanting that to be his trademark. He is fourth in career assists with 10,847, picking up another nine against Denver, and his average of 7.35 per game ranks in the top 25. Nuggets coach Michael Malone, who spent five seasons with James as an assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2005-2010, saw an early dedication from James in all areas. It was already a priority for James to keep himself in peak physical condition, even if the run to the scoring title was an unforeseen outcome back them. “I remember being in Cleveland, him being in the weight room with our weight and strength coaches, and there’s no way he’s doing what he’s doing at this stage of his career if he is not putting a ton of time into his body, his diet, his sleep, all those things that really matter,” Malone said before the game. James’ combination of longevity and sustained excellence is what makes it entirely likely he could be the only player to ever reach 40,000 points. To put the feat in perspective, Nuggets center Nikola Jokic will need to average 25 points over his next 1,057 appearances to join James at 40,000 points. That would be nearly 13 full seasons without injuries or any other unforeseen circumstance, all the way past age 41 without a drop in production for the two-time MVP. Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic seems like the most reasonable candidate to make a serious push, as his career average of 28.51 points per game is third in league history behind Michael Jordan (30.12) and Wilt Chamberlain (30.07). But Doncic will need to keep it up for 1,022 more games to match James, a timeline pushing into the 2036-37 season barring interruption. “There’s just certain things that you just don’t think that’s going to happen,” James said. “I guess for years people said Kareem’s record wouldn’t be broken. I was able to eclipse it. But like I said, you have to have some really good luck, you have to play the game at a high level for a long time, and then we see.” As to whether James might ever take up residence in the 50,000-point club, a conservative estimate of 25 points per game from here on out — essentially matching what he has been producing in his 21st professional campaign at 39-years-old — while playing 55 outings each coming season would put him at the doorstep in 2031-32. Malone wouldn’t rule it out. “Really, when you take a step back, you just have to marvel at the longevity. But he’s just not playing at this. He is playing effectively,” Malone said. “I’m sure for him, that’ll be his decision down the road probably in five, six years. ‘Am I still playing effectively?’ And he is.” If anyone would even dare to make a charge at the impossible, it could only be King James. “I come to work and prepare and prep, mentally, physically, spiritually every single night when it’s time to play, and I just try to go out and contribute,” he said. “Been able to do it for 20-plus years, including this year. When I come on the floor and feel pretty good, I feel I can make plays. The next four years will change America forever.

Jost remarked that Trump looks “good behind bars” as another picture flashed onscreen of him behind fencing during his border stop in Eagle Pass, Texas. The “SNL” star went on to mock Trump over what Jost called a “pretty harsh” message for migrants before playing a video of the GOP presidential front-runner waving and pumping his fist at people on the Mexico side of the border. “They like Trump, can you believe it?” Trump said as he waved to the group. “No, I can’t believe it,” Jost said in response to the clip. “The migrants don’t like you, they just walked a thousand miles to get to the edge of this river, and they’re probably thinking, ‘Is that weirdo in a Trump costume waving us into the country?’” You can check out more of “Weekend Update” in the clips below.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-immigration-comments-biden_n_65e3bcc7e4b0d2a24759a980","Trump Escalates Immigration Rhetoric, Claims Biden Is Trying To 'Overthrow' The U.S.","bill barrow , jill colvin","2024-03-02","GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) — Former President Donald Trump on Saturday further escalated his immigration rhetoric and baselessly accused President Joe Biden of waging a “conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America” as he campaigned ahead of Super Tuesday’s primaries. Trump has a long history of trying to turn attack lines back on his rivals in an attempt to diminish their impact. Biden has cast Trump as a threat to democracy, pointing to the former president’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Those efforts culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as his supporters tried to halt the peaceful transition of power. Trump, who has responded by calling Biden “the real threat to democracy” and alleged without proof that Biden is responsible for the indictments he faces, turned to Biden’s border policies on Saturday, charging that “every day Joe Biden is giving aid and comfort to foreign enemies of the United States.” “Biden’s conduct on our border is by any definition a conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America,” he went on to say in Greensboro, North Carolina. “Biden and his accomplices want to collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters and establish a new base of power that gives them control for generations.” Similar arguments have long been made by people who allege Democrats are promoting illegal immigration to weaken the power of white voters — part of a racist conspiracy, once confined to the far right, claiming there is an intentional push by the U.S. liberal establishment to systematically diminish the influence of white people. Trump leaned into the theory again at his rally later in Virginia, saying of the migrants: “They’re trying to sign them up to get them to vote in the next election.” “Once again Trump is projecting in an attempt to distract the American people from the fact he killed the fairest and toughest border security bill in decades because he believed it would help his campaign. Sad,” Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement. Trump’s campaign stops came three days before Super Tuesday, with elections in 16 states, including North Carolina and Virginia, where thousands of enthusiastic supporters gathered for an evening rally in downtown Richmond. The primaries will be the largest day of voting of the year ahead of November’s general election, which is shaping up as a likely rematch of 2020 between Trump and Biden. Nikki Haley, Trump’s last major rival, also campaigned in North Carolina. Speaking to reporters after her event in Raleigh, about 80 miles away, the former U.N. ambassador demurred on her plans after Super Tuesday. “We’re going to keep going and we’re going to keep pushing,” she said, arguing a majority of Americans don’t want either Biden or Trump as the nation’s leader. Much of Trump’s speech in North Carolina focused on the slew of criminal charges he faces. While the former president has successfully harnessed his legal woes into a powerful rallying cry in the primaries, it is unclear how his message of grievance will resonate with the more moderate voters who will likely decide the general election. “I stand before you today not only as your past and hopefully future president, but as a proud political dissident and a public enemy of a rogue regime,” Trump said, railing against what he called an “anti-Democratic machine.” At both rallies, Trump played a recording of “Justice for All,” the version of the Star-Spangled Banner that he collaborated on with a group of defendants jailed over their alleged roles in the January 2021 insurrection, whom he refers to as “hostages.” As he focuses on the general election, Trump has painted an apocalyptic vision of the country under Biden, particularly on the topic of immigration, which was the animating issue of his 2016 campaign and which he has once again seized on as the U.S. has experienced a record influx of migrants at the border. Trump and Biden both visited the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday to highlight their contrasting approaches to the issue. On Saturday, Trump conjured images of Biden turning “public schools into migrant camps” and “the USA into a crime-ridden, disease-ridden dumping ground, which is what they’re doing.” He also spoke at length about the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student whose alleged killer is a Venezuelan man who entered the U.S. illegally and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case. Studies have found native-born U.S. residents are more likely to have been arrested for violent crimes than people in the country illegally, but Trump has seized on several high-profile incidents, including a recent video of a group of migrants brawling with police in Times Square. “Not one more innocent American life should be lost to migrant crime,” Trump said. Trump, who repeatedly attacks Biden’s intelligence and mental acuity, has been sensitive to questions of his own sharpness after he’s mixed up Haley with Nancy Pelosi and Biden with former President Barack Obama at past rallies. Trump has lately sought to inoculate any questions by insisting he interchanges the names intentionally. “I do that because you know that makes a point. Do we understand that, right? Because a lot of people say he’s running the country. I don’t personally think so,” Trump said early into his appearance in Virginia. But more than an hour in to his free-flowing remarks, he seemed to mix up Obama and Biden again, when he said “Putin, you know, has so little respect for Obama that he’s starting to throw around the ‘nuclear’ word.” Beyond their importance on Super Tuesday, North Carolina and Virginia are both states the Trump campaign is focused on for November. Trump won North Carolina twice but watched his margin of victory shrink. Biden’s reelection campaign already has staff on the ground hoping to flip the state for the first time since 2008. Virginia, meanwhile, had once been a swing state but for years has trended blue and Trump lost there twice. But a Trump campaign senior adviser told reporters Saturday that he believes “we could make Virginia competitive.” In North Carolina, a festive atmosphere surrounded the Greensboro Coliseum Complex ahead of Trump’s rally. Supporters stood in a line that snaked through a web of metal barricades and extended hundreds of yards from the arena. License plates from North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee filled the parking lot, where Trump flags flew alongside U.S. and Confederate flags on many vehicles. “We just love Trump,” said, Mary Welborn, who lives in nearby Thomasville and expressed that she was frustrated by the criminal prosecutions and civil judgments against the former president. “The way he’s being treated is insane. No other president has been treated this way,” she said. In Richmond, supporters started lining up Saturday morning for an evening rally at a downtown convention center. The entry lines stretched several blocks by mid-afternoon. Ken Ballos, a retired police officer from nearby Hanover County who said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said he was eager at the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-texas-migrants-arrest_n_65e65f3de4b013678e165cc9","Supreme Court Temporarily Blocks Texas Law That Allows Police To Arrest Migrants","acacia coronado , lindsay whitehurst","2024-03-04","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas’ plan to arrest migrants who enter the U.S. illegally is headed to the Supreme Court in a legal showdown over the federal government’s authority over immigration. The high court on Monday blocked Texas’ immigration law from going into effect until March 13 and asked the state to respond by March 11. The law was set to take effect Saturday, and the court’s decision came just hours after the Justice Department asked it to intervene. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the law in December and for months has unveiled a series of escalating measures on the border that have tested the boundaries of how far a state can go keep migrants from entering the country. The law would allow state officers to arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally. People who are arrested could then agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the country or face a misdemeanor charge for entering the U.S. illegally. Migrants who don’t leave after being ordered to do so could be arrested again and charged with a more serious felony. The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that the law would profoundly alter “the status quo that has existed between the United States and the States in the context of immigration for almost 150 years.” It went on to argue that the law would have “significant and immediate adverse effects” on the country’s relationship with Mexico and “create chaos” in enforcing federal immigration laws in Texas. The federal government cited a 2012 Supreme Court ruling on an Arizona law that would have allowed police to arrest people for federal immigration violations, often referred to by opponents as the “show me your papers” bill. The divided high court found that the impasse in Washington over immigration reform did not justify state intrusion. In a statement Monday, the Texas Attorney General’s Office said the state’s law mirrored federal law and “was adopted to address the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which hurts Texans more than anyone else.” The federal government’s emergency request to the Supreme Court came after a federal appeals court over the weekend stayed U.S. District Judge David Ezra’s sweeping rejection of the law. In a 114-page ruling Thursday, Ezra rebuked Texas’ immigration enforcement and brushed off claims by Republicans about an ongoing “invasion” along the southern border due to record-high illegal crossings. Ezra added that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, conflicts with federal immigration law and could get in the way of U.S. foreign relations and treaty obligations. According to Ezra’s ruling, allowing Texas to supersede federal law due to an “invasion” would “amount to nullification of federal law and authority — a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War.” Republicans who back the law have said it would not target immigrants already living in the U.S. because the two-year statute of limitations on the illegal entry charge would be enforced only along the state’s border with Mexico. Texas has been arresting migrants for years under a different program that is based on criminal trespass arrests. Though Ezra said some might sympathize with Texas officials’ concerns about immigration enforcement by the federal government, he said that was not enough to excuse a violation of the U.S. Constitution. The battle over the Texas immigration law, known as Senate Bill 4, is one of multiple legal disputes between Texas officials and the Biden administration over how far the state can go to patrol the Texas-Mexico border and prevent illegal border crossings. Several Republican governors have backed Abbott’s efforts, saying the federal government is not doing enough to enforce existing immigration laws. The next four years will change America forever.

The six-week investigation, which began after a Boeing 737 Max 9 lost a door panel during a flight in January, found issues with Boeing’s “manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control,” the FAA said in a news release, which didn’t offer more detail. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker addressed the audit’s findings with Boeing’s CEO and other senior leaders in a meeting last week and gave the company 90 days to outline a plan of action, the FAA said. Boeing also must review and address a report released last week by a panel of outside experts that examined safety culture within the company dating back to two 737 Max 8 crashes in 2018 and 2019. To hold Boeing accountable, the FAA said, it has halted the expanded production of the Boeing 737 Max, whose fuselage is built by Spirit AeroSystems. It is also exploring the use of an independent third party to review Boeing’s quality systems. It will also continue to physically monitor Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems’ work with FAA representatives at Boeing facilities in Washington state and Spirit AeroSystems in Kansas. A spokesperson for Boeing told HuffPost on Monday that its president and chief executive officer, Dave Calhoun, had expressed optimism about the road ahead following his meeting with the FAA. “We have a clear picture of what needs to be done,” Calhoun was quoted as saying. “Boeing will develop the comprehensive action plan with measurable criteria that demonstrates the profound change that Administrator Whitaker and the FAA demand. Our Boeing leadership team is totally committed to meeting this challenge.” The next four years will change America forever.

On Sunday, the “Frozen” actor shared a short video of herself singing “Happy Birthday” to “Adele Dazeem” on TikTok. “I just wanted to say happy birthday. I’m sending you so much love and positive energy,” Menzel said in the clip. “I hope you have the best, best day.” Happy 10th birthday, Adele Dazeem! Adele Dazeem first entered the cultural lexicon during the 2014 Academy Awards ceremony, when John Travolta mispronounced Menzel’s name while introducing her performance of “Let It Go” from Disney’s “Frozen.” “Please welcome the wickedly talented, one and only, Adele Dazeem,” said Travolta at the time, alluding to Menzel’s Tony-winning stint as Elphaba in Broadway’s “Wicked.” “Let It Go” went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Song later that night, and Travolta’s flub quickly became a viral moment. Appearing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” a year later, Travolta blamed the mishap on Menzel’s name being spelled phonetically on the Oscars’ teleprompters. “I didn’t rehearse it that way,” he said. Menzel, for her part, poked fun at the incident during the 2015 Academy Awards ceremony by intentionally messing up Travolta’s name when they presented together. Since then, she’s repeatedly made it clear that she holds no ill will toward the “Pulp Fiction” actor.

Just over heard my husband telling the dog that he wants nothing more in life than to pet him, so I guess that was 16 years and three kids well spent We ran into my wife’s close friend on our neighborhood walk which allowed me 45 minutes to stare at a fire hydrant. My husband just referred to the Wonka Experience as ""Fyre Festival for children."" Please don't write happily married in your social media bio. Be realistic. ""I have a spouse and they like me well enough."" It's early in the year but I'm already anxious about my husband getting his Spotify Wrapped and asking me who has been getting high and listening to ""If We Hold On Together"" from ""The Land Before Time"" sung by Diana Ross so many times. My wife has close friends whose husbands are notably worse than me and I highly recommend this arrangement the smug way my wife walks into the kitchen, casually opens a drawer, and pulls out the exact item she needs on the first try Wife: Can you turn on the oven?Me: [starts dancing seductively in front of oven]Wife: why for everything Wife: We need to talkMe, absolutely panicking: WhatWife: We need to start buying the big jars of peanut butter husband: how was your dayme showing him the Twitter research I’ve done on Kate Middleton’s whereabouts since December of last year pic.twitter.com/WXphrsc96x Husband: Why are your hands bleeding?*flashback to me struggling to open a pistachio for 20 minutes*Me: I’m learning how to play guitar.

Husband: You’re parked in the driveway listening to a book and scrolling your phone. Me: And I have 23 minutes left in my session. When my mother-in-law came to stay, she insisted we NOT change our regular routine for her. We obliged, but naked Saturday was a pretty awkward. My husband called me from upstairs because he needed tp and what did we do before cell phones Almost made it to the end of February before my wife made the first mention of what we could gift people for Christmas this year. Maybe next year will be the year we make it to March my wife: you put more time and energy into our son’s little league team than you do our marriage.me: well yeah our marriage doesn’t end in a championship tournament. My husband just said he's going to take a shower so I told him I hope he showers off his bad attitude*. *I got a new sweatshirt and put it on and asked if I look cute and he said ""well, it sure is a sweatshirt!"" which is obviously not the right answer and he needs to do better. According to my husband he's the only person on the road who knows how to drive. The eye-roll is implied. wife: [stressed and busy]me: [not working] let me help and I can do the grocery shoppingwife: I don't want you to do that.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/emaciated-palestinian-boy-dies-gaza-famine_n_65e5f01ae4b013678e162d03","Palestinian Boy In Photos That Showed Reality Of Gaza Famine Dies Of Malnourishment","sanjana karanth","2024-03-04","Yazan al-Kafarneh, a Palestinian boy whose emaciated appearance offered the world a stark illustration of Gaza’s accelerating starvation crisis, has become one of the latest children in the territory to die of severe malnourishment. Yazan was receiving medical treatment with the few resources available at Abu Yusuf al-Najjar Hospital in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are trying to survive without adequate shelter or food. Graphic photos taken on Feb. 28 and March 2, which appear below, show Yazan emaciated and bedridden while covered in blankets and receiving fluids intravenously. The photos were reposted online by activists, journalists and pro-Palestinian accounts, showing the reality of a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza born out of Israel’s ongoing offensive and monthslong blockade of aid deliveries. Yazan died of malnourishment on Monday, Al Jazeera reported. He was 10. “This child had turned into a skeleton in this war before he died,” Muhammed al-Kafarneh, a relative of Yazan, told Al Jazeera in a video interview on Monday, as Yazan’s body was being cleaned and prepared for burial in the background. “Hunger ravaged his body. This child was suffering from several diseases,” al-Kafarneh said. “The war came and took away all the basic components that could give him life.” Yazan’s family was originally living in north Gaza ― which is facing its own starvation crisis ― before Israeli strikes displaced them several times. In a video on Instagram, Yazan’s father, sitting beside his emaciated son, shared a photo, taken a week before Israel began its offensive, of Yazan smiling and not visibly malnourished. Hoping to find better health care for Yazan, who had cerebral palsy, the family arrived in Rafah. But despite his efforts, Yazan’s father could not locate the food, water or medicine his son needed to survive. “We found nothing, so he was met with a slow and painful death,” Muhammed al-Kafarneh told Al Jazeera. “The barbaric war and the oppressive actions of the Israeli occupation against the children of Gaza and its civilians must be stopped.” North Gaza itself is experiencing even less access to aid, with public order falling apart as Palestinians become desperate for food, water and other basic necessities. UNICEF said Sunday that at least 10 children have died due to dehydration and malnutrition in the north’s Kamal Adwan Hospital in recent days. “These tragic and horrific deaths are man-made, predictable and entirely preventable,” Adele Khodr, UNICEF’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. Malnutrition screenings conducted in the north by UNICEF and the World Food Program in January found that nearly 16% of children under 2 years of age were acutely malnourished, while similar screenings in Rafah found 5% of children in the same age range experiencing malnutrition. “The sense of helplessness and despair among parents and doctors in realizing that lifesaving aid, just a few kilometres away, is being kept out of reach, must be as unbearable, but worse still are the anguished cries of those babies slowly perishing under the world’s gaze,” Khodr said. “The lives of thousands more babies and children depend on urgent action being taken now.” Following an Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants, in which some 1,200 people were killed and roughly another 250 were taken hostage, Israel has barred entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies into Gaza, aside from a small amount of aid entering from the south. Some aid groups have said their deliveries are also being delayed due to Israeli forces firing at their trucks. The U.S. airdropped dozens of food bundles over Gaza on Saturday, even as it continues to assist the country blocking the aid in the first place. The airdrop occurred two days after Israeli forces killed more than 100 Palestinians trying to access aid on the first major delivery to north Gaza in a month, resulting in widespread anger at the Israeli military and its biggest ally, the U.S. government. Janti Soeripto, CEO of aid organization Save the Children, said Monday that “the conditions to provide humanitarian assistance to children in Gaza are not only not being met but are getting worse.” “We have been calling for more crossings, more opening hours, more capacity to check trucks and pass them through, not have trucks be off and unloaded again four or five times,” Soeripto told NPR. “These are all fairly straightforward ways to make the logistics of this operation much easier, less painful and more effective. And none of these have been taken up so far.” A US official familiar w/ top Biden aides' thinking tells me they expected scenarios like the flour massacre but know POTUS is ""not budging"" on pushing Israel in a real way despite Gaza's needs.The result: ""hard-to-do + low-yield PR stunts like air drops + portable port idea."" In addition to the airdrops, U.S. President Joe Biden said he wants to open a maritime corridor for aid “and expand deliveries by land.” A U.S. official told HuffPost’s Akbar Shahid Ahmed on Sunday that aides anticipated incidents like the aid convoy shooting ― now widely being described as the “flour massacre” ― but that they still don’t expect Biden to pressure Israel in a way that actually helps Gazans. “Pushing Israel to allow food in is totally off the table,” the official said, resulting in Biden’s pursuit of “low-yield PR stunts” like airdrops of aid and the idea of a maritime corridor. “We direct our message to the international community and the free people of the world: What are you waiting for? At least guarantee the right to life for children,” Muhammed al-Kafarneh told Al Jazeera. “You claim to be just and righteous. What are you waiting for? We have reached famine. Not only that, but a complete catastrophe.” GRAPHIC PHOTOS WARNING: The following highly distressing images depict death and severe malnourishment.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-trump-colorado-ruling-liberals-disagreement_n_65e63b5ee4b0d2a2475a625c","The Key Disagreement In The Liberal Justices’ Concurrence On The Trump Ballot Ruling","paul blumenthal","2024-03-04","The U.S. Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision on Monday overturning a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court that found former President Donald Trump could be disqualified from appearing on the state’s ballot for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. But while all nine justices put their names to that decision, a bitter 5-4 divide lurked underneath. The majority opinion allowed Trump to stay on the ballot in Colorado (and Maine and Illinois, where he had also been found ineligible) by arguing that states may only enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment ― the constitutional provision barring oath-breaking insurrectionists from future office ― for state offices but not federal ones. All of the justices agreed on this main point. But three justices ― liberals Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson ― disagreed vehemently with the assertion by the five conservative justices ― John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh ― that Section 3 could only be enforced for federal offices by specific congressional legislation. Fellow conservative Amy Coney Barrett issued a separate concurrence that refrained from elaborating on her disagreement with the majority opinion, concluding “our differences are far less important than our unanimity.” Invoking the court’s controversial decision in Bush v. Gore, which decided the razor-thin outcome of the 2000 election in favor of Republican George W. Bush, the liberal justices declared that the majority’s decision had gone too far by potentially closing off other avenues for federal courts and Congress to prevent insurrectionist candidates from gaining office. “Even though ‘[a]ll nine Members of the Court’ agree that this independent and sufficient rationale resolves this case, five Justices go on,” the three liberals write in a concurrence that reads like a bitter dissent. “They decide novel constitutional questions to insulate this Court and petitioner from future controversy.” The liberal concurrence took issue with the fact that the majority had not only ruled on whether the state of Colorado could enforce Section 3 against federal candidates but also on who could instead: namely, Congress, and only Congress, via legislation. In short, they argued, the decision removes power from the courts to rule on if someone was, in fact, an insurrectionist. The decision “forecloses judicial enforcement of that provision,” according to the liberals’ concurrence. Such enforcement could arise “when a party is prosecuted by an insurrectionist and raises a defense on that score,” they contended. Such a situation could arise if someone brings a legal challenge to an action by a future President Trump, like, say, a declaration of emergency in order to federalize police officers to round up undocumented immigrants for deportation. Similarly, it could negate any federal court review if Trump appointed anyone who engaged in the Jan. 6 plot to a federal office, such as former Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark. In doing this, the liberals argued, “the majority attempts to insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future challenges to their holding federal office.” As the liberals noted, “nothing in Section 3’s text supports the majority’s view of how federal disqualification efforts must operate.” Instead, they argued, the majority relied on flimsy precedent and cherry-picked historical quotes to create a new precedent, making Section 3 all but unenforceable in the courts. The majority cited an 1869 decision, issued by Chief Justice Salmon Chase while riding circuit, that argued that Section 3 required congressional authorizing legislation. But Chase’s decision in what was known as Griffin’s Case has been shown to be poorly reasoned and the result of his own personal political ambitions. The liberals also countered the majority’s assertion that Congress passed the Enforcement Act in 1870 in order to give a path to enforce Section 3, noting that the majority cherry-picked quotes from Sen. Lyman Trumbell in his support for the bill. “The majority also cites Senator Trumbull’s statements that Section 3 “‘provide[d] no means for enforcing’” itself,” the opinion said. “The majority, however, neglects to mention the Senator’s view that ‘[i]t is the [F]ourteenth [A]mendment that prevents a person from holding office,’ with the proposed legislation simply ‘affor[ding] a more efficient and speedy remedy’ for effecting the disqualification.” The majority opinion’s requirement that “congressional legislation enforcing Section 3” on federal officeholders must “reflect ‘congruence and proportionality’” and be tailored “‘to remedying or preventing’ the specific conduct” prohibited by Section 3, the liberals noted, also keeps Congress from passing “general federal statutes requiring the government to comply with the law.” What the court is asking of Congress is by no means clear. Does this mean that Congress cannot declare under the Electoral Count Reform Act that Trump’s electors are “not regularly given” due to his ineligibility under Section 3? “If the majority in Trump v. Anderson wanted to foreclose the possibility of a post-election Section Three challenge to Donald Trump’s eligibility, then they did a poor job,” Gerard Magliocca, a law professor at Indiana University School of Law and one of the few Section 3 legal experts, wrote of the decision. Barrett, the lone conservative to disagree with this part of the ruling, simply noted that she “would decide no more than that” states cannot enforce Section 3 for federal offices, but she added that she did not want to further inflame public passions around the court by loudly disagreeing with the majority.

The Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up.” The court could have simply chosen to speak in a unified voice, but instead five justices chose to further narrow any enforcement of Section 3 while muddying the waters about how exactly Congress could act to protect the country from oath-breaking insurrectionists.

Last week, a new episode of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast was released, in which Dornan made fun of Beatty for falling for an email scam involving fellow actor Eddie Redmayne. Dornan is a longtime friend of Redmayne; it’s unknown how Redmayne and Beatty know each other. Dornan began his anecdote nearly 13 minutes into the episode, as he told host Josh Horowitz about how scammers had hacked into Redmayne’s email account. “Eddie got scammed, and we all got emails [from his account] saying, like, ‘Guys, I’m up against it here. I need some cash,’” the “Fifty Shades” actor said. When Horowitz asked if anyone responded to the phishing email, Dornan did not hesitate to give a name. “Yeah, Warren Beatty was like, ‘What can I do?’” he said. Revealing that Beatty took the bait, Dornan paused and said, “I think I’m OK to tell this [story]?” After a moment of hesitation, Dornan then launched into how he felt about the 86-year-old responding to the scam. “I was like, ‘Yeah, Warren, you go. You go first, I’ll follow,’” Dornan said while cracking up. “No, but like, we all just got individual emails saying, ‘Guys, I need you to wire me some cash,’” he continued. “And fair credit, Warren Beatty was like, ‘Whatever you need,’ you know? What a legend.” Despite crediting Beatty for wanting to help out Redmayne, Dornan continued to tease the fellow actor, joking that the email scam happened “just before [Beatty] read the wrong name at the Academy Awards.” “So it all sort of makes sense,” he said. In 2017, Beatty presented the award for Best Picture at the Academy Awards alongside his “Bonnie and Clyde” co-star, Faye Dunaway. In one of the biggest hiccups in Oscar history, the pair had been given the wrong envelope and announced “La La Land” as the winner, when it was supposed to be “Moonlight.” HuffPost has reached out to Beatty and Redmayne for confirmation on whether this actually happened and for clarification as to how Dornan even knows about this if all of Redmayne’s contacts were emailed individually.

On Sunday, Gyllenhaal shared a throwback photo of himself posing with Patrick Swayze, with whom he appeared in the 2001 thriller “Donnie Darko,” on Instagram. In the accompanying caption, the actor hinted at differences between Swayze’s “Road House” and his performance in the remake, but noted that he was hopeful that his former co-star would still have enjoyed the new film. “I’ve been thinking back about my time working with Patrick on Donnie Darko, and rewatching this great man in the original Road House plus so many other films. I’ve never stopped being a fan,” Gyllenhaal wrote. “He was such a talent and I continue to have so much respect and admiration for what he put out and into the world.” He went on to note: “I’ll never forget his kindness to me when I was starting out— he didn’t have to take the time, but he always did. We’ve made a different RH this time around, but hoping it’s one he would’ve had fun watching!” Swayze died of pancreatic cancer in 2009 at age 57. The three-time Golden Globe nominee was hot off his “Dirty Dancing” success when he appeared in 1989’s “Road House,” which also starred Sam Elliott and Kelly Lynch. The movie followed James Dalton (played by Swayze), a New York bar bouncer who relocates to Missouri to run security at a local bar and ends up saving a small town from a corrupt businessman. The 2024 remake stars Gyllenhaal as Elwood Dalton, a reimagined version of Swayze’s character. This time around, the protagonist is a former UFC middleweight fighter, while the film itself takes place in the Florida Keys. The original “Road House” received middling reviews and was a box office disappointment. Perhaps buoyed by Swayze’s better-regarded performances in “Dirty Dancing” and other films, however, the movie was a surprise hit on home video. Only time will tell if Gyllenhaal’s performance in the new “Road House” will fare better. The film’s rollout, however, has gotten off to bit of a bumpy start.

In January, director Doug Liman announced plans to skip the movie’s South by Southwest (SXSW) premiere after its distributor, Amazon, opted for a direct-to-streaming release on Prime Video instead of a theatrical run. “That hurts the filmmakers and stars of ‘Road House’ who don’t share in the upside of a hit movie on a streaming platform,” Liman, whose credits include “The Bourne Identity” and “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” wrote in an essay for Deadline. “And they deprive Jake Gyllenhaal — who gives a career-best performance — the opportunity to be recognized come award season.” R. Lance Hill, who wrote the screenplay for the original “Road House,” filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Amazon Studios last week. In it, Hill alleged that work on the new movie wasn’t completed until January, months after the copyright deadline had passed and he’d reclaimed the film rights.

Also my kid: If you raise my allowance by 52.7% for the next 7 weeks, then I'll be able to afford that pair of Air Jordan 4s I want. My 11 y/o daughter wanted an allowance so we started negotiating a chores list but she put up her hand after a couple minutes and said, “Okay, this is great, but like when do we work in some self-care here?” Kids always know who to put first. My toddler calls allowance “aplowance” and if you correct her, you’re dead to me 14yo made 4.6 GPA for 1st semester of HS, so I gave him $40 for his savings to build a gamer PC, countering all my training that kids earn good grades for food+shelter. Boy said I was ""indulging in capitalist excess,"" but also asked if he was still gon get his regular allowance👀 My daughter telling me not to worry because she got her own allowance from my purse did not have the effect she intended My 10yo just asked me for his allowance and sang “I like big bucks and I cannot lie” and I know I’m not supposed to like this as his parent but I do, I really do My son asked if I got an allowance as a kid. I said yeah…my mom allowed me to stay in the house rent free and eat every night. Teen: mom when can I have some allowance Me: things are kinda tight Teen: but I still get one tho rightMe: PAYMENT STATUS NOT AVAILABLE Give your kids an allowance so they can stop selling their teeth to a fairy You should let your kids stay up however long they want but force them to go to school in the morning or they lose their allowance. That’s closer to preparing them to adulthood than making them go to sleep. My 8yo folding laundry: Hey Mom!

Had to tell her that puppeteering is not a chore but a PASSION. Me: “Out of all of the billions of kids in the world, you are my very favourite. I love you the most.”Wilder: “Can I have my allowance?” I taught my kids about inflation and now I’m embroiled in an acrimonious allowance negotiation. My husband forgot his phone in the house so my son ran in and got it and changed his wallpaper to barf emojis so I bumped up his allowance. professor dad who makes his kids submit funding proposals to increase their allowance I offered my oldest additional allowance money to vacuum rugs, which the kid jumped at.Why haven't I been doing this already?WHY. My kid just told me that if Lego people live in houses made of Lego they’re technically living inside their own flesh so I raised his allowance Thoughts and prayers for my kids who are upset that they didn't get their allowance this week, even though they didn't do anything to earn their allowance this week. My 11yo had the nerve to ask for his allowance even though his room looks like a crime scene and I mean, imagine what he could accomplish if he used this level of audacity for good.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/safe-driver-apprenticeship-program_n_65e5f473e4b0d2a2475a3fe9","Congress Set To Roll Back Extra Safety Rule In Teen Trucking Program","arthur delaney","2024-03-04","WASHINGTON ― Congress looks poised to undo a safety requirement that the trucking industry says has held back participation in a program for younger drivers. Lawmakers unveiled a bipartisan budget bill on Sunday that would fund certain federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year ― with a rider blocking the Department of Transportation from requiring freight carriers to point cameras at apprentice truck drivers. Federal law requires long-haul truckers to be at least 21 years old, but Congress told the department to let truck companies try out drivers ages 18 to 20 as part of a pilot program. The Safe Driver Apprenticeship Program was supposed to help the trucking industry with its hiring woes, bringing in thousands of eager young drivers, but only a few dozen apprentices have signed up, according to the latest data. The bipartisan infrastructure law required participating freighters to have modern safety technology on their trucks, such as collision mitigation systems, and the Transportation Department added an extra requirement for inward-facing cameras. The American Trucking Associations, an industry trade group, blamed the cameras for the low participation in the apprenticeship program. “These additional mandates have stifled program participation, limiting the utility of data that Congress ordered be collected on drivers in this age cohort,” ATA’s Nathan Mehrens said in an emailed statement. Mehrens said Congress intended the pilot program to be “a pathway for younger drivers to enter the industry as a first career choice.” Another possible explanation for the low enrollment is that younger workers aren’t interested in becoming long-haul truckers, which involves spending weeks away from home, when unemployment is low and easier jobs are readily available. Though few lawmakers are familiar with the teen trucking initiative, there does seem to be bipartisan agreement about doing the industry a favor by relaxing the extra safety rule. Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) added the anti-camera language to a Senate spending bill last year, and the provision was tucked into bipartisan House-and-Senate legislation over the weekend without any press statements or public disagreement. Congress has to pass that bill in order to avoid a partial government shutdown by the end of the week. (The trucking provision also strikes a requirement that truck companies register their apprenticeships with the U.S. Department of Labor.) Younger drivers are known to present higher risks on the road, so the pilot program requires extensive mentoring, in addition to high-tech safety equipment, with the goal of studying whether the requirements can mitigate the danger. Skeptics of the apprenticeship initiative view it as a straightforward giveaway to the industry, a step toward lowering the interstate driving age, and a threat to all drivers.

Envoy Says 'Reasonable Grounds' To Believe Hamas Committed Sexual Violence On Oct. 7","edith m. lederer","2024-03-04","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. envoy focusing on sexual violence in conflict said in a new report Monday that there are “reasonable grounds” to believe Hamas committed rape, “sexualized torture,” and other cruel and inhumane treatment of women during its surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. There are also “reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may be ongoing,” said Pramila Patten, who visited Israel and the West Bank from Jan. 29 to Feb. 14 with a nine-member team. In the report, she said the team “found clear and convincing information” that some hostages have been subjected to the same forms of conflict-related sexual violence including rape and “sexualized torture.” The report comes nearly five months after the Oct. 7 attacks, which left about 1,200 people dead and some 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s war against Hamas has since laid waste to the Gaza Strip, killing more than 30,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The U.N. says a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people face starvation. Patten’s report said the team’s visit “was neither intended nor mandated to be investigative in nature.” She said the team was not able to meet with any victims of sexual violence “despite concerted efforts to encourage them to come forward.” However, team members held 33 meetings with Israeli institutions and conducted interview with 34 people including survivors and witnesses of the Oct. 7 attacks, released hostages, health providers and others. Based on the information it gathered, Patten said, “there are reasonable grounds to believe that conflict-related sexual violence occurred during the 7 October attacks in multiple locations across Gaza periphery, including rape and gang rape, in at least three locations.” Across various locations, she said, the team found “that several fully naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down were recovered – mostly women – with hands tied and shot multiple times, often in the head.” While this is circumstantial, she said the pattern of undressing and restraining victims “may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence.” At the Nova music festival and its surroundings, Patten said, “there are reasonable grounds to believe that multiple incidents of sexual violence took place with victims being subjected to rape and/or gang rape and then killed or killed while being raped.” She said credible sources described finding murdered victims, mostly women, naked from the waist down, many shot in the head. On Road 232 — the road to leave the festival — “credible information based on witness accounts describe an incident of the rape of two women by armed elements,” Patten said. Other reported rapes couldn’t be verified during their time in Israel. But she said “the mission team also found a pattern of bound naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down, in some cases tied to structures including trees and poles, along Road 232.” Patten said that in kibbutz Reim, the mission team verified the rape of a woman outside a bomb shelter and heard of other allegations of rape that could not yet be verified. At Kibbutz Be’eri, Patten said, her team “was able to determine that at least two allegations of sexual violence widely repeated in the media, were unfounded due to either new superseding information or inconsistency in the facts gathered.” These included a highly publicized allegation that a pregnant woman’s womb was reportedly ripped open before being killed with her fetus stabbed inside her, Patten said. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Princess of Wales, who underwent a planned abdominal surgery in January, was photographed Monday riding in a car with her mother, Carole Middleton. The picture arrives just days after Kensington Palace shut down rumors about the princesses’ whereabouts, following increased speculation on the internet. “Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates,” a spokesperson told HuffPost on Friday. “That guidance stands.” The spokesman reiterated that the princess is “doing well.” The palace previously announced the timeline for Kate’s recovery in a statement announcing the royal’s operation on Jan. 16. “The surgery was successful, and it is expected that she will remain in hospital for 10 to 14 days, before returning home to continue her recovery,” the palace shared with HuffPost at the time. “Based on the current medical advice, she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.” Kate’s health concerns come at a difficult time for the royal family. Buckingham Palace revealed early last month that King Charles had been diagnosed with cancer, which was discovered during a “recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement.” “Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer,” the palace said at the time. “His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties.” The palace specified that Charles “will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

(Watch the video below.) Appearing on “The View” Monday, the 92-year-old EGOT winner was asked by co-host Ana Navarro what she thought of criticism that Biden, 81, was too old to run again. “Let me say this and it’s very succinct and to the point: I am not about to vote for someone who has 91 indictments against them for criminal activities,” Moreno said, referring to the charges against Donald Trump spread over four indictments. “I mean, enough said already. That’s so stupid. Look at all the stuff Biden has accomplished.” “I’ll take 81 years over 91 counts any day,” Navarro chimed in. “Ya damn right,” Moreno countered. After just turning 92, the fabulous Rita Moreno shares how spreading joy keeps her thriving: ""What I bring with me is a lot of joy and I love to laugh, and I love to make people laugh."" https://t.co/cVclFZQmjA pic.twitter.com/1L2sL6hyDx A New York Times poll of 980 registered voters published Sunday doesn’t exactly reinforce Moreno’s confidence. More than 60% of the voters who backed Biden in 2020 now say he’s “just too old” to govern effectively. A whopping 73% of all registered voters said he was too long in the tooth as well, according to the survey. But if voters aren’t going to heed the word of a show business legend who has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony, they can at least enjoy the joke she cracked at Trump’s expense on the talk show. “I saw a sign in a deli wall in LA, where I was visiting,” Moreno said, per The Wrap. “And it said: Trump Sandwich.

The famous momager and mother of Miley Cyrus explained her reasoning on the latest episode of her podcast, “Sorry We’re Stoned,” which she co-hosts with her daughter, Brandi Cyrus. The episode, which was released last week, included a guest appearance from Wiz Khalifa. “I didn’t smoke pot when I had kids. I didn’t start smoking until I was, like, 46,” Tish Cyrus told Khalifa. “But I think I would’ve been a better parent if I would’ve smoked then,” she continued. “I think I would’ve been, like, I don’t know ― school projects, I would’ve felt more fun.” Brandi Cyrus interjected that her mother could’ve been “much more tolerant” during that time period of her life. “I was just like, ‘Ahhh!’” Tish Cyrus said of her attitude at the time, reiterating, “I really do wish I had smoked then.” Tish Cyrus has five children: Miley, Braison and Noah with her ex-husband, musician Billy Ray Cyrus, and Brandi and Trace from a previous relationship. Billy Ray Cyrus adopted Brandi and Trace after marrying Tish Cyrus in 1993. Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus divorced in 2022 and have since remarried other people.

But, f**k, it took a lot of hard work and determination getting here.” Kelce, who started crying as soon as he sat down at Monday’s news conference, explained how much football has meant to him. “Stepping on the field was the most alive and free I had ever felt,” the 36-year-old said. “There was a visceral feeling with football unlike any other sport,” he said. “The hairs on my arms would stand up. I could hit somebody, run around like a crazed lunatic and then get told, ‘Good job.’ I loved football.” The Philadelphia Eagles center, who has played for the franchise for his entire tenure, thanked an array of people during his announcement, including his high school and college coaches, his teammates and his family. When he got drafted to the NFL and picked to play for the Eagles, his agent told him he would fit in great in Philadelphia. “Thirteen seasons in Philadelphia and I look back on a career filled with ups and downs,” he said. Kelce, a seven-time Pro Bowl player, helped the Eagles win the Super Bowl in 2018, but the team fell short in 2023 against the Kansas City Chiefs. Kelce said it was always a goal of his to play for just one team his entire career. “I couldn’t have dreamt of a better one and a better fit if I tried,” he said. Kelce became extra tearful when he spoke about losing to the Kansas City Chiefs and his brother, Travis Kelce, in the 2023 Super Bowl. “I won’t forget falling short to the Chiefs and the conflicted feelings of immense heartbreak I had selfishly for myself and my teammates,” he said. “And at the same time, the amount of pride I had that my brother had climbed the mountaintop once again.” Travis Kelce was also seen wiping away tears while watching his brother announce his retirement. He said he doesn’t know what’s next for his career, but he looks forward to the next step. “Thank you, Philadelphia,” Jason Kelce said. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you for letting me represent this city and allowing me into your homes every Sunday.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/french-parliament-enshrines-constitutional-right-to-abortion_n_65e60e6be4b0f890593386e4","French Parliament Enshrines Right To Abortion In Constitution After Historic Vote","barbara surk , nicolas garriga","2024-03-04","PARIS (AP) — French lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved a bill that will enshrine a woman’s right to an abortion in France’s constitution, a historic move designed to prevent the kind of rollback of abortion rights seen in the United States in recent years. In an exceptional joint session of parliament convened at the Palace of Versailles, the bill was approved in a 780-72 vote. Abortion enjoys wide support in France across most of the political spectrum, and has been legal since 1975. The vote makes France the first country to have a constitutional right to abortion since the former Yugoslavia inscribed it in its 1974 constitution. Serbia’s 2006 constitution carries on that spirit, stating that “everyone has the right to decide on childbirth.” Nearly the entire hall in France stood in a long standing ovation, and many female legislators in the hall smiled broadly as they cheered. There were jubilant scenes of celebrations all over France as women’s rights activists hailed the measure promised by President Emmanuel Macron immediately following the Dobbs ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022. Both houses of parliament, the National Assembly and the Senate, had already adopted a bill to amend Article 34 of the French Constitution to specify that “the law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.” In the lead up to the historic vote, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal addressed the 925 lawmakers gathered for the joint session in Versailles, and called on them to make France a leader in women’s rights and set an example in defense of women’s rights for countries around the world. “We have a moral debt to women,” Attal said. He paid tribute to Simone Veil, a prominent legislator, former health minister and key feminist who in 1975 championed the bill that decriminalized abortion in France. “We have a chance to change history,” Attal said in a moving and determined speech. “Make Simone Veil proud,” he said to a standing ovation. The lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, overwhelmingly approved the proposal in January. The Senate adopted the bill on Wednesday, clearing a key hurdle for legislation promised by Macron’s government, intended to make “a woman’s right to have an abortion irreversible.” A three-fifths majority in the joint session was required for the measure to be approved None of France’s major political parties represented in parliament have questioned the right to abortion, including Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party and the conservative Republicans. However, some lawmakers have voted against inscribing abortion right into the constitution in previous votes in both houses. Le Pen, who won a record number of seats in the National Assembly two years ago, said on Monday that her party will vote in favor of the bill but added that “there is no need to make this a historic day.” The right to an abortion has broad support among the French public. A recent poll showed support at more than 80%, consistent with previous surveys. The same poll also showed that a solid majority of people are in favor of enshrining it in the constitution. There were scenes of celebrations around France even before the joint parliamentary session began. Sarah Durocher, a leader in the Family Planning movement, said Monday’s vote is “a victory for feminists and a defeat for the anti-choice activists.” With the right to an abortion added to the constitution, it will be much harder to prevent women from voluntarily terminating a pregnancy in France, women’s rights and equality activists said. “We increased the level of protection to this fundamental right,” said Anne-Cécile Mailfert of the Women’s Foundation. “It’s a guarantee for women today and in the future to have the right to abort in France.” The government argued in its introduction to the bill that the right to abortion is threatened in the United States, where the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a 50-year-old ruling that used to guarantee it. “Unfortunately, this event is not isolated: in many countries, even in Europe, there are currents of opinion that seek to hinder at any cost the freedom of women to terminate their pregnancy if they wish,” the introduction to the French legislation says. The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to strip women of the right to abortion has reverberated across Europe’s political landscape, forcing the issue back into public debate in France at a time of political upheaval. Mathilde Philip-Gay, a law professor and a specialist in French and American constitutional law, warned against easing the pressure on legislators for women’s rights as far-right parties — determined to curtail women’s rights — gain political influence and are elected to form governments around Europe and elsewhere. “It may not be an issue in France, where a majority of people support abortion,” Philip-Gay said. “But those same people may one day vote for a far-right government, and what happened in the U.S. can happen elsewhere in Europe, including in France.” The next four years will change America forever.

Inscribing abortion into the French Constitution “will make it harder for abortion opponents of the future to challenge these rights, but it won’t prevent them from doing it in the long run, with the right political strategy,” Philip-Gay added. “It only takes a moment for everything we thought that we have achieved to fade away,” said Yael Braun-Pivet, the first female president of the French parliament, in her address to the joint session. Amending the constitution is a laborious process and a rare event in France. Since it was enacted in 1958, the French Constitution has been amended 17 times. The last time was in 2008, when parliament was awarded more powers and French citizens were granted the right to bring their grievances to the Constitutional Court.

Edwards, who starred for the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets after a record-setting college career at Michigan, told WDIV TV that he overheard an argument on Friday about music being played too loud. “The noise escalates, and you can start to hear some pushing and shoving ― I mean, you know what fighting sounds like. Start to hear some tussling, start to hear some fists,” Edwards said. “But then once I heard a thud... that’s what got me up. That’s what got me to turn around.” Edwards said he saw a young man about to slam the older man’s head on the counter, so he jumped into action. “I grabbed him, subdued him,” he said. According to Farmington Hills police, who described the suspect as a 20-year-old man, the victim was already unconscious and bleeding when Edwards intervened. Edwards “pulled the suspect off the injured man, at which time the suspect attacked [Edwards], who was able to fight the suspect off,” a police release said. The suspect fled the scene on foot but was captured without incident, according to police. “I’d like to thank the good Samaritan for taking action to stop the suspect in the midst of a vicious assault,” Farmington Hills police Chief Jeff King said in the release, which did not identify Edwards by name.

The unanimous 9-0 decision avoided answering whether or not Trump engaged in insurrection, finding instead that states do not have the right to disqualify candidates for federal office under the 14th Amendment. To no one’s surprise, Trump greeted the news with glee. “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” he wrote on Truth Social, the right-wing social media company he’s accused of trying to filch from its co-founders. Trump doubled down on that sentiment in remarks at Mar-a-Lago, applauding the justices for their decision. “They worked long, they worked hard, and frankly, they worked very quickly on something that will be spoken about 100 years from now and 200 years from now,” he said. Trump also reiterated his belief that the decision about his eligibility ultimately lies with the voters. “The voters can take someone out of the race, but a court shouldn’t be doing that,” he said. The twice-impeached former president faces 91 criminal charges spanning four criminal cases for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, illegally retaining hundreds of highly classified documents after he left office, and falsifying business records during the 2016 presidential election to conceal hush-money payments he made to two women with whom he allegedly had extramarital affairs.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. I hunt for and write about exceptional products for a living, and have read thousands of reviews for innumerable goods. That’s all to say that I have read many a gushing review. Yet I have to admit, the volume of exceptional reviews for these quick-dry hiking pants from Baleaf impressed even me — and the women’s version is on sale for 19% off for a limited time. These popular men’s and women’s pants are comfy, lightweight and so water-repellant that reviewers recount spilling bottles of water on them and simply watching the water roll off. The women’s are surprisingly stylish, thanks to their adjustable ankle straps that give the option of a more tapered look. In my opinion, most impressive of all is the material’s UPF 50+ sun protection factor, which reviewers swear by for guarding their legs from UV rays. Reviewers not only love these comfy pants for hiking, but also say they basically live in them. And they mean it. In addition to being vouched for by hikers and lovers of comfy clothing, folks with tons of different professions and hobbies have added these pants to their daily rotation of staples, including dental hygienists and nurses who use them as scrubs, fly fishers, climbers who zip-line and rappel, office and retail workers, camera operators, people who rehabilitate and groom animals, and construction workers. Some reviewers even dress them up to wear out to dinner. The women’s pants are available in 18 colors in sizes XS–3XL, and the men’s version is available in three colors in sizes S–3XL. (Note: For the women’s pants, a number of reviewers suggest sizing up.) Each has deep zippered pockets so you can stash your phone and other hefty items comfortably, then zip them right up to ensure they’re extra secure. (The women’s version has two pockets at the side and one at the back, and the men’s version has two at the side and back.) As someone who has been unwillingly subjected to women’s pants with either no pockets or insultingly small, shallow pockets, this is nothing short of awesome. They’re also highly durable, with one reviewer mentioning their pair got caught on an aluminum decking during a construction job, and their pants not only did not rip, but did not even snag. Okay, I’m listening. According to reviewers, they’re perfect pants to pack for travel since you can roll them up super tight, using up almost no room in your luggage. The adjustable drawstring waist will help these fit even if you’re feeling bloated or have some fluctuations in weight. And strikingly, folks of all body types love them, including tall, petite and plus size reviewers. One reviewer’s adult son was so impressed by her pair that he asked if they made them in men’s. Luckily for him, they do. And finally, reviewers say they also do a great job protecting against mosquitoes, welcome news given that mosquitoes are more plentiful this year than ever in many parts of the country. Grab your own pair while they’re on sale, or read on for what Amazon reviewers have to say. Promising reviews: “I wore these pants daily on an 8-day backcountry canoe trip for which I wanted good sun coverage. They held up great! They dried quickly (important on a canoe trip) and breathed well. I’m as happy with them as I would have been with a pair of pants from REI, which were all $50+ more expensive. Zipper pockets were nice ― particularly enjoyed the thigh pocket which fit a standard iPhone + small map and fun-size candy and was accessible while seated in the boat. For sizing reference, I’m 5′3″ and 125ish lbs, and a small worked well and still had room for me to slip a pair of long underwear under on our coldest day.” — Ana “Love this pants! They can be dressed up or dressed down. They are wrinkle free, light weight, contain 4 different zippered pockets and the drawstrings at the ankles can be pulled or not pulled, depending on if you want a jogger/hiker pant look or a causal pants look. These are super comfortable - I ordered two pairs and loved them so much I immediately got on online and ordered 2 more pairs in different colors. They fit true to size - I’m 5 ft., 1″ and approximately 113 pounds - an XS fit me perfectly with a nice loose fit. Highly recommend these - I think they’d also be great for travel - they are so lightweight they would not take up much room at all in a carry on bag.” — Lucy Van Der Laan “I am 67 years and love to garden. I wear these pants for the sun protection along with a white long sleeve crew neck. They have worked great and I do not overheat in them. The fabric is light weight and breathable.” — Smartlady By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Bissell’s Little Green portable carpet cleaner is a big-time fan favorite, so there’s a rush whenever it gets marked down. It has a reputation for selling out during big sales events like Amazon Prime Days, so if you’ve always wanted to get one for yourself at a discount, you’re in luck. Both Amazon and Walmart are offering this famed cleaning machine for less than $100 right now. The classic green version that you’ve probably come to recognize is $98 at Amazon, and there’s a cool black color that’s exclusive to Walmart also on sale for an impressive $89. That model works just like the green version, comes with the same 3-inch tough stain tool to spray, scrub and suction away dirt and stains, and the same handy 48-ounce tank capacity and the same free 8-ounce bottle of Bissell’s Spot & Stain with Febreze Freshness cleaner. I own one of these Little Green cleaners, and they are indeed supremely portable and carpet-saving (pet owners love them). Every time I spill food on my rug — this happens way too often — I just run for the Little Green, flip it on, spend a scant minute scrubbing, suction up the dirty water and then breath a sigh of relief. It’s saved me from soy sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, dollops of of curry and more than one dropped cheeseburger. Reviewers say they also use this on upholstery, car seats and even mattresses. It may just be one of the most beloved cleaning tools we share her at HuffPost, and this is the lowest price I remember seeing for it. Grab one now for up to $34 off. Promising reviews from Walmart.com: “Honestly amazing, my roommate’s cat knocked over a plant I’d just repotted and this made the carpet look good as new. We’re about to move, so I didn’t want to be charged for replacing all the carpets if it came to that which could be hundreds. Walmart had it for the cheapest price I’d seen anywhere, so I grabbed it. It took all the solution it came with and around an hour to do but it looks 1000% better. Prior to this I had rented one from Lowe’s which helped a little, but the stain was still noticeable. This made it look like there never was a stain. 10/10...” — Emily, verified purchase “Love this cleaner, I cleaned my kitchen stool seats, my sofas and my hallway carpets boy did it leave it so clean and very easy to use highly recommend.” —Arlene, verified purchase “Bought this because we needed a portable, smaller carpet cleaner to take back and forth to our cabin for smaller messes. Also for our boat and vehicles as well. It’s so easy to transport and functions really well. We were actually very impressed, it worked better then we expected.” — NW, verified purchase “I’m so glad that I bought the little green machine. Everyday messes are not as upsetting as they used to be. This machine has cleaned everything spotless, including black coffee and doggie accidents. And you can’t even tell where these stains occurred. I’ve also used it to clean our dining room chairs, really perked them up.

During an appearance on CNN Monday morning, Griffin was asked about a string of verbal slip-ups the GOP presidential front-runner made in speeches over the weekend. “You saw Donald Trump firsthand when he was, albeit four years or several years younger, at least. How much does he miss or mix up facts and the like?” CNN’s John Berman asked. “I have said this before, he is not as sharp as he was in 2016 and not even as sharp as he was in 2020,” Griffin said. She went on to say that Trump “is not the strongest fighter that Republicans could have right now,” adding that it’s “remarkable how much voters don’t see [his] age as also an issue because he is only 3 1/2 years younger than President Joe Biden.” Griffin was Trump’s White House communications director for eight months in 2020. She also served as a press secretary for former Vice President Mike Pence and the Department of Defense. Griffin said Trump has “never been a super articulate or eloquent person,” but he’s been consistently mixing up the names of people like Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley recently.

No matter what time of year it is, it’s always important to slather sunscreen on ourselves and our loved ones. Sunscreen is proven to reduce the risk of skin cancer and protect skin against premature aging, but unfortunately, that knowledge is not always enough to actually inspire us to apply sunscreen. Greasy, heavy sun lotions can make you dread application so much that logic goes out the window (I know that’s true for me). That’s why this bestselling EltaMD Clear broad-spectrum SPF 46 —currently 20% off with discount code REFRESH as part of Dermstore’s beauty refresh sale — is here to save the day and probably answer more than a few of your prayers. Beloved by dermatologists and thousands of 5-star reviewers, it provides strong UVA and UVB protection in a lightweight, oil- and fragrance-free formula that promises to leave no sticky residue on your face and no white cast. Those with sensitive skin or rosacea may benefit from its calming niacinamide and antibacterial zinc, both skincare favorites for soothing inflamed skin. This cult-favorite SPF also moisturizes with popular hyaluronic acid while helping even out hyperpigmentation, reducing shine and lightly exfoliating pores thanks to the inclusion of lactic acid. You just can’t go wrong with this gentle powerhouse sunscreen, and its 20% discount is the cherry on top. Apply under or over makeup, and be sure to reapply every two hours while you’re in the sun. Check out these glowing reviews from Dermstore — and while you’re grabbing a bottle for yourself, do your teen or your partner a favor and let them in on this sun protection must-have, too. “This is my go–to sunscreen. I’ve used it for about four years now and it’s perfect. It applies very smoothly and dries down quick. It feels more like a serum than a sunscreen. For years I dreaded applying sunscreen, but this one is amazing. I have from time to time wandered away from this product, but I always come back. No other sunscreen compares.” — Jessica “It’s honestly as good as sunscreen gets. I used it on my boyfriend and he thought I was putting regular lotion on his face since it’s so soothing and goes on totally transparent. Plus it’s non-irritating and great for skin conditions like acne.” — Delaney “This is by far my favorite sunscreen. I use it daily and it always protects my face from getting sunburnt. This is the one sunscreen that I used when I had severe acne and it helped my acne and inflammation greatly! I recommend it to everyone I meet.” — Stacy “This sunscreen is my favorite. As a brown-skinned girl, this doesn’t leave a white cast after being blended in! It also is incredibly hydrating.” — Savi “Holy grail sunscreen. As if this product NEEDS another five-star review — but it’s too good not to sing its praises! It blends like a dream and it doesn’t bother my oily, acne-prone skin. I don’t find that there’s any white cast, and my skin appears hydrated and glowy. Five million stars!” — Amy “As someone who has had numerous basal skin cancers removed from my face, I am always on the lookout for the best sun protection.

The 76-year-old surrendered to the Manhattan district attorney’s office early Monday following weeks of negotiations with prosecutors. He will be sentenced to five months in jail, according to The Associated Press. “Allen Weisselberg looks forward to putting this situation behind him,” Seth L. Rosenberg, one of Weisselberg’s lawyers, said in an emailed statement to HuffPost. Weisselberg, who was also sentenced last year to five months in prison after being found guilty of multiple tax fraud charges in 2022, had been suspected of lying about his former boss’ finances during a sworn deposition in May and while on the stand during Trump’s trial in October. Weisselberg, under oath, had said that he was not involved in an evaluation of Trump’s Manhattan penthouse, which was listed for years as much larger in size on his annual financial statements than it actually was. Shortly after Weisselberg’s testimony, Forbes published an article citing past emails and notes between the outlet and him that contradicted his claims. Forbes reported that he was not only involved in an evaluation of the penthouse, but he tried to inflate the property’s value over several years. New York state Judge Arthur Engoron later questioned the veracity of Weisselberg’s testimony prior to delivering his judgment in Trump’s trial last month. In an email to the defense and prosecution on Feb. 5, Engoron said he was considering whether he should throw out all of Weisselberg’s testimony after The New York Times first reported about Weisselberg negotiating with prosecutors on a perjury plea. “As the presiding magistrate, the trier of fact, and the judge of credibility, I of course want to know whether Mr. Weisselberg is now changing his tune, and whether he is admitting he lied under oath in my courtroom at trial,” Engoron wrote. Shortly after, Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355 million in penalties for lying about his wealth. Weisselberg was also permanently banned from having financial control over any New York corporation or similar business entity in New York. In his ruling, Engoron said “the evidence is overwhelming” that Weisselberg, as well as Trump’s former corporate controller, Jeffrey McConney, “cannot be entrusted with controlling the finances of any business.” McConney received the same business ban in New York.

A great many artists or their estates have condemned Trump’s use of their music over the years, including the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, the Smiths, Black Sabbath, Rihanna and others.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-trump-colorado-ballot-ruling_n_65984f08e4b0f9f6621ca0ee","Supreme Court Says Donald Trump Can Appear On 2024 Ballot","lydia o'connor","2024-03-04","The U.S. Supreme Court overruled a Colorado court’s decision barring Donald Trump from appearing on the 2024 presidential ballot in an unsigned and unanimous decision on Monday. The case revolved around a clause in the 14th Amendment stating that anyone who took an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution but then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against it is ineligible to hold state or federal office. The Colorado Supreme Court had ruled Dec. 19 that Trump’s actions in support of the Jan. 6 insurrection disqualified him from the ballot. The Supreme Court disagreed, arguing that states do not have the ability under the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates for federal office. “We conclude that States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office,” the decision states. “But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency.” The court’s decision ensures that Trump will remain on the ballot in Colorado, and Maine and Illinois, where judges and election officials similarly ruled him ineligible under the 14th Amendment. The decision came the day before Colorado’s Republican presidential primary election, which the state’s top court had ordered Trump disqualified from. “While the Supreme Court allowed Donald Trump back on the ballot on technical legal grounds, this was in no way a win for Trump,” Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the liberal legal group that led the Colorado lawsuit, said in a statement. “The Supreme Court had the opportunity in this case to exonerate Trump, and they chose not to do so.” Trump, on the other hand, called the decision a “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” The case came before the court after a group of Colorado voters challenged Trump’s eligibility under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment in state court. This challenge followed a series of lawsuits brought by CREW and Free Speech for People, another liberal legal group, seeking to disqualify other candidates from office for their participation or alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection. At first a Colorado court ruled against the challenge to Trump’s ballot eligibility by claiming that the presidency was not an “office ... under the United States” to which Section 3 applied. On appeal, the Colorado Supreme Court overruled the lower state court in a 4-3 decision to find that Section 3 applied to the presidency and that Trump engaged in insurrection that warranted disqualification from future political office. In its decision, the U.S. Supreme Court remained silent on whether Trump engaged in insurrection or not, but instead solely determined that states did not have the authority under Section 3 to disqualify federal candidates. “Because federal officers “‘owe their existence and functions to the united voice of the whole, not of a portion, of the people,’” powers over their election and qualifications must be specifically “delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States,” the decision says, quoting from its 1995 precedent in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton where it struck down state-imposed term limits on congressional candidates. While the court spoke in a united voice in its decision that states did not have the authority to disqualify federal candidates under Section 3, four justices dissented from the decision’s assertion that Section 3 could only be enforced by congressional legislation. “Today, the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming President,” a concurrence from liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson states. “Although we agree that Colorado cannot enforce Section 3, we protest the majority’s effort to use this case to define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision.” In addition, conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett issued her own concurrence stating that the case “does not require us to address the complicated question whether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced.” The court’s decision to allow Trump to remain on the ballot was not a surprise. When it heard oral arguments in early February, the court appeared unanimous in its skepticism of the Colorado Supreme Court ruling that Trump was disqualified from office because of his role inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. At that hearing, the court’s six conservative justices and three liberal ones appeared united in the argument that that clause does not empower individual states to remove candidates for federal office from the ballot without legislative authorization from Congress. “The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power,” Chief Justice John Roberts, historically a swing vote on the court, said at the hearing. “Wouldn’t that be the last place you’d look for authorization for the states, including the Confederate states, to enforce … the presidential election process?” he added. “That seems to be a position at war with the whole thrust of the 14th Amendment and very ahistorical.” Kagan raised similar concerns. “To put it most baldly, the question that you have to confront is why a single state should get to decide who gets to be president of the United States,” she said at the time. When it issued its ruling in December, the Colorado Supreme Court acknowledged the enormity of such a decision. “We do not reach these conclusions lightly,” the court wrote. “We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us. We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.” The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case at the request of Trump’s lawyers. The former president’s spokesperson Steven Cheung called Colorado’s decision an “unAmerican, unconstitutional act of election interference which cannot stand.” Efforts to remove Trump from the ballot have advanced in 36 states, though courts have since dismissed or rejected more than half of them. Trump’s legal woes are far from over. He was initially scheduled to face trial in March on four felony charges related to his role in the Capitol insurrection, but a judge delayed the start of that trial. A new date has not been set. Across the four criminal cases in which he’s been indicted, he’s been charged with 91 felonies. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

Greg Abbott (R-Texas) “couldn’t be more wrong” in claiming there is no need for Congress to approve legislation on immigration, and accused Abbott of “trying to wreak havoc” in cities across the U.S. Abbott had previously called on President Joe Biden to use his executive authority to improve the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. “The president does not need new laws,” Abbott told CNN’s “State of the Union” last month. “The president needs the backbone to make sure that he enforces the immigration laws that are already on the books.” Mayorkas on Sunday took issue with Abbott’s comments, telling CNN’s Dana Bash that the governor “couldn’t be more wrong” and that Abbott’s suggested approach failed during former President Donald Trump’s time in office. “As a matter of fact, former President Trump tried to close the border, and it was enjoined in the courts and never saw the light of day,” Mayorkas said. Mayorkas also blasted Abbott for failing to work with other U.S. officials, and for engaging in political stunts by busing migrants from Texas to Democrat-led states and cities like New York and Chicago. “This coming from an individual who is purposefully refusing to coordinate, communicate, collaborate with other officials, and trying to wreak havoc in other cities and states across the country,” Mayorkas said. “That is not a model of governance, and he couldn’t be more wrong.” Republicans, at Trump’s urging, ended up rejecting a bipartisan bill that would have established some of the toughest border enforcement measures in decades, to avoid potentially handing Biden a win in an election year. Abbott joined Trump at his campaign stop at the border last week, where the former president said he is “absolutely” considering the governor as a potential running mate.

Most recently, the administration sued Texas over a bill that would enable local police to arrest migrants who cross into the country illegally. A federal court struck down the legislation, but the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton (R), has already appealed the decision. Bash also asked Mayorkas whether he wants the Senate to hold an impeachment trial against him, after the House voted to impeach him last month in what was widely considered a politically motivated effort by Republicans to make Trump look tough on immigration ahead of November’s presidential election. “I’m going to let the Senate, of course, execute its responsibilities as it thinks best in the service of our country,” Mayorkas told Bash. “I am going to focus on work.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The policy has taken effect during spring training and the expectation is for it to continue in the regular season, outlets reported. The move may strike some as surprising given the city’s liberal bent and former San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick’s historic protests several years ago. But Melvin insisted there’s no politics behind the mandate. “Look, we’re a new team here, we got some good players here,’’ Melvin told USA Today in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Friday. “It’s more about letting the other side know that we’re ready to play. I want guys out here ready to go. There’s a personality to that.” He continued, “It has nothing to do with whatever happened in the past or whatever, it’s just something I embrace. You want your team ready to play and I want the other team to notice it, too. It’s as simple as that. They’re embracing it.” Melvin said he had the same rule as manager of the Oakland A’s and San Diego Padres and had to crack down from time to time. The Athletic previously reported that Melvin wants to enforce the policy during the regular season although getting full participation will be “trickier” because of different pregame routines. “But the expectation is that everyone who can be out there standing at attention will be out there standing at attention,” The Athletic wrote. The man he replaced to lead the Giants, Gabe Kapler, embraced activism when it came to the anthem. Kapler stopped appearing on the field in 2022 for “The Star-Spangled Banner” after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Sports Illustrated reported. He also took a knee in protest following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. Kaepernick’s demonstrations to raise awareness of racism and police brutality began in 2016, putting him in the cross-hairs of backlash that included the rage of Donald Trump.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-benny-gantz-meeting-dc_n_65e5da5be4b0f89059336d99","Kamala Harris Meets Israeli Cabinet Official Despite Netanyahu's Rebuke","aamer madhani , seung min kim","2024-03-04","WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris met on Monday with a member of Israel’s wartime Cabinet who came to Washington in defiance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the Biden administration intensifies its efforts to push more humanitarian aid into war-battered Gaza. White House officials said Benny Gantz, a centrist political rival of Netanyahu, requested the meeting and that the Democratic administration believed it was important that Harris sit down with the prominent Israeli official despite Netanyahu’s objections. President Joe Biden, Harris and other senior administration officials have become increasingly blunt about their dissatisfaction with the mounting death toll in Gaza and the suffering of innocent Palestinians as the war nears the five-month mark. “The president and I have been aligned and consistent from the very beginning,” Harris said in an exchange with reporters shortly before meeting with Gantz. “Israel has a right to defend itself. Far too many Palestinian civilians, innocent civilians have been killed. We need to get more aid in, we need to get hostages out. and that remains our position.” The White House, in a statement following the meeting, said Harris and Gantz discussed the urgency of completing a hostage deal to free more than 100 people believed still to be in captivity in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. She also reiterated the administration’s support for a temporary extended cease-fire that would facilitate the release of hostages and allow for a surge of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. Although Gantz holds many of the same hardline views as Netanyahu, he has been seen as more open to compromise on critical issues, including the increased delivery of humanitarian assistance. The meeting comes after the U.S. on Saturday carried out the first of what are expected to be ongoing airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The moment is reflective of the increasingly awkward dynamics in the U.S.-Israel relationship, with the U.S. forced to fly badly needed aid past its close ally as it looks to ramp up assistance for desperate civilians in Gaza. The first airdrop occurred just days after more than 100 Palestinians were killed as they were trying to get food from an Israel-organized convoy. The White House agreed to the meeting with Gantz even as an official from Netanyahu’s nationalist Likud party said Gantz did not have approval from the prime minister for his meetings in Washington. Netanyahu gave Gantz a “tough talk” about the visit — underscoring a widening crack within Israel’s wartime leadership. “We have been dealing with all members of the war Cabinet, including Mr. Gantz,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. “We see this as a natural outgrowth of those discussions. We’re not going to turn away that sort of opportunity.” In addition to his talks with Harris, Gantz met with White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Security Council Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk. Gantz also met with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and on Tuesday will sit down with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Gantz ,just before the start of his White House meetings, told a reporter with Israel’s public broadcaster Kan: “There will be an open and honest conversation between two friendly and important countries and partners.” Biden is at Camp David, the presidential retreat just outside Washington, until Tuesday as he prepares to deliver the annual State of the Union address later this week. Over the weekend, Harris issued a forceful call for a temporary cease-fire deal in Gaza, which administration officials say would halt fighting for at least six weeks. She also increased pressure on Israel not to impede the aid that workers are trying to get into the region. The White House has been advocating for that framework deal for weeks. Israel has essentially agreed to the deal, according to a senior Biden administration official, and the White House has emphasized that the onus is on Hamas to come on board. Biden faces mounting political pressure at home over his administration’s handling of the Israeli-Hamas war, which was triggered when militants in Gaza launched an attack, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 people hostage. In last week’s Michigan presidential primary, more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters cast ballots for “uncommitted.” Biden still easily won the state’s primary, but the “uncommitted” vote reflected a coordinated push by voters on the left to register their dissatisfaction with the president’s unwavering support for Israel as its military operations in Gaza have left more than 30,000 Palestinians dead. The vote totals raise concerns for Democrats in a state Biden won by only 154,000 votes in 2020. Gantz, who polls show could be a formidable candidate for prime minister if a vote were held today, is viewed as a political moderate. But he has remained vague about his view of Palestinian statehood — something that Biden sees as essential to forging a lasting peace once the conflict ends but that Netanyahu adamantly opposes. It is also assumed that when the heavy fighting subsides, Gantz will leave the government, which would increase pressure for early elections. Since Gantz joined Netanyahu’s three-minister war Cabinet in October, U.S. officials have found him to be easier to deal with than either Netanyahu or Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Until now, calls for elections have been muted due to the war, but analysts think that when Gantz leaves the government, it will send a signal to the Israeli public that the need for national unity has passed and efforts to oust Netanyahu’s government can begin in earnest. For his part, Gantz was aiming to strengthen ties with the U.S., bolster support for Israel’s war and push for the release of Israeli hostages, according to a second Israeli official. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t allowed to publicly discuss the disputes within the Israeli government. Gantz is scheduled to head to London for meetings after his U.S. visit. It was unclear if Gantz during his White House talks diverged from Netanyahu’s stances on Palestinian statehood or carrying out an expanded operation in the southernmost Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Israel against a Rafah operation without a plan to protect civilians, and the White House said Harris reiterated that position in her meeting with Gantz. “I don’t doubt there are some administration officials who believe just by meeting with Gantz they are undermining Netanyahu,” said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a conservative Washington think tank. “But if Gantz carries the government’s line on key issues of disagreement, these meetings are net-negative for the White House while helpful back home for Gantz.” ___ Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel; Wafaa Shurafa in Rafah, Gaza Strip; Samy Magdy in Cairo and Matthew Lee and Zeke Miller contributed to this report.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/american-kids-lack-independence_l_65e1f6cee4b0d2a2475922a8","The 1 Thing Kids In Other Countries Do That Differs Greatly From American Kids","marie holmes","2024-03-04","My son, age 14, loves watching the Japanese show ‘Old Enough’ on Netflix. The premise is that young children — ages 4, 3 and even 2 — are sent to run errands by themselves. Cleverly disguised camera crews trail them on their journeys while their parents wait for them at home or some other predetermined meeting point. The kids walk though neighborhoods, cross the street, navigate public transit and manage interactions with shopkeepers. One little girl carries her mother’s work pants to be mended. Another child purchases dumplings from a vendor. The children’s focus and determination is captivating, and it’s impossible not to become invested in their success at the task. The kids are also adorable. Their reactions and facial expressions regularly crack my son up. But that isn’t the show’s only allure. The sheer implausibility of the whole endeavor draws him in. “You would’ve never let me do something like this,” he observed. “You would’ve been freaking out.” He’s not wrong. When he was 3, I likely would’ve sent him hang gliding before allowing him to cross the street alone. But my parenting instincts aren’t just a product of my own neuroses. They’re part of a culture, and here in the U.S. we’ve developed a culture of overprotectiveness and fear when it comes to kids acting independently. By keeping them safely within arms’ reach, what are our kids missing out on? And what are some ways we could give them the opportunity to practice these vital life skills? Japan isn’t the only nation where you can find kids navigating a town’s streets and public transportation without adult supervision. Mei-Ling Hopgood lived in Argentina as a new mother, writing about the experience in her book “How Eskimos Keep Their Babies Warm,” in which she explores parenting practices around the globe. She noted that it was common in Argentina and in other countries to see children commuting to and from school without adults. In some places, the reasons behind this particular independence are structural. Not all families have cars, so the only options may be walking, biking or taking public transit. Another factor is parents’ level of trust in their community. When they send their kids out of the house, do they assume they will be safe and that the adults they interact with will be helpful and trustworthy? In Argentina, Hopgood saw signs of trust in the community of surrounding adults. “If a child is crossing the street, not with a parent, or if an older person is crossing the street and needs help, they will take your hands. For example, when I would take the girls back to Argentina when they were little, the drivers that would pick us up, a man they did not know, would take their hands and walk them to the car,” she said, much to the surprise of her daughters, who by then were living in the U.S. “The thinking [is] that adults are there to help you,” Hopgood told HuffPost. This includes men and even men you don’t know, and was a real shift from the “stranger danger” panic that permeated her American childhood. It was “notable to me because of the bias against men being nurturing people, or they are the strangers you should be afraid of.” Journalist Michaeleen Doucleff observed a similar kind of autonomy among the Maya, Inuit and Hadzabe children that she observed when researching her book “Hunt, Gather, Parent.” Children in these cultures, she told HuffPost, “have enormous freedom to decide where they go, what they do and who they’re with. Parents and older kids are around them, observing and ensuring they are safe. But generally their movements and actions are their own.” Again, there is a shared assumption that children are safe moving throughout the community. This autonomy extends to kids setting their own schedules — deciding when do go to bed, for example (an often fraught topic for American parents that has generated the profession of sleep consultant). In general, kids were entrusted with a multitude of what an American would likely consider “adult” responsibilities: “They use knives and the stove. They help take care of younger siblings (playing with them, changing diapers, feeding them). They take care of animals or a family garden. They learn to hunt, slaughter/butcher animals, make clothes. They work at local stores. They climb trees, gather firewood or forage for food,” Doucleff said. This trust in children’s ability to handle things includes managing their emotions and speaking for themselves. “They are allowed to get upset, have tantrums, without being scolded or forced to control their emotions very early,” Doucleff said. In addition, she said, “parents allow children to talk for themselves” rather than answering questions directed at them on their behalf or prompting them with what to say. Other cultures also have a higher tolerance for risk when it comes to kids’ behavior. Helen Russell, author of the forthcoming “The Danish Secret to Happy Kids” (released already in Britain as “How to Raise a Viking”), observed in Denmark that children often take risks in their extensive outdoor play and are expected to resolve conflicts among themselves when they arise. Likewise, children speak for themselves and are expected to dress themselves (including the all-important snowsuit!) and feed themselves, rather than being told by adults what to say, what to wear and when and what to eat. Danish children, Russell told HuffPost, are allowed to pretty much “roam free,” and the same is true in other Nordic countries. “Icelandic children are all allowed to roam free until a state-sanctioned ‘curfew’ in the summer holidays, when Iceland enjoys 24-hour sun. So, come July, 13- to 16-year-olds are allowed to run wild until midnight, while children up to the age of 12 get to hang out until 10 p.m.,” she said. Letting children travel about, do chores and play without interference from adults can allow the adults more time to get their own work done and might seem to require less effort. Doucleff, however, noted that it’s not that parents are letting their children go unattended. “Adults keep a close eye to ensure kids are safe. So it’s not about simply doing less.” The key difference, she explained, is that “parents don’t interfere with children’s actions and movements, especially during play.” Kids, not adults, are the ones who truly reap the rewards of this dynamic. “Lack of autonomy is strongly associated with anxiety and depression,” Doucleff said, while “high levels of autonomy are linked to confidence, drive and all-around better mental health. In the communities I visited in ‘Hunt, Gather, Parent,’ children had these in spades.” Autonomy, she explained, “enables children to learn adult skills ... . So they can be active contributors to their families and not simply attended to by their parents.” We know that being able to contribute meaningfully can help kids feel a sense of mattering, which is protective of their mental health. Knowing that adults trust them to get from one place to another or use the kitchen knives helps them believe in their own abilities and gives them opportunities to “learn on their own, make mistakes on their own,” Hopgood said. Experience teaches them that they can figure things out for themselves and overcome challenges. Russell explained that all the outdoor play kids engage in in Denmark, in spite of frigid weather, also has a positive effect on their well-being. “Studies show that spending time outdoors improves well-being and cooperation, reduces stress, helps with concentration and evens out differences between low-achieving and high-achieving children,” she said. Hopgood, a journalism professor at Northwestern University, noted that here in the U.S. we are beginning to see the effect of a lack of independence once these children head off to college. “Students coming to university, [their] maturity and responsibility level is years below what they were some years ago. Because of many reasons, but parents have done so much for them.” Without practice, kids lack problem-solving skills and confidence in their ability to tackle challenges without their parents’ help. There’s no need to move all the way to Latin America or Scandinavia to help your kids learn independence. Some communities, by their design, are more conducive to kids’ autonomy than others, and some places are also simply safer. But even within the confines of your own home, there are steps you can take to encourage this growth. “It’s about having confidence in children’s ability to learn and grow at a young age without the need for constant interference from adults,” Doucleff said. Doucleff measured her own interference in her children’s lives by counting how many times per hour she gave them commands. (“Eat two more bites, please.” “Give me the ball.”) She initially found that this number was 120 — which is in line with what most kids experience in Western cultures. “In cultures with autonomous children, parents give only two to three commands per hour. So a hundred times fewer! It’s radically different than the approach that’s common in the U.S.,” she said. She encourages parents to use their cellphones to record their own interactions with their children and count the number of commands they are giving now and make a goal of getting that number down to three per hour. You can start slow, by having a low-command hour just once a day, perhaps at the playground. She also recommends that parents take some time to observe their children. “See what their interests are but also their skill level. Then you know when to back off and be confident that they’ve got the situation handled or when to jump in to help if they need it.” Focus on building up their independence in a specific domain by “teaching them skills they need to handle any dangers or problems that may arise in these environments,” such as using knives and electrical plugs, crossing streets or watching for cars. “Then schedule time in their week to simply be autonomous in these environments (without devices),” she said. You don’t have to start by letting them roam free all afternoon. Instead, you might begin by letting them walk home from school with a sibling or group of friends. If they’re interested in cooking, you could plan to let them make breakfast for themselves on Saturday mornings. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

JetBlue said Monday that even though both companies still believe in the deal, they were unlikely to meet the closing conditions required in the agreement before a July 24 deadline. JetBlue’s new CEO, Joanna Geraghty, called the merger “a bold and courageous plan intended to shake up the industry status quo” and speed JetBlue’s growth. “However, with the ruling from the federal court and the Department of Justice’s continued opposition, the probability of getting the green light to move forward with the merger anytime soon is extremely low,” Geraghty said in a memo to employees of New York airline. She said uncertainty over the merger’s fate was distracting the airline from its effort to return to profitability. Spirit CEO Ted Christie said he was disappointed that the airlines could not combine and create a new challenger to the nation’s four biggest airlines but said he is confident that Spirit — which has been losing money since the pandemic started — can succeed on its own. JetBlue will pay Spirit a $69 million termination fee. The Justice Department sued to block the merger last year, saying it would reduce competition and drive up fares, especially for travelers who depend on low-fare Spirit. In January, a federal district judge in Boston sided with the government and blocked the deal, saying it violated antitrust law. On Monday, the Justice Department took a victory lap. “Today’s decision by JetBlue is yet another victory for the Justice Department’s work on behalf of American consumers,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “The Justice Department proved in court that a merger between JetBlue and Spirit would have caused tens of millions of travelers to face higher fares and fewer choices. We will continue to vigorously enforce the nation’s antitrust laws.” The airlines had appealed the ruling, and a hearing had been set for June in the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. The Biden administration’s Justice Department, which has fought against consolidation in several industries, previously killed a partnership between JetBlue and American Airlines on flights in New York and Boston. Spirit and Frontier Airlines announced a $2.2 billion merger in early 2022 — a deal that would have combined two similar carriers that charge lower fares than the big airlines but add on fees that generate a large chunk of their revenue. JetBlue jumped into the fray against the wishes of Spirit’s management, which warned that it would be difficult to win regulatory approval for a Spirit-JetBlue combination. JetBlue went over the heads of Spirit’s board, directly to Spirit’s shareholders, and won a bidding war against rival Frontier a few month later. While the deal was taking shape and wound up in court, there were continuing losses and other problems at Spirit, which is based in Miramar, Florida. In late January, JetBlue warned that it might terminate the agreement. The next four years will change America forever.

Activist investor Carl Icahn bought nearly 10% of JetBlue stock last month and won two seats on JetBlue’s board. The end of the JetBlue-Spirit deal raises questions about whether Alaska Airlines can pull off its proposed purchase of Hawaiian Airlines for $1 billion plus the assumption of about $900 million in debt. The Justice Department has not indicated whether it will sue to block that agreement.

The withering montage prompted conservative pundit Charlie Sykes, the former editor-in-chief of The Bulwark, to advise “bedwetting” Democrats on how to defeat the former president if, as is increasingly likely, he becomes the GOP nominee to take on President Joe Biden in November. “Well, what fresh hell?” Sykes responded to footage of Trump slurring, mispronouncing words, confusing Biden with former President Barack Obama and claiming a Taliban leader addressed him as “Your Highness.” Sykes acknowledged he’s “not a psychiatrist” but drew a sharp distinction between Biden who “is old” and Trump who is “deranged, demented and pathetic […] not to mention dangerous.” But Biden could use that to his advantage, the commentator suggested. Biden “will be able to say, ‘Yeah, I’m old, I’m very stiff when I walk, but this guy is also old and he’s crazy and he’s dangerous and he’s incoherent.’” Trump’s likely nomination will “focus the mind” among Democrats, he added, who he urged to “stop the bedwetting” and maybe “freak out a little bit.” “This could actually happen” he warned. “Maybe we ought to treat that threat the way it ought to be treated. If it’s an existential threat, let’s act like it is an existential threat. So, stop the bedwetting, but maybe a little freakout wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.” The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/petting-dogs-frustrated-annoyed-behavior_l_65df575be4b0e4346d54ad05","Love Petting Your Dog? There's Something You Should Know — And We Hope You're Prepared For This","am i doing it wrong?","2024-03-04","Some things go perfectly together: Peanut butter and jelly. He-Man and She-Ra. Netflix and chill. And... dogs and petting, right? Not necessarily. Believe it or not, that’s what we — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, the co-hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — learned when we recently chatted with Dr. Emily Levine, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist and the owner of Animal Behavior Clinic of New Jersey. “Many dogs really don’t find being pet and hugged and kissed particularly nice — they just don’t enjoy it very much,” she told us. “There are some dogs — don’t get me wrong — that love a good butt scratch or when you first come home or they haven’t seen you in a while, because they’re so excited to see you, that may mask how they really feel about it... but when you really watch a dog’s body language when they’re hanging out and doing their own thing, most of them are just tolerating [being petted] at best. There are lots of dogs where, quite frankly, they get so frustrated and annoyed that they start to growl and say ‘Hey, please, back off! I’m really not enjoying this.’” Of course lots of furry friends do seem to enjoy physical affection, but if we’re dealing with a dog who doesn’t seem particularly enthused about it, should we refrain from doing it? “This is where we have a little bit of a culture clash — human culture and dog culture. We have dogs... we love them... and I would say if they’re tolerating it, and as long as they’re not aggressing or it’s [not] making them very anxious — tail tucked, ears back — if they’re tolerating it, it’s a little bit like hugging your kid, especially as they become more a teenager, you know? Sometimes it’s like, you’re just going to hug them and kiss them and they just have to put up with it. So I don’t think it’s a terrible thing to pet and hug and kiss your pet if they tolerate it.” So when shouldn’t we be doing it? “If it clearly makes them anxious or it they’re using aggression as a strategy to say, ‘STOP,’ Dr. Levine said. “If we ignore the early signs — the growl, let’s say — then the dogs sometimes feel they have to escalate their message. Fair enough, because we aren’t getting it.” Dr. Levine noted that hugging in particular can make dogs feel suffocated, so she suggested some alternative physical expressions of affection that might be better appreciated by your pet. ″[You can pet] the cheek and the chin... probably avoiding going along down the back... and you can keep it brief, too,” she said. Prioritizing the quality of your interactions over quantity might be the approach to take. “It’s a relationship we have with our dogs — there’s always give and take — so as long as [petting] is not the only thing you ever do with your dog, let’s make sure they’re getting time to play, or getting time to do things they find enjoyable.” So how do we determine what our dogs want — or don’t want? Dr. Levine advised that our best bet is to look at their body language. “They’re constantly telling us how they feel. We just have to learn how to read it. We’re not born knowing that — no dog owner should feel guilty about not knowing how to read their dog. But there are lots of resources — body language videos and other resources — where you can learn how they are communicating ... It’s the best thing really that a dog owner can do, to really get to know their dog, learn how they speak, because they’re speaking all the time.” We also chatted about the one thing every pet owner should do while walking their dog, whether or not it’s safe for a dog to sleep with us in our bed and much more.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barbara-lee-katie-porter-california-senate-primary_n_65e50f3fe4b013678e15bf92","Progressives Trade Blame Ahead Of Likely Defeat In California Senate Primary","daniel marans","2024-03-04","Barring a significant upset, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey, a former Major League Baseball star, are set to emerge from California’s top two “jungle” primaries on Tuesday as the finalists for the open U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The situation has left progressives nationally and in California frustrated, wondering how they will end up on the outside looking in at a Senate race in one of the nation’s bluest states. And the answer, to many, comes down to a long-standing failure of the left to consolidate around a single candidate in contested primaries. “In race after race after race, the left is penalized for lack of consolidation while more moderate Democrats end up having a lane all to themselves,” said Morris Katz, a progressive Democratic ad maker who is neutral in the California primary. The die is not cast yet: Some polling has Rep. Katie Porter, one of the two progressive candidates, within striking distance of Garvey. Rep. Barbara Lee, the other candidate, trails Porter by a wide margin. Schiff, an antagonist to former President Donald Trump and frequent presence on MSNBC, has taken advantage of the division to his left. He’s spent millions of dollars on advertisements elevating Garvey with attack ads aiming to improve Garvey’s standing among GOP voters. (Porter responded with a much smaller ad blitz of her own bolstering Eric Early, another Republican contender.) In heavily Democratic California, Schiff wanted to face a Republican in the general election over either of his more progressive rivals. Schiff’s placement as one of the top two vote getters in the Golden State’s unusual nonpartisan primary system virtually assures him Feinstein’s old seat. But the ideological implications of Schiff’s impending triumph ― a defeat for the progressive wing of the party ― have gotten less attention than Schiff’s tactics themselves. Although Schiff is a hardened partisan gladiator whose credentials with the Democratic faithful only got stronger when House Republicans censured him, he is not one of California’s many progressive champions. While Porter, a consumer attorney and protégée of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), has developed a national following for her white-board presentations exposing corporate malfeasance, Schiff is a member of the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition for whom economic policy has always been less of a concern than national security. And while Lee, a former Black Panther famous for casting the sole vote against the blanket authorization of war shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks, has campaigned loudly for a cease-fire to end Israel’s war in Gaza, Schiff is a staunch defender of Israel’s policies. Both the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC have endorsed him; DMFI PAC has also spent a modest sum promoting his bid in Jewish news outlets in California. “It would be a shame to not have two progressive senators represent us in the U.S. Senate ― someone that is very clear eyed about corporate greed, someone that also understands the housing crisis,” said state Assembly member Alex Lee, who is backing Porter. “That’s what’s at stake here.” After Schiff’s massive fundraising edge and decision to bolster Garvey, a familiar culprit emerges: Progressives’ failure to consolidate behind a single candidate, even as Schiff had the moderate Democratic lane all to himself. A similar dynamic played out in the crowded Democratic primaries in New York’s 10th Congressional District in August 2022, New York City’s mayoral race in June 2021, and Massachusetts’ 4th Congressional District in September 2020. But if progressives agree that they would be better off parrying Schiff’s Machiavellian maneuvers with one strong candidate, they disagree deeply on which of the two candidates deserves the support of a unified left. “It has been true since the very beginning that Porter is the most viable progressive against both Schiff and Garvey.” To some of Porter’s backers, the three-term Orange County Democrat would have been the obvious beneficiary of consolidation. These progressives argue that Porter simply had a better chance of making it to a runoff with Schiff. Porter has led Lee in polls from the start of the race, though not always by her current nine-point margin. And she has also far outpaced Lee in fundraising, bringing in more than $28 million to Lee’s $5 million (though still far short of the nearly $39 million that Schiff has spent). In California, a 39 million-person state with some of the most expensive media markets in the country, flush campaign coffers are a prerequisite for competing. The fundraising gap was predictable: Porter had built a dedicated online fan base with 1.2 million followers on her official side account on X and 635,000 followers on her campaign account, compared with Lee’s 322,000 followers on her official side account on X and 72,000 followers on her campaign account. Having always run in a safe Democratic seat over decades in Congress, Lee was a relatively weak fundraiser, bringing in $2.2 million in the 2022 election cycle, compared to the $26 million Porter raised in her swing seat. “Porter is one of the best chances we have to get a Warren/Sanders-caliber figure into the Senate for decades to come,” said a national progressive strategist, who requested anonymity to protect professional relationships. “Lee deserves great credit for much of her work, and took that extraordinarily courageous vote in 2001, but it is clear that she isn’t going to make the top two.” “The left is now broad enough that it can win elections, but as it has grown, it hasn’t shrugged off its tendency to self-cannibalize,” the national progressive strategist added. What’s more, Porter’s allies believe that the combination of her brand of pro-consumer populism, and Schiff’s status as a hardened Democratic partisan, could make her appealing to enough independents and even Republicans to defeat Schiff in November. “It has been true since the very beginning that Porter is the most viable progressive against both Schiff and Garvey,” Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Porter. But Assembly member Lee, a Porter ally, declined to call for Rep. Lee to withdraw from the race and endorse Porter. Among other reasons, he is not sure that Lee’s supporters are natural pickups for Porter. The idea of Porter and Lee splitting the progressive vote is “a very convenient and reductive narrative that I don’t see bearing out in the data,” Assembly member Lee said. Indeed, polling data do not definitively demonstrate that Rep. Lee’s voters would break for Porter enough to propel Porter into the top two. A late January poll conducted by the University of Southern California found that Schiff was the second choice candidate of 51% of Lee’s voters, compared with 23% for Porter. Meanwhile, 66% of Porter’s voters cited Schiff as their second choice, compared with 12% who would vote for Lee. In addition, many Black voters are supporting Lee, a Black woman, out of affinity for her as a person, rather than because of their progressive ideology. Lee was getting the support of 28% of Black voters, compared to 19% for Schiff and 12% for Porter, according to a Morning Consult/Politico poll in December. At the same time, Porter and Lee do have stronger appeal than Schiff among progressives, according to a Berkeley/LA Times poll out on Friday. Two-thirds of Lee supporters and 58% of Porter supporters said it was “very important” to vote for a candidate who is “progressive in politics,” compared to 44% of Schiff voters who felt the same, the survey found. And California’s progressive attorney general, Rob Bonta, issued a dual endorsement of Lee and Porter. “Do I think Katie Porter has a better chance to make the runoff if Barbara Lee drops out? Yes,” Katz said. “Do I think Barbara Lee, who’s been a loyal advocate for the left for decades, should be pressured to drop out? No.” “She is the proven progressive candidate – the first one to call for a cease-fire, the first one to call for Donald Trump’s impeachment, and the only woman of color in the race.” Katz’s response exemplifies a challenge for Porter proponents: Lee’s status as a progressive icon makes many Democrats reluctant to cast doubts on her viability. To make matters more complicated, Lee’s supporters believe that she has had a harder time fundraising because of her identity as a Black woman and her representation of a lower-earning constituency in the East Bay Area. “It’s hard as an African-American woman representing Oakland to fundraise,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley Democrat backing Lee. “This is why we have so few African-American senators and so few African-American women in statewide office.” “There was hope that more progressives would rally around her,” he added. Asked to respond to the idea that she might drop out and endorse Porter, Lee’s campaign pointed to the support she has received from every constitutional statewide official in California to weigh in the race, the mayors of Los Angeles and San Francisco, Democratic clubs and grassroots activists across California, and a diverse array of outside groups that includes the Congressional Black Caucus and the progressive organization, Our Revolution. “She is the proven progressive candidate ― the first one to call for a cease-fire, the first one to call for Donald Trump’s impeachment, and the only woman of color in the race,” Isabel Naturman, a spokesperson for the Lee campaign, said in a statement. “Her lived experience is shared by multi-ethnic, cross-cultural coalition of Californians, including young voters, the LGBTQ+ community, and Latino and Black communities, who back her unparalleled record of advocating for and delivering on behalf of their needs.” Karen Bernal, a Lee supporter and former chair of the California Democratic Party’s progressive caucus, argued that, if anything, Porter should have dropped out of the race and endorsed Lee. Porter’s decision to vacate California’s 47th Congressional District, which Porter carried by three percentage points in 2022, also puts a key House swing seat at risk, Bernal maintained. “We’re going to lose that seat on top of it all,” she predicted. Porter’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the demand that she drop out and endorse Lee. Progressive outrage over Israel’s war in Gaza has fueled the passion of Lee supporters like Bernal. She supported Lee from the moment she entered the race, but now more than anything, she is inspired by Lee’s support for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza. “Currently, it is the primary issue,” she said. Lee came out for a permanent cease-fire in mid-October and has since made it a central focus of her campaign. For his part, Schiff has echoed the Israeli government’s insistence that calls for a cease-fire undermine its right to defend itself against Hamas, following the group’s massacre of nearly 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7. “I don’t see how people can call on Israel to permanently cease-fire while a terrorist organization is controlling Gaza and threatening to attack them in the manner of Oct. 7 over and over and over again,” he told the Jewish News Syndicate in late February. Porter has landed somewhere in between Lee and Schiff on Israel-Palestine policy. She came out in favor of a “lasting bilateral cease-fire” in December that included the Palestinian militant group Hamas’s release of all Israeli hostages. J Street PAC, a liberal pro-Israel group that has had its own difficulty balancing concerns about Israel’s security with the Jewish state’s failure to protect Palestinian civilians, has endorsed all three Democratic Senate candidates. But tellingly, only Porter advertises the group’s endorsement on her campaign website. “Not voting for Porter in the first round means that the general election in the biggest state won’t include anybody who’s remotely concerned about the suffering of Gazans,” said the national progressive strategist. Of course, progressives might have been more apt to unify behind either Porter or Lee, if a deep-pocketed and influential outside group had stepped in for one of the two contenders. “If this ends up being a Schiff-Garvey general election, it will both be true that progressives should have consolidated and women’s groups should have done more to prevent that outcome,” Green said. The absence of EMILY’s List, which provides critical funding and campaign infrastructure for pro-choice Democratic women candidates, from the race is especially notable.

The actor, who plays Riddler in the Matt Reeves-directed movie, weighed in on the concept after recent films such as “Madame Web,” “The Marvels” and “The Flash” had less-than-super outings at the box office. “There are enough comic book movies where you just know what you’re gonna get,” Dano told The Independent. “Reading the script for The Batman, you knew it was a real film. Every sentence… that’s just [writer/director] Matt Reeves.” Dano, whose “Love & Mercy” performance helped inspire Reeves to write Riddler with the actor in mind, added that the fatigue has led to what he called an “interesting moment” where people ask, “OK — what now?” “Hopefully from that, somebody either breathes new life into [comic book movies], or something else blossoms which is not superheroes. I’m sure there will still be some good ones yet to come, but I think it’s kind of a welcome moment,” he said. The actor continued, “It’s a larger thing, too. As soon as the word ‘content’ came into what we do — meaning-making movies or TV — it meant quantity over quality, which I think was a big misstep. And I certainly don’t need that as a viewer or as an artist.” Reeves — in an interview with The Guardian last year — revealed that Dano “loves doing a lot of takes,” including in the final scene of “The Batman,” which he said took two days where he had “easily done 70 to 80 takes” between him and co-star Robert Pattinson. “There were all these moments as the Riddler where he’d be tickled by something and then fly into a rage, and you never knew from take to take where that switch would come,” Reeves explained.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/apple-fine-european-union_n_65e5c3bbe4b0f890593363f9","Apple Fined Nearly $2 Billion By EU For Hindering Music Streaming Competition","kelvin chan","2024-03-04","LONDON (AP) — The European Union leveled its first antitrust penalty against Apple on Monday, fining the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion for unfairly favoring its own music streaming service by forbidding rivals like Spotify from telling users how they could pay for cheaper subscriptions outside of iPhone apps. Apple muzzled streaming services from telling users about payment options available through their websites, which would avoid the 30% fee charged when people pay through apps downloaded with the iOS App Store, said the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer. “This is illegal. And it has impacted millions of European consumers who were not able to make a free choice as to where, how and at what price to buy music streaming subscriptions,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said at a news conference in Brussels. Apple — which contests the decision — behaved this way for a decade, resulting in “millions of people who have paid two, three euros more per month for their music streaming service than they would otherwise have had to pay,” she said. It’s the culmination of a bitter, yearslong feud between Apple and Spotify over music streaming supremacy. A complaint from the Swedish streaming service five years ago triggered the investigation that led to the 1.8 billion-euro ($1.95 billion) fine. The decision comes the same week new rules take effect to prevent tech giants from cornering digital markets. The EU has led global efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies, including three fines for Google totaling more than 8 billion euros, charging Meta with distorting the online classified ad market and forcing Amazon to change its business practices. Apple’s fine is so high because it includes an extra lump sum to deter it from offending again or other tech companies from carrying out similar offenses, the commission said. It’s not the only penalty that the tech giant could face: Apple is still trying to resolve a separate EU antitrust investigation into its mobile payments service by promising to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment system to rivals. Apple hit back at the commission and Spotify, saying it would appeal Monday’s fine. “The decision was reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,” the company said in a statement. It said Spotify stood to benefit from the EU’s move, asserting that the Swedish streaming giant met over 65 times with the commission during the investigation, holds a 56% share of Europe’s music streaming market and doesn’t pay Apple for using its App Store. “Ironically, in the name of competition, today’s decision just cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is the digital music market’s runaway leader,” Apple said. Spotify said it welcomed the EU fine, without addressing Apple’s accusations. “This decision sends a powerful message — no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers,” Spotify said in a blog post. The commission’s investigation initially centered on two concerns. One was the iPhone maker’s practice of forcing app developers selling digital content to use its in-house payment system, which charges a 30% commission on all subscriptions. Those fees have turned into a significant part of Apple’s service’s division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company’s last fiscal year ending in September. Various legal and regulatory developments threatening to undercut the Apple’s commissions from the App Store have been weighing on the company’s stock, which has fallen by about 10% so far this year amid a broader market rally in the tech sector. Apple’s shares dropped 3% in Monday afternoon in the U.S. But the EU later pivoted its focus to concentrate on how Apple prevents app makers from telling their users about cheaper ways to pay for subscriptions that don’t involve going through an app. The investigation found that Apple banned streaming services from telling users about how much subscription offers cost outside of their apps, putting links in their apps to pay for alternative subscriptions or even emailing users to tell them about different pricing options. “As a result, millions of European music streaming users were left in the dark about all available options,” Vestager said, adding that the commission’s investigation found that just over 20% of consumers who would have signed up to Spotify’s premium service didn’t do so because of the restrictions. The fine comes just before new EU rules are set to kick in that are aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital markets. The Digital Markets Act, due to take effect Thursday, imposes a set of do’s and don’ts on “gatekeeper” companies including Apple, Meta, Google parent Alphabet, and TikTok parent ByteDance — under threat of hefty fines.

In a new video shared on social media Sunday, Stiefler challenged a “Trump 2024 Or Before”-banner carrying North Carolina woman over her false claim that Trump is still the president. “I believe he is,” she told Stiefler. When Stiefler noted that President Joe Biden is in the White House, the woman attacked former President Barack Obama as “calling the shots on all this mess” in the world. The pair went back and forth. Stiefler sought clarifications, and the woman insisted Obama was actually pulling the strings. Biden is “a bumbling fool right now,” she added. Then came Stiefler’s damning question: “But why would it matter if Obama was telling Biden what to do if Biden is not president?” The woman paused, then asked him to “say that again.” Stiefler repeated the question. The woman couldn’t answer, and the clip ended. Yesterday in North Carolina we heard that Trump is still president but that Obama is in charge. pic.twitter.com/jnmJCOBXdm The video has garnered more than 700,000 views alone on X, formerly Twitter.

Eric Swalwell Spots Sign GOP’s Biden Impeachment Inquiry Is Truly A Fail","josephine harvey","2024-03-04","Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) spotted a sign that Republicans’ impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden might be dead in the water. “That’s all she wrote, folks. Even crazy Tomi Lahren thinks this thing is over,” he tweeted, sharing a clip of the right-wing commentator on Fox News. “As somebody who does believe there’s plenty of evidence here, I think that this has failed optically for Republicans,” Lahren, a contributor to the network, told “MediaBuzz” host Howard Kurtz on Sunday of the impeachment probe. “They’ve done good work ... but optically, it does make it seem as though they’re beating up on someone with addiction issues,” she added, referring to the intense focus on the president’s son, Hunter Biden. She encouraged Republicans to focus on the election instead. “This impeachment inquiry, unfortunately, is falling flat with a lot of viewers and voters,” she said. Swalwell wasn’t the only one to spot the pivot. Ian Sams, a White House spokesperson, also shared the clip, writing: “When you’ve lost Tomi Lahren…” That’s all she wrote folks. Even crazy Tomi Lahren thinks this thing is over. https://t.co/uNRGSKZTqi Despite what Lahren says she believes and the claims of Republicans leading the probe, GOP lawmakers have failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden after more than a year of investigating him and his family. The investigation has unraveled in recent weeks, leaving its fate up in the air after one of Republicans’ key sources in the probe was charged with lying to the FBI about the Bidens. Lahren and many other Fox News pundits have been advocates for the inquiry, leaning heavily into unsubstantiated Republican allegations in their coverage for months.

Lisa Murkowski Says She ‘Could Not Vote’ For GOP Front-Runner Donald Trump","marita vlachou","2024-03-04","Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Saturday said she’s not prepared to vote for former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, as she urged voters not to give up on his rival Nikki Haley’s candidacy. In a phone interview with NBC News, Murkowski, who endorsed the former South Carolina governor on Friday, said she refuses to accept that the two main options available for Americans to choose from this November will be Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden. “I could not” cast a vote for Trump, Murkowski, a frequent critic of the former president, told NBC’s Ali Vitali. “I can’t vote for Biden,” she added. Murkowski also called on voters who share her desire to avoid another Trump-Biden rematch to give Haley a chance. “It’s not just a situation where Nikki is the lesser of the evils,” Murkowski said. “She is a qualified, competent, capable leader at a time when the country needs them.” Haley on Sunday scored her first win in the GOP contest, defeating Trump in the Washington, D.C. primary, also becoming the first woman in U.S. history to win a GOP primary. However, Trump over the weekend won the caucuses in Missouri and Idaho and received all 39 delegates from a party convention in Michigan, further solidifying his position as the front-runner in the race. Alaska, Murkowski’s home state, is holding its primary on Super Tuesday along with 14 other states for Republicans. Haley has previously pledged to stay in the race through at least Super Tuesday. Asked if she was prepared to stay in the contest through the Republican National Convention in July, Haley told NBC’s “Meet The Press” Sunday: “If the people want to see me go forward, they’ll show it. They’ll show it in their votes, they’ll show it in their donations.” Murkowski said she wouldn’t know how to proceed if Haley chose to drop out. Murkowski was the first senator to endorse Haley, closely followed by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) Friday. The next four years will change America forever.

(Watch the video below.) In the umpteenth regurgitation of lies that he was denied victory through fraud, the criminally indicted former president told supporters in North Carolina Saturday that a whopping share of the electorate agrees with him. “What happened at that last election is a disgrace, and we’re not going to let it happen again,” the GOP front-runner said ahead of Super Tuesday’s slate of primaries that includes North Carolina. “Did you ever notice they go after the people that want to find out where the cheating was — and, by the way, 82% of the country understands that it was a rigged election, OK? You can’t have a country with that.” “A poll came out, 82% ― but they go after the people — they don’t go after the people that rigged the election — they go after the people that looking, they’re looking for the people that rigged the election,” he continued. “And that’s the people they go after. They got away with something; they’re never going to get away with it again.” The only polls that appear to even remotely correspond to the numbers Trump blathered on about are referring to conservatives only. Not the country. A May 2023 Rasmussen poll found that 84% of those who voted for Trump believed it’s “likely the outcome was affected by cheating.” And according to a 2021 Public Religion Research Institute poll cited by the conservative Washington Examiner, 82% of “Republicans who most trust Fox News” either “completely agree” or “mostly agree” that Trump was robbed of victory.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colorectal-cancer-prevention_l_65e1e971e4b013678e14fae7","I'm A Colorectal Cancer Doctor. Here Are 5 Things I'd Never Do.","julia ries","2024-03-04","Colorectal cancer is the third-most common type of cancer around the world. In the earlier stages, it can be tough to catch. The symptoms, like diarrhea, abdominal pain and anemia, can easily be overlooked or mistaken for another, more benign issue. There’s also been a spike in colorectal cancer diagnoses among younger people. The reason for this, though unclear, is likely multifactorial, with genes, environmental exposures and lifestyle all contributing. What we do know is that when colon cancer is caught early, it can be effectively treated. Fortunately, there’s a lot you can do to keep your bowel health in check. We asked Dr. Ursina Teitelbaum, a medical oncologist and section chief for gastrointestinal cancers at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center, about the most common mistakes worth avoiding for the sake of your bowels. Here’s what Teitelbaum said she personally avoids, and what you should, too: Family history is one of the strongest risk factors for colorectal cancer. Up to 1 in 3 people who get diagnosed with colorectal cancer have family members who also had it. There are a few reasons why cancer runs in families: genetics, shared environmental factors, and some combination of the two, according to the American Cancer Society. Because the health of your relatives directly influences your individual risk of colon cancer, it’s crucial to know your family history. Teitelbaum recommended asking your parents, siblings or other relatives if any family members, including grandparents, cousins, or aunts and uncles, were ever diagnosed with colorectal cancer. If you find out a first-degree relative had colon cancer, for example, you’ll be advised to start screening earlier. “Your colon health depends on your genes,” Teitelbaum said. Cases of colorectal cancer have been rapidly increasing among young adults. Though the disease, which affects fewer than 1% of adults, is still rare, the spike in incidence has made early screening and diagnosis all the more important. Because of this alarming trend, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued new colon cancer screening guidance in 2021 to try to catch more cases. Now, all adults are advised to starting screening by a colonoscopy or stool-based test starting at age 45. Regular colonoscopies are especially important for people with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, since these conditions can increase your risk of colorectal cancer. But even otherwise healthy people who have no family history can get colorectal cancer. “No matter how healthy your lifestyle is, when you hit a certain age, you need to get screened,” Teitelbaum said. Getting screened is the best way to catch colon cancer early and treat it. Doctors across the country have noticed that many younger adults don’t think their abnormal symptoms could be cancer, Teitelbaum said. And because they’re so young, health care providers may not immediately suspect issues either. This can lead to delayed diagnoses and poorer outcomes, research shows. The takeaway? You have to pay attention to your body, Teitelbaum stressed. Look out for any changes in bowel habits ― if you have always pooped on schedule but now frequently feel constipated, or notice blood in your stool and have abdominal pain, it’s worth talking to a doctor. Diarrhea, fatigue or unexplained anemia also warrants a medical checkup. It’s important to advocate for yourself. If you feel like your doctor isn’t taking your symptoms serious, go get a second opinion. “If you’re really worried, you need to persist,” Teitelbaum said. Though the causes of colon cancer are poorly understood, over half of colorectal cancers are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors. Smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol and having a sedentary lifestyle are thought to go hand in hand with a heightened risk of colon cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Your diet also plays a big role. Red meats and overly processed foods, such as soda, candy and cookies, have been linked to a higher risk of colon cancer, whereas vegetables, fruits and whole grains have been associated with a lower risk. “There’s no perfect predictor for colon cancer, but globally, a healthy lifestyle may help” in avoiding it, Teitelbaum said. Finally, Teitelbaum recommended getting comfortable with talking about poop. The more we open up about the topic, the better we can break down the stigma around discussing it.

Wolfe often felt the lines between her role and her mother’s role were blurred. “By the time my youngest brother was born when I was almost 11, I was overwhelmed with feelings of responsibility for his welfare. I used to sit by his crib and watch him sleep just to make sure he was safe,” Wolfe, the oldest of four, told HuffPost. “It wasn’t that I thought my mother wasn’t competent ― but more that I felt we were both responsible for the family by that point in my life,” she explained. “As if I was literally ‘other mom,’ rather than big sister.” In other words, Wolfe is deeply familiar with “eldest daughter syndrome.” The internet is rife with thinkpieces about the plight of oldest daughters and tweets about how we ― I might as well reveal my bias here ― need to unionize: “If you are the oldest sibling and also a girl you may be entitled to financial compensation,” one woman joked on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Though “eldest daughter syndrome” is a pop psychology term ― you won’t find it listed as an official diagnosis in the DSM-V ― a new study suggests that there may be more science to the pseudo-syndrome than previously thought. A University of California, Los Angeles-led research team found that, in certain instances, first-born daughters tend to mature earlier, enabling them to help their mother rear younger siblings. Specifically, the researchers found a correlation between early signs of adrenal puberty in first-born daughters and their mothers having experienced high levels of prenatal stress. Why does age of adrenal puberty matter? Changes in skin (acne, for instance) and body hair happen during this phase, but so do changes in brain development. Adrenal puberty processes are believed to foster social and cognitive changes; basically, superficial physical changes correlate with emotional maturity. When times are tough and mothers are stressed in pregnancy, it’s in the mother’s adaptive best interest for her daughter to socially mature at a quicker pace, said Jennifer Hahn-Holbrook, one of the co-authors of the study and an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Merced. “It gives mom a ‘helper-at-the-nest’ sooner, aiding the women in keeping the latter offspring alive in difficult environments,” she said. Notably, adrenal puberty does not include breast development or the onset of menstruation for girls (or testicular enlargement, in the case of boys). The study posits that girls become mentally mature enough to care for their younger siblings while not being physically capable of having their own children, which would naturally draw them away from their older daughter responsibilities. Older brothers are seemingly off the hook when it comes to this kind of parentification: The researchers did not find the same result in boys or daughters who were not first-born. “One reason that we didn’t find this effect in first-born children who are sons could be that male children help less often with direct childcare than female children do, so mothers have less of an adaptive incentive to speed their social pubertal development,” Hahn-Holbrook explained. Plus, she said, previous research suggests that female puberty timing is more malleable in response to early life experiences than males. The results of this study, published in the February issue of Psychoneuroendocrinology (say that five times fast ― or just once), were a long time coming: Researchers tracked the families for 15 years, from the pregnancy stage to the babies’ teen years. Researchers recruited women from two obstetric clinics in Southern California during routine first trimester prenatal care visits. On average, the women were 30 years of age and pregnant with one child, not twins. It was their first pregnancy for roughly half of the participants. The women were nonsmoking and not using steroid medications, tobacco, alcohol or other recreational drugs during pregnancy. They were all over 18 years of age. At five different stages of pregnancy, the women’s stress, depression and anxiety levels were measured, and then measured cumulatively. The depression assessment asked the women to rate the truth of statements such as “I felt lonely,” while the anxiety question asked how often they felt particular symptoms, such as “jittery.” Of the children born to these mothers, 48% were female and 52% were male. As the children aged, characteristics of adrenal and gonadal puberty were separately measured ― things like body hair, skin changes, growth in height or growth spurts, breast development and the onset of menstruation in females and voice changes and facial hair growth in males. The study also measured childhood adversity to account for other factors known to correlate to early maturation or signs of puberty in children, like the death of a parent or divorce before age 5 and the absence of a father and economic uncertainties at ages 7–9. Taking all that into account, it was the eldest girls who matured the fastest when their moms experienced high levels of prenatal stress. Other studies suggest that there is some later-in-life payoff for highly responsible eldest girls: A 2014 study found that eldest daughters are the most likely to succeed out of any sibling type, while a 2012 study found that those who are eldest-born are more likely to hold leadership roles. The findings ring true for Wolfe, the aforementioned author who said she felt like a second mom to her siblings growing up. “I’m not at all surprised by what the study found,” Wolfe said. “My story is slightly different — I went through true puberty, not just adrenal puberty, at 12, though I suspect I experienced an early cognitive maturation.” The study is interesting for another reason as well: The findings add to social scientists’ growing understanding of fetal programming, a fascinating area of study that explores how stress and other emotional and environmental factors women experience during pregnancy affect their children long after birth. “This is a first-of-its-kind finding and is fascinating to look at through an evolutionary lens,” Molly Fox, a UCLA anthropologist and one of the co-authors of the study, said in a press release. In an interview with HuffPost, Fox delved deeper into how fetal programming works. “One fascinating theory is that when you’re still a fetus in your mothers’ womb, you get cues about what the world is going to be like, and your body can flexibly adjust the shape of your life-cycle to be optimally suited to those conditions you expect to encounter,” she said. Fox and her co-authors are excited their work is out there for the public to read, especially after following the families along for so long. The fact that the findings were published just as a cultural conversation about eldest daughters broke out was just a cherry on top, especially for Fox, a co-oldest daughter. (She’s a twin.)

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-nipples-get-hard-cold_l_65e0bda5e4b005b858336e6b","So THAT'S Why Your Nipples Get Hard When It's Cold","kelsey borresen","2024-03-04","Exposure to cold temperatures can affect the body in a number of ways, like making your teeth chatter or cheeks redden. But have you ever wondered why nippy weather perks up your nipples? It’s not just a winter phenomenon — it can also happen in warmer times of year, like when the air conditioning is on full blast. So what exactly is occurring in the body when nipples become erect? The physiological process that leads to hardened nipples when cold is also what causes goose bumps (known medically as piloerections), dermatologist Dr. Joshua Zeichner told HuffPost. “This response is beyond our control and is a result of our bodies’ automated reactions to the environment,” said Zeichner, an associate professor of dermatology at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Essentially, a drop in temperature triggers your sympathetic nervous system, which is behind the fight-or-flight response and other involuntary bodily functions. This process activates specialized nerve cells controlling the erectile muscles that cause hard nipples and goose bumps, according to a 2016 study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. “When the body feels cold, the sympathetic nervous system contracts tiny arrector pili muscles, which are attached to hair follicles,” explained dermatologist Dr. Aanand Geria of Geria Dermatology in New Jersey. This creates goose bumps and makes the hair on your body stand upright. “In the case of nipples, it contracts the specialized smooth muscles,” Geria added. “This contraction pulls on the skin, erecting the nipple.” As for why this occurs, it’s one way that the body tries to retain heat in cold weather. The muscles beneath the skin contract “to trap the warm air near the skin and lose less heat from radiation coming off your skin,” plastic surgeon Dr. Michelle Lee told the outlet Shape. For mammals, including humans, “regulating core body temperature within a small range is crucial for survival,” Geria explained. The reflex that causes goose bumps (and nipple erections) in the cold is not so useful for humans today, but would have been quite important for our ancestors. Back when we were a much hairier species, having all of your body hair stand up helped with insulation — not to mention that it could make you look larger to ward off predators.

Nipples can become erect for other reasons unrelated to the cold, such as sexual arousal, tactile stimulation (like when they rub against your shirt), hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy or breastfeeding, and even “emotional responses like fear or excitement,” Geria said. Most of the time, hard nipples are just a normal bodily response to a number of different stimuli, he noted — but if you’re seeing “persistent or extreme erection unrelated to temperature or excitement,” then it could be indicative of a health problem. Also, if you’re experiencing pain with nipple erections or any type of discharge, it’s worth talking to your health care provider to rule out any underlying issues.

Sign up here for weekly book news, author interviews and more. It’s an impactful thing to see yourself — and the struggles you deeply feel — reflected on television screens and in the pages of books. Michael Arceneaux, a Black gay man who grew up in the South in what he describes as a difficult childhood, said he couldn’t see himself the way so many others could, especially in media dominated by the straight, white and financially comfortable. In Arceneaux’s collection of essays and other writings — a loosely connected series that will be complete with a third installment, “I Finally Bought Some Jordans,” in March — he describes wanting a kind of representation that goes beyond just Black or just queer, but rather a full-fledged and complex existence that everyone can and should find themselves in. In his first book, “I Can’t Date Jesus,” Arceneaux discusses what it was like to reconcile what he was taught to believe about homosexuality in an overtly religious household, and who he knew himself to be. Using candid, moving and hilarious prose, he explores how to still have a close relationship with his mother while also not completely agreeing on some of those fundamental beliefs. But it wasn’t easy to get to this point, according to the author. From very early on Arceneaux said there was some doubt about how commercially viable books written by someone Black and gay would be. As a result, he said he still experiences financial instability, amid inequities within the publishing industry and an on-going inability to shake some of the generational struggles that have and continue to impact Black men, like financial instability which he candidly explores in his second book, “I Don’t Want to Die Poor.” Despite all of this, Arceneaux’s persistence and dedication to the craft of engaging storytelling has managed to heal and bring together some unlikely audiences. I had the opportunity to discuss all of this with Arceneaux ahead of this upcoming book release, “I Finally Bought Some Jordans,” which will be released on March 12. Can you tell us a little bit about what readers can expect from “I Finally Bought Some Jordans” and how it relates to your other books? It’s more of a broader collection of essays than my other two books. There are similar themes of family and identity, but it’s focusing on the chaos of the last couple of years. I write a lot about the pandemic and grief and being impacted by death. I talk about suicidal ideation [and] losing friends to suicide. I try to make sense of how life’s not exactly turning out how I thought it would, even with all of the hard work and certain accomplishments, [while] still trying to maintain a sense of hope. I think a lot of other people are kind of secretly carrying a lot of pain and frustration or grief and still trying to process that pandemic. I hope I can give people some kind of comfort like no, you’re not crazy or alone, these are valid feelings. I think one of the things that you do so well is you write about these universal human experiences in a very relatable way that makes us all feel seen. Is this something that you intended for your writing to achieve? My intent with my work in writing or in anything is to make people laugh, make people think, and to also create nuanced narratives about people like me. And when I say people like me, that’s working class, Southern Black, that’s anyone coming from religious backgrounds. And fundamentally, I just didn’t want people to feel as alone, as I often have. In “I Don’t Want To Die Poor,” specifically, I write about private student loans and how they impacted every facet of my life. Private loans are disproportionately impacting a lot of Black college graduates and students, so I wanted to talk about what it’s like to have that financial insecurity. Another goal that I had was … particularly in publishing, to make it easier for people to see the commercial viability in stories that they don’t necessarily usually value monetarily and not on equal footing as often their white counterparts. Is that something then that you think would improve circumstances for minorities in the media and literary world? To make content like yours more mainstream and conventional? I do, honestly. I think a lot of us would be a lot better off if we really truly engaged with works that are created by people who are not like them because you can learn a lot from different types of people. When I’ve spoken on platforms like NPR and PBS, yes, I got so many messages from young queer black men or boys like happy to see someone like me speaking the way I do to them, and being comfortable in my own skin. But it’s also been very nice to get emails from nice white women in Maine or Vermont, saying they related to my story or, they didn’t get my references, but they Google[d] them, which is what I do when I read something from a white author or something I don’t know. I think smart is smart, funny is funny and a good story is a good story, so to say that my books only appeal to just Black people or queer people is really limiting. This country is truly segregated by design, in terms of class and race, so we don’t really get to interact as much as they make it seem on certain TV shows and films. So for me to be in these different types of spaces that you wouldn’t expect me to be in, and to speak the way that I do, and be very comfortable in my own skin [to] tell my story, is important because I write about things that are problems that we all share. *** You can shop Arceneaux’s works for yourself and pre-order a copy of “I Finally Bought Some Jordans” or keep scrolling to see some of his favorite Black-authored books that have served as personal inspiration for the author and can be vital reading for you.

But what if the real solution can be found in the hardware store? Have you ever noticed a change in the way your skin or hair looks and feels when you have showered someplace other than your home? Surprise! It could very likely be the water conditions that made a difference. These days, beautifying water filter ads come at us from every direction on social media, claiming to clear up your skin and add shine to your hair under a fancy new (and sometimes expensive) showerhead. So we wanted to know if experts thinks they really make a difference. Scientific research and water testing in the United States provides evidence that the water we shower with may contain contaminants that adversely affect the health of your skin, hair and potentially your overall health, particularly related to the amount of chlorine in the water along with other bacteria, chemicals and minerals. Angela Stiegler, a water infrastructure scientist, added that “although the water that arrives at your home from your local utility is safe to drink, in some cases, an at-home filtration system can be beneficial for your skin and hair because some water sources have more ‘hardness’ than others. Hard water contains more calcium and magnesium minerals than ‘soft’ water.” According to Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group (EWG) who researches contaminants in water, “Hard water, or water that contains higher levels of calcium or magnesium, can cause skin dryness or cause skin to be more sensitive.” In a previously reported HuffPost story, Dr. Brandon Kirsch, a board-certified dermatologist at Kirsch Dermatology in Naples, Florida, confirmed that hard water “can have cosmetic and dermatological effects, such as drying out hair and skin or exacerbating conditions like eczema. ... Chlorine and hard water minerals can also strip away natural oils from your hair, leaving it looking dull, and chlorine in particular can cause colored hair to fade faster.” Hard water can make shampoos, conditioners and cleansers “less effective and react with those products to form mineral build-up, which might irritate some people’s skin,” Stiegler added. “You’ll notice that if you have hard water at home, you can’t get as much lather or sudsiness with shampoos and cleansers, and your hair or skin just doesn’t feel as clean.” If you’re wondering about the state of the water coming out of your own shower or sink faucets, you can check the water contaminants in your area at www.ewg.org. You can also check the hardness of your water with home testing kits, which allow you to test water from multiple sources in your home. Solutions range from whole house systems to more affordable and “portable” systems for those who may not be homeowners. Let’s get into the different kinds of filters, what they remove and their efficacies. Studies have shown that charcoal is effective in removing chlorine, heavy metals and organic pollutants from water, and an activated charcoal system is a good option if you are a renter and not investing in something long-term. Charcoal water filters can be found in showerheads and showerhead filters, which attach between the wall spout and your current showerhead. A true filter, like the AquaYouth 2.0 filter ($60), fits 99.9% of showerheads, including hand-held units. It’s important to note that regular maintenance and filter replacement is required with a charcoal system ― filters need to be replaced about every six months. If you opt for a showerhead with the filter integrated, Canopy ($150) has a high rating of 4.8 stars. Canopy recommends filter replacements (which cost $65 for a two-pack) every 90 days. Your other option is a whole-house filtration system, like a reverse osmosis system, which can run you thousands of dollars and can use up to four times the amount of water than you’d use without a system, due to pushing so much water through the system in the filtration process. This can also reduce the water pressure in your faucets. The bottom line is that if you have hard water and can’t get your hair and skin products to work well, experts agree it’s worth giving water filtration a try. And luckily, that can be done by something as simple as trying a new showerhead. Take a look at the options below to find one for your budget.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-make-brown-rice-better_l_65d8e0e9e4b0189a6a7dc69e","This 1 Simple Step Makes Brown Rice Taste Infinitely Better","robin asbell","2024-03-04","If you’re one of the many people who doesn’t like brown rice, you might be missing out on enjoying a nutritious food because you’ve skipped a step in the kitchen. Making tender, nutty-tasting brown rice takes one little trick that costs zero pennies. The step that is so important, and often overlooked, is simple: just take the pan off the heat and let the cooked rice sit, covered, for about 10 minutes to finish steaming. This also applies to other whole grains, like farro, wheat berries and sorghum. I wanted to find out the science behind what’s going on in that pot, so I asked Cameron Jacobs of the USA Rice Federation. “Brown rice has the nutritious and hearty bran layer surrounding the endosperm intact. The act of allowing it to sit covered allows the brown rice kernels to absorb additional moisture from all the steam and leaves the consumer with an optimal mouthfeel for brown rice and a much less chewy grain than if you were to eat directly after all the water was absorbed.” I also asked Harold McGee, author of the seminal book ”On Food & Cooking: The Science & Lore of the Kitchen,” and a food chemistry expert. “It takes time for the absorbed water to become distributed evenly throughout the grains and hydrate the starch at the center; and serving the hot rice immediately will cause it to evaporate away some near-surface moisture as visible steam, leaving the bran a little drier and firmer. I actually don’t mind that contrast in texture, but the 5-10 minute rest does give you a more evenly cooked pot.” First, you do need to rinse the rice. All grains rub against each other during shipping, scraping fine particles loose. To remove it, simply place your rice in a bowl, cover with cool water by an inch or two, and swish the rice around with your hands. Pour off the water and drain in a wire mesh strainer. Because brown rice is coated with a bran layer, where all that sturdy fiber resides, brown rice and whole grains can benefit from soaking overnight, or even for an hour or so. If you’re in a hurry and didn’t plan ahead, you can skip it. If you’ve heard that whole grains should be soaked to remove phytates, which might prevent absorption of some nutrients, don’t worry. According to registered dietician Kelly LeBlanc, “From a nutritional standpoint, the concern around phytates and mineral absorption seems to be overblown. Regularly eating a diet high in phytates may limit this ‘anti-nutrient’ eﬀect, as shown in a 2015 study in the Journal of Nutrition. Since phytates are found naturally in plants, it’s not surprising to learn that they may also have some antioxidant and anti-cancer properties. In my own personal kitchen, I’ll try to give long-cooking grains like sorghum, barley, and wheat berries a soak to help reduce their cooking time. But if I happen to forget, it’s not something I lose sleep over – my meals are still yummy.” The absorption method looks like this: Simply boil 2 cups water, add 1 cup rice, return to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, set a timer for 35 minutes and cook, covered, until the water is absorbed. Then let it stand for 10 minutes. If you prefer “pasta-style” cooking, you bring a pot of water to a boil, add the grain and boil until tender, then drain. Then, be sure to return the hot grain to the pot, cover and let stand for 10 minutes. If you have a standard rice cooker, it will turn itself off when the water has absorbed, and you should give it 10 minutes to finish steaming then. Multifunction rice cookers, like Zojirushi, have built-in soaking and steaming to the program for brown rice. In an Instant Pot or pressure cooker, use a 1:1 ratio of brown rice to water, and let the pot release naturally, for a final steam. If you’re still on the fence about cooking brown rice instead of white, just know that its rep as a “health food” is well-deserved. According to Emily Ho, a distinguished professor of nutrition at the College of Health at Oregon State University, “Because it still has the hull, bran layer and germ intact compared to processed white rice, it is packed full of nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium, potassium and iron. It also is a great source of dietary fiber that can help your gut health. Consumption of brown rice is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared to intake of white rice, and lowering of blood glucose.” What a difference a few minutes can make!

The MSNBC host, a former Biden White House press secretary, took a “bit of a deep dive” into McConnell’s “unwavering devotion to winning and winning at any cost” Sunday. She started with his support of campaign finance reform in the 1970s. “[He was] denouncing the cancer of the corrupting influence of money and politics, only to do a complete 180 in the U.S. Senate, where he became instrumental in opening up our politics to the flood of special interest dark money,” said Psaki. She also noted he once was a defender of the Voting Rights Act, which he had described as a “landmark piece of legislation” in 2006. “And yet, McConnell has blocked all attempts to rebuild the law after conservatives on the Supreme Court, of course, gutted portions in 2013,” Psaki said. “This all adds up” for the Kentucky Republican, Psaki said, arguing that McConnell realized that opposing campaign finance reform “would mean raising far more unrestricted money” that could help him politically and that “suppressing the vote might help Republicans win elections.” ""A cynic focused on power… only to be swallowed by the monster that he enabled to obtain it.""@jrpsaki on the real legacy of Mitch McConnell pic.twitter.com/IqfbX8xIZE She later referred to him having “stonewalled” President Barack Obama’s appointment for Supreme Court justice in 2016 and seeing former President Donald Trump as the “means to an end” when it comes to filling federal courts with conservatives. Psaki described McConnell as leaving his post in a “diminished” state. She added that there’s been a lack of action on new Ukraine aid “despite his insistence” and the inability to pass a bipartisan border bill. “And yet despite all that McConnell thinks about Trump, which we know, he’s already said that if he is the Republican nominee he will support him,” Psaki said.

Vance (R-Ohio) boasted on X (formerly Twitter) about having a “long memory” as he warned colleagues against attacking Donald Trump. But Vance’s post immediately went viral for all the wrong reasons, seeing as it conveniently ignored his own past trashing of the former president. “If you’re fighting Trump and his endorsed candidates politically today, don’t ask my help in a year with your legislation or your pet projects,” the “Hillbilly Elegy” author warned. A reader-added community note was soon added to the post. I have a long memory. If you’re fighting Trump and his endorsed candidates politically today, don’t ask for my help in a year with your legislation or your pet projects. “Vance has publicly called Trump an ‘idiot,’ ‘reprehensible’ and ‘noxious,’” it recalled. “In Facebook messages, Vance wrote ‘I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn’t be that bad… or that he’s America’s Hitler.’” Indeed, Vance was a fierce critic of Trump ahead of the 2016 election. He called himself a “Never Trump guy” who “will never vote for Trump.” Trump’s policies, meanwhile, ranged from “immoral to absurd,” he added at the time. Vance later went full MAGA with his 2022 run for Senate, though. Trump rewarded him with an endorsement.

The former president “has never evolved beyond the kind of person he was when he was very young, and it’s not at all surprising because he grew up in an authoritarian household,” Mary Trump told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an interview that was broadcast at the weekend. It’s “one of the things that should worry everybody about Donald,” the Republican front-runner’s niece claimed. Mary Trump, who has become a fierce critic of her uncle, described her grandfather Fred Trump as “a quite straight-up sociopath.” As “favorite son,” Donald Trump therefore “knew what he needed to do in order to stay on my grandfather’s good side,” she explained. “Because he also understood what would happen to him if he didn’t,” she added. “So he [Donald Trump] is very comfortable in this milieu and it is extremely important to him that he get the benefits of associating with strong men like [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor] Orbán and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, but also that he be on their good side.” Last week, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull recalled his unease at seeing Trump fawn over Putin on multiple occasions. Turnbull called it “really creepy.” It is “really no laughing matter when, at that point the leader of the free world is being described as a pre-pubescent child with a crush on an older, more powerful person,” Mary Trump said of Turnbull’s comments. Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull: “When you see Trump with Putin, as I have on a few occasions, he’s like the 12-year-old boy that goes to high school and meets the captain of the football team. ‘My hero!’ It’s really creepy.”pic.twitter.com/x89ogncwQz By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Primary Loss To Haley Is Mercilessly Mocked","lee moran","2024-03-04","Former President Donald Trump’s spin on losing Sunday’s GOP presidential primary in Washington, D.C., to Nikki Haley was summed up by many critics with one word, “pathetic.” Following Trump’s first loss to Haley, the Republican 2024 front-runner’s campaign said “the swamp has claimed their queen” and claimed she only won thanks to “the lobbyists and D.C. insiders that want to protect the failed status quo.” Trump himself then ranted on his Truth Social platform that he’d “purposely stayed away from the D.C. Vote because it is the ‘Swamp,’ with very few delegates, and no upside.” “Birdbrain spent all of her time, money and effort there,” he continued, using his derogatory nickname for his former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Over the weekend we won Missouri, Idaho, and Michigan - BIG NUMBERS - Complete destruction of a very weak opponent. The really big numbers will come on Super Tuesday. Also, WAY UP ON CROOKED JOE!” he added. Trump wrote in a second post: “Birdbrain is a loser, record low performance in virtually every State. DeSanctus easily beat her in Iowa for a VERY DISTANT second place, and then she ran up to the podium, before he had a chance to do so, and claimed victory.” He continued, “I enjoy watching the Bird disavow her PLEDGE to the RNC and her statement that she would NEVER run against President Trump (‘A great President’). “Well, she ran, she lied, and she LOST BIG!” Critics responded in not so kind: Cry harder, you pathetic loser. pic.twitter.com/C40Vr7u904 YOU CAN'T HANDLE LOSS, TRUMP!

Steele, co-host of MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” flipped to a clip of the former president claiming that MAGA “represents 96% and maybe 100%” of the Republican Party as he spoke to supporters at a Virginia rally Saturday. “We’re getting rid of the Romneys of the world, we want to get Romneys – and those out,” said the GOP front-runner of the Utah senator who recently remarked that he would “absolutely not” vote for Trump in November. “But they know that we are the only ones who can stop them.” Steele, in response, noted that he’s a decadeslong member of the Republican Party before taking a swipe at Trump. “If anyone is the biggest RINO, it’s you, and we comin’ for you,” Steele said. “So, just so you understand, you drew the line, baby. I’m stepping up to it and a whole lot of Republicans out there –– at least 40% or more –– are stepping to that line, too. So you just need to chill on that.” Co-host Symone Sanders-Townsend added that Steele, a long-time critic of the former president, was putting Trump “on notice” before the ex-RNC chair chimed back in. “Just on notice — you bring it, baby, ’cause you wanna punk? Let’s punk, baby. Let’s go, one-on-one.” Co-host Alicia Menendez went on to note a post on X from Sarah Longwell, founder of the Republican Accountability Project, who pointed to former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake’s criticism of John McCain voters. “I forget, is she the Governor of Arizona right now, or no?” Longwell wrote in response to the Trump clip Sunday. “We’ve already seen this movie play out when you say, ‘We are not a big tent and we don’t want you at our table,’” Menendez said. Steele added that Trump — whom he called “the biggest RINO in the room” — has duped supporters into thinking he’s “somehow the conservative standard bearer.” “You want to try to build a party and grow it? You’re not doing it. You’re shrinking. What elections have you won? What elections have you won? None, except your own. And you’re not winning this one because you didn’t win the last one,” Steele said. The next four years will change America forever.

The two animals on the lam caused an unusual traffic jam Saturday afternoon as they wove through slowing traffic and then stopped it on Interstate 90 in the downtown Cleveland area. Cleveland.com reports that video from the Ohio Department of Transportation showed the animals trotting on the side of the road near the unit’s stables at about 12:15 p.m. Saturday. Another video showed them headed westbound in the eastbound interstate lanes, slowing and then halting traffic. The camera follows the animals, ultimately trailed by a police cruiser with flashing lights, heading further along the highway and then down an onramp before cutting across a grassy section onto a side street and out of view. Cleveland Police Sgt. Wilfredo Diaz told reporters that the horses were members of the department’s mounted division. He said they “inadvertently strayed” during “routine care and exercise.” “Mounted officers promptly recovered both horses, ensuring their safety, and no further incidents ensued,” Diaz said. Video of the horseplay prompted a good deal of online hilarity, with even the transportation department getting into the snarky act. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lee-speigel-ufo-journalist-huffpost-weird-news_n_64dce763e4b0eb9f33d7ec02","Famed UFO Reporter Puts Skeptics On Blast With A Defiant Final Act","david moye","2024-03-04","When Lee Speigel arrived in New York City in the early 1970s, there was a word for people who reported seeing a UFO ― “kooks.” The world this 74-year-old man left behind on Aug. 14, after a battle with esophageal cancer, has vastly changed. Politicians, scientists and law enforcement officials are no longer laughing at those who say they’ve witnessed an unexplained phenomenon. Just weeks before Speigel’s death, military whistleblowers testified before a congressional committee, claiming the government has secretly retrieved and reverse-engineered unidentified flying objects. And though the Pentagon denied those claims, it soon unveiled a website devoted to sightings of unidentified flying objects. As 2023 drew to a close, Congress ordered all files on UFOs ― now classified as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) ― released within 25 years so long as there was no Oval Office objection. These are files that government officials barely acknowledged in years past ― and information Speigel and other UFO investigators spent their lives in search of. NASA still maintains that there’s no proof UFOs are the work of extraterrestrials, but it’s a conversation that can no longer be ignored. To be sure, no single person can take credit for shifting public opinion, but Speigel’s contributions over his 60-year career stand out. He is renowned as the first person to organize and host a conference at the United Nations on UFOs, attended by dignitaries from around the world. “Lee sought out interviews with military officers, commercial airline pilots and the best sources he could find. These people put their credibility on the line when they claimed they saw something in the sky that defied explanation,” said Buck Wolf, director of HuffPost Trends, who also worked with Speigel at ABC News. “Lee might be the only UFO writer and researcher from his generation to make the jump into mainstream journalism. At NBC Radio, ABC News and HuffPost, his colleagues looked at him with skepticism and amusement. But he also earned their respect,” Wolf said. Wolf and Speigel’s widow, Lorraine Simone, raised more than $10,000 from friends, family and admirers for one final tribute — to send Speigel’s cremated ashes into space. His remains will be loaded on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, scheduled for launch on March 4 at Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California. Speigel’s ashes will circle the Earth every 90 minutes at roughly 17,000 to 17,500 miles per hour on a mission slated to last two to three years and will burn up upon reentry, “like a shooting star,” said Dan Peabody, CEO of Beyond Burials, the company administering Speigel’s funeral service. “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry, along with original cast members James Doohan and Nichelle Nichols; noted astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, best known for discovering Pluto; and 1960s counterculture hero Timothy Leary are among those who have also had space funerals. “Anyone who knew Lee knows he wanted to get into space somehow, especially after William Shatner did it,” said Simone. “I’m sure Lee is somewhere enjoying all this immensely.” Shatner, who portrayed the legendary Capt. Kirk on “Star Trek,” was 90 when he became the oldest man to voyage to space on a 2021 Blue Origin launch. In addition to the space funeral, Speigel’s friends and family organized and shipped his massive archive of taped interviews and case files to the National UFO Historical Records Center in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. Cmdr. Allan Palmer, a retired Air Force and Navy combat aviator, now serves as CEO and executive director at the National Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas. He thinks Speigel’s work is worthy of further study. Palmer consulted with Speigel in 2013 when creating the museum’s Area 51 exhibit. Area 51 is the now-famous top-secret site set up by the CIA and Air Force in 1955, which looms large in UFO lore. In the 1950s and 1960s, if a commercial pilot saw an aircraft flying at 70,000 feet or traveling at three times the speed of sound, it certainly would have seemed like otherworldly technology, Palmer said. Yet it wasn’t until 2013 that the government started acknowledging what was going on there. “Lee did so much in telling the story responsibly,” Palmer said. “Yet even with all we know today, there are still many unanswered mysteries.” Speigel’s personal journey is almost as amazing as some of the stories he covered. As a teen in Concord, New Hampshire, in the late 1960s, Elliot “Lee” Speigel was obsessed with the Apollo space program. But it was his other childhood love that brought him to New York City: folk music. By the early 1970s, he was singing and playing guitar on the same Greenwich Village stages that Bob Dylan and Harry Belafonte had been performing on a few years earlier. He went by the stage name Happy Day. Like any aspiring musician in the big city, Speigel scrambled to pay bills, working at times as a waiter, bartender and NBC page. He also put his tenor voice and audio production skills to use, crafting radio station ads and commercial jingles. In his downtime, Speigel devoured everything he could find on UFOs, but, except for sci-fi camp, all he could find were stray news clippings and paperback books. It struck him that there were no solid, feature-length recordings of some of the most credible UFO witnesses. He was soon pitching himself as the guy with the audio production skills to put that project together. By 1975, Speigel was traveling the country, conducting interviews that would become the CBS documentary record album “UFOs: The Credibility Factor,” featuring scientists, military personnel and aviation experts who admitted seeing things that defied explanation. Speigel focused extensively on the notorious July 1947 incident in Roswell, New Mexico, when the military seemed to admit — and then abruptly deny — that it had recovered the debris of an aircraft “not of this Earth.” In one of Speigel’s field assignments, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, a scientific adviser to the Air Force’s UFO study, Project Blue Book, invited him to North Carolina to investigate what the UFO website Rogue Planet described as “a spate of UFO sightings observed by local law enforcement.” During the trip, Speigel and multiple officers saw what he described as “the first well-documented UFO incident in the U.S. involving a triangle or boomerang-shaped UFO and multiple witnesses.” Speigel would joke years later that what they saw in the sky that day resembled “flying Doritos.” Speigel was hawking his UFO audio documentary album on late-night TV commercials in 1978 when he was invited by the island nation of Grenada to organize a meeting at the United Nations, attended by dignitaries from around the world, including U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. “Lee made a major contribution by organizing the U.N. meeting, which he is so well known for,” said Leslie Kean, author of the 2011 New York Times bestseller “UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record” and co-author of a 2017 New York Times investigative piece that revealed a secret Pentagon project to study UFOs. “He was one of the few reporters who had a platform to do regular stories on UFOs and related topics,” Kean said. By the late 1970s, Speigel’s work caught the eye of future MTV CEO Bob Pittman. In one of the most memorable nights of his life, they attended a party with comedian Richard Belzer. Together, they conceived of the late-night NBC Radio show “Edge of Reality,” hosted by Speigel, though at first he was billed only as “The Alien,” for promotional purposes. “There has always been huge interest in UFOs ― but not much info or ongoing dialogue, even more so way back then,” Pittman told HuffPost by email. “This was an attempt to tap into that for our audience.” Speigel dressed as a super-sized space lizard at promotional events to the delight of fans around New York City. If his shiny spacesuit looked a bit familiar, it’s because it was designed by the same NBC wardrobe team that threw together “Saturday Night Live’s” Conehead costumes. “It started as a gimmick, hence the name and suit. But [it] morphed into more serious reporting with Lee as the expert,” Pittman explained. “Did it change my views? Not sure, but it sure got me more interested,” said Pittman, adding that he thought Speigel was “a great human” who was “nice, considerate and thoughtful, as well as fun and funny.” Speigel shared an NBC studio briefly with notorious shock jock Howard Stern, who would occasionally go off on his otherworldly colleague. “He’d have people on from Mars,” Stern recalled in a hilarious 1992 on-air rant. “It was always UFOs. Every week. It’d be a whole show on UFOs. ... I’d say to him, ‘Have you seen a UFO?’” Stern denied that Speigel ever gave him a satisfactory answer. In an eight-year period beginning in 1978, Speigel recorded roughly 1,500 hours of local and national programming, interviewing actors William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, astronomers, astronauts and others who had something to say about the search for intelligent life in the universe. In that time, when Stephen Spielberg was working on projects like “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,” Spielberg had Speigel flown out to his home. “Lee had his share of celebrity fans. Robin Leach would visit when Lee he was in New York, not to discuss lifestyles of the rich and famous, but to go UFO hunting,” Wolf said. “One time, Lee invited a few of us HuffPosters to go see ZZ Top, and it was because the band wanted Lee to stay after the show and talk about space aliens.” When “Edge of Reality” ended, Speigel remained at NBC Radio in New York working on science and human interest stories while also contributing to Omni magazine. He joined ABC Radio Networks in the late 1990s, eventually moving to ABCNews.com as a copy editor. In 2010, when Wolf offered Speigel a chance to write freelance articles on unexplained phenomena for AOL News, he quit ABC, even though that meant giving up his health insurance. He was eventually brought on to The Huffington Post (now HuffPost) as a full-time reporter, winning the 2012 International UFO Congress Researcher of the Year award. In his six years at The Huffington Post, Speigel was able to get astronauts Edgar Mitchell, Alan Bean and Leroy Chiao to go on the record about UFOs, as well as luminaries, like actor Morgan Freeman, who opined that, “We may already be in the midst of a growing zombie apocalypse.” “In the newsroom, Lee stuck out like a sore thumb. He was a showman, and he pitched so many out-there stories,” Wolf said, recalling that Speigel’s desk was festooned with “Star Wars” toys and a giant statue of a spaceling, which he called the Alien Butler. “Other reporters were sometimes skeptical, but Lee wouldn’t have had a second career as a copy editor and proofreader at major news outlets if he wasn’t trusted,” Wolf said. The span of Speigel’s work is hard to describe. One Huffington Post story was headlined, “Hey, Even a Yeti Needs to Pee Sometime.” Another favorite among his colleagues was when Swedish rapper Elliphant asked him to discuss “alien sex” in a Rolling Stone interview. That’s not to say that all of Speigel’s wild stories panned out. At one Huffington Post editorial meeting, jaws dropped when he said he was on the verge of uncovering a vast, multinational conspiracy, which involved high-ranking U.N. officials, to cover up the crash-landing of a spacecraft. HuffPost senior editor Andy Campbell recalled telling Speigel at the meeting, “If there were ever a time to burn your sources and report what you have for the good of humanity, it’s now, Lee. The Earth needs you more than ever.” Nevertheless, in the community of UFO enthusiasts — both the sci-fi pop culture enthusiasts and the committed researchers who believe the truth is out there — Speigel was a legend. “He was a great journalist,” George Noory, host of “Coast to Coast AM,” told HuffPost. “He understood the paranormal better than anyone. He was doing it years before I started.” As a career capstone, Speigel revived “Edge of Reality” on the UN-X Digital Broadcast Network, pushing forward his research and conversations. Speigel also helped write and produce “The Phenomenon,” a James Fox documentary that featured interviews with former White House chief of staff John Podesta and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who admitted a lot of evidence “hasn’t seen the light of day.” Speigel’s UN-X producer, Race Hobbs, said his work needs to be preserved and built upon. “He never led witnesses, but, if they strayed, he could steer them. He knew what was important for people not familiar with the subject,” adding that Speigel was “a genius.” In the final months of his life, Speigel also helped author Marc Hartzman with his book “We Are Not Alone,” a look at humanity’s evolving views on UFOs going back to biblical times. “Lee opened doors no one else could,” Hartzman said. With Speigel’s interviews and case files now in the hands of the National UFO Historical Records Center, other researchers and journalists will soon have access to his work. Simone, Wolf and other friends and family are planning to gather in Santa Barbara County on March 4 for the launch of Speigel’s ashes. Speigel and Simone, who met in 1982, dated on and off for more than three decades before tying the knot in 2019 on the east end of Long Island. She still recalls when he wandered into the Manhattan magic shop where she was working. Speigel did not enter the store to purchase a magic potion. He was seeking an advertiser for his NBC radio show. Simone quickly recognized him, not by his striking resemblance to a young Al Pacino, but by his voice. “Lee used to do the voiceovers in radio ads for Omni magazine, and every time I heard it, I would turn up the volume because I loved his voice,” Simone said.

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) slammed the Supreme Court’s decision to hear arguments from former President Donald Trump that he is immune from prosecution for any actions he took in the White House. Raskin told MSNBC’s Jen Psaki on Sunday he believed a lower court’s decision on the matter was already “completely exhaustive and totally compelling.” Trump has argued he cannot be prosecuted on charges he attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election, seeking to lean on an unprecedented and broad interpretation of presidential immunity. A three-judge panel on the D.C. Court of Appeals unanimously rejected that argument last month, but the Supreme Court agreed to decide on Trump’s claims last week. Arguments are set for the week of April 22, which effectively freezes special counsel Jack Smith’s case against Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and will likely push any eventual trial until much later in the year. “This was an obvious case not to take up, and just let the D.C. Circuit Court ruling stand,” Raskin said on MSNBC’s “Inside with Jen Psaki.” “We don’t have a king here, we had a revolution against a king and the Constitution is written so that [the] president’s main job is to take care the laws are faithfully executed, not faithfully violated in his own interest.” .@jrpsaki: ""Do you look at this court and think some of these justices want to delay these trials?""@RepRaskin: ""Yeah. If you don't believe that, you're too innocent to be let out of the house by yourself at this point."" pic.twitter.com/Z0YI3r0cJH Trump has largely moved to delay his trials on dozens of charges leveled against him in four different indictments. If he wins reelection and has not been tried, he could order the Justice Department to dismiss the federal cases against him or try to pardon himself. Raskin laid blame for the Supreme Court’s move on the three justices nominated during Trump’s presidency and others under former President George W. Bush. When Psaki asked the lawmaker if he believed some on the court also wanted to see a delay in Trump’s trials, Raskin said you only had to look at the court’s recent rulings.

In a behind-the-scenes look at her 2024 Super Bowl halftime performance, the Grammy winner told her hair and makeup team about how her “pushy” nine-year-old Genesis Dean had been angling to befriend the “Bad Guy” singer. After what Keys said was three days of pestering, she agreed to text Eilish a video of her son where introduced himself and said, “Hi, my name is Genesis and I really like your music. And I’m Alicia Keys’ son.” Laughing at Genesis’ boldness, Keys cackled as she watched the video with her beauty team and showed them her accompanying text to Eilish. “Someone wanted me to send you this message,” it read. “I hope it makes you smile. How are you, beautiful? Big love!” A little too eager to connect with the artist, Keys said Genesis prodded her to see if he got a response “over and over” again. “I said no, it takes a minute,” she recalled telling him. “She likes to take time, reconnect. It’s all good.” Much to the annoyance of his mother, Genesis decided to take it upon himself and text Eilish a simple “Hi” from her phone. “Don’t bother the girl,” Keys said she told her son. “She’ll write back if she can write back.” But as she sat in the makeup chair getting ready for the Super Bowl stage, the “Girl On Fire” singer got the reply Genesis had been waiting for. “Genesis, it’s Billie,” Eilish responded in a video beside her brother and producing partner, Finneas. “I’m ready to be your friend any day.” “I would like to be your friend,” she said eagerly, as Finneas chanted Genesis’ name in the background. “Alicia is my friend, I love her. I love you. Let’s hang out and be friends.” Keys and Eilish go back to at least 2019, when they performed a duet of the song “Ocean Eyes” during an episode of “The Late Late Show With James Corden.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

GOP Presidential Primary","jennifer bendery","2024-03-03","WASHINGTON – Nikki Haley on Sunday defeated Donald Trump in the GOP presidential primary in Washington, D.C., her first win against the former president. It’s a relatively tiny victory, one Trump will almost certainly use to portray Haley as a creature of the D.C. swamp. D.C.’s 19 delegates will now cast their votes for her at the Republican National Convention in July. That’s out of 2,429 delegates, and so far, Trump has trounced her in all of the other state GOP primaries. Right on cue, shortly after Haley’s win was announced, Trump’s campaign said her victory means “the swamp has claimed their queen.” “While Nikki has been soundly rejected throughout the rest of America, she was just crowned Queen of the Swamp by the lobbyists and DC insiders that want to protect the failed status quo,” Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for Trump’s campaign, said in a statement. Trump has a total of 244 delegates and Haley now has 43. Whoever is first to hit 1,215 delegates will be the Republican presidential nominee. Trump is expected to get much closer following this week’s Super Tuesday primaries, where polls show him dominating from coast to coast. But Haley’s win counts for something. For starters, unbelievably, she is now the first woman to ever win a Republican presidential primary. Her ability to defeat Trump in any primary means he can’t celebrate a clean sweep, which, as petty as it sounds, is almost certainly going to infuriate him and delight his critics. And for Haley’s supporters in D.C., it’s a sign that there’s enough of them, even if in this small election, to send the message that they reject the MAGA grip on their party. “It matters for her to win in D.C. because I think it’s going to frustrate Trump more and more,” said Cherry, 66, who was one of about 250 people at a Haley campaign event in D.C. on Friday afternoon. She asked to use her first name only. “I’ve never hated a politician, but I hate Donald Trump,” she said. “This is America’s Hitler.” A Haley victory in D.C.’s GOP primary would “put our little group on the map,” said Dennis Paul, an 84-year-old semi-retired resident. “She seems to grasp things very well,” he said. “She’s obviously good on fiscal policy. She’s vibrant and exciting.” Joe, a long-time D.C. resident, praised Haley for her “message of real vigor and understanding of the issues.” He said he wants her to stay in the race as long as possible, even though it’s unlikely she can win. “First of all, she’s not Joe Biden. Secondly, she’s not Donald Trump,” said Joe, who is in his 60s and who also requested only using his first name, but confirmed his last name is not “Biden.” “Anywhere ― anywhere ― she can win and show momentum would be great,” Joe said of Haley. Some attendees at Haley’s event said she has come to represent something much bigger than herself. Antonia Ferrier, a former longtime senior aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the late Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), is now a major donor to Haley’s campaign. She said it’s clear there is a faction of voters who “feel almost voiceless in the Republican Party.” She rattled off recent polling that has deeply frustrated her: Nearly 70% of Americans don’t want a Biden-Trump rematch in November. Nearly 60% think they’re both too old. More than 40% of voters are registering as independent, tying a record high in 2014. “There is a collective scream in this country,” said Ferrier, who is currently an executive at a GOP nonprofit focused on advancing democracy. “It’s like a collective scream for a leader we can be proud of. But the established political class refuses to listen to it because of their own feedback loops or whatever fucking reason, and Haley is giving voice to that.” Ferrier said she wants the former South Carolina governor to stay in the race as long as she can, because “she is an affirmation of the politics saying there is a better way. She gets it. It’s clear she understands it.” “There is another way for our country,” she emphasized. Haley herself made this point at her campaign event on Friday. “We don’t have to live the way we’re living now,” she told the room, to applause. “But we need to be part of the solution. We’re gonna fight for Super Tuesday.” But what is Haley’s endgame, if it’s clear she can’t defeat Trump in the Republican primary but is continuing to campaign and raise money?

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jason-galanis-biden-impeachment-inquiry_n_65e778f0e4b0d2a2475ae706","Republicans Go To Bat For Federal Prisoner Who Testified In Biden Impeachment Inquiry","arthur delaney","2024-03-05","WASHINGTON — House Republicans are chasing a new lead in their impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden, sending official demands for information about how the Justice Department handled a federal prisoner’s requests for home confinement. Impeachment investigators interviewed Jason Galanis last month at a federal prison in Alabama, where Galanis, who claimed to have been a business partner of Hunter Biden’s, is serving a 14-year sentence for his roles in two multimillion-dollar fraud schemes. Galanis claimed during the interview that his request for home confinement last year had been rejected in order to prevent him from talking to Republicans searching for evidence of Joe Biden’s involvement in his son’s business deals. “I’ve been the victim of a pattern of retribution by the Department of Justice in order to prevent my home confinement, which would have allowed full and free access to congressional investigators,” Galanis said, according to an interview transcript. Despite the Justice Department granting Republicans’ request for an interview with Galanis and talking to him for four hours, some GOP figures still think there’s something fishy going on. In a letter from House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and Judiciary Committee member Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), the three said they were investigating Galanis’ allegations “and will take seriously any attempt by [the Bureau of Prisons] to obstruct the Committees’ inquiry, including by retaliating against witnesses.” The letter was sent Tuesday to the director of the BOP and the U.S. attorney’s office for the southern district of New York, which prosecuted Galanis. The U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment. The BOP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Galanis testimony and follow-up letter represent one of the more unusual rabbit holes Republicans have followed in their quest for incriminating evidence against the president. They have also interviewed a New York gallerist who sold paintings by Hunter Biden and the trustee of a bankrupt health care company that once hired the president’s brother. The gallerist and trustee (along with a series of other witnesses) have said they were unaware of Joe Biden being involved in his family’s business schemes. Republicans’ most serious allegation ― that the Bidens solicited bribes from a Ukrainian oligarch ― imploded last month when the Justice Department said an informant had made them up. Galanis testified that from 2012 to 2015, he partnered in business with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, a friend of Hunter’s, on a scheme to rake in billions from overseas private equity investors. “The entire value add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden,” Galanis said, adding that he once witnessed Hunter Biden put his dad on speakerphone at a restaurant in the company of other business associates. “The Vice President said, ‘Hello,’ and some pleasantries, ‘Hope you had safe travels,’ and seemed like he wanted to bring the call to an end by saying, ‘Okay, you be good to my boy,’” Galanis said. As part of the venture, Galanis went on to say that he “engaged in unlawful conduct” and was sent to prison. In 2016, the Justice Department announced charges against Galanis, Archer and five others for defrauding a Native American tribe and pension fund managers in a self-enrichment scheme. Though the defendants used Hunter Biden’s famous last name to sell their plans, prosecutors didn’t press charges against him. His lawyers have said he wasn’t involved. In an interview last year, Archer told lawmakers that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone repeatedly in the company of clients, but the president only offered pleasantries and commentary on the weather — essentially the same thing Galanis said he witnessed. Archer said the elder Biden wasn’t involved in their work and that he was unaware of Joe Biden taking any action as a government official to benefit his son. In his own deposition last week, Hunter Biden said he did not partner with Galanis and that he only knew his name from news reports. “I think that 10 years ago, for 30 minutes, I was introduced to Jason Galanis, and that’s only ― the only time I ever recall meeting him,” he said. Republicans didn’t press for more. Though he wasn’t charged alongside Galanis and Archer, the Justice Department has charged Hunter Biden with crimes for failing to pay his taxes on time and for illegally owning a firearm in 2018 while he was addicted to crack cocaine. Prosecutors have suggested they may seek additional charges. Galanis said that while he was in a Florida prison last February, he applied for home confinement in California and was approved. However, the approval was reversed in July after Republicans announced their subpoena for Archer’s testimony. Galanis claimed that a former BOP official told him prosecutors weighed in on the request, and he said prison officials offered shifting justifications when they rejected his appeals. He said he received his current placement in Alabama in August after complaining of persistent sexual harassment from a prison staff member at the facility in Florida.

Although he’s been treated professionally at the Alabama prison, Galanis said his overall experience makes him suspect his past association with the president’s son has put a target on his back. “From the experiences I’ve had in the criminal justice system, I believe I am putting myself at grave risk within the BOP for providing information into these matters concerning the president and his son,” he said. Republicans first asked the BOP for time with Galanis in November, several months after his home confinement request had been denied and he had been transferred to Alabama.

No single or specific incident led to this decision. Our decision was made to prevent such a significant incident.” Fraternities and sororities are fighting back. In a statement to The Washington Post, three Greek organizations said that UMD hasn’t given an explanation for the suspension or allowed them to defend themselves. “This shut down was so sudden and we’re frustrated with no answers,” Spencer Doyle, chapter president of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, told The Washington Post. “It is not fair to chapters operating the right way.” According to national hazing statistics listed on UMD’s website, 95% of students who are hazed won’t report it. According to the Hazing Prevention Network, 55% of fraternity and sorority members will experience hazing.

Blackwell engaged in a pretty toxic relationship with fellow cast member Jimmy Presnell during Season 6, and their dynamic seemed to bring out the worst in both of them. Presnell was initially emotionally aloof with Blackwell, causing her to unleash all of her insecurities on screen, which was excruciating to watch. But even if Blackwell’s antics were annoying, it seems some fans have taken their dislike of her a tad too far. “You guys have every single right to, you know, have opinions on my life,” Blackwell said while addressing fans on Instagram last week. “But like, I don’t know, maybe cease the death threats for a minute? I don’t know, just a thought.” Earlier in her video, Blackwell acknowledged that she came off pretty cringe. “Let’s be honest … woof,” Blackwell said about watching herself on “Love is Blind” over a year after Season 6 was filmed. “Imagine spending the year really working on yourself, finding those inner demons, and really becoming the woman you’ve always wanted to be, sitting with hardships in your life that you’ve never really sat with before — and then having to relive it.

The actors were photographed together on a beach in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, over the weekend, as seen in photos published by E! News on Monday. The two were seen smiling and holding hands on the shoreline of a beach. One photo showed the pair embracing each other with their foreheads pressed together. Nyong’o and Jackson had previously fueled dating rumors in December, when they were seen holding hands while walking through Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California. They were also spotted together in a car ahead of a trip to the grocery store in Los Angeles that same month, as seen in photos published by TMZ. Prior to that, fans of the actors speculated about their relationship on social media in October, when they were photographed at a Janelle Monáe concert with a group of friends. They have yet to publicly comment on their relationship. Representatives for Jackson and Nyong’o did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jackson was previously married to fellow actor Jodie Turner-Smith. The “Queen & Slim” actor reportedly filed for divorce from Jackson in October, after more than three years of marriage. They share a 3-year-old daughter. Tuner-Smith publicly discussed her divorce from Jackson for the first time last month. “Sometimes things we really want to work just don’t end up working. And that’s OK,” she told U.K.’s Sunday Times Style. “The most important thing is that you choose what’s healthiest for you and your family and definitely your children.” In October, Nyong’o shared her “heartbreak” with her Instagram followers after her split from sports commentator Selema Masekela.

King, who plays Leslie Bennett on “Euphoria,” said during a recent stand-up show that she doesn’t know when fans can expect new episodes of the show. “Season 3 is coming out — I don’t f**king know,” the actor and comedian said, as seen in a TikTok video she shared Monday. “Don’t ask me, I don’t know. It’s one of those things. People are like, ‘We need Season 3.’ I’m like, ‘Bitch, I need Season 3.’ I haven’t paid my rent in six months.” King then took a playful dig at her co-star, Zendaya, who plays her character’s daughter, Rue Bennett. “Zendaya’s over in Paris at Fashion Week,” she quipped. “I’m like, ‘Bitch, come home! I need you. Mama needs you!’” A two-time Emmy winner, Zendaya has been making the red carpet rounds on both sides of the Atlantic to promote “Dune: Part Two,” which also stars Austin Butler, Timothée Chalamet and Florence Pugh. Although King’s bit about Zendaya was meant in jest, she said her recent lack of steady employment was no laughing matter: “I haven’t booked nothing since ‘Euphoria.’ This is some bullshit.” “Euphoria” was officially renewed for a third season in early 2022. In November, however, HBO’s CEO Casey Bloys clarified that that the series wouldn’t return until 2025, partly as a result of the actors and writers strikes that brought most of Hollywood to a standstill last year. Since then, many of the show’s actors, including Colman Domingo and Jacob Elordi, have shared their thoughts on the delay. “[Creator Sam Levinson] is a person who writes and rewrites and writes and rewrites again, because I think he’s wrestling with what’s important,” Domingo, an Oscar nominee for Netflix’s “Rustin,” told GQ last month. “He’s responding immediately to what the ills of the world are. I know that the one thing I can tell you is that he’s very much interested in the existential question of who we are right now. Our souls. That’s what he wants to figure out with Season 3.” Elordi, who plays teen jock Nate Jacobs, joked to “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon in January that the “Euphoria” creative team might have to find a way to de-age him if the production delay was extended.

The attack killed her 3-year-old granddaughter, who had been sitting with Thari as she made bread for her family, and wounded Thari so badly that emergency workers put her in a body bag ― only realizing she was alive when her grieving sister noticed Thari’s eyes were still moving. Medical teams moved Thari and her injured husband from hospitals in Gaza to an Italian hospital ship, then to Egypt and eventually Qatar. She’s now had five surgeries, and is awaiting one more in her back. “If I had the option to stop treatment, I would go back in a heartbeat,” Thari, 39, told HuffPost last week. In addition to the concern for her children, her “heart burns” for her parents, who are 70 and 75. “I’m not able to heal because of my mind and emotional state,” Thari said. “My therapist tells me to stop watching the news, but how can I stop? I have to check the lists of people being martyred. How can I stop?” Since Israel began its devastating U.S.-backed campaign in Gaza on Oct. 7, retaliating for a shock attack by Gaza-based Palestinian militants that killed some 1,200 people, only a handful of the region’s 2.3 million residents have gotten to safety. Up to a thousand are believed to be living in Egypt after relying on their dual nationalities or bribes to travel through the Rafah Crossing, currently the only functional pedestrian exit point into and out of Gaza. And medical and diplomatic personnel have overcome bureaucratic and logistical hurdles to evacuate some Palestinians, like Thari, who needed urgent, specialized care. About 700 Palestinian civilians ― among them 300 children ― are now in Qatar, local officials say, a group that comprises mostly wounded people but also some of their companions. In interviews with HuffPost in the Persian Gulf state, a U.S. ally that plans to treat at least 1,500 injured Gazans, evacuees described heartache over separation from their vulnerable loved ones, and deep disillusionment about the global response to Israel’s offensive. Despite Israel’s claims that its military operation is focused on the militant group Hamas, it has killed more than 30,000 people, most of them civilians, according to Palestinian authorities. Perched on a beanbag chair in the courtyard of a residential facility just a few miles from the offices where Israeli representatives have visited for U.S.-backed discussions about a possible truce with Hamas, a 30-year-old mother named Watfah described watching coverage of President Joe Biden discussing the prospect of a cease-fire on Feb. 26. “He’s doing it while eating ice cream, mocking us,” Watfah said. Thari had particular disdain for governments in the Middle East. Palestinians have traditionally looked to fellow Arab nations for support, but in recent years, Israel has successfully convinced several of those states to establish ties with it without an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. “The only reason this is happening to us is because of the silence of the Arabs,” Thari said, tearing up. “Arab leaders are too scared to stand up to Israel and America ... It’s like spraying pest control on animals, that’s how many people have died.” Views like these reflect not only how the ongoing war has traumatized Palestinians, but also a widespread wariness about discussions in Washington, regional capitals, and beyond about halting the fighting and negotiating a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. Simultaneously, the evacuees’ stories underscore the yearning for a respite among those who understand conditions in Gaza ― a goal that Biden and other key figures say they are working hard to achieve before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins on March 10. “Our hearts are still back in Gaza,” Thari said. “I die a hundred times a day for my kids.” Mohammed Obaid, 42, and his 13-year-old son Bahaa have been in Qatar since Jan. 18. Since they were hit by an Israeli airstrike on Nov. 6, both have had complex surgeries. Bahaa has lost his left leg and is hoping to soon get a prosthetic. “We’re tired,” Obaid said. “We just want peace.” He fought back tears remembering how he tried to hold his wife’s hand after the strike, and how he realized, once they were taken to a hospital, that she had lost too much spinal fluid to survive. Obaid’s uncle, a surgeon, was able to help him and Bahaa get to Egypt for treatment. But Obaid’s other children are still in Gaza, and he has only been able to speak to them once a week. Struggling to feed themselves, they always ask him what he and Bahaa have been able to eat. “They’re living with their uncle, but they need their father,” he told HuffPost. “They already lost their mom ― they need their father.” Many at the Qatari facility said reuniting with their loved ones was their chief priority. Some had already been separated from family members during the war, as more than 70% of Gaza’s population has been displaced into makeshift refuges amid Israeli evacuation orders, bombardments and troop advances. Naheel, 35, and her five children have only seen her husband for a handful of days since Oct. 7. On Oct. 11, a premonition prompted her to move with her kids into a U.N. school. Her husband didn’t want to abandon their home. Attacks in their neighborhood, initially designated a safe zone by Israel, soon wounded him, putting him in a hospital bed for months. Meanwhile, the relative safety of Naheel’s shelter had limits. When she went out to a balcony to check that her kids had not strayed off the school grounds, a large piece of shrapnel hit her in the back. “It felt like I was on fire,” she said. Amid chaos at the local Nasser Hospital, she only got a dressing for the wound, then hurried back to her children. Still, she couldn’t watch them at all times. One day in late October, two of her sons ― 15-year-old Anas and 10-year-old Adham ― joined a group of boys in search of wood for cooking. Suddenly they were engulfed in what Anas called “toxic bombs” that made them feel like they were suffocating. By the time they were taken to a hospital, Adham was near death. Doctors told his family his brain had run short on oxygen, leaving him disfigured and unable to speak or control his limbs. By late December, bullets through the windows of the U.N. school, as well as airdropped Israeli messages about continued attacks, convinced Naheel to move again. Her husband went to Rafah and secured a tent, and Naheel and their children traveled three hours on a donkey cart to reunite with him on Jan. 10. Four days later, she heard that Egyptian authorities were willing to let her and Adham exit through Rafah. She hoped that permission could extend to their whole family. But when they arrived at the crossing, border guards refused to let her husband cross. “My kids broke down,” she recalled. Since they have been transferred to Qatar, she and the children have had minimal contact with him, but she says nothing could be more important for them, especially Adham. She showed HuffPost a video of him reacting excitedly when she mentioned his father. She said she is “begging” multiple governments for help, awaiting the day she sees his name spelled out on the Rafah exit list: Mohammed Abu Al Ola. Fear and longing are paired with guilt for some evacuees, making each day of the war harder to bear. Watfah, who arrived in Qatar two weeks ago with her severely injured 13-year-old son, is wracked by thoughts of her other children. Her 9-year-old daughter “is a parent now,” she said, caring for her young siblings. The family has already endured a loss: Watfah was seven months pregnant when the war broke out, but due to malnourishment and dehydration, her baby was stillborn, she said. Iman, a young woman from Gaza City, told HuffPost she thinks constantly about her decision to get in an ambulance with her daughter Aleen after the girl was hit by shrapnel on the balcony of their apartment on Dec. 10. Emergency personnel brought the pair to a hospital through Israeli checkpoints. Because of the extent of Aleen’s wound, which left a gaping hole in the side of her face, doctors kept her in a hospital and ultimately sent them to Egypt, then Qatar. Iman wonders if she could have snuck her other two children ― boys aged 12 and 4 ― into the ambulance too. She says she’s regularly asked that question by other people. But she also knows Israeli soldiers would have likely pulled them out of the vehicle. “I didn’t expect my daughter to need this much treatment. I can’t handle one more day without my other kids,” she said, expressing particular concern about Israeli forces’ pattern of treating men and older boys like her husband and her 12-year-old as potential combatants. As Iman receives meals provided by the Qatari government, her children in Gaza can rarely get rice, she said: “They’re starving.” Northern Gaza, where Iman’s family and about 300,000 other Palestinians live, is enduring near-famine conditions and children there are dying of hunger, U.N. and aid experts say. Though Israel controls the area, it has offered little support to efforts by donor groups and Israeli partners like the U.S. to send in a huge surge of food and other supplies. Worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza, and fears that continued bloodshed there will spark broader violence over Ramadan, are intensifying a U.S.-led attempt to negotiate a pause in fighting, allow in more aid and release Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. As HuffPost interviewed evacuated Gazans, Israeli technical experts and Qatari mediators with Hamas were assessing the possibility of trading Israeli hostages for Palestinians. Since then, however, talks have stalled over the questions of whether Israel will withdraw its troops from Gaza and whether Hamas will share details about individuals it wants included in the deal. From evacuees to well-connected sources, there’s little optimism among observers that a meaningful stop to the war is imminent. “They’re all liars. We were hopeful, but we kept getting let down,” Thari said in Doha. A U.S. official familiar with senior Biden aides’ thinking told HuffPost that top American officials know how dire the situation is ― and even anticipated a scenario like the tragedy last week, now being called a “flour massacre,” when more than 100 Palestinians trying to get aid were killed amid trampling and Israeli gunfire. Yet the president’s refusal to pressure Israel in a tangible way, for instance by suggesting limits on the American support fueling its Gaza offensive, is shaping U.S. policy, the official said. “Pushing Israel to allow food in is totally off the table,” they said. “Biden is not budging on anything.” The official, who has worked under both Democratic and Republican presidents, described a mix of incompetence and Biden’s “singularly” harmful views, like leaning more reflexively pro-Israel than other Democrats and, according to administration officials, viewing Israel as it was 30 or 40 years ago, rather than acknowledging its current strength and hard-right politics. The upshot, they said, is that the Biden administration would try to address the crisis through “complex, hard-to-do and low-yield PR stunts like airdrops.” Spokespeople for the White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Experienced humanitarians have condemned Biden’s new policy, launched over the weekend, of airdropping aid into Gaza. “The world’s wealthiest, most powerful, ‘greatest’ nation should not have to resort to needed, but inefficient and last-resort airdrops to get life-saving aid in,” Sean Carroll ― a former U.S. Agency for International Development official who now runs the group American Near East Refugee Aid ― recently wrote on LinkedIn. Given its influence, many say the U.S. could do more to change Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s approach. Netanyahu this week refused to even send an Israeli delegation to truce talks, and Israel has not permitted aid to enter northern Gaza through crossings it controls. “The Americans should be much tougher. They still don’t fully understand who they’re up against,” said a former senior Israeli official who requested anonymity to speak candidly. Advocates like Dylan Williams of the Center for International Policy argue that the U.S. should legally already be compelled to cut off military aid for Israel because the country is hindering the distribution of American aid. “It defies credulity for the administration to act as if it hasn’t made known to the President that the government of Israel restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of US humanitarian assistance, which is the standard set in the law,” Williams told HuffPost by text message. “If there is not a massive increase in aid into Gaza, I think you can expect congressional calls for enforcement of this law to grow.” Palestinians with lives in the balance say a change in course is overdue. Evacuees described how their loved ones’ days are dominated by anxiety about Israeli airstrikes, how their chronically ill relatives are unable to get treatment as hospitals focus on war injuries, and how their own futures feel inextricably tied to the war. “We’re resisting food, on hunger strike,” said Thari, telling HuffPost she only accepts a couple of spoonfuls of food to take her medication. “How can I eat when my dad is eating grass?”",-0.0343185952413264,0.253609729771324

In a phone interview on “Fox & Friends,” hosts Brian Kilmeade and Lawrence Jones asked the GOP front-runner if he was “on board” with the way Israeli forces have been carrying out their offensive in Gaza. “You’ve got to finish the problem,” Trump said. “You had a horrible invasion that took place, that would have never happened if I was president, by the way.” Hamas militants launched a deadly attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 hostages. About half the hostages were released during a temporary cease-fire late last year; 100 of the remaining 130 hostages are estimated to still be alive. In retaliation, Israel launched a massive and ongoing military offensive in Gaza, killing more than 30,000 Palestinians and wounding many more, as well as displacing millions. Trump dodged multiple questions by the “Fox & Friends” hosts on his stances related to Israel and Gaza and instead reiterated that the Oct. 7 attack and Israel’s retaliation would not have happened had he been president. “They wouldn’t have done it to me I guarantee you that,” he said. “They did this because they have no respect for Biden, and frankly, they got soft.” ""You gotta finish the problem"" -- Trump endorses Israel's war effort against Hamas pic.twitter.com/5VXrqSiuNM President Joe Biden’s unconditional support for Israel and its military offensive is beginning to cost him votes in the 2024 election. Michigan, which has one of the largest Arab and Muslim American populations, saw an unprecedented number of Democratic voters cast their primary ballot for “uncommitted” instead of for Biden. The uncommitted movement, which has started spreading to other states, was led by voters who felt that Biden was not taking his constituents’ concerns seriously about U.S. involvement in Israel’s offensive. Despite the president’s strong allyship with Israel, Trump would likely still be the preferred candidate for the Israeli government’s far-right leaders, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. Last month, Ben Gvir told The Wall Street Journal that Trump would give the Israeli right a stronger backing than Biden currently does. The next four years will change America forever.

The two leaders were close during the Trump administration, which cut Palestinians out of the negotiations over the so-called Abraham Accords and supported expanding Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. However, after Netanyahu called Biden to congratulate him on his win in 2020, Trump began to sour on the Israeli leader. Just days after the Oct. 7 attack, Trump praised the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group as “very smart” while disparaging Netanyahu and Israeli military officials. The Republican candidate had since stayed noticeably silent on the war until Tuesday.

Bob Menendez and his wife that allege they accepted gold bars, cash and a luxury car in return for favors the senator carried out to assist three businessmen. The new charges were in a rewritten indictment returned against the Democrat in Manhattan federal court. New charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice were added against Menendez and his wife, Nadine. An indictment already alleges that the couple conspired with three businessmen to accept the bribes in return for the senator’s help in projects pursued by the businessmen. Both have pleaded not guilty, along with two of the businessmen. A May trial has been scheduled. One businessman pleaded guilty to charges last week and agreed to testify at trial against the others. After his fall arrest, Menendez, 70, was forced to relinquish his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but said he would not resign from Congress. According to an indictment, Menendez and his wife accepted gold bars and cash from a real estate developer in return for the senator using his clout to get that businessman a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund.

In an interview with Bustle published Tuesday, Johnson spoke about the film’s unfavorable reception while reflecting on what it was like to be a part of the project, saying that “it was definitely an experience for me to make that movie.” “I had never done anything like it before. I probably will never do anything like it again because I don’t make sense in that world. And I know that now,” she said. The “Fifty Shades” star continued, “But sometimes in this industry, you sign on to something, and it’s one thing and then as you’re making it, it becomes a completely different thing, and you’re like, ‘Wait, what?’” Johnson, who plays the clairvoyant Cassie Webb in “Madame Web,” said she’s “not surprised” that the film “has gone down the way it has” and added that “of course it’s not nice to be a part of something that’s ripped to shreds, but I can’t say that I don’t understand.” The actor also spoke on the challenges of getting movies made because “decisions are being made by committees, and art does not do well when it’s made by committee.” “Films are made by a filmmaker and a team of artists around them. You cannot make art based on numbers and algorithms. My feeling has been for a long time that audiences are extremely smart, and executives have started to believe that they’re not,” Johnson said. “Audiences will always be able to sniff out bullshit. Even if films start to be made with AI, humans aren’t going to fucking want to see those,” she continued. Many social media users on X, formerly Twitter, praised Johnson for her remarks in the interview.

The rules in the model building code will require new homes to come equipped with the circuitry to hook up induction stoves and electric car chargers, and will be used as a benchmark in almost every state. In November, trade associations representing gas utilities and furnace manufacturers launched a last-ditch effort to gut the provisions, which will be released this year. The International Code Council, the nonprofit organization that works with industry groups and local governments to write the generic codes enshrined into law across most of the country, even bent its own rules to grant players like the American Gas Association and the American Public Gas Association extra time to file appeals, HuffPost reported last month. The fossil fuel groups challenged codes that would make it cheaper for homeowners to opt out of gas, arguing that the proposals either fell outside the bounds of what the energy code was meant to do or were forged through improper procedures. But the ICC’s appeals board this week rejected all nine challenges to the latest energy codes, ruling that the “appellants have not demonstrated a material and significant irregularity of process or procedure.” The gas companies will have one more chance to make their case in a two-hour hearing later this month before the ICC’s board of directors, which will make a final decision at its March 18 meeting. The trade groups that filed the appeals say they plan to push the top executives to overturn the decisions. “This issue is, in fact, not concluded,” said Francis Dietz, a spokesperson for the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group for gas furnace manufacturers that filed an appeal. The American Public Gas Association said it was “disappointed” by the appeals board’s ruling, which the trade group representing municipal gas utilities framed as a threat to Americans’ access to “energy sources that they prefer.” “Fortunately, the appeals process is not over,” the trade group said in a statement to HuffPost. “In the end, the ICC’s Board of Directors will ultimately decide whether to support or reject the appeals. We are closely monitoring to see what they decide.” While the outcome isn’t guaranteed, two sources with knowledge of the process said it would be unusual for the executive panel to buck the appeals board’s recommendations. The ICC directed HuffPost to its public webpage about the current appeals process but did not respond to an emailed question about when the board of directors last overturned a decision by the appeals board. Rejecting the industry appeals may restore some credibility to the beleaguered ICC, whose once-sleepy tradition of updating the nation’s model building codes came under scrutiny in recent years following what advocates saw as an industry coup. “This is definitely a positive development, and we’ll see how the final step goes,” said Mike Waite, the director of codes at watchdog American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and a volunteer who helped author this year’s commercial building codes for the ICC. “The ICC needs to follow their written policies and we still need this code to go much further to hit our energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.” Since the ICC became the national standard for model building codes in the 1990s, the organization had convened local governments and industry associations every three years to update its codebook. At the end of the process, elected officials alone voted on the final version of the codes, giving the ICC enough democratic legitimacy that virtually every state set its codes as the benchmark in local laws. In 2019, however, local governments under pressure to cut planet-heating emissions rallied to vote for the greenest energy codes enacted in a generation. Industry groups balked, first challenging local officials’ eligibility to vote, then filing appeals to strip key climate-friendly provisions out of the codebook. The ICC’s appeals board removed some provisions related to wiring needed for electric cars and appliances, handing a victory to the gas associations that challenged the codes. Then the ICC went a step further, and proposed eliminating governments’ right to vote on the final version of energy codes altogether. While elected officials would still get the last say on codes related to plumbing and swimming pools, energy codes would instead be written by “consensus”-minded committees where industry associations would enjoy equal representation with governments. Governments, including the newly-inaugurated Biden administration, urged the ICC against making the change. The ICC went ahead with the new system, which gas utilities hailed as a win for the industry. “Those appeals should not have been placed in front of it in the first place, so they made the correct judgment here.” Early on, gas companies sought broader influence over a system critics now saw as rigged — at least slightly — in the industry’s favor. Finding two-thirds supermajorities to enact proposals on each of the committees writing energy codes proved challenging. But the process ultimately yielded a proposed codebook for 2024 that the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found improved efficiency by up to 10% and pushed decarbonization forward in particular with new electrification measures. While those efficiency gains fell short of the leaps the 2021 code made over its predecessor, the 2024 code’s circuitry for electric vehicles and appliances made significant progress on cutting emissions, according to the national lab’s preliminary analysis. Advocates who worked on the committees that wrote the latest code said the proposed 2024 codebook did not go as far as groups like ACEEE wanted, but the nonprofit said the compromise improvements made the package worth supporting. On its own, the fact that ICC broke its own rules to give the industry groups more time to file appeals amounted to a “scandal,” ACEEE said. But if the ICC granted the appeals and overturned the key electrification codes, ACEEE said advocates would look to abandon the ICC process altogether in favor of a new benchmark for model codes. “The appeals board itself dealt with what it had placed in front of it,” Waite said. “But those appeals should not have been placed in front of it in the first place, so they made the correct judgment here.” It’s still unclear how the next round of code-writing will play out, he said, and warned that advocates still doubt “that the ICC is a fair administrator of its own process.” Still, Waite said the appeals board’s ruling confirms that slashing planet-heating emissions is “within the scope” of the energy code-writing process.

And so I did ‘Skirt Up Day’ and oh, my god. She lost it on me, and I was just not in the mood to back down.” Green said the fight was “a huge moment for everyone” on set at the time. Garth has spoken about her time on “90210” before, and said she also “struggled” with competitiveness stemming from being on the show. “If I’m honest, I think the show kind of taught me to be threatened by other girls, be threatened by other women and be more competitive because I wanted our costars’ approval or attention,” she said on an episode of her podcast, “9021OMG,” which she co-hosts with her former co-star and friend Tori Spelling, back in 2021.

Damian Hurley recently shared the first trailer for his feature directorial debut, “Strictly Confidential,” in which his 58-year-old mom gets hot and heavy with a younger woman (Pear Chiravara). Social media users were naturally baffled (and curious) by the trailer. “Part of me wants to thank [Damian Hurley], none of me wants to shake his hand,” one user wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “She’s a beautiful woman. It’s also peak Roman Empire for a kid to be directing mom in soft-core porn,” another wrote. According to People, “Strictly Confidential” is billed as a “sensual thriller with a devilish twist,” where a woman named Mia (Georgia Lock) goes to the Caribbean to investigate her friend’s death. While there, she meets Lily (Elizabeth Hurley) — and enters a “seductive world of sex, betrayal and murder.” Back in 2022, Damian Hurley explained on Instagram how his mother ended up in the film. “I want to worship [my mom] who, during the making of my first ever short film back in 2010 (when I was 8) promised me she’d be in my first feature,” he wrote at the time. “True to her word, the minute this film was greenlit, Mama dropped everything and raced out to the beautiful Caribbean to help.” While speaking with People, Damian Hurley elaborated on what it was like to work with his mother. “We only had 18 days to shoot the whole film, so our twin-like telepathy was invaluable throughout,” he said, adding that the “power dynamic” between them was “complicated at the best of times” but made for “a joy to come to work” with. Still, their upcoming collaboration has clearly unsettled some people.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kyrsten-sinema-senate-reelection_n_65e770f5e4b0d2a2475ae4cd","Kyrsten Sinema Announces She Won't Seek Reelection","igor bobic","2024-03-05","Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) announced on Tuesday she won’t be seeking reelection in November, ending months of speculation about her political future. In a video released by her office, Sinema complained about the death of civility and compromise in American politics.` “The only political victories that matter these days are symbolic, attacking your opponents on cable news or social media. Compromise is a dirty word,” Sinema said. “I believe in my approach. But, it’s not what America wants right now.” “Because I choose civility, understanding, listening, working together to get stuff done, I will leave the Senate at the end of this year,” she added. Sinema’s decision not to run for reelection means that Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) is now set for a one-on-one race with election denier Kari Lake, the likely Republican candidate, in November. National Republicans believe Sinema’s exit will boost Lake’s chances of flipping the seat and winning control of the Senate next year. “An open seat in Arizona creates a unique opportunity for Republicans to build a lasting Senate majority this November,” Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. “With recent polling showing Kyrsten Sinema pulling far more Republican voters than Democrat voters, her decision to retire improves Kari Lake’s opportunity to flip this seat.” Earlier public polls of a hypothetical matchup between Lake and Gallego have found Gallego leading or the two candidates neck-and-neck, with a large number of undecided voters. Lake, who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has been the outspoken supporter of Jan. 6, 2021, rioters, characterizing those prosecuted for their actions as “political prisoners.” She has also been a vocal critic of the late GOP Sen. Arizona Sen. John McCain. Gallego on Tuesday invited Sinema to help him defeat Lake in November. “Protecting abortion access, tackling housing affordability, securing our water supply, defending our democracy — all of this and more is on the line,” Gallego said in a statement. “That’s why Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike are coming together and rejecting Kari Lake and her dangerous positions.” Sinema left the Democratic Party and became an independent in 2022. She has been fiercely criticized by some on the left for standing in the way of progressive priorities in the Senate, including a higher minimum wage, higher corporate tax rates, and the elimination of the filibuster. Those positions helped to effectively sour her standing with Democratic voters in Arizona. Her only path forward, had she chosen to run for reelection, would have been gathering enough signatures to appear on the ballot as an independent ― a difficult and risky campaign. Still, Sinema was deeply involved in crafting all the major bipartisan bills that passed in Congress in recent years, including the gun safety overhaul, infrastructure reform, new protections for gay marriage and improvements to the Electoral Count Act, to name a few. But it was the most recent negotiation over U.S. immigration and border policy that seemed to shake Sinema’s belief in bipartisan compromise. The next four years will change America forever.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. With endorsements from Wirecutter, Consumer Reports and Gear Patrol (along with thousands upon thousands of Amazon reviews), Coway is one of the most highly rated brands in the crowded space of air purification. When a Coway air purifier is on sale, you want to act fast to grab one at a discounted price. Right now, you can get the popular Coway Airmega 1512HH air purifier for 30% off its list price at Amazon. Unlike many bulky (and downright hideous) home appliances, the polished design of this device will actually make you want to show it off. It comes in black, white and a luxurious black and gold WiFi-enabled option (which is not on sale), and could easily become your favorite machine-turned-home decor. The sleek purifier has a complex, three-stage filter that captures and reduces up to 99.97% of irritating particles ― including pollen, pollutants and other allergens ― along with odors and volatile organic compounds (like airborne gases from your gas stove). It’s designed to purify rooms of up to 867 square feet and has a timer feature you can set to run one, four or eight hours before it automatically shuts off. It comes in black and white and measures 16.8 inches by 18.3 inches by 9.7 inches. When it comes time to replace your filters (the odor filter every six months and the HEPA once a year) the process couldn’t be any easier and a complete replacement set is easily available to grab with your purchase. You can see some promising reviews for the Coway down below or head back up to snag one for an impressive 30% off its regular price. Promising Amazon reviews: “Three weeks in and we couldn’t be happier with this filter. Quiet and effective. If it detects contaminants the light turns red and the fan kicks up to high, which is a bit loud (when set to auto), but it doesn’t run high for long.We have a woodstove for heat, which creates a lot of dust. This has cut it back a lot, and has cut the amount of dusting I have to do overall.We’re both breathing easier, and its cut down on the smell of our 2 large house dogs.” — SpragueRiverHomestead “Fed up with musty odors and dust this winter, we got several air purifiers. This one deserves its top reputation. It really cleans the air in a room―even a large room. I used to wake up with a headache every day; once we started using this guy, those were a thing of the past. My son was having trouble with allergies (probably to dust or mold), and we swapped units. After he started running this one in his room, he was fine. He could get a similar result with the other units only by running them at a higher, noisy level.The sleep mode is not completely silent, but quiet enough for me (a light sleeper). It is also not completely dark, but it’s easy enough to put an opaque object over the bright LED that can’t be turned off when the unit is on.One really great feature of this purifier is that if it loses power and then the power comes on again, it will start up with the same setting it was on before. All of our other air purifiers, once the power goes off, you have to manually turn it on again for it to run. Why does this matter? I plugged the Coway airmega into a smart plug so that I can control it from afar―turn it on when I’m away from home, or schedule it to run for a certain number of hours each day and turn itself off and on again. I can’t do that with the Levoits.” — Emommy “I have two Coway air purifiers in my apartment and have run them non-stop for nearly 5 years, aside from cleaning and changing filters. Online reviews said they are durable and this is quite true. Some of my favorite features:- Easy to service. There are three layers of filtration - a screen behind the front cover that captures lint, hair, large items, an activated charcoal filter to remove odors and a true HEPA filter behind that. Removing the outer cover to vacuum the screen is very easy. Accessing the other filters is also a snap.- Very durable. As I mentioned, mine are nearly 5 years old and one has always been in a room with my two boys, so seen its fair share of knocks.- Ability to run int auto mode where it speeds up if it detects pollutants- Adjustable sensitivity to pollutants- Three fan speeds. The first two are nearly silent. The 3rd (high) makes a decent amount of noise, but the only time I ever use high is during extreme wildfire/smog events or if cooking something smokey. Middle speed moves plenty of air and should be all you need.The only con I can think of is that my interior designer wife is not crazy about their appearance. Doesn’t bother me. One of my favorite home products.” — SeattleGreen By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

By 12:30 p.m., the outages, which were reported around the world, appeared largely resolved, according to tracking website Downdetector.com. Meta’s head of communications, Andy Stone, blamed a “technical issue” for some users’ inability to access the company’s servers. “We resolved the issue as quickly as possible for everyone who was impacted, and we apologize for any inconvenience,” he said in a statement posted to X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Facebook appeared to get hit the hardest of all Meta-owned sites, with nearly 500,000 users reporting outages just before 11 a.m. Messaging app WhatsApp, in comparison, only had a few hundred reported outages, according to Downdetector.com. The outages became a trending topic on X, with Meta users turning to the rival social media platform to express grievances. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

It didn’t work. (Watch the video below.) On a Saturday night airing of “King Charles” on CNN, the two watched a clip of Trump bragging about Black supporters who have “embraced” the shirts, which bear Trump’s booking photo in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. “When you heard that, what did you think?” Gayle asked the basketball Hall of Famer. “First of all, I’m just going to say this: If I see a Black person walking around with Trump mugshot, I’m gonna punch him in the face,” Barkley replied. “Charles, you really can’t say that, ’cause, A, you don’t mean that,” King shot back. “Oh, I mean that sincerely,” he said. “And then you will be arrested for assault, and then what?” King said, perhaps still hoping for Barkley to withdraw the remark. “I’m gonna bail myself out and go celebrate,” Barkley responded. When the studio guests laughed, King told them not to encourage her colleague. The clip went viral and has been viewed by more than 7 million people.

It’s hard to miss in the skin care sphere, and is personally one of my favorite, must-have devices. If you’ve been eyeing one of these delightful tools then I have good news for you, because NuFace is having its Friends & Family sale this week, making it the perfect time to splurge on the brand’s award-winning devices and skin care products. Enjoy 25% off sitewide today through March 11— no code at checkout required. If you’re a skin care devotee, having a high-tech skin care device or two in your repertoire is the perfect way to amp up your beauty routine. From LED light masks to lasers and facial toning devices, the addition of a high-quality beauty tool can make quite a difference to a wide range of skin issues, from acne to tone and texture, fine lines, sagging skin, anti-aging and more. Unfortunately, if you want to get a device that actually works, you may have to make a pretty steep financial investment, which is why any time there’s a sale happening, we love to jump on it. The NuFace in particular is a great investment. It’s an FDA-cleared microcurrent device that claims to gently stimulate the face and neck in an effort to tone, lift and contour facial muscles and reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles. You can purchase various additional attachments, like a red light wrinkle reducer and a lip and eye wand, to make it a more versatile, multifunctional tool. It has five different intensity levels, so you can also work your way up if you find it to be a bit too strong at first. Users swear by its effectiveness, and I’ve noticed that nearly a year of regular use has resulted in firmer, tighter and even brighter skin around my face, jawline and neck. Used consistently, the NuFace Trinity can be an excellent complement to even the simplest beauty routine. I like to use it while watching TV — I just throw on the conductive gel and go to town for five to 10 minutes a day. It’s easy to incorporate into your regimen and will stand the test of time, making it worth ever penny. Below, I’ve rounded up a few of NuFace’s most popular items.

The union election held at the Ivy League school in Hanover, New Hampshire, could prove to be historic, but the legal battle over whether the players can bargain collectively is far from over. Dartmouth’s trustees have disputed the athletes’ legal status as employees eligible to unionize. It could be years before the case is resolved at the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees private-sector union elections, and possibly federal court afterwards. “These players are our members and we welcome them warmly.” But for now, the players have made clear they intend to bargain over their working conditions as part of the Service Employees International Union Local 560, the same group that represents cooks, custodians, groundskeepers and other workers on campus. The vote tally was 13-2 in the union’s favor. “These players are our members and we welcome them warmly,” the union’s president, Chris Peck, said in a statement. “We’re all looking forward to standing in solidarity as they begin to negotiate their historic first contract.” Dartmouth said in a statement that it was “proud to build productive relationships” with its unions, but that it doesn’t believe the basketball players are workers. “In this isolated circumstance ... the students on the men’s basketball team are not in any way employed by Dartmouth,” the school said. “For Ivy League students who are varsity athletes, academics are of primary importance, and athletic pursuit is part of the educational experience.” The National Collegiate Athletics Association, the governing body for college sports, has always insisted that college athletes are not employees, despite being the center of a billion-dollar industry. Union campaigns have percolated within the NCAA for years, but until Tuesday none had made it so far as to see the ballots opened following a vote. Football players at Northwestern University in Illinois held an election in 2014, but the labor board impounded the ballots pending the school’s appeal. Members of the board ultimately declined jurisdiction in the case, killing the union effort by punting on the politically explosive question of whether the athletes were really employees. 🏀MAKING HISTORY!🏀 Dartmouth Men's Bball team votes to join SEIU L560—our 500-strong union of campus custodians, security officers, museum guides, and others. @Dartmouth, it’s time to bargain a fair contract.

The school filed a Hail Mary-motion last week trying to either block the election from happening or have the ballots locked up while its legal challenge played out. The labor board did not oblige. But immediately after Tuesday’s vote, the school appealed the decision that allowed for the vote to take place. That puts the issue before the NLRB’s board members in Washington. Due to appointments by President Joe Biden, the labor board now has a Democratic majority that tends to hold a broader, more union-friendly view of collective bargaining rights, with a track record that bodes well for the players and the SEIU. The board also had a Democratic majority when it decided to extinguish the Northwestern union effort, but the political and legal landscape around college sports has changed significantly over the past decade. College players can now profit off their name, image and likeness, while recent polling shows a majority of Americans believe college athletes should be paid directly by their schools. “The labor board now has a Democratic majority that tends to hold a broader, more union-friendly view of collective bargaining rights.” The next four years will change America forever.

Meanwhile, a separate NLRB case revolves around whether football and basketball players at the University of Southern California qualify as employees for the purpose of labor law. The labor board’s general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, argues that the university, the PAC-12 conference and the NCAA have misclassified the players as “student athletes” rather than the employees they are. Abruzzo told HuffPost in a 2021 interview that she believes college athletes are workers under the law. “If players at academic institutions feel like they want to choose a union to represent them in discussions with their employer over wages or working conditions ... then they should be filing [union representation] petitions,” she said.

Michael Luttig slammed the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling allowing Donald Trump to remain on 2024 ballots, calling elements of the decision “stunning in its overreach.” On CNN Monday, Luttig said the ruling was “both astonishing and unprecedented, not for its decision of the exceedingly narrow question presented by the case — though that issue was important — but rather for its decision to reach and decide a myriad of the other constitutional issues surrounding disqualification under 14th Amendment.” Luttig, a former veteran conservative jurist on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, was among a number of prominent legal minds to begin publicly arguing last year that Trump was ineligible to hold office again under the so-called insurrection clause of the Constitution — Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. He filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in January, arguing his point. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that states do not have the authority to bar the former president from appearing on ballots, overturning a Colorado court’s decision to do so. The Supreme Court also ruled that only Congress has the authority to disqualify federal candidates under Section 3. The three liberal justices and conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett disagreed with that decision. In a concurrence, the liberal justices said they protested the “majority’s effort to use this case to define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision.” Barrett, in her own concurrence, wrote that the case did not require the court to decide the “complicated question” of whether federal legislation is the only enforcement mechanism for Section 3. According to Luttig, in deciding those questions unnecessarily, the majority “effectively decided that the former president will never be disqualified from holding the presidency in 2024 or ever for that matter.” He added, “But even more importantly, as the concurrence said, effectively, the court today decided that no person in the future will ever be disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, regardless of whether he or she has engaged in an insurrection or rebellion against the Constitution of the United States.” Listen to his analysis below on CNN’s “The Lead.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

(Watch the video below.) The former president baselessly insinuated last month at CPAC that California balloting is corrupt, but that God could fix that ― and guide him to victory. “If God came down and God was the vote checker, I believe we would win,” said Trump, who lost to Joe Biden by more than 5 million votes in the state in 2020. Not to mention that predominantly Democratic California has not voted for a Republican candidate in a presidential election since 1988. But that was beside the point for Meyers. “I doubt God wants anything to do [with you],” the “Late Night” host told Trump. “If God came down and counted votes, I’m sure you’d accuse him of cheating too.” Meyers then went into his Trump impression. “I find the robe very suspicious, the long flowing robes which he wears even in the summer,” the comedian said in Trump’s voice. “Even in the summer, a robe? You see the videos of him walking into the voting center. The robe is normal. And then he walks out. The robe is bulky. Because he’s hiding ballots under the robe and no one will check the robe because we’re all too woke now.” Fast forward to 2:25 for Meyers’ takedown of Trump’s heavenly hope.

David Franklin Slater, 63, was arrested Saturday after allegedly conspiring to transmit and transmitting classified information about Russia’s war on Ukraine to the unnamed individual over a three-month period in early 2022, which is when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began. “Dear, what is shown on the screens in the special room?? It is very interesting,” one message sent to Slater in March read, according to a copy of the three-count federal indictment. “You have a job in the Operations Center today, I remember, I’m sure there is a lot of interesting news there?” another message read. Slater, dubbed the person’s “Secret informant love” and “secret agent,” became employed in a classified area at the Offutt Air Force Base, south of Omaha, in 2021 after retiring as a lieutenant colonel from the Army the year prior. He was assigned to the United States Strategic Command at the base and attended classified briefings regarding Russia’s war against Ukraine from February to April 2022, according to the indictment. In messages allegedly exchanged between the pair, the individual asked for information about classified briefings and military strategies that could impact Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assault. “Dave, I hope tomorrow NATO will prepare a very unpleasant ‘surprise’ for Putin! Will you tell me?” one message cited in the indictment read. “Sweet Dave, the supply of weapons is completely classified, which is great!” read another. Another message applauded Slater for allegedly sharing information about NATO members’ movement by train before it was announced publicly on the news. “You are my secret informant love! How were your meetings? Successfully?” the message read. Slater, whose initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday, faces up to 10 years in prison for each count of conspiracy to transmit and the transmission of national defense information. He did not have an attorney listed. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tricia-rose-systemic-racism-book_n_65e5fc96e4b013678e163080","Where Is Systemic Anti-Blackness Lurking In 2024?","chaz l. cruz","2024-03-05","During the past few years, discussions about racism and social inequities have swelled, especially in professional settings. The main message: Racism is bad. Let’s shut it down somehow. Yet, we’re not seeing progress. Instead, we’re seeing the implementation of anti-affirmative action laws, the elimination of diversity and equity inclusion positions, and the censorship of books that critically examine racism’s legacy and its insidious nature. Living in this contradictory reality sometimes makes me want to yell, “Computer, end program!” But I’m a gamer, so I stay in the game. What keeps me grounded and focused is that countless individuals share the vision of a more just and safe world — a world where we learn from our collective past and use that knowledge to cultivate systems that uplift — a world where cultural and systemic anti-Blackness is dismantled. Professor Tricia Rose is one of those touchstones who makes me feel hopeful; she’s spent much of her career shedding necessary insight on how to confront pervasive issues directly. In her latest book, “Metaracism: How Systemic Racism Devastated Black Lives — and How We Break Free,” which drops on March 5, she delves fearlessly into the intricate web of institutional anti-Blackness, offering vivid analysis of its impact on all of our lives. By tracing racism’s insidious influence across generations and through various societal institutions, we can better understand how we can arm ourselves against it. Ahead of her book release, I had the honor of chatting with Rose about what she feels are the most potent and pressing issues we, as Black and people of color, face today. Drawing from her extensive research, data analysis, and lived experiences, she provides powerful narratives and strategies for liberation and empowerment. In her work, she invites readers to critically engage with the systems perpetuating inequality, empowering them to become agents for change. What called you to write “Metaracism” at this particular moment in time, and what do you hope readers will take away from it? I started this larger project on systemic racism about eight years ago when I was teaching a class, and I began to realize that there was a lot of confusion around how racism worked. [The students] thought it was all attitudes and behaviors and individual mistreatments. The idea that affirmative action was reverse racism: even the Black kids, white kids, and other ethnic groups felt that way. I realized they didn’t understand what was happening. This is not just about individual values, beliefs, and attitudes. This process is built in such a way that you can be a neutral participant and really make a very negative contribution — you can be a nonconscious participant. So, visuals became important to me. People do not easily see how education and all these details connected to criminal justice and high levels of punishment and policing in and out of schools — they are really complicatedly interconnected over time. So, that’s when I started doing research about how these connections accumulate. And I realized this was much bigger than what I thought it was. What actionable steps or strategies do you suggest for anyone who is empowered to dismantle deeply embedded racism? The chapter at the end of the book focuses on what it takes to break free, and by that, I’m hoping people don’t think, “Oh, we changed this policy; we’ll be good,” or “We changed this approach to education, and it’ll solve it.” Many of us are trapped in a paradigm, and that paradigm includes the myth that racism is not systemic. That myth that society generally works fine, minus the couple of unintended consequences or bad apples or whatever. But when you change your paradigm and you tell stories that show the power of the interconnections and the way they harm Black people specifically, once you start unpacking that paradigm, a new one emerges. That new one means you’re asking different questions, and that’s the beginning of individual and collective change. One part of that argument really resonated with me — specifically where you say, in the book, “Our individual experiences are better understood when they are systemically informed.” I’m glad I said that! We are individuals. We don’t want to say, “I’m Black, I’m Latinx, I’m whatever it is, and this is the only experience I can have.” Many people have many constellations of disadvantages; they are not all the same. And our own individual will, intelligence, opportunity, luck can change things for us, but when we understand ourselves in the bigger picture of how things are systemically arranged, we should be more proud of how well we do and how much we contribute. We should recognize that we know more about the world we are in and what we are subjected to. It is empowering to me to know that. How do you navigate the heaviness of discussing systemic racism while also offering hope that things can potentially change? This is probably one of the most important difficulties that I’ve faced. I think if I try to empathize by exploring and exposing this reality that, it may be temporarily despairing. But if it’s going to continue on, then not knowing about it is actually self-destructive and dangerous. Pretending it’s not going on because you do not want to hear the details — this really diminishes your ability to effectively organize for the kinds of changes that will help the whole world, especially for those who are brown and Black people. For everybody, really. This system is designed to make things more difficult, not for everyone at every moment, but overall. I need to know this if I’m going to do well and if I’m planning to protect people around me. I think that we have muscles for dealing with human suffering — the muscles it takes to deal with human suffering in terms of landslides and genocides, and the Ukraine war, children starving. The world has a lot of suffering in it. But you have to develop the muscles for responding to that in the right way. And you don’t do that by running away. How do you, in this book, speak to non-Black readers or those who may be resistant or defensive readers in these difficult conversations? One of the things I tried to make clear was that Black people are specifically positioned in the ways I described at length, and that doesn’t mean that others are not a part of an oppressive system. But [these struggles] are not identical. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent weeks trying to broker an agreement in which Hamas would release up to 40 hostages in return for a six-week cease-fire, the release of some Palestinian prisoners and an influx of aid to address the humanitarian catastrophe in the isolated territory. Two Egyptian officials said the latest round of discussions had ended. They said Hamas presented a proposal that mediators would discuss with Israel in the coming days. Hamas has refused to release all of the estimated 100 hostages it holds, and the remains of around 30 more, unless Israel ends its offensive, withdraws from Gaza and releases a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants serving life sentences. U.S. officials have said they are skeptical that Hamas actually wants a deal because the group has balked at a number of what the U.S. and others believe are legitimate requests, including giving the names of hostages to be released. “It is on Hamas to make decisions about whether it is prepared to engage,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday. “We have an opportunity for an immediate cease-fire that can bring hostages home, that can dramatically increase the amount of humanitarian aid getting in to Palestinians who so desperately need it, and can set the conditions for an enduring resolution,” Blinken said. Jihad Taha, a Hamas spokesperson, said the negotiations were ongoing but “the ball is in the Israeli court.” He said Israel had thus far refused Hamas’ demands for people who fled northern Gaza to be allowed to return and for guarantees of a long-term cease-fire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. “Hamas is open to proposals and initiatives that are consistent with its position calling for a cease-fire, withdrawal, the return of the displaced, the entry of relief convoys and reconstruction,” Taha said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly rejected Hamas’ demands and repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas is dismantled and all the hostages are returned. Israel did not send a delegation to the latest round of talks. An Israeli official said Israel was still waiting for Hamas to hand over a list of hostages who are alive as well the hostage-to-prisoner ratio it seeks in any release deal. It was not clear if that information was included in the latest proposal. The Israeli and Egyptian officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the negotiations. Benny Gantz, a member of Netanyahu’s War Cabinet and his main political rival, met with senior U.S. officials in Washington on a visit that drew a rebuke from the prime minister, the latest sign of a growing rift within Israel’s leadership. Mediators had hoped to broker an agreement ahead of Ramadan, the month of dawn-to-dusk fasting that often sees heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions linked to access to a major holy site in Jerusalem. The month is expected to begin around March 10, depending on the sighting of the moon. “The negotiations are sensitive. I can’t say there is optimism or pessimism, but we haven’t yet reached a point at which we can achieve a cease-fire,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Monday. The war began with a Hamas attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages. More than 100 of them were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. The attack sparked an Israeli invasion of the enclave of 2.3 million people that Gaza’s Health Ministry says has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians. Aid groups say the fighting has displaced most of the territory’s population and pushed a quarter of the population to the brink of famine. The U.N. children’s agency said Monday that at least 10 children have reportedly died in isolated northern Gaza because of dehydration and malnutrition. “There are likely more children fighting for their lives somewhere in one of Gaza’s few remaining hospitals, and likely even more children in the north unable to obtain care at all,” Adele Khodr, the UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. “These tragic and horrific deaths are man-made, predictable and entirely preventable,” she added. The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that 15 children have starved to death at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza and another six were at risk of dying from malnutrition and dehydration. It was not clear if the children had underlying medical conditions that increased their vulnerability. Northern Gaza, the first target of Israel’s offensive, has suffered mass devastation. The World Food Program recently suspended aid shipments to the north, citing the breakdown of security. An attempt by the Israeli military to bring in aid ended in tragedy last week when over 100 Palestinians were fatally shot by Israeli forces or trampled to death in a melee. Up to 300,000 Palestinians are believed to remain in northern Gaza after Israel ordered the evacuation of the entire region, including Gaza City, in October. Many have been reduced to eating animal fodder to survive. The U.N. says one in six children under 2 in the north suffer from acute malnutrition. The United States and other countries have carried out air drops in recent days, but aid groups say the expensive, last-ditch measure is not enough to address the soaring needs. Israel is still carrying out strikes in all parts of Gaza and has threatened to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, where around half of Gaza’s population has sought refuge. Gantz has said the Rafah operation could begin as soon as Ramadan if there is no deal on the hostages. Gaza’s Health Ministry said 97 people had been killed over the last 24 hours. bringing the overall Palestinian death toll to 30,631. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures, but says women and children make up around two-thirds of the total casualties. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames the high toll on Hamas because the militants operate in dense, residential areas. But the army rarely accounts for individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The next four years will change America forever.

Lindsay Lohan officially confirmed on Monday that the beloved 2003 body-swap comedy is finally getting a sequel. After years of anticipation, Lohan said on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” that she and Jamie Lee Curtis will return. “It is [true],” she told host Andy Cohen. “I don’t want to say too much. And we’re both excited.” Lohan caught herself and cheekily added, “I’m gonna speak for Jamie.” The duo spoke with The New York Times last year to celebrate the film’s 20th anniversary and teased fans with hopes for a sequel. “As I went around the world with ‘Halloween Ends,’ people wanted to know if there was going to be another ‘Freaky Friday,’” Curtis told the outlet. “Something really touched a chord … I called my friends at Disney and said, ‘It feels like there’s a movie to be made.’” Lohan added at the time that they’d “only make something that people would absolutely adore.” While she told People on Monday the sequel is “in the process,” however, a date to start filming remains under wraps. The first film starred Lohan and Curtis as a mother-daughter duo who magically swap bodies, but it wasn’t an original. Based on a 1972 Mary Rodgers novel, it was first adapted in 1976 with Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris and again in 1996 with Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann. The 2003 iteration was the most commercially successful take, however, and grossed more than $160 million at the worldwide box office — and spawned endless fan fever with every hint of a possible sequel in the decades to come.

Lohan, who was once deemed one of the most promising actors of her generation but left the spotlight amid substance abuse struggles, told People that she’s “just excited to work with Jamie again and see how much further we can take” the body-swap premise. The actor’s cinematic return is in full swing, however, with a three-film Netflix deal and surprise cameo in 2024’s musical version of “Mean Girls.” The newfound mother might just find her real comeback with “Freaky Friday 2.” “I think we’re going to have a lot of fun with this,” she told People.

Show a little restraint when you win. Show a little restraint when you don’t win.” Fox News host Trey Gowdy says Trump should exhibit some ""humility"" on the SCOTUS ballot ruling because it's very likely the court will also overwhelmingly rule against him on presidential immunity.""It's confusing when you say 'I love you' on one day and 'I hate you' the next."" pic.twitter.com/5Gg11O6Xn3 The U.S. Supreme Court’s Monday ruling ended an effort in several states to remove Trump from ballots over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection under the so-called insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that states do not have the authority to disqualify candidates for federal office under that clause. Trump called the decision a “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” Later, in remarks from his Mar-a-Lago estate, he urged the Supreme Court to rule in his favor on his claims of presidential immunity.

If they’re not allowed to do their job, it’s not what the founders wanted, but perhaps even more importantly it will be terrible for the country.” Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to rule on Trump’s claims that he is immune from prosecution for his actions as president, scheduling oral arguments for April 22.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-witness-fani-willis-disqualification-hearing_n_65e70046e4b0f9d26cac5c70","Trump Co-Defendant Offers New Witness To Testify In Effort To Remove Willis","marita vlachou","2024-03-05","Attorneys for one of the co-defendants of former President Donald Trump in the Georgia 2020 election interference case on Monday said a new witness could testify on the timeline of the relationship between Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and a top prosecutor she hired to work on the case, according to new court documents. While Willis admitted to having a relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as one of the three special prosecutors in the case in November 2021, she said the romance didn’t start until the spring of 2022. Both testified their relationship ended last summer. David Shafer, a defendant in the case, has contested the testimony by Willis and Wade about when they started dating. In a court filing submitted Monday, Shafer’s lawyers Craig Gillen and Holly Pierson requested to subpoena Cindi Lee Yeager, a co-chief deputy district attorney for Cobb County, Georgia, for testimony if Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee grants a request to reopen hearings into the potential disqualification of Willis. Gillen and Pierson claim Yeager could testify that lawyer Terrance Bradley, who has previously appeared before the court, told her Willis and Wade “definitely” started dating when Willis was running for the district attorney’s office in 2019 through 2020. Bradley has already testified before McAfee, but said he was “speculating” when defense attorneys brought up a text he sent them stating he believed Wade and Willis had been dating since she was municipal court judge. Shafer’s attorneys added that Yeager could also provide testimony on a conversation she allegedly heard take place between Willis and Bradley when he visited her office around September 2023. Willis, according to the court documents, called Bradley to discuss an article in the press about how much Wade was being paid for his work on the Fulton County probe. “They are coming after us,” Willis allegedly told Bradley. “You don’t need to talk to them about anything about us.” Shafer’s lawyers added that Yeager became “concerned” over the inconsistencies she spotted in Bradley’s testimony. It’s unclear if this will have an impact on how McAfee will rule. The judge said Friday he would issue a decision on whether Willis should be disqualified within the next two weeks. “I think it’s been very much made clear by the argument made today that there are several legal issues to sort through, several factual determinations I have to make, and those aren’t ones I can make at this moment,” he said. Willis’ office has not commented on the allegations included in Monday’s filing, but the Fulton County district attorney has previously fiercely defended herself against accusations of wrongdoing. “I’m not on trial no matter how hard you try to put me on trial,” she told defense attorneys in a hearing last month.

The “Shark Tank” star’s remark went viral on X, formerly Twitter, amid nagging concerns about Biden’s age — even though he is just four years older than his likely opponent, Donald Trump. While Trump is getting flak for his recent verbal stumbles, confidence in the incumbent has reportedly waned. According to a New York Times poll of 980 registered voters published Sunday, more than 60% of the voters who backed Biden in 2020 now believe he’s “just too old” to govern effectively. Cuban, the co-founder of Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs, was at the White House to advocate for lower prescription drug prices. The billionaire businessman told Bloomberg he was voting for Nikki Haley in Tuesday’s Texas Republican primary as a “protest vote against Trump.” Cuban buttressed his support for Biden by riffing on Elon Musk’s X post joking that Cuban would vote for the president if he were a flesh-eating zombie.

The fact that his Netflix film “They Cloned Tyrone” premiered in June certainly didn’t help. Foxx himself previously touched on the rampant speculation and joked in December: “I know a lot of people been saying I was cloned out there.

Here's What It Did To My Grief.","diana weisman","2024-03-05","Artificial intelligence is widely believed to be the next frontier — an uncharted future, primed for exploration and new life — but since learning about ChatGPT, I can only think about the after-life. Will the way we view death transform with technology? It’s a question I’ve been asking myself for over 10 years. My recognition of a new type of graveyard began when I was a teenager and I understood a young person’s death meant they left behind more than just family or belongings — it also meant Facebook pages with entire personalities frozen in time. A profile of a deceased classmate would hold 300+ photos of a night buying slurpees at 7-Eleven, a badge proclaiming they “liked” baby sloths, and comments from friends saying they’d see them tomorrow. We were part of generation “me,” which made the sudden absence of “them” feel even more haunting in the digital realm. At that time, Facebook was also not prepared for the fact that its “friends” would die and their profiles would remain. After users started to get notifications to “add” their dead loved ones, the company made updates to its profile settings and created a process by which users could be allowed to control a deceased connection’s “digital legacy.” An explainer video on Facebook reads: “We live in a digital world, what happens when we leave it behind?” When my dad left his behind in 2019, I couldn’t bear to visit his Facebook page, but knowing it existed made it hard to avoid. There were too many comments left from people I didn’t know, all of whom proclaimed to love my Dad. It felt like a virtual tombstone that my family did not create. I didn’t know what was worse — the heartfelt messages from strangers or knowing that he’d never respond. I investigated how to get the page taken down so I wouldn’t be tempted to look at it again, but gave up filling out the online form required to do so when Facebook asked me to provide a death certificate. I thought, You want me to throw my dad’s death certificate into my at-home scanner to prove you should delete his page? I guess it’s probably a fair ask when I think about it now. One might wonder then, after years of avoiding his digital poltergeist, why I’d be hoping to get ChatGPT to speak like my dad. The concept came to me around the time of my wedding, when I contemplated revealing to our guests my life’s biggest regret: that my husband and dad had not gotten a chance to meet. I wanted to admit my failing to bring them together in my vows as a sort of public, emotional self-lashing, but that would have been a total downer. Having been exposed to ChatGPT in my work, I saw AI as my out. If I could train the bot to follow the speech patterns of my father, maybe he and my husband might finally be able to have a conversation. I knew this task would be challenging, as ChatGPT requires very specific prompts to produce optimal results. I would need to provide the bot with a full profile of my dad’s speaking characteristics for it to copy, and maybe even feed it past examples from our text conversations. For added flair, I could ask the bot to interrupt every now and then with a cough, as my dad frequently did from smoking cigarettes all his life. After working out lines of basic descriptions, like his age and the amount of words with which he would usually respond, I realized how difficult the rest of this process was going to be. Chats with my dad were often extremely random and I’d usually walk away from them wondering what it was we were even talking about. This was not because he didn’t know how to have a discussion, but because he was likely thinking of numerous things at once. As a documentary producer who worked in his field for 40 years, my dad was very creative and could make any conversation into a story. You could argue he was always producing your very interaction. He might begin singing lyrics to a song you didn’t know or drop names of people you’ve never met and then it was over. That was him. You never knew what you would get. So, could I get a bot to be him? The more I tried, the more my excitement waned. I spent hours researching the proper prompts and wrote long soliloquies dissecting my father’s persona. But every time the bot offered a response that sounded nothing like my dad — like when it called me a “youngster,” I could see the mask slip. In the midst of this private experiment, I began working with a creative who goes by Shxpir (pronounced Shakespeare). Even before we met, I knew we would have a lot in common, but I didn’t think we’d both be thinking about death. As we got to talking on the set of an ad campaign, he revealed he also had lost his father and was using tech to work through those emotions. In contrast to my guilt, his stemmed from a lack of having ample photographs of his father. He told me he’d been feeling his dad’s physicality in this world slipping from his memory with each passing day. Now, he’s working to render his father virtually, and in 3D, from the images he does have. His project will be completed in a few months and it will allow him to create new images of his father from every angle. In awe of his dedication, I asked Shxpir how he finds the strength to continue the project, as I continuously stumble over emotional roadblocks — memories, pain, the occasional cry — that keep me from trying again. “Sometimes I don’t know if I can handle it,” he admitted to me. Back in 2021, Shxpir began working on a proposal for a business that would recreate deceased loved ones digitally and is now actively working on his own Metaverse funeral for whenever he’s no longer on this planet. With a deep understanding of art and years of digital rendering experience, Shxpir knew that the business of death and mourning, like that of fashion and cosmetics, could be thrust into the digital space at any moment. Although it’s become more of a side project, rendering his dad has remained an important mission for him. “At the end of the day,” he told me with a resolve I could feel through the phone, “as an artist, it’s an experiment for my personal growth.” After some time, I stopped my experiment with ChatGPT and logged into an AI video generator for the first time. I typed “older man talking on the phone” into the generator bar and waited to see what it would return to me. For a long time, I wanted to create art about a vivid dream I had after my dad died. I even sought advice from a dream analyst to help interpret it. In the dream, I was on the phone with my dad and I suddenly realized his voice started to sound different, as if someone had been impersonating him the whole time. It felt so horrifyingly vivid, I woke up thinking I should call my dad and make sure he was OK. After the AI digested my prompt, a face appeared on the screen: a brunette older man, slightly balding, wearing large glasses and hunched over a desk while talking on the phone. I was surprised. Wow, there he is, I thought. He had about four extra fingers, a feature AI tends to trip up on, but he looked a lot like my dad. I went on from there, creating small one-second video scenes using the AI, until I had compiled a full visual retelling of my dream. The process of acquiring the “footage” felt strangely peaceful in its impassiveness. The AI did not ask why I wanted to create this rendering, it just provided scenes in response to my prompts. I added words and phrases like “film noir style” to get a darker effect. I could calmly say “try again” if it did not give me the render I wanted. The graphics it output looked human, but also alien — part dream, part nightmare. The shapes of people were not fully formed. The colors moved on the screen like ink in water. I thought one of the brunette women it rendered looked like me too. I finished the piece by adding my own audio narration and titled it “The Call.” After watching the final product, tears flowed from the bottomless pit that is the well of grief. But I also breathed a sigh of relief. Communicating with AI — creating this piece — gave me a sense of closure I hadn’t felt before. Still, I wondered if this whole process was healthy, or if I had just fallen for an illusion of feeling understood. I reached out to my friend and colleague Marni Blank for her perspective. Marni is a death doula — a person who guides people through the end-of-life process — for either themselves or a loved one. Her response to my project made me feel better. “Some people need to go through the stage of revisiting memories of the person or photos, over and over again — or some people need distance,” she told me. “I think it’s just about what that person needs at that moment.” Social media has also reprogrammed our brains to want to keep a white-knuckled grasp on our memories. “We live in an age where it’s really hard to let go of anything,” Marni said. “Pre-Instagram, you could completely forget someone you broke up with existed.” When I asked her if she would seek to have her social media accounts deleted after she passed, she sounded surprised by my question. “I think I’d want to leave it up to the people who are grieving ... I think to myself, who is going to be affected? Because it won’t be me.” My thoughts snagged on her words — her focus on “the people who are grieving.” That was me. I had only been focused on my dad, and how he could be real again. I thought AI was the answer, but it proved to be a mirror. Months after my ChatGPT experiment, I realized that my struggle with the AI bot was not that it could not “be” my dad. It was the deep sadness that came with facing the truth that he would never again be able to do something new — a new thought, a new conversation — like one I’d hoped he would have had with my husband. Only when I, myself, sought to create something new, like “The Call,” did AI truly give something valuable back to me. There’s irony in the fact that my nightmare of my dad’s voice not really being his voice was so similar to what I was experiencing while attempting to give AI his personality. I think back to Shxpir and his quest for “personal growth” and how I hadn’t realized he’d given me the answer I had been searching for all along. The next four years will change America forever.

Though I thought AI would be a fitting match for powerful emotions like sorrow and grief, which seem to transcend the physical world, it turns out AI’s power may be providing pathways to better understanding ourselves. Technology will never be able to replace the strength we need to go deep inside ourselves and make something of our darkest sorrows. The will to keep moving forward with our grief in tow will never be rendered for us by machines. While so many of us are trying to decipher how AI will play a role in our lives, we must seek to keep ourselves at the center of that search. Because the scariest thing about AI might be realizing that it can’t do it all — especially when it comes to curing the pain of losing someone real.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-potential-endorsement_n_65e715f0e4b0170871fbb4dd","Mitch McConnell Weighs Endorsing Donald Trump In Potential Stark Turnaround","lisa mascaro","2024-03-05","WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate leader Mitch McConnell is the highest-ranking Republican in Congress who has yet to endorse Donald Trump’s bid to return to the White House — having once called the defeated president “morally responsible” for the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack. But that’s potentially about to change. McConnell’s political team and Trump’s campaign have been in talks over not only a possible endorsement of the former president but a strategy to unite Republicans up and down the party’s ticket ahead of the November election, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. How, when or where McConnell would endorse Trump is less head-spinning than the idea that it could happen at all: A stunning rapprochement for two men who have not spoken since McConnell enraged Trump by declaring Joe Biden the legitimate winner of the 2020 presidential election. But a fast-moving series of events ahead of Super Tuesday’s elections have been set in motion by McConnell’s own sudden announcement he would step down as leader next session and as Trump is on track to move closer toward the GOP nomination. Taken together, it lays bare the lengths that McConnell, the longest-serving Senate leader and an ever calculating politician, will go as he works to win back Republican control of the Senate in what could be among his final acts in power. “I still have enough gas in the tank to thoroughly disappoint my critics, and I intend to do so with all the enthusiasm which they have become accustomed,” McConnell said last week in announcing his decision to step aside as leader for the next session. Not long ago, it appeared Trump would have few fans politically lining up behind his bid to return to the White House, particularly from the halls of Congress. In the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, key Republicans, including McConnell, signaled unequivocally they were done with Trump. In a scathing speech during the Senate impeachment trial on charges Trump incited the insurrection at the Capitol, McConnell decried Trump’s intemperate language and the “entire manufactured atmosphere of looming catastrophe” and “wild myths” about a stolen election. “The leader of the free world cannot spend weeks thundering that shadowy forces are stealing our country and then feign surprise when people believe him and do reckless things,” said McConnell after the mob siege. Still, McConnell declined to vote to convict Trump of the impeachment charges in the Senate trial, saying it was for the courts to decide, since the defeated president by then was out of office. “He didn’t get away with anything yet,” McConnell said in the February 2021 speech. Trump is now charged in several cases including a federal indictment of conspiring to defraud the U.S. and obstruct an official proceeding related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by supporters trying to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election. Trump has appealed claiming immunity. The first sign that McConnell was leaving the door open to reuniting with Trump came in early 2023 when he was asked about Trump’s potential return to the presidential campaign. At the time, McConnell suggested he would support the Republican Party’s eventual nominee, declining to name names or mention Trump. But endorsements matter to Trump, who has assigned key campaign staff in charge of roping in support from elected officials in what has become a two-way political street. The GOP leaders are also relying on Trump to support — or at least not attack — their own nominees for the House and Senate. As McConnell is weighing his decision to endorse Trump despite his concerns over Jan. 6, he is watching core Republican voters flock to the former president. And he is wary of being the one to try to stand in their way. It’s not just McConnell but the other Republican leaders on Capitol Hill who have all quickly fallen in line as Trump emerges ever so close to again becoming the party’s nominee at the top of their party ticket this November. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson traveled to Mar-a-Lago last month to meet with Trump at his private club about House races as the new speaker works to keep his slim GOP House majority. The other House Republican leaders endorsed Trump as the former president’s team pushed for backing ahead of the Iowa, New Hampshire and other early contests. Senate Republican leaders did the same. And Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, the chairman of the Senate GOP campaign arm who is a friend, hunting and fishing partner to the president’s oldest son, Don Trump, Jr., had told others as far back as 2022 he hoped Trump would run again. He became the first member of Senate GOP leadership to endorse him. When Daines traveled to Mar-a-Lago for his own visit in February 2023, he told Trump the most important thing he could do for Trump was deliver a Senate majority to confirm Cabinet nominees and approve conservative policies, according to another person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. Daines remains close to Trump, and the two speak often, the person said. “I’m encouraging the Republican Party to unite behind President Trump,” Daines said in a recent statement to the media, including AP. McConnell’s past political distaste for Trump appears to be no match for the GOP leader’s desire to win back a Senate majority for Republicans one more time as he prepares to exit the leadership stage. The two have traded harsh words since even before McConnell’s 2021 speech, with Trump deriding the now 82-year-old as an “Old Crow.” But in recent weeks Trump has refrained from name-calling McConnell, or using racial slurs against McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, the former Trump Transportation Secretary, who resigned in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack.

Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on Monday held a meeting with former President Donald Trump as he is reportedly mulling entering the race to succeed Mitch McConnell (Ky.) as GOP Senate leader. McConnell, 82 last week announced his decision to leave the post in November, putting an end date to his tenure as the longest-serving Senate leader in history. Scott posted a photo with Trump Monday on X, formerly Twitter, writing it was “great” to meet the former president. “We’re going to continue working together to win big in 2024 and fix Washington,” Scott wrote.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/haiti-violence_n_65e6fe9ee4b0f9d26cac5a08","Gangs In Haiti Try To Seize Control Of Main Airport In Newest Attack On Government Sites","evens sanon , pierre-richard luxama","2024-03-05","PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Heavily armed gangs tried to seize control of Haiti’s main international airport on Monday, exchanging gunfire with police and soldiers in the latest attack on key government sites in an explosion of violence that includes a mass escape from the country’s two biggest prisons. The Toussaint Louverture International Airport was closed when the attack occurred, with no planes operating and no passengers on site. Associated Press journalists saw an armored truck on the tarmac shooting at gangs to try and prevent them from entering airport grounds as scores of employees and other workers fled from whizzing bullets. It wasn’t immediately clear as of late Monday whether the attack, which was the biggest one in Haiti’s history involving the airport, was successful. Last week, the airport was struck briefly by bullets amid ongoing gang attacks, but gangs did not enter the airport nor seize control of it. The attack occurred just hours after authorities in Haiti ordered a nighttime curfew following violence in which armed gang members overran the two biggest prisons and freed thousands of inmates over the weekend. “The secretary-general is deeply concerned by the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Port-au-Prince, where armed gangs have intensified their attacks on critical infrastructure over the weekend,” said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. A 72-hour state of emergency began Sunday night. The government said it would try to track down the escaped inmates, including from a penitentiary were the vast majority were in pre-trial detention, with some accused of slayings, kidnappings and other crimes. “The police were ordered to use all legal means at their disposal to enforce the curfew and apprehend all offenders,” said a statement from Finance Minister Patrick Boivert, the acting prime minister. Gangs already were estimated to control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince, the capital. They are increasingly coordinating their actions and choosing once unthinkable targets like the Central Bank. Prime Minister Ariel Henry traveled to Kenya last week to try to salvage support for a United Nations-backed security force to help stabilize Haiti in its conflict with the increasingly powerful crime groups. Dujarric said the secretary-general stressed the need for urgent action, especially in providing financial support for the mission, “to address the pressing security requirements of the Haitian people and prevent the country from plunging further into chaos.” Haiti’s National Police has roughly 9,000 officers to provide security for more than 11 million people, according to the U.N. They are routinely overwhelmed and outgunned. The deadly weekend marked a new low in Haiti’s downward spiral of violence. At least nine people had been killed since Thursday — four of them police officers — as gangs stepped up coordinated attacks on state institutions in Port-au-Prince, including the international airport and national soccer stadium. But the attack on the National Penitentiary late Saturday shocked Haitians. All but 98 of the 3,798 inmates being held at the penitentiary escaped, according to the Office of Citizen Protection. Meanwhile, at the Croix-des-Bouquets prison, 1,033 escaped, including 298 convicts. The office said late Monday that it was seriously concerned about the safety of judges, prosecutors, victims, attorneys and others following the mass escape. It added that it “deplored and condemned the policy of nonchalance” demonstrated by government officials amid the attacks. Following the raid at the penitentiary, three bodies with gunshot wounds lay at the prison entrance Sunday. In another neighborhood, the bloodied corpses of two men with their hands tied behind the backs lay face down as residents walked past roadblocks set up with burning tires. Among the few dozen people who chose to stay in prison are 18 former Colombian soldiers accused of working as mercenaries in the July 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse. “Please, please help us,” one of the men, Francisco Uribe, said in a message widely shared on social media. “They are massacring people indiscriminately inside the cells.” Colombia’s foreign ministry has called on Haiti to provide “special protection” for the men. A second Port-au-Prince prison containing around 1,400 inmates also was overrun. Gunfire was reported in several neighborhoods in the capital. Internet service for many residents was down on Sunday as Haiti’s top mobile network said a fiber optic cable connection was slashed during the rampage. After gangs opened fire at Haiti’s international airport last week, the U.S. Embassy said it was halting all official travel to the country. On Sunday night, it urged all American citizens to depart as soon as possible. The Biden administration, which has refused to commit troops to any multinational force for Haiti while offering money and logistical support, said it was monitoring the rapidly deteriorating security situation with grave concern. The surge in attacks follows violent protests that turned deadlier in recent days as the prime minister went to Kenya seeking to move ahead on the proposed U.N.-backed security mission to be led by that East African country. Henry took over as prime minister following Moise’s assassination and has postponed plans to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, which haven’t happened in almost a decade. Jimmy Chérizier, a former elite police officer known as Barbecue who now runs a gang federation, has claimed responsibility for the surge in attacks. He said the goal is to capture Haiti’s police chief and government ministers and prevent Henry’s return. The prime minister has shrugged off calls for him to resign and didn’t comment when asked if he felt it was safe to come home. ___ Associated Press writers Joshua Goodman in Miami and Dánica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He’s like, ‘I really wanna zig-a-zag-ahhh,’” Fallon quipped on “The Tonight Show” on Monday. “It sounds like his brain got a flat.” “To make it seem like he meant to say that, they made it his new campaign slogan,” he added.

The real action will be farther down the ballot. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will continue their steady marches toward their party’s nominations when states including Alabama, Colorado, California, North Carolina, Utah and Vermont head to the polls. (Also in the mix: American Samoa, the one territory that Michael Bloomberg managed to win during the former New York mayor’s doomed 2020 quest for the Democratic presidential nomination.) Biden faces only nominal opposition from Rep. Dean Phillips, whose home state of Minnesota votes today. Biden’s so far won all 206 Democratic delegates up for grabs. Trump, meanwhile, still faces a challenge from former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. Trump has amassed 244 delegates to Haley’s 43, nearly half of which she won in last weekend’s GOP primary in Washington, D.C. But though Trump is expected to collect the roughly 1,200 delegates he needs to clinch the Republican nomination before the end of the month, Haley might do unexpectedly well in states like Vermont and Utah that have either open primaries where Democrats can vote for her or more moderate GOP bases that may reject Trump. Haley might need only a few victories to prolong Trump’s pursuit of the nomination, precious days and weeks putting him and the Republican National Committee further behind Biden and the Democratic National Committee in fundraising. Haley has only committed to staying in the race through Super Tuesday, so it’s not entirely out of the question the former South Carolina governor might suspend her campaign following Tuesday’s elections, at which point it’s not clear whether she might walk back her attacks on the former president and endorse him. The make-or-break races, however, will be in critical House, Senate and gubernatorial primaries, including the massive intra-party brawl among Texas Republicans; a fight to determine whether progressives have a shot at succeeding the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein in California; indications of how Israel’s war in Gaza is playing in Democratic primaries; and a race in which a Trump-backed conspiracy theorist is favored to win the GOP nomination for governor. Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a conspiracy theorist who has claimed that Beyoncé is “satanic,” the 1969 moon landing may have been fake and there is a ruling class of secretive reptiles, is on track to win the Republican nomination for governor in North Carolina. Robinson, who has been endorsed by Trump, is poised to take on Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein. The current governor, Democrat Roy Cooper, is term-limited out. Even when compared to recent extreme GOP nominees, Robinson’s record of sexism, homophobia and Islamophobia is particularly ugly. He’s mocked kids who survived school shootings as “immature media prosti-tots” for advocating gun safety reforms. He’s claimed that homosexuality leads to pedophilia. He’s referred to former first lady Michelle Obama as a man. Despite all of that, Robinson has risen politically for one reason: He’s fashioned himself in the mold of Trump. They have endorsed each other, and last weekend, Trump attended a rally with Robinson and declared that he is “Martin Luther King on steroids.” Of course, Robinson has insulted King in the past, too. He said the civil rights leader was an “ersatz pastor” and a “communist” and that the 1960s civil rights movement was “crap.” North Carolina will have the biggest and most expensive governor’s race nationwide. It’s a crucial swing state in the presidential election, and of the 11 gubernatorial elections this year, just two are in swing states: North Carolina and New Hampshire. Beyond that, if Robinson wins in November, the GOP will have total control of the state’s government. At least one local political analyst previously speculated to HuffPost that Robinson’s extremism will backfire on him in the November election. “We have seen ever since the elevation of Trump, Republican primary voters, again and again, time and time and time again, choosing the candidate who makes an awful general election candidate in a purple state,” said Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “My presumption is Mark Robinson will fall right into this pattern.” Centrist Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff is almost certain to nab the leading spot in California’s top-two “jungle” primary contest for the open seat previously held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, but all eyes will be on progressive Rep. Katie Porter and her bid to secure second place over the Republican candidate in the race, former baseball player Steve Garvey. Porter, who rose to prominence in Congress for grilling fossil fuel industry and Wall Street CEOs, has faced a multimillion-dollar barrage of television advertising funded by wealthy donors who are seeking to deny her a spot in the runoff. Separately, Schiff’s campaign has spent heavily to elevate Garvey in conservative media in hopes of boosting his appeal and ensuring that Schiff faces an easily beatable Republican candidate in California, a Democratic stronghold, instead of Porter. Polls have found Porter struggling to keep even with Garvey for second place in the race even though his campaign has barely spent any money of his own on advertising. Meanwhile, Rep. Barbara Lee, the other major progressive candidate in the race, trails in third place, splitting the left in yet another advantage for Schiff’s establishment-backed campaign. U.S. Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas) is facing off against Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez for the Democratic nomination to run against one of the most polarizing Republicans in Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz came close to losing to his Democratic challenger, Beto O’Rourke, in 2018 and remains unpopular in Texas. Allred is a mild-mannered former NFL player who has boasted a fundraising and polling advantage since announcing his candidacy last year. Gutierrez’s district includes Uvalde, site of a horrific elementary school massacre in May 2022, and he has pushed for stricter gun control as a state legislator and an unapologetic progressive. During a debate in January, Allred defended his moderate voting record, including his support for a symbolic resolution condemning President Joe Biden’s handling of immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. “I’ve built broad coalitions in my campaigns,” Allred said. “That’s how you win tough races.” There are seven other candidates in the race, and the winner needs 50%, so the biggest question may be whether Allred can win outright or will wind up in a runoff against Gutierrez, who should do well among the state’s large Latino population. Everyone knew that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee would be spending big money in Democratic primaries this year, but the mammoth pro-Israel group’s decision to make California state Sen. Dave Min its first target of the cycle has puzzled observers across the spectrum. Min, who is competing against attorney Joanna Weiss, also a Democrat, for the chance to succeed Rep. Katie Porter in California’s 47th Congressional District, has not called for a cease-fire in Israel or for restricting U.S. aid to Israel. But AIPAC’s super PAC, the United Democracy Project, has still spent $4.7 million on ads blasting Min. The TV, digital and direct-mail campaign has cast Min as a general-election liability against a likely Republican opponent due to his arrest in May for driving under the influence of alcohol. Min maintains that AIPAC is trying to beat him because he, like Biden, has been critical of Israel’s expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank. “Maybe AIPAC wants a rubber stamp. I’m not going to be a rubber stamp,” Min told Semafor. Min, a former banking law professor who is the sole Korean American in the state legislature, has the support of Porter; Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.); the AAPI Victory Fund, which supports Asian American and Pacific Islander candidates; organized labor; and many of his fellow state lawmakers. But Weiss, who founded a local Democratic club, has an outside money advantage. Two super PACs affiliated with EMILY’s List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, have spent nearly $1 million on her bid. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is backing primary challenges against 10 of the Texas state House Republicans who voted against the creation of a private school voucher program, helping to kill the proposal. School vouchers have long been a white whale in Texas, one of the only Southern states that does not already have such a program. The overwhelmingly right-wing proponents of vouchers, who insist that they give parents mobility when a local school isn’t cutting it, have blamed the mostly rural Texas Republicans opposed to the program for being too close to teachers unions. In reality, those lawmakers say they oppose the voucher plan for fear it would deplete enrollment at rural schools with little room to lose funding. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) is backing his own slate of primary candidates against House Republicans who voted to impeach him on corruption charges in May, and he has endorsed several who stood by his side as the state Senate acquitted him. Paxton’s efforts have less money behind them, but in at least one case, they conflict with Abbott’s preference. Paxton is supporting state Rep. Travis Clarty, a rural Republican opposed to vouchers, while Abbott has endorsed a pro-voucher challenger against Clarty. The cryptocurrency industry, which profits from investment in digital forms of money, is putting a lot of actual dollars in the hat to avoid the kind of federal regulation that might affect profits as it faces intense scrutiny. In the California Senate primary, Fairshake, a super PAC funded by leading crypto players, including Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, has spent more than $10 million trying to sink Porter, a proponent of stricter banking rules and protégé of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Protect Progress, a separate super PAC with a nearly identical list of donors, has spent $1.7 million to support Shomari Figures, a former Biden and Obama administration official running on Tuesday in a competitive Democratic primary in Alabama’s newly redrawn 2nd Congressional District. In October, a federal court ordered the creation of Alabama’s 2nd, where the voting-age population is nearly half Black, after finding that the previous districts had suppressed Black political power. Figures’ strongest Democratic rivals are state Reps. Anthony Daniels and Napoleon Bracy. Should no Democrat get an outright majority on Tuesday, there will be a runoff on April 2. Democrats are strongly favored to pick up the seat in November. And in Texas, Protect Progress has spent nearly $1 million in support of state Rep. Julie Johnson, who is running to succeed Rep. Colin Allred, a Senate candidate, in a district representing a large share of Dallas and its suburbs. Johnson is running against Dr. Brian Williams, a trauma surgeon and former Air Force officer. Immigration is consistently the top issue for GOP voters in public polling, and a primary for a U.S. House district along the U.S.-Mexico border will test whether Republicans are willing to make a statement on the border crisis using one of their own. GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales is facing four primary challengers who argue he’s out of step with the MAGA wing of the party on a host of issues, including border security, marriage equality and gun rights. Texas’ 23rd Congressional District, which stretches along the southern border in western Texas from El Paso to San Antonio, contains the city of Uvalde, site of the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School, where a gunman killed 17 children and two teachers. In the wake of the massacre, Gonzales supported stricter gun safety rules, a move that earned him a censure from the Texas Republican Party and other grassroots groups. And challengers including local GOP activists and a retired U.S. Border Patrol agent soon lined up to take out the incumbent representative, arguing he isn’t tough enough on the border at a time when the country is seeing a deluge of migrant crossings. Gonzales, who came into office in 2020 after a close race against Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, downplayed his chances of losing the party’s nomination in the primary. “Anybody who wishes to challenge me — it’s a fool’s errand. I’ll run you into the deep end of the pool every single time and drown you. So, I welcome it,” he said. California’s 22nd Congressional District, located in the state’s agricultural Central Valley, has long frustrated Democrats. In majority Latino district where Democrats have a massive registration advantage, low turnout has meant Republican Rep. David Valadao has won five of the last six congressional races. This cycle, the party looked to have an even worse problem: It was possible neither of the two Democrats running for the seat ― former state Rep. Rudy Salas and state Sen. Melissa Hurtado ― would advance in the state’s top-two primary system. Though Valadao was a lock to advance, his support for Trump’s impeachment would generate just enough intra-party opposition for another Republican to qualify instead. The problem set off a round of backbiting within the party, with Democrats grumbling about EMILY’s List working to recruit Hurtado, whom they ultimately never endorsed. National Democrats, who prefer Salas as their candidate, have spent $1.3 million to back Salas, and newer rounds of data show the chances of a lockout fading. Still, it’s $1 million the party would prefer not to spend this far from November. The next four years will change America forever.

Over the years, she’s developed a reputation as a leading progressive and member of the Congressional Black Caucus ― and for churning through staff at record levels. Her treatment of staff member helped doom her run for Houston mayor last year. Now she’s trying to hold on to her House seat representing a majority-Black district surrounding Houston against a challenge from former Houston City Councilwoman Amanda Edwards, 42, who began running while Jackson Lee was still campaigning to be mayor. The race against the 74-year-old Jackson Lee has been an old-fashioned generational showdown.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/massage-gun-neck_l_65e5e229e4b0d2a2475a39c9","Why You Should Never, Ever Use A Massage Gun On Your Neck","leigh weingus","2024-03-05","Massage guns have surged in popularity in recent years, and for good reason: They actually work. According to a 2023 systematic review, massage guns can help improve short-term range of motion, flexibility and recovery. This likely comes as good news to anyone who deals with a lot of muscle stiffness. “I used to think they were just gimmicky things that might feel good in the moment but were not that useful,” admitted physical therapist Ingrid Anderson, founder of Intown Physical Therapy in Atlanta, Georgia. “Now, I believe they have a place for pain relief and treating certain conditions.” But before you whip out that massage gun, are there any parts of the body where a massage gun will do more harm than good? The answer is yes. If you’re one of the 30-50% of adults in the U.S. who suffer from chronic neck pain, please don’t use your massage gun regularly to remedy it. According to Anderson, you’ll want to stay away from any bony area of your body when using the machine ― and your neck is very bony. If you use it on areas with lots of muscles, like your shoulders or the back part of your neck, that’s a safer bet. “I don’t recommend using a massage gun on your neck,” she said. “While necks have lots of muscles, there are many superficial bony prominences and superficial nerves, neither of which like being pounded with a massage gun.” The neck is composed of sensitive areas and vital blood flow that connect to the brain, making using a massage gun on it a not-so-great idea, said Kevin Lees, a chiropractor in Arizona. “Some areas of muscle have receptors that help with balance. If these receptors are overstimulated or damaged, they can cause nausea and dizziness,” he said. “Pressure from a massage gun may cause soft tissue damage and possibly vascular damage.” Perhaps you’ve also seen the viral TikTok where one user warned viewers about the dangers of using the tool on your neck after she experienced problems herself. As Health reported, putting the tool on your neck ― which helps with blood flow to the brain ― may also lead to rare but serious injury if you’re not careful. Ryan Krzyzanowicz, a clinical associate professor and program director of the Master of Science in Athletic Training program at the University at Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions, told the outlet that “you do not want to use percussive therapy (a massage gun) over an artery.” “In the neck we get worried with blood flow to the brain, and in theory, percussion could temporarily starve the brain from blood flow, causing mini-stroke or stroke-like symptoms,” Krzyzanowicz continued. Again, this is more rare, but still a risk to consider. If your neck is really bothering you, turn to the pros. “If you are experiencing neck pain, it’s best to see your doctor to determine the underlying cause. If massage is the solution, have a professional work on the affected muscles,” Lees told HuffPost. Neck pain is a pain in the neck (sorry, we had to), and it’s clear that a massage gun isn’t the solution. So what is? First, get to the source of the neck pain. “Neck pain can be caused by a variety of things. Some of the most common are poor posture, stress and poor sleeping positions,” Lees said. “While a massage gun may help with some of the symptoms, addressing the underlying condition is the only way to prevent the problem from recurring. Poor posture can be due to the ergonomics of a workstation, or a muscle imbalance that causes hunching of the upper back. Sleeping awkwardly with an improper pillow or stomach sleeping may also cause neck pain.” The best way to relieve neck pain, Anderson said, is to stop doing the things that cause it. “This includes a good work-station setup, not craning your neck forward while working, and, most importantly, lots of breaks. Data show that a 20-second movement break every 20 minutes goes a long way towards preventing neck pain,” she said. Once you have a stiff and sore neck, Anderson added, the best things you can do at home are heat or cold (whichever feels good!), topical pain relievers such as lidocaine patches or pain-relieving creams and movement. “Even if it doesn’t feel the best, moving through neck range of motion ― looking right, left, up and down ― goes a long way to shortening an episode of neck pain,” Anderson said. If your pain doesn’t resolve, chat with your doctor or a physical therapist. You may need some manual interventions like medication, specific exercises or trigger point shots (or all of the above) to help relieve the pain. “Massage guns are best used on large muscles, especially in the legs, shoulders, and back,” Lees said. “These muscles tend to do most of the work when exercising or doing physical labor. Because they are large it’s generally safe to work them with a massage gun unless a tear is suspected.” Anderson also pointed this out. “Areas of big muscles are the best for massage guns,” she said. “My favorites are quads, calves and glutes. Just make sure and stay away from anything bony, even if it feels useful.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/theragun-massage-gun-relief_l_65e225d7e4b0d2a247594afc","Reviewers Say This Light, Reasonably Priced Massage Gun Was Their 'Best Purchase Ever'","haley zovickian","2024-03-05","HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. Rarely do you encounter a product so effective that it blows you away. For me and a plethora of reviewers, the Theragun Relief massage gun is one of those things. It’s a massage gun designed to unknot clenched muscles and help relieve everyday pain and tension. What makes it so impressive, to me, is that it does so surprisingly gently given its power — and at a comparatively accessible price point that reviewers described as “an absolute steal,” given that many quality massage guns can run for well over $500. “I’ve found that the Theragun brand offers a better variety of pressure and speed for all levels of comfort,” Hilary Burkholder, a massage therapist at The Summit in Philadelphia, previously told HuffPost. Dr. Mathew J. Hamula, an orthopedic surgeon at New York-Presbyterian Medical Group, also previously told HuffPost that Theragun massage guns can reduce perceived pain in users by stimulating nerve receptors that in turn relax muscles. “For the most part, they have been successful in treating delayed onset muscle soreness as well as acutely improving range of motion,” Hamula explained. “[Theraguns] tend to be best suited for muscle aches and pains as well as myofascial release to treat areas of tension, knots, adhesions from trauma and tightness.” This has been my experience as a user of Theragun massage guns; I’ve been fortunate to try several of their models and to own the Theragun Relief, the brand’s newest model that’s designed to work as an everyday massager with three speeds and three attachments to target different muscles. It’s also an affordable alternative to some of the brand’s pricier models. Before trying the Theragun for myself, I was skeptical that it would even work for me. I deal with persistent pain from tight, clenched muscles that make it difficult to sleep, and which only seemed to be worsening. I didn’t know what to expect when I first turned it on, and when I did, it at first felt a little strange, like a high-percussion pounding that flattened my muscles but strangely did not hurt, instead delivering a physical relief and release. After spending a few minutes on each of my shoulders, I found that my previously tight, knotted muscles felt liquid-y and knot-free, like I was once again a kid with fluid, pain-free muscles. Of course, you should see a doctor or physical therapist if you feel consistent pain in your body. But the ability to feel this level of relief so quickly blew my mind, and felt like something of a miracle. Reviewers agree with me, too. “I was initially skeptical,” wrote one Best Buy reviewer, “but I was blown away by its performance.” Another Best Buy reviewer swore by it for helping their arthritis, and an Amazon reviewer called it “great for relieving the daily stiffness that comes with advanced age.” Reviewers appreciate how lightweight it is, making it easy for those with small hands and those sharing their Theragun with the rest of their household found their family members delighted: “‘[O]ne of my kids said, ‘[B]est purchase ever!’” And while you can find other cheaper options, reviewers say this one is well worth the extra money. “I [had] the cheaper off-brand version of one of these for a while and the on-brand is definitely worth the extra price,” one Amazon reviewer said. You can grab one of the Theragun Relief models at Amazon, Target or Best Buy, or check out other Theragun options at Amazon or Therabody. Take a look at reviewers’ input below: “I was initially skeptical about the ‘Relief’ given its much lower price point compared to other Therabody products, but I was blown away by its performance! Not only does it deliver the same high-quality deep tissue massage I’ve come to expect from Therabody, but at $149, it’s an absolute steal. The “Relief” has been a game-changer for my post-workout recovery. Its ergonomic design, combined with the power it packs, rivals the more expensive models in the market that go for $200+. It’s clear that Therabody has once again prioritized the user experience without compromising on quality. For those on the fence because of the cost of premium massage guns, the ‘Relief’ is your answer. Highly recommended!” — LlamasRFun, Best Buy “Perfect for my tight muscles! I was a massage therapist for 10 years. I wish I had this back then. Everybody needs this! It has several speeds and three different attachments to target specific areas of tightness/sensitivity.” — AndreaH, Best Buy “Exactly as described. Gr8 for ppl who suffer from arthritis. I was able to single handidly hit the knot between my shoulder blade and spine. This lil fella has enough power to break up tension areas and loosen them without any muscular assistance from me. FYI: if I’m leaving a review, that must mean that it was a pretty dang good product. Just sayin because I don’t leave reviews lightly.” —diSguisedRealist, Best Buy “So worth it!! We are a family of four and we all have enjoyed using it. We are planning on buying a second one! one of my kids said, ‘best purchase ever!’” — Soniagris, Best Buy “I wish I had discovered this years ago! Easy to use, very good battery life with multiple uses before charging is required. It can be used by ones self with the triangle handle that can be held in many ways, as well as used on someone else. This model has 3 levels, I’ve never gone above the second setting, and prefer the first setting but I am thin and boney. My husband prefers the 2nd level setting. It is very effective muscle relief for soreness and stiffness. It helps loosen everything up for flexibility and movement.” — Jody, Amazon “I have the cheaper off-brand version of one of these for a while and the on-brand is definitely worth the extra price. It’s a little bit easier to use on yourself due to the handle and it is also a lot quieter than the cheaper version that I used to have” — anne sue, Amazon “Great for relieving the daily stiffness that comes with advanced age.” — Weaverlady, Amazon “I have small hands and this gun is small and light enough for me to use.” — M.Bermudez, Amazon By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The longer you stay at these jobs, the more comfortable you may get ― even if it does feel increasingly like your career is stalling. And that’s where you might hit the dreaded “job plateau.” It’s a period of time in a long-term job where you feel stuck, frustrated or bored by what you do. Lisa Orbé-Austin, a licensed psychologist who focuses on helping professionals manage their careers, said she sees a lot of people who will ignore for a long time that they are in a job plateau because it’s often a job they know how to do well. “The beginning of a plateau doesn’t feel terrible,” Orbé-Austin said. “But it’s when that ... becomes kind of a feeling of ‘I’ve done this 1,000 times; what’s new about this?’ you have to kind of then think about ‘What is next for me?’” If you do not take action, you can hold yourself back from taking more fulfilling opportunities and stay stuck in a job you should have long left. Sometimes there are warning clues and hints that will alert you to your plateau before you are fully ready to acknowledge or address the problem. Here are some of the most common ones: If you feel you’ve done all you can in terms of skills you can develop and things that you can learn, you’re likely in a job plateau, said Nell Wulfhart, a decision coach who helps professionals get “unstuck” so they can move on. To decide if you’ve really stopped learning useful skills, Wulfhart suggests writing down what you want your future to look like a year to 10 years from now, as well as your long-term goals. “Maybe it’s boring at the moment, but is [the job] actually getting you the skills you need for that next big job leap? Or are you learning things that could be useful when you want to start your own business in five years?” Wulfhart gave as examples. “Sometimes you literally just have to put in the time. And there’s no way to sort of avoid it or skip over it or take a shortcut,” Wulfhart said. But if what you are doing is not serving these long-term goals, then you know that you have hit your plateau. Your ability to be promoted and get raises are tangible ways to track your opportunities for growth in a role. Wulfhart said to watch out if there’s a repeated pattern of your boss promising opportunities and promotions over months and years, but they never happen. “People love praise, and they love the idea that someone is looking out for them,” Wulfhart said. “That kind of thing can keep you coasting along for a really long time.” Wulfhart said many of her clients come to her with job plateaus they have been in for years. She said one of the big signs of a plateau is if you keep obsessing over the idea of leaving your job. “If the thought starts buzzing in your brain, like, ‘Maybe I’ve done all I can with this,’ or ‘Maybe it’s time to get out of here,’ that probably is not going to go away,” Wulfhart. For clients who are torn between leaving and staying at a job, Wulfhart said she asks them to answer: “Would I take this job now if somebody offered it to me?” That’s because one of the reasons people stay put in a job that has plateaued is because it is a job that seems good on paper, Wulfhart said. Answering this question can help you clarify if this is really a job that you are content to stay in long-term. “I would encourage people really to look at who they are now, not who they were when they got the job, just to see if it’s still a fit for them,” Wulfhart said. Does every day feel the same at work? When you’re not learning or growing, you can become completely disengaged from your projects, and it’s a sign that you’ve hit your plateau. “Oftentimes when people are in a plateau, they’re not really thinking about it. They’re just going through the motions more than anything,” Orbé-Austin said. A job plateau is a tough place to be in, but it is possible to address it more immediately. Here’s how: Before you start job-hunting, assess what your current job is offering you. A stable but boring job that you know how to manage may be just what you need to complete higher priorities in your life. Wulfhart gave the example of a job that is helping you pay off credit card debt or helps fund your true passion of being in a band. “I have a friend who has worked in medical publishing for 25 years. And he does not care about medical publishing,” she recalled. “But he has a band, and he’s really into the band. And this is a steady, reasonably well-paid job ... So that’s a perfectly good reason to stay at a job.” While you feel stuck, Wulfhart suggested, it can help to find a hobby unrelated to your job, like pottery, a book club or crafting, that you enjoy doing. Nurturing a new passion can help you see what you have been missing at your job. “When you find something that you’re actually really hyped and passionate about, then it kind of puts the rest of your life into perspective,” she said. “You’re like, ‘Oh, this is actually what it looks like to really enjoy the thing that I do. Like, why am I putting up with less at my actual job?’” People often stay in job plateaus because of their fear of the unknown. Deep down, you may know you need to quit, but you’re afraid of ending up in a job that is worse than what you have. Doing informational interviews with people in other jobs you’re interested in can dispel those anxieties and give you the encouragement you need to take action. With informational interviews, you will also learn what responsibilities you can do at your current job to look like a better candidate for positions you actually want, Orbé-Austin said. You want to take these responsibilities “strategically, so they can be helping you get to the next place you want to go,” Orbé-Austin said. “But you’ve got to know the place first before you start doing that.” Ultimately, getting out of a job plateau and finding a more rewarding opportunity can be tough, hard work, which is why so many of us simply stay put.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/playing-musical-instruments-aging-brain-health_l_65dfada2e4b005b85832abc7","This 1 Hobby Is Great For An Aging Brain, According To A New Study","jillian wilson","2024-03-05","If you’re looking to bolster your cognitive abilities and keep your mind sharp throughout your lifetime, you may want to pick up a musical instrument. A recent study published in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that playing is good for your brain health as you age. Researchers examined 1,107 people in the U.K. over the age of 40 with an average age of 67.82. Participants self-reported their musical experience via a questionnaire and took part in a cognitive assessment, which tested their working memory and executive function. Researchers then studied how four aspects of musicality — listening to music, playing an instrument, singing and self-reported ability — impacted cognitive behavior and compared that to people who did not have a musical background. “This large-scale, longitudinal study supports previous research indicating that musical training supports cognitive health by improving memory and lowering risk for age-related cognitive decline,” Dr. Gary Small, a memory, brain and aging expert at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, told HuffPost via email. Small is not affiliated with the study. It’s worth noting that 83% of participants were women, so it’s not totally indicative of the general population. Another caveat is that some data was self-reported, said Dr. Arman Fesharaki-Zadeh, a behavioral neurologist and neuropsychiatrist at Yale Medicine in Connecticut, who is not affiliated with the study. Self-reporting leaves room for error; people may misremember their musical background or misunderstand a question. Playing music largely involves your executive function, so it’s natural for folks with a musical background to see an improvement in the brain, said Dr. Golnaz Yadollahikhales, a neurologist at Cedars-Sinai in California, who is not affiliated with the study. Your executive function refers to your “ability to multitask and organize oneself, and being able to sequence and prioritize,” Fesharaki-Zadeh explained. Additionally, playing music keeps you cognitively active, meaning it challenges your brain. “Being cognitively active throughout one’s life can have a protective role” in brain health, Fesharaki-Zadeh continued. This is known as your cognitive reservoir (or cognitive reserve) and activities like playing music can build this up. Yadollahikhales noted that she’s seen the study’s findings in her day-to-day work, too. People with a good cognitive reserve perform well even when their brain imaging has signs of atrophy. Brain atrophy is linked to issues like dementia and aphasia, according to the Cleveland Clinic. “The patients of mine who were musicians or who were still playing music at the time of diagnosis would show better cognitive function than what was expected to be seen based on their structural imaging findings,” Yadollahikhales said. You may want to consider dabbling in music. The research and the experts who spoke to HuffPost were all pretty clear that playing musical instruments and singing can be beneficial for your long-term cognition. If you’re ready to start some lessons and are open to the process, consider trying specific instruments. The study found that playing keyboard-based instruments, like the piano or organ, had the biggest benefit on memory and executive function, study author Anne Corbett told Newsweek, followed by brass and woodwind instruments. The social aspect of music may be beneficial for your brain, too. Corbett also told Newsweek that the singers in the study had better complex task completion as they aged. But the study noted that the benefits that come with singing may also have to do with the social connections that are formed when singing with a choir or in a group setting. “Music doesn’t usually happen in isolation,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said. Think about it: Music is often played in a group, practiced with a teacher or performed for other people. That social interaction is one of those protective factors for brain health, he added. Bottom line: You’re never too old to start learning and challenging your brain. “Overall, it is recommended that people start building their cognitive reserve early in life,” Yadollahikhales said. “This can be achieved by playing music and games such as puzzles, reading books and being physically active ... also, as mentioned in this study as well, higher education can affect cognitive reserve positively.” Even if it’s been years or even decades since you’ve challenged your brain to something new, hope is not lost. “We’re never too old to learn, I think that’s a known concept,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said. Benefits can be seen whether you’re 65 or 18. Neurogenesis, the forming of new connections and new cells in the brain, is often not as robust for someone in their mid-70s when compared to someone, say, learning at a new job in their mid-20s. But by learning music (or by learning anything new) you activate this process again, Fesharaki-Zadeh added. “So, let’s say somebody doesn’t have dementia [and] they’re wondering what are the ways that they can protect their brains against dementia — music could be potentially a viable strategy because it does incorporate a lot of the other factors such as learning, emotional well-being, social connections ― and they’re all great for the brain,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said. It’s important to keep in mind that while you can control certain risk factors, you can’t control your genetics. “Although this study demonstrates that musicality provides a significant cognitive benefit, other non-genetic ... and genetic risk factors contribute to the risk of cognitive decline,” Small said. “So, even highly successful people with healthy lifestyles will develop dementia if they have a strong genetic predisposition.” But, as Yadollahikhales mentioned above, if you build your cognitive reserve throughout your life, you’ll be better off if you do develop cognitive impairment or dementia. Studies “have shown that being cognitively, socially and physically active after the development of cognitive impairment and dementia can slow down the progression of the disease,” Yadollahikhales said.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/signs-parentification-child_l_65d7982ae4b0189a6a7d425f","4 Signs You May Have Been 'Parentified' As A Child","kelsey borresen","2024-03-05","It’s common for parents to gradually give their kids more responsibilities as they grow up. When those responsibilities are age-appropriate, that can be a good thing and help the child build skills like accountability, independence and teamwork. But when a child is saddled with adult responsibilities, it can turn into a damaging phenomenon known as “parentification.” Parentification is essentially when the child and caregiver swap roles. So the kid is emotionally supporting the adult (known as emotional parentification) and/or managing the logistics of the household (known as instrumental parentification). Emotional parentification tends to be more harmful than the instrumental type. ″[It’s] the phenomenon that happens when a parent relinquishes the role of parent and a child feels the need to step into that role,” Kristene Geering, a parent educator at the family resource Parent Lab, previously told HuffPost. “So instead of the parent taking care of the child’s needs, the child takes care of the parent’s needs,” she said. Expecting your kid to be a contributing member of the household by putting away their laundry, cleaning up their toys or feeding the dog is not the same as parentification. Parentification is when the burdens placed upon the kid are excessive and prolonged, putting “an emotional toll on the child and getting in the way of developmentally appropriate social, emotional and academic endeavors,” Dr. Khadijah Booth Watkins, associate director of the Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital, previously told HuffPost. Examples of parentification might be if a child is expected to act as their parent’s therapist, be the caregiver for younger siblings or the peacemaker during adult squabbles. Clinical psychologist Cindy T. Graham, founder of Brighter Hope Wellness Center, told HuffPost it’s important to keep cultural and ethnic differences in mind when having these conversations, as “many cultures value interconnectedness among family members and ‘pitching in.’” In cultures where this is the case, “we would also expect to see that the children are allowed to be kids with time to play with other children, be involved in education with other children,” she added. “We would expect that the responsibilities of the home do not regularly overshadow an appropriate childhood experience.” Certain circumstances increase a child’s risk of being parentified, like if their parent is struggling with a physical or mental health issue, a substance use disorder, a divorce or financial troubles, trauma therapist Maggie Nick told Care.com. Immigrant families may also find themselves in this type of dynamic due to language barriers and culture shock. “We are more likely to see parentification in single-parent households, with the oldest siblings being most at risk,” Nick told the publication. If this sounds all too familiar, read on as therapists share the signs you may have been parentified as a child. Struggling to set and maintain boundaries is a sign you may have experienced parentification, said Evelyn Pechous, an associate marriage and family therapist at The Expansive Group. You may have a habit of neglecting your own desires, plans and preferences in order to satisfy someone else’s. In adulthood, you may continue to take on a lot of responsibility and feel a “consistent need to be in control of situations,” Graham said. “Adults who were parentified as children may struggle with allowing others to take the lead in situations,” she said. “This could also result in having relationships with those who will allow them to take charge. Adults who were parentified as children might harbor feelings of resentment from the lack of support.” Over time, this inability to let others share some of this responsibility can leave you “overburdened and eventually burned out,” Graham added. Perhaps your parent treated you like their confidant when you were just a kid and leaned heavily on you for comfort and support. They may have even made comments like, “I need you to make me happy” or “If I didn’t have you to talk to about this, I don’t know what I’d do.” In adulthood, you may continue to feel like you’re responsible for other people’s feelings and well-being. “The caregiver may also have communicated messages such as, ‘If you don’t do well in class, you’re going to make me angry. So do well so you don’t make me angry,’” Pechous said. “This message can then develop an internalized narrative for the child that they must be ‘good’ or ‘perfect’ to prevent their caregiver from becoming angry.” When a loved one is venting to you about something happening in their life, you can’t resist the urge to offer unsolicited advice and solutions in an effort to save the day. “While adults who were parentified as children can be empathetic peacemakers in their relationships, this can also lead to over-involvement in the interpersonal dynamics of others,” Graham said. She added: “In short, the adult who was a parentified adult can struggle with internal feelings of discomfort stemming from having to watch others figure out how to navigate their own lives.” Being placed in situations that were not developmentally appropriate as a kid can hinder your emotional and cognitive development and lead to high stress, anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed, according to The Attachment Project. Making matters worse, your caregivers may not have given you the comfort or support needed to help you work through these emotions, which “can further interfere with the development of healthy emotional regulation skills,” the project’s website says. You may have also had trouble socially and academically as a kid because of all the responsibility you carried at home. Long term, you may struggle with maintaining healthy boundaries and relationships. Additionally, you may develop clinical depression “due to a constant hypervigilance of a caregivers’ emotions or challenges with identifying wants and needs,” Pechous said. But not all of the outcomes are negative, Graham noted. It can be useful to consider some of the positive effects of this kind of upbringing. “For example, parentified adults may be dependable and high-achieving, or even the ‘rock’ of their families, friend circle, workplace and community,” she said. “They may also be likely to remain calm in difficult interpersonal situations.” If you’re an adult trying to deal with the parentification you experienced as a child, there are things you can do to process and move forward. For starters, work on identifying your own authentic desires and needs, Pechous said. “Notice how different situations, such as boundary-setting, physically feel in our bodies. When we are able to slow down and help our bodies understand that we might no longer be in the same environment or unsafety we were in before, our nervous system can become much more attune to the present,” she said. “When we are able to slow down and help our bodies understand that we might no longer be in the same environment or unsafety we were in before, our nervous system can become much more attune to the present.” Building a consistent routine with protected time set aside for relaxation and self-care practices “can reduce the potential for burnout and overcommitment,” Graham said. “Having an accountability buddy, or someone who checks in to make sure that one is not overcommitted, is also a helpful strategy.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

(AP) — A single-engine plane crashed near a highway in Nashville, Tennessee, just a few miles short of the airport it had tried to reach for an emergency landing, killing five people aboard, authorities said. The pilot made an emergency call to John C. Tune Airport around 7:40 p.m. Monday, reported engine trouble and was given clearance to make an emergency landing, Metro Nashville Police Department spokesman Don Aaron said. A short time later the pilot radioed that the aircraft would not reach the airport, he said. The plane burst into flames when it crashed in a grassy median just off Interstate 40 and behind a Costco on the city’s westside. The crash scene was about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) south of the general aviation airport. “It appears that everyone on board perished,” Aaron said. In a statement early Tuesday on the social media platform X, police said five people died. It said the Federal Aviation Administration was at the scene and the National Transportation Safety Board planned to arrive Tuesday. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/credit-card-late-fees-cfpb-rule_n_65e68bd6e4b0f8905933b823","Credit Card Late Fees Would Drop Under New Biden Administration Rule","jonathan nicholson","2024-03-05","The Biden administration is trying to rein in what it says are unnecessarily high credit card late fees, putting in place a new consumer protection rule it says will lower them. “For over a decade, credit card giants have been exploiting a loophole to harvest billions of dollars in junk fees from American consumers,” Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Tuesday. “Today’s rule ends the era of big credit card companies hiding behind the excuse of inflation when they hike fees on borrowers and boost their own bottom lines.” The move is part of a slate of measures unveiled Tuesday by regulators and agencies meant to show the Biden administration is trying to boost competition and bring down costs to consumers as many voters are still chafing from the effects of prices increases in 2022 and 2023. Those other moves include a proposal by Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel to limit bulk billing of broadband services in multi-household buildings, such as condo and apartment complexes, and a move by the Agriculture Department to boost competition for processing in livestock and poultry markets. But the CFPB rule, to be officially published Tuesday, may get the most notice. The bureau said banks collected more than $14 billion in late payments in 2022 and that those fees made up more than 10% of all the fees and interest banks charged customers. A 2009 law was meant to limit late fees to no more than the amount needed to actually recover late payments. But in implementing the law, the Federal Reserve provided an exception for banks that charged no more than $25 for the first late payment and $35 for subsequent ones, and it allowed those amounts to rise with inflation. The average fee is now $32, said the CFPB, which is now in charge of enforcing the 2009 law. Its new rule would bring that down to $8, saving an estimated $220 annually for the 45 million people who pay late fees. Though fees have long been a steady source of income for banks, they are in good financial shape and may not feel much of an effect from the change. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in November that U.S. banks made $68.4 billion in profits in the third quarter of 2023, down slightly from the quarter before. Still, major banking trade groups — the American Bankers Association, the Consumer Bankers Association and the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions — warned in 2023 that the change would mean more borrowers would pay late because the fees would not deter them and would subsequently see their creditworthiness suffer.

During an interview with Right Side Broadcasting Network that was broadcast in front of supporters from his Mar-a-Lago home, Trump claimed there are “people who are coming from parts unknown, countries that you’ve never heard of.” “Languages that nobody in this country speaks. We don’t even have teachers of some of these languages,” he continued. Then he asked, “Who would think that we have languages that are like from the planet Mars?” The line drew a laugh from the audience. “Nobody, nobody, knows how to, you know, speak it,” Trump added. Trump on immigrants: They have languages that nobody in this country speaks. The languages are from Mars pic.twitter.com/diVfTZ88nU Four-times-indicted Trump has regurgitated a similar line of attack on immigrants. “Nobody can explain to me how allowing millions of people from places unknown, from countries unknown, who don’t speak languages,” he confusingly complained during his visit to the U.S. southern border last week. “We have languages coming into our country. We have nobody that even speaks those languages. They’re truly foreign languages. Nobody speaks them,” he added. “And they’re pouring into our country, and they’re bringing with them tremendous problems, including medical problems, as you know.” CNN’s fact-checking reporter Daniel Dale, though, at the time said the claim “seems to be just conjured out of thin air” and is “nonsense.” Amid record levels of migrants at the border, Republican 2024 front-runner Trump has sought to make immigration a key issue in the 2024 election, which is looking increasingly likely to be a repeat of the 2020 vote between himself and President Joe Biden. Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration and limit legal immigration if he returns to the White House, promising “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.” “Look, we have to deport a lot of people, and they have to start immediately,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity last week. Local police officers would play a key role in the deportations, he explained. MARS-a-Lago? This tracks, for a man who stared directly into an eclipse. Donald Trump, in an interview with RSBN, says that some of the immigrants crossing the border are speaking ""languages that are, like, from the planet Mars. Nobody knows how to, you know, speak it.""Trump often makes similar claims, but this is a new interplanetary variant. His cheese has slid off the launch pad ~ fucking Mars? Does he think illegal aliens are......aliens????? Pretty sure he couldn’t point to Mars on a map of the solar system. The next four years will change America forever.

During a discussion on President Joe Biden’s fitness for office on Monday, Democratic strategist Jonathan Kott said he’d rather have a POTUS “who maybe has a stutter once in a while than one who spews conspiracy theories, racist nonsense, and has dinner with Nazis.” Bruce fired back by falsely accusing Kott, a former aide to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), of calling “a number of Republicans Nazis and racists.” She railed, “So, I think we can put him in the category of willing to go there.” DAMN!

(Trump later claimed he’d “never heard” of Fuentes before their “very quick dinner”). But the Fox News personalities didn’t allow Kott’s defense. “That is a tactic that is not going to work,” raged Bruce. “The American people don’t like it, and they are taking it personally. Look at his numbers. It’s not going to work.” As Faulkner drew the conversation to a close, she told Kott she was withdrawing her earlier praise of him for not name-calling.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-supreme-court-legal-peril_n_65e6a554e4b0f8905933ba3a","Trump’s Staying On The Ballot, But His Legal Peril Is Just Starting","nicholas riccardi","2024-03-04","DENVER (AP) — Former President Donald Trump gained a clear win at the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, which unanimously ruled that states don’t have the ability to bar him — or any other federal candidates — from the ballot under a rarely-used constitutional provision that prohibits those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. The decision shuts down a push in dozens of states to end Trump’s candidacy through a clause in the 14th Amendment, written to prevent former Confederates from serving in government after the Civil War. But it may open the door to further electoral uncertainty, exposing more state officials to disqualification under the provision and setting up a constitutional showdown should Trump win the election. Facing four separate criminal trials, Trump’s legal peril may just be beginning. So is the Supreme Court’s role in that process. Here are some takeaways: A TECHNICAL, BUT STILL BIG, WIN The most significant thing the court did Monday was to overturn a Colorado Supreme Court ruling from December that Trump was not eligible to be president because he violated the insurrection clause, Section 3, of the 14th Amendment. This will also stop efforts to kick him off the ballot in Illinois, Maine and other states. Had the Supreme Court let the Colorado ruling stand, it could have triggered a new wave of litigation that might have left Trump disqualified in many states. The high court avoided addressing that politically contentious issue of whether Trump played a role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol that would have barred him from seeking office. The ruling is almost devoid of references to Jan. 6 or insurrection, and doesn’t address whether Trump committed such an act by sparking the attack on the Capitol. Instead it focuses on the technical, procedural question of who gets to decide an election challenge under Section 3. All nine justices agreed that is the purview of Congress. But a narrower majority of five went further, ruling it can only be done through legislation. That exposes significant splits underneath the unanimous majority, and points toward the greatest uncertainty the ruling creates. A TIME BOMB FOR JAN. 6, 2025? One possible outcome that the case presented was the prospect of unelected judges disqualifying the man dominating who has already received hundreds of thousands of votes in the nominating process. But another potential nightmare is that if Congress is the only entity that can determine whether a presidential hopeful is indeed disqualified for engaging in “insurrection,” that it makes that determination on Jan. 6, 2025, when required to certify a possible Trump victory in the presidential election. The high court shut down the first possibility, but may have left the door open to the second one. The five-justice majority — all from the court’s conservative wing — said Congress can implement Section 3 through legislation, “subject of course to judicial review.” (That means the court reserves for itself the right to have the final say.) That triggered a dissent from the court’s three liberals, who complained that that “shuts the door on other potential means of federal enforcement.” That would appear to include a rejection of Trump’s electors should he win the election ― but multiple legal experts said Monday that it wasn’t that clear, and the only way to know may be for Congress to try. FEELING THE HEAT The 14th Amendment case is one of two putting the high court squarely in the midst of the ongoing presidential election. Last week, the court agreed to hear Trump’s appeal of a federal ruling that he’s not entitled to immunity from criminal charges for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Trump’s trial on those charges was originally scheduled to begin Monday, but has been postponed because of the battle over his immunity challenge. The high court taking up his appeal in late April raises the possibility that trial won’t conclude until after the presidential election. The justices’ discomfort over being put in the middle of the nation’s partisan divide came through in a brief, but notable, concurring opinion by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Though one of the court’s conservatives, she didn’t agree with the majority’s ruling that Congress can only enforce Section 3 through legislation. But she didn’t want to sign onto the liberals’ dissent, either, instead warning against focusing too much on partisan divisions. “...this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency,” Barrett wrote. “The Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up.” “For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case,” she concluded. “That is the message Americans should take home.” ACTION IN THE STATES The court’s ruling shuts off using Section 3 against federal officials absent action by Congress but it leaves open the ability of states to use the provision against their own state officials, noting there’s a rich record after the Civil War of just those sorts of actions. That’s already begun anew in the post-Jan. 6 era. The first disqualification under Section 3 in more than a century came in 2022, when a New Mexico court removed Couy Griffin, who was convicted of entering the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 while leading a group called “Cowboys for Trump,” from his rural county commission. The group that brought that case, Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, next filed the Colorado case against Trump. They said they were eager to continue filing Section 3 cases against lower-level Jan. 6 participants. TRUMP’S LEGAL TRAVAILS AHEAD Few observers expected the Supreme Court to keep Trump off the ballot. But he’s facing far more perilous legal road ahead. The first of Trump’s criminal trials, for allegedly falsifying business records to pay hush money to an adult film actress during the 2016 presidential campaign, is scheduled to start in New York later this month. The former president is also appealing a New York judge’s ruling that he pay $355 million for fraud committed by his businesses, and verdict that he pay a writer $83 million for defaming her after she sued him for sexual assault.

Depending on how and how quickly the high court rules on Trump’s immunity claim, he could still face charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election in Washington DC before this November’s election. Two more cases are more likely to come later – in Atlanta where Trump faces state charges for his 2020 election plot, and in Florida where he’s tentatively scheduled for a May trial on improper retention of classified documents after leaving the presidency, but the trial date is expected to be postponed.

The suit was filed by former Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal, former chief financial officer Ned Segal, former head of legal and policy Vijaya Gadde and former general counsel Sean Edgett. The executives, fired after Musk’s 2022 takeover, say they were entitled to severance due to clauses in their contracts. (Twitter was later renamed X.) The amounts include a year’s salary and stock options, but the group claims Musk “fired them without reason, then made up fake cause and appointed employees of his various companies to uphold his decision.” According to Agrawal’s offer letter, obtained by The New York Times, he was entitled to a severance payment of more than $57 million. Segal was entitled to more than $44 million in benefits and Gadde more than $20 million. Edgett was also entitled to nearly $7 million, according to the suit. “Musk’s refusal to pay Plaintiffs their benefits is part of a larger pattern of refusing to pay Twitter’s former employees the benefits and other compensation they are due,” the complaint says. “He claimed in his termination letters that each Plaintiff committed ‘gross negligence’ and ‘willful misconduct’ without citing a single fact in support of this claim.” The group’s lawyers argued the tactic fit with Musk’s public pledges to deny severance to employees he fired after taking over Twitter. The suit added Musk had vowed a “lifetime of revenge” on the former executives after the group blocked his attempt to walk out on the $44 billion takeover deal.

(AP) — Donald Trump won the North Dakota Republican presidential caucuses on Monday, adding to his string of victories heading into Super Tuesday. The former president finished first in voting conducted at 12 caucus sites, ahead of former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The results resumes Trump’s winning streak, which was briefly interrupted on Sunday when Haley notched her first victory of the campaign in the District of Columbia’s primary. The White House hopefuls now turn their attention to Super Tuesday, when results will pour in from 16 states in contests that amount to the single biggest delegate haul of any day in the presidential primary. Trump and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, are dominating their races and are on track to winning their nominations later this month. Under North Dakota’s rules, candidates are eligible to win delegates if they finish with at least 20% of the vote. However, a candidate who wins at least 60% of the vote receives all of the state’s 29 delegates. Four candidates were on the ballot, including Trump and Nikki Haley. The other candidates, who have received little attention, were Florida businessman David Stuckenberg and Texas businessman and pastor Ryan Binkley, who recently ended his campaign. In 2016, it was a North Dakota delegate who helped Trump secure the number needed for the Republican presidential nomination. He swept North Dakota’s three electoral college votes in 2016 and 2020, winning about 63% and 65% of those votes, respectively. As president, Trump visited Bismarck and Mandan in 2017 to talk about tax cuts, and he campaigned twice in Fargo in 2018 for Kevin Cramer in the then-congressman’s successful Senate bid against Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. North Dakota’s Democratic-NPL Party is holding a presidential primary almost entirely by mail, with mail-in voting from Feb. 20 to March 30, and limited in-person voting for residents of Indian reservations. President Joe Biden, Rep. Dean Phillips and six others are on the ballot. A third party will count ballots in Fargo on March 30, with results available on the party’s website afterward.

The new allegations add to Jones’ original lawsuit, in which he accuses Diddy of sexual assault and harassment. In new filings, Lil Rod claimed that Diddy or his son Justin shot Justin’s friend, identified in the complaint as a 30-year-old named G, in the abdomen and near his leg or hip area in a bathroom at Chalice Recording Studio in Los Angeles in September 2022. He claims that G has since disappeared. The complaint, which included pictures purported to show a bloodied bathroom, said the shooting followed an argument involving Diddy, Justin and G during a “writers and producers camp” at the studio. The three moved to a nearby bathroom just 2 feet away from Lil Rod when multiple shots were fired, at which point the producer feared being shot through the door, according to the complaint. It then added that Diddy and Justin left the bathroom while G remained on the floor and that multiple people then crowded around the door. In an effort to help G, Lil Rod applied pressure to his wounds, propped him up on the toilet and urged the surrounding bystanders to call for an ambulance, according to the complaint. Lil Rod then carried G to the ambulance in front of the studio as Diddy and his son “disappeared to another part of the studio,” according to the document. The complaint claims that G was “physically incapable of walking” and that Lil Rod had to carry him to the ambulance. “Mr. Combs gave strict instructions to inform the police that he had nothing to do with the shooting. He also forced Mr. Jones to lie to the police by telling them that G was shot standing outside the studio by a drive-by assailant,” the complaint says. Lil Rod’s recollection of the shooting clashes with the official Los Angeles Police Department account and claims from Diddy’s attorney Shawn Holley that the shooting did not happen at the studio, NBC News reported Monday. At the time, KCAL-TV in Los Angeles reported that the victim was shot outside of the studio, citing the LAPD. The report, which was featured in the amended complaint, did not include names. “When LAPD arrived on scene, it was immediately determined (conclusively) that the shooting took place some distance from the studio,” Holley told NBC News. “Neither Sean nor Justin were in the vicinity or even aware of what had occurred until afterwards. So I don’t think either of them were interviewed [by police],” Holley added. Further, the complaint included a screenshot of an Instagram message from the studio to an unnamed recipient that claimed the shooting occurred “half a block away from Chalice.” “As of the date of this filing, neither the Los Angeles Police Department, nor the Los Angeles Fire Department have released any official reports surrounding this shooting. There has been no body camera footage, and no 911 call recording. What is even more disturbing, is that there has been no citing [sic] of G,” the complaint said. In Lil Rod’s initial complaint, filed on Feb. 26 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, he accuses Diddy of “constant unsolicited and unauthorized groping”; coercing him to engage in sexual acts with sex workers; as well as lacing alcohol given to Lil Rod and his guests, which included underage girls. In addition, the complaint says that Diddy runs a racketeering enterprise has not paid him for his production work on his latest album, “The Love Album.” Rod also claims in the suit that Diddy said he was “responsible for” a shooting involving a rapper named Shyne in 1999. “Filing a lawsuit should never be the first option in a dispute. We can have an honest discussion to resolve the issues as I suggested, or we can follow the same plan Shawn Holley used that got her clients Danny Masterson and Tory Lanez convicted. Makes one wonder who is really managing this situation for Mr. Combs,” Lil Rod’s attorney Tyrone Blackburn said, according to NBC News. Lil Rod is the first man to file a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against Diddy, who has branded himself as “Brother Love” despite previous allegations of violence and faulty business practices from numerous men who had been employees, Rolling Stone reported. The Bad Boy Entertainment founder was accused of sexual abuse in four other lawsuits in November, starting with a harrowing lawsuit filed by an ex-girlfriend, model and R&B artist Cassie. In a 35-page complaint, Cassie accused Diddy of raping and abusing her, forcing her to have sex with male sex workers as he watched, and inciting a drug and alcohol addiction. The “Me & U” singer’s accusations came as the Adult Survivors Act in New York, which allowed accusers to come forward with allegations of sexual abuse beyond the set statute of limitations, was set to expire in November. Cassie and Diddy settled the lawsuit the day after it was filed. Following Cassie’s suit, at least three more from other women were filed under the New York statute before it expired. One woman, identified in the lawsuit as Liza Gardner, accused Diddy and singer Aaron Hall of raping her and her friend in 1990 or 1991. Another woman, Joi Dickerson-Neal, accused Diddy of raping her, filming it and showing the video to others in 1991. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a lawsuit claiming that Diddy, former Bad Boy Records President Harve Pierre and an unnamed man “gang raped” and “sex trafficked” her when she was 17 years old in 2003. At the time, Diddy was 34. Following the onslaught of lawsuits, Diddy, who has denied all the accusations against him, stepped down from his position as chairman of the media company Revolt in November. Plans for a reality TV show that was set to focus on his life and family were cut short in December. “Enough is enough,” he wrote in an Instagram post in December. “Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.” The next four years will change America forever.

John Thune (R-S.D.) confirmed Monday that he’s throwing his hat in the ring to become the Senate Republican leader once Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) steps down. Thune, the Senate minority whip, shared the news with KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “Well, I hope to be, and I’m going to do everything I can to convince my colleagues,” Thune replied when asked if he was gunning for the leadership position. “They’re the voters. They’re the ones who ultimately make the decision. But that, as we look at a new generation of consistent, principled, conservative leadership in the United States Senate that empowers our Senate Republicans, that puts a [check and balance] against ... what has been the, a very liberal Schumer/Biden agenda, I’m prepared to lead that effort,” referring to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and President Joe Biden. His announcement comes days after 82-year-old McConnell, the longest-serving Senate leader in history, said he’ll step down in November and leave office when his term ends in January 2027. “One of life’s underappreciated moments is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter. This will be my last term as Republican leader in the Senate,” an emotional McConnell told his colleagues Wednesday. Thune has served in the Senate since 2005 and has been the Republican whip since 2019. He was a vocal opponent of efforts by former President Donald Trump, the likely GOP nominee in this year’s presidential election, to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump’s plot to overturn Biden’s victory would “go down like a shot dog,” Thune said at the time, adding, “I just don’t think it makes a lot of sense to put everybody through this when you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be.” The next four years will change America forever.

John Cornyn of Texas informed his colleagues last week that he also intends to go after the job, saying, “From experience, I have learned what works in the Senate and what does not.” John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) is also expected to announce plans to seek McConnell’s leadership post.

The “Baywatch” star — whose ultra feminine and glammed-up appearance contributed to impossibly high beauty standards for women in the 1990s — made headlines in September when she decided to ditch her signature look and attend Paris Fashion Week without makeup. In an interview with fashion and lifestyle outlet Highsnobiety that was published last week, the former Playboy model said that her decision to go makeup-free has been a part of her “healing experience” and noted that she now uses a “more natural” beauty routine. She also shared how the choice to get rid of her glam team made those closest to her, including her two sons, Brandon Thomas and Dylan Jagger, nervous. “My boys were like, ‘Mom, you must have a glam team,’” Anderson said. “And my agents were like, ‘You have to have a glam team! Where’s the stylist?’ I go, ‘I know how to put a dress on myself. I don’t need someone buttoning up my blouse. I got this.’ And they were just horrified.” Anderson’s decision to nix the makeup has received praise. Scarlett Johansson called Anderson’s makeup-free look at Paris Fashion Week “powerful,” while Jamie Lee Curtis said she was “so impressed and floored” by the “Home Improvement” actor’s “act of courage and rebellion.” Elsewhere in her Highsnobiety interview, Anderson said that the look that made her famous was never authentic. “I was actually always a tomboy growing up,” she said. “I never wanted to wear a dress. I was athletic. I made mud pies.” She also hinted as to why she initially embraced a style that wasn’t really hers. “We all get roped into, ‘Oh, I want to be successful so I can have this and this, and show people that I’m cool, chic, admired,’” Anderson said. “And then we’re all just left with debt and a fancy car. It’s just like chasing age. You’re not going to win.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-2020-fake-electors-wisconsin_n_65e6679ce4b0f8905933a9b1","Wisconsin Fake Elector Case Settlement Offers New Details On Trump Lawyers' Strategy","sophia tareen","2024-03-04","Two attorneys for then-President Donald Trump orchestrated a plan for fake electors to file paperwork falsely saying the Republican won Wisconsin in a strategy to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 victory there and in other swing states, according to a lawsuit settlement reached Monday that makes public months of texts and emails. Under their agreements, Kenneth Chesebro and Jim Troupis turned over more than 1,400 pages of documents, emails and text messages, along with photos and video, offering a detailed account of the scheme’s origins in Wisconsin. The communications show how they, with coordination from Trump campaign officials, replicated the strategy in six other states including Georgia, where Chesebro has already pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the 2020 election. The agreements settle a civil lawsuit brought by Democrats in 2022 against the two attorneys and 10 Republicans in Wisconsin who posed as fake electors. The Republicans settled in December. “Our democracy demands better than this,” said Scott Thompson, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys who helped negotiate the agreements. “That is why this lawsuit … consistently sought transparency, accountability and deterrence. We can’t let this happen again.” There is no admission of wrongdoing or liability in the agreements in which Chesebro and Troupis promise to never participate in similar efforts involving future presidential campaigns. Troupis must also pay an undisclosed amount to the plaintiffs. Troupis said Monday in an emailed statement that the “alternate elector ballots” were “a reasonable course of action” given that the 2020 results were appealable to the U.S. Supreme Court. “The settlement was made to avoid endless litigation, and nothing in today’s settlement constitutes an admission of fault, nor should it,” he added. Phone and text messages left Monday for Chesebro weren’t immediately returned. Electors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party’s electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome. The documents show how Chesebro and Troupis, Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin, used arcane laws in rationalizing and drafting the false certificates for the fake electors. They also reveal how the two strategized ways to delay deadlines for certifying electoral votes and sway public opinion, including floating ideas on conservative talk radio. In November 2020, as they were awaiting a decision from the then-conservative leaning Wisconsin Supreme Court on Trump’s effort to invalidate thousands of votes in the state, Chesebro suggested to Troupis that they contact conservative radio hosts in Milwaukee and Madison: “Mostly to maximize the chance that SCOW (Supreme Court of Wisconsin) justices hear about this quickly and prejudge the case?” He ended with a winking emoji. The fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied wrongdoing. Michigan and Nevada have criminally charged fake electors, but there’s no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, has suggested he’s relying on federal investigators while also not ruling out a state probe. Attorneys who negotiated the settlement said information in the documents has already been provided to Kaul’s office. Monday’s agreements were announced by Georgetown University Law Center’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, Law Forward and the Madison-based Stafford Rosenbaum law firm. According to the plaintiffs’ attorneys, the documents show how Troupis, an attorney who has represented the Republican Party of Wisconsin and is a former judge, was deeply involved in the origins of the effort. Trump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes. At Troupis’ urging, Chesebro drafted memos in the final months of 2020 detailing how to prepare the fake elector certificates and how they should be signed. The documents include a 10-minute video of the fake electors who cheer and take photos as they cast and sign ballots for Trump at the Wisconsin State Capitol. There are no direct communications with Trump in the documents, but there are exchanges with top campaign aides and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. A day after Chesebro shares a Dec. 6 memo on strategies, Troupis follows up via text: “I have sent it to the White House this afternoon. The real decision makers.” There’s a brief mention of a Dec. 15 afternoon meeting with Trump in the Oval Office that both men attended with others. Days later, Chesebro refers to Trump’s social media post summoning followers to Washington on Jan. 6, saying “Be there, will be wild!” “Wow. Based on three days ago, I think we have a unique understanding of this,” Chesebro texts Troupis. Trump campaign officials did offer their assessment of each state’s progress on the fake elector plan. “Wisconsin appears to be the most organized state so far,” concludes a Dec. 11, 2020, email from Trump campaign associate general counsel Joshua Findlay to Chesebro. “This all came out of Wisconsin and expanded to other states,” said attorney Mary McCord with Georgetown’s institute, who helped negotiate the settlement. “That was a significant part of the narrative that led to the violence on Jan 6.” After the deadly attack at the Capitol, the attorneys discussed falsely deflecting blame from Trump supporters to members of the anti-fascist movement, among others. “It’d be nice if Trump surrogates could get across that without antifa’s role in the actual breaking in … the scene at the Capitol would have been entirely peaceful. And that Trump could not (have) reasonably foreseen this,” Chesebro wrote in a text to Troupis. The next four years will change America forever.

I will not buy him an elevated water bowl or a doggie sofa. The fact that I live in Marin County, Calif., land of certified dog massage therapy, cashmere canine wardrobes and fake service-dog vests, only strengthens my resolve to stay normal. When Sheridan from Dairy Dell Doggie Care hands me the two-page menu of extras to consider for Scotch's weeklong stay, (i.e., ""furry blowout,"" ""extra bedtime cuddling by staff,"" and ""treadmill time""), I put up my hand and say nicely, ""Thank you, Sheridan. But he's a dog."" And yet. And yet: ever since white hair started sprouting up on my Brittany spaniel's perfect, mahogany-brown face, I began to sink into an embarrassing, only-half-ironic existentialist funk. ""What if I ship him off to Nicole?"" I threatened my husband and kids. Nicole is my hair colorist, to whom I hand over a small fortune every six weeks so my hair can try to look like Julianne Moore's. My family laughed at first, but has since asked me to stop saying this because they're starting to worry. But here's my deal: We get dogs to bring us one thing: JOY. Right? Uncomplicated joy. Your dog's job is to come when you call, love you all the time, and live to be, in all adorable doggy ways, a constant reminder that your life is right there, waiting to be enjoyed. Never mind that our dog regularly fails at most of his job. Most of the time, he treats us like a bad boyfriend, stopping for a moment to consider our jubilant calls and effusive praise with a blank stare before walking off in the other direction. But still, we adore him, just like all bad boyfriends are unjustifiably adored. And despite his poor dog performance, Scotch's rapidly changing appearance from gorgeous young thing to wizened elder is managing to unhinge me. What, in God's name, is wrong with me? Am I vain? Am I ageist? Am I a cliché of Man's Denial of Death? Also, what is the life expectancy of the cat? I really don't know. But what I do know is that I do not appreciate my Brittany turning into a daily reminder of the grim, inexorable march of time. I also do not appreciate my daughter constantly telling me that we better get another dog soon, because Scotch's life expectancy comes up right about the time she leaves for college. Do I need another living being I take care of to break my heart? No. I do not. Instead, I need my dog to stay beautiful and vital and mahogany-brown, and also to stop rolling around in rotting carcasses when I go trail running with him in the hills. Sadly, it's becoming ever more clear that he is not interested in any part of my plan. And so I am left with ""my work,"" as I am certain Oprah would call it. ""Julie,"" Oprah would say, holding me by my shoulders. ""Your work is to accept what is, with equanimity. There you'll find your best life."" Yes, Oprah, yes. My work, I understand, is to breathe into watching Scotch's face turn arctic white. To be OK as I watch his hip flexors seize up just a little more every month, right along with mine. My work is to practice -- it takes practice! -- being with the fact, that one day, my daughter will leave home. Scotch will stop running. And so will I. And that's life. Unless I call Nicole. I'll keep you posted. Earlier on Huff/Post50: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Now, finally, relief is in sight. For the first time since 2011, local, state and federal governments are providing a small but significant increase to prosperity. “There’s not a lot of positive contribution coming from the government sector, but when you’re talking about economic growth, less of a negative is a positive,” said Chris Varvares, senior managing director and co-founder of Macroeconomic Advisers.

These words, uttered half a decade ago by the head of intelligence for the NATO coalition force in Afghanistan, summon a far earlier American savagery. As the American empire affects to close the door on its war with Afghanistan, the words also serve as a sort of doorstop propping open our further intervention in this broken country. The war isn't really ending. Some 18,000 foreign troops will stay in Afghanistan, almost 11,000 of them American, under a new mission called ""Resolute Support."" U.S. forces will also have ""a limited combat role as part of a separate counterterrorism mission,"" according to the Wall Street Journal. Incredibly, we're not letting go. We're just disappearing the combat mission into global background noise. We're continuing to dehumanize part of humanity on the pretext of saving it. The updated version of ""the only good Indian is a dead Indian,"" redirected to the Taliban, was quoted a few days ago in a Der Spiegel article called ""Obama's Lists: A Dubious History of Targeted Killings in Afghanistan."" The article goes into detail about the administration's infamous ""kill lists"" and the hunting of upper- and mid-level Taliban leaders via helicopter and drone -- assassination by Hellfire missile -- which is an extermination methodology guaranteed to kill lots of innocent civilians along with (or instead of) the targeted Taliban operative. But, you know, that's war. The official ""end"" to the Afghan war, while it doesn't mean the end of combat operations, does offer us a moment of disturbing reflection on what has been accomplished these last 13 years, during the first of our wars allegedly to eradicate, but in fact to promote, terror. We poured at least a trillion dollars into the war, which claimed some 30,000 lives, over two-thirds of them civilians. The first thing that occurs to me is that, officially, these statistics mean nothing. U.S. Army General John Campbell, commander of the International Security Assistance Force, exemplified this by smothering the human toll of the war in simple-minded verbiage during a secret ceremony held last weekend in a gymnasium at ISAF headquarters in Kabul: ""Our new resolute mission means we will continue to invest in Afghanistan's future,"" he said. ""Our commitment to Afghanistan endures."" By the way, the ceremony, commemorating the war's shutdown, was secret because authorities feared the possibility of a Taliban attack. The United States and NATO, as everyone knows, are the losers, despite the bloated enormity of their military superiority. The Afghanistan war, like the Iraq war, was an utter failure even in terms of U.S. interests and geopolitical objectives. But any honest reflection requires a far more serious, all-encompassing look at the war's results. War is torture on a national scale. The nation of Afghanistan and its people are, of course, the primary losers in our ""investment"" in their future -- our investment in nation-wrecking. For instance: ""What has happened in Afghanistan over the last 13 years has been the flourishing of a narco-state that is really without any parallel in history,"" Matthieu Aikins said during a recent interview on Democracy Now. Aikens' article, ""Afghanistan: The Making of a Narco State,"" which ran recently in Rolling Stone, points out that, since the U.S. invasion, opium production in Afghanistan has doubled and the country now accounts for about 90 percent of the world's heroin traffic. Opium is about 15 percent of the country's gross domestic product, Aikens said -- even though Afghanistan is at the bottom of the drug trade economically. ""Afghan farmers only touch 1 percent of the value of the global opium trade,"" he said. Before 2001, opium production had been declining in Afghanistan, but, Aikens told Democracy Now, ""the U.S., in its quest for vengeance against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, partnered with the very warlords whose criminality and human rights abuses had created the conditions that led to the rise of the Taliban in the first place. And in many cases, these are the same individuals who were responsible for bringing large-scale opium cultivation to Afghanistan during the war against the Soviets."" War is also humanity's spiritual cancer. Up and down the ranks, dehumanization of the enemy rules. ""The only good Talib is a dead Talib."" This is the thinking that justifies mass bombing raids and kill lists. It also infects the souls of rank-and-file soldiers, such as the ""Kill Team"" described by Mark Boal in another extraordinary Rolling Stone story, this one published in March 2011. ""Among the men of Bravo Company,"" Boal writes, ""the notion of killing an Afghan civilian had been the subject of countless conversations, during lunchtime chats and late-night bull sessions. For weeks, they had weighed the ethics of bagging 'savages' and debated the probability of getting caught. Some of them agonized over the idea; others were gung-ho from the start. But not long after the New Year, as winter descended on the arid plains of Kandahar Province, they agreed to stop talking and actually pull the trigger."" Boal's article details the killing -- and dismemberment -- of Afghan civilians purely for sport and revenge. The details are gruesome: ""Then, using a pair of razor-sharp medic's shears, he reportedly sliced off the dead boy's pinky finger and gave it to Holmes, as a trophy for killing his first Afghan."" What a mockery the reality of war makes of the rhetoric that blesses it. The American empire holds a secret ceremony to skulk away from a failed mission. But this war isn't over. It won't be over until we vow, as a nation, not to start the next one. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crime-and-congress_b_6404622,1/1/2015,christopher brauchli,Crime and Congress,"Grimms' Fairy TalesA collection of Fairy Tales by the brothers GrimmRecent events cause the citizen to ask whether there are any rules that might prevent members of the criminal class from also being members of a Congressional class. What we have learned, thanks to Michael Grimm, the Congressman from New York's 11th Congressional District, is that being a congressman and a convicted felon are not mutually exclusive. Being both ultimately ended badly for Mr. Grimm but not because of any congressional rule or protocol. In April 2014, Congressman Grimm was confronted with a 20-count federal indictment alleging, among other things, that he was concealing income he received from a health food restaurant he once owned. Among other things, the store was a vehicle that enabled him to engage in tax fraud. On May 28, 2014, discussing the criminal charges with a reporter from Politico, Congressman Grimm expressed confidence he would be exonerated. On November 4 Congressman Grimm was elected to a third term in Congress and on December 23 Congressman Grimm pled guilty to a felony federal charge of filing false tax returns for the health food store he owned. Prosecuting attorney, Loretta Lynch, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York said the Congressman ""chose lies and deception over honest dealings with federal and state authorities as well as his own employees."" Notwithstanding his guilty plea, the good news, as far as the congressman was concerned, was that instead of standing trial in the spring on 20 federal charges he would be in Congress working on important legislation. As he told reporters after he'd entered his guilty plea: ""So long as I am able to serve, I will serve."" What he was saying is that being a convicted felon is no bar to serving in the United States House of Representatives. That probably surprises some of my readers. Mr. Grimm is, however, correct. Paragraph 1 of House Rule XXIII says members of the House ""shall behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House."" That reference, of course, does not apply to criminal behavior engaged in by a member of the House before joining that body, and, therefore, pleading guilty to such a crime while a member of Congress should not implicate paragraph 1. It might, however, implicate paragraph 10. That paragraph says a congressman receiving a sentence of 2 or more years' imprisonment ""should [not ""must""] refrain from voting on any question . . . unless or until judicial or executive proceedings result in reinstatement of the presumption of the [member's] innocence . . . . or the Member is reelected to the House after the date of such conviction."" Why the Rule refers to ""reinstatement of the presumption of innocence"" instead of ""exoneration of the charges"", is unclear. Although Rule XXIII does not require a convicted congressman to leave the House, two-thirds of the House could vote to expel Mr. Grimm but that has only happened twice since the civil war. On December 29,2014, Congressman Grimm announced that he was resigning from Congress saying: ""After much thought and prayer, I have made the very difficult decision to step down from Congress. . . .[It] is time for me to start the next chapter of my life."" His reference to "" prayer"" almost certainly refers not to Mr. Grimm addressing a deity, but to Majority Leader, John Boehner, addressing Mr. Grimm and urging him to resign from Congress so that Mr. Boehner's Republican caucus would not include a convicted felon. The ""new chapter"" to which Mr. Grimm refers is his upcoming time in prison. The foregoing discussion is of more than passing interest to one of Mr. Grimm's colleagues, Chaka Fattah. Mr. Fattah, a democrat, has just been elected to an 11th term in the House from West Philadelphia with 88 percent of the vote. He, like Mr. Grimm, is facing an encounter with the federal criminal justice system. The foregoing discussion may be of more than passing interest to him should he be convicted of criminal activity as seems more than a slight possibility. Federal prosecutors have had him in their sights for some time. In August 2014 his former chief of staff pled guilty to several counts of campaign finance fraud. Among improper payments made by the aide were payments to reduce Mr. Fattah's son's college debt. On November 7, 2014, another former Fattah aide pled guilty to one count of conspiring to commit honest services wire fraud, a charge someone smarter than this writer can explain. The kinds of questionable activities in which Mr. Fattah and his aides have been engaged are discussed at some length in The Philadelphia Tribune. The foregoing discussion of what consequences of a conviction meant for Mr. Grimm are certainly of no interest to Mr. Fattah-yet. He might want to keep it in mind for future reference, however.

The Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA Interrogation concluded the program ""created tensions with U.S. partners and allies...complicating bilateral intelligence relationships."" It said the program caused ""immeasurable damage to the United States' public standing, as well as to the United States' longstanding global leadership on human rights in general...."" Immeasurable is right -- in a literal sense it's impossible to gauge just how badly Washington's international U.S. image has been hurt by the CIA's torture. The CIA was never among the world's most trusted global brands, even among U.S. allies, but torture revelations have diminished U.S. claims to moral leadership and reduced its ""soft power."" An editorial in influential Spanish newspaper El Pais argued that the revelations mean the U.S. can no longer present itself as ""a beacon of freedom."" Releasing the report isn't what's hurt America's reputation -- making public and facing up to its mistakes are generally seen as a plus -- and the backlash attacks against American embassies and personnel overseas some warned would be triggered by the report's release hasn't happened. After Abu Ghraib and earlier revelations from Guantanamo it's not much of a shock for foreigners that the CIA tortured detainees and lied about it to other parts of the U.S. government, though details of rectal feeding and other abuses refreshed memories of what went on during the Bush presidency. Western government leaders have been fairly muted in their reaction to the revelations, and their responses have generally concentrated on applauding the U.S. for doing the right thing in owning up to its sins (the U.K. is facing a not dissimilar test of transparency now its 1970s treatment of the ""Hooded Men"" in Northern Ireland is under renewed scrutiny). There have been some calls for prosecutions of American officials, including from Members of the European Parliament and the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on Counterterrorism. But for governments complicit in hosting black sites or otherwise facilitating the CIA's torture, is difficult to condemn what happened too vigorously. U.S. allies that facilitated American torture might be nervous about closer scrutiny of where the CIA money went. ""To encourage governments to clandestinely host CIA detention sites, or to increase support for existing sites, the CIA provided millions of dollars in cash payments to foreign government officials,"" says the report. ""CIA Headquarters encouraged CIA Stations to construct a 'wish list' of proposed financial assistance to xxxxxxx [entities of foreign governments], and to 'think big' in terms of that assistance."" The Senate report estimates that the CIA Detention and Interrogation Program cost ""well over $300 million in non-personnel costs. This included funding for the CIA to construct and maintain detention facilities, including two facilities costing nearly $[number redacted] million that were never used..."" Following the release of the report, former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski admitted for the first time there had been a CIA ""black site"" in the country. Kwasniewski was in power from 1995 to 2005 and had previously denied the existence of a CIA site in Poland. Now he says there was a facility but that the Polish government had no knowledge of torture or mistreatment there.Around 50 countries are reported to have been involved in enabling the CIA program, either by hosting black sites or otherwise facilitating its operation. Some are now under pressure from their media and public for having enabled the torture, complicating their relationships with the US and making future co-operation more problematic. Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani described the revelations as shocking and inhumane, and announced that from now on the US would not be able to detain Afghans in the country. Lithuania and Romania are among the countries now exposed to possible international legal action for having hosted CIA torture facilities, and while the Thai government is keen to distance itself from the revelations, denying it hosted a secret prison, it is widely reported that Detention Site Green was based in the country.

President Bush's personal assurances to Irish government leaders that Shannon airport was not being used as a refueling stop for flights carrying detainees are still met with some skepticism in Europe, and after the guarantee given to Ireland the Bush White House told the European Union it wouldn't be offering assurances to other governments on a country-by-country basis. The revelations mean being seen as friends with the CIA is less attractive than ever, and will make it harder politically for some allies to partner with US intelligence agencies. But releasing the report was the right thing to do: in the long run continuing the coverup and refusing to admit what really happened would have hurt the U.S. far more."

As revelers nationwide bid goodbye to 2014, protesters brought in the new year by rallying in major U.S. cities, proving that the fight to end police brutality against black lives will not vanish anytime soon. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered to coincide with the evening’s celebrations. While the protests were more subdued than those held in recent weeks, many continued to rally and spread awareness of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. An activist holds her hands up during a protest march against police brutality that traveled from Union Square to Times Square on December 31, 2014 in New York City. About 100 protesters marched through New York City to Times Square on Wednesday evening where thousands were gathered to participate in the city’s popular New Year's Eve celebration. However, police reportedly blocked protesters from entering crowded areas and demonstrators instead staged “die-ins” in nearby areas. “Blow your whistle, raise your fist. We refuse to live life like this!” protesters chanted as they marched through the city. In Boston, activists held a peaceful protest outside the Boston Public Library where dozens of people staged a “die-in” to speak out against the recent deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice and Ezell Ford -- all of whom are black men who have lost their lives to police killings in the past year. Demonstrators protested and staged a die-in in Copley Square during First Night Boston 2015 on December 31, 2014 in Boston, Massachusetts Never in recent history has the concern over police brutality and racial profiling been more prevalent than it was in 2014. ""There's a lot of pressure for us not to do this but we thought it was a fundamental right that we have in this country,"" one protest organizer, Brock Satter, told CBS Boston. A small group of protesters gathered in Cleveland, Ohio, where 12-year-old Rice was shot and killed by a police officer in November. However, temperatures hit 20 degrees and the crowd reportedly began to disperse shortly before 11 p.m. “No New Year under this old system. We can't breathe,” signs read, a reference to Garner's death. Many of the night’s protests were organized by The Stop Mass Incarceration Network, which is a group committed to bringing an end to racial injustice in policing. The protests were planned to “Rock in the new year with resistance” as part of a collective effort to show the issues will not lose steam. Earlier on Wednesday, about 75 protesters stormed police headquarters in St. Louis with an “eviction notice” and called for amnesty for protesters charged with non-violent crimes. Five people were arrested while several other protesters were pepper-sprayed on camera. Meanwhile, signs posted on walls around the building read: ""We are informing you that the police department is scheduled to be reclaimed by its citizens today, December 31, 2014.” It was signed, “We the people.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/met-opera-a-new-merry-wid_b_6404302,1/1/2015,wilborn hampton,Met Opera: A New 'Merry Widow' With Renee Fleming In Widow's Weeds,"It is hard to imagine a merrier widow than Renee Fleming, and she swirls through the Metropolitan Opera's sumptuous new production of Franz Lehar's popular operetta The Merry Widow with the ease of a woman who knows what she wants and knows how to get it. Joined by Kelli O'Hara, the Broadway star making her operatic debut, and the reliable baritone Nathan Gunn, the new staging by the acclaimed theater director Susan Stroman is an opulent spectacle that opened with a gala New Year's Eve premiere and will be repeated 13 more times during the season. It is an eye-popping production that the Met also will make available to audiences around the world on Jan. 17 when the matinee performance is simulcast in more than 2,000 theaters in 69 countries as part of its Live in HD series. Fleming, who has a penchant for tackling new roles, can now add operetta and Hanna Glawari, the farmer's daughter from Pontevedro who married a banker and inherited his millions when he died on their honeymoon, to her long resume. She teases her reluctant wooer Count Danilo, splendidly sung by Gunn, with the finesse of a gambler and she tosses off Lehar's melodious tunes, especially the ""Vilja Song,"" like they were dollops of cream on a Sacher torte. O'Hara is a small revelation in her first operatic outing, making the transition from the Broadway stage to the Met opera house seem as easy as a subway ride uptown. Her lovely soprano carries to the family circle and her acting talent brings credibility to the complicated role of the flirtatious Valencienne, the ambassador's wife who dallies with a young French dandy. Stroman, who has five Tony Awards to her credit as director and choreographer of Broadway musicals, brought in the designer Julian Crouch to re-create a grand set, abounding in chandeliers, for the Pontevedro Embassy in Paris (possibly too grand for a country facing bankruptcy), and a terrace garden with a view of Sacre-Coeur in the distance that morphs into a gilded Chez Maxim nightclub for the final act. Augmenting this splendid evocation of Belle Epoque Paris are William Ivey Long's costumes, widow's weeds for Fleming like few widows have ever worn, black bare-shouldered dresses dripping with diamonds, and ravishing ball gowns for O'Hara and the ladies and grandiose military attire, complete with plumed tricorn hats, for the Pontevedrian aristocrats. While the new Merry Widow is breathtaking to look at and a pleasure to hear, the staging is not without problems. The energy level flags at times, especially in the opening act when the exposition of the plot is unfolding, and there are too many pauses in the action. Operetta, a forerunner of the modern-day musical comedy, needs to move at the pace of a Broadway show, and any lag between the music and dialogue only serves to lessen the audience's involvement or concentration. But these are problems that can be corrected as the overall fine cast performs it more often. This Merry Widow is best when it is singing and dancing. Stroman's strongest suit is her choreography and from the opening waltzes and polkas to acrobatic folk dances to the shouting, skirt-flinging high steps of the grisettes at Maxim's, including a can-can during the set change, the dancing is one of the show's biggest attractions. And O'Hara is a marvel in the scene where she joins the grisette chorus line. Like most operettas, the story of The Merry Widow is a simple one. Hanna, now the toast of Paris and pursued by a horde of suitors whether available or not, keeps them all at bay. But the Pontevedro ambassador to France, Baron Zeta, wants her to marry a Pontevedrian in order to keep her millions in her native country and save it from bankruptcy. The Baron tries to enlist Count Danilo, a profligate playboy attached to the embassy, to the task. But Danilo and Hanna have a history and Danilo is not inclined to marry anyway. And Hanna wants to hear those three little words ""I love you"" from Danilo's own lips before she will even consider him. Then there's Valencienne's missing fan, with those same words written on them by her would-be French lover, to further complicate Zeta's plan. It's all froth and frivolity, but so is a lot of opera and most operetta. And that can be fun too provided there are enough bubbles to keep things light and airy. There are times the new Met staging runs short of bubbles. Still, there is much to admire. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Gunn is excellent as Danilo, his rich baritone a familiar fixture at the Met, and his duet with Hanna, familiarly known as ""The Merry Widow Waltz,"" is worth waiting for. Thomas Allen brings the role of Baron Zeta to life and Carson Elrod, in his Met debut, adds some much-needed comic relief to the role of the embassy factotum Njegus.

More specifically, how do young photographers “make it” amid all the chaos? One way is through Foam, an important center of photography in Amsterdam that has been giving out annual awards for young talent over the past seven years. This year, from a pool of 1,473 candidates across 71 countries, 21 artists have been selected. For the winners, it’s an invaluable opportunity for professional growth. Their work is touring the world: first Amsterdam, then Paris; now, at the East Wing Gallery in Dubai, until January 10th. Foam’s goal is not only to make these promising artists known to the world but also to reflect on how photography in general is changing. As we look at the winners’ work, it becomes evident that the relationship between photography and contemporary art is getting stronger and stronger. Some examples? Take the Japanese duo Nerhol, who create portraits of people by using overlapping sheets. While they seem to be digital images, they’re actually deeply unique 3D creations. Or the Canadian Émilie Régnier, who went to Africa to tell the story of the lives of young Africans who are reckoning with their future. Then there are David Lynch’s disturbing scenes, which have inspired Johnny Briggs. The latter has created some panoramas or characters with semi-human aspects quite troubling to the viewer. Yoshinori Mizutani's spectacularly direct, intimate photography reveals tiny parrots scattered throughout the sky of Tokyo. And no one's ever had closer contact with the most affluent social classes of Beijing than Charles-Henry Bédué, who dives into the realm of clothes, shoes, purses, cell phones and food, all of which are becoming symbols of power in the country. Behold, 31 photographs that will show you the future of photography. This post originally appeared on The Huffington Post Italy and was translated into English.

An Oregon man with a history of hair-related misdemeanors allegedly got caught cutting off some of a woman's locks in an Oregon City Dollar Tree store, police said. Jared Walter, 27, has been arrested several times in the past for touching himself while secretly cutting a victim's hair, according to KPTV. This time, he didn't get off so easily. The 31-year-old victim said she could feel him cutting her hair while she waited in line to pay for her items. ""So I just immediately started screaming and you know yelling like, 'get away from me,'"" she told the station. ""He is obviously showing that he is in no spot to be in public and is not a safe person."" Walter fled, but police tracked him down nearby. They charged him with harassment and also slapped him with a parole violation. KPTV reports: Walter pleaded guilty in May 2013 to charges including third-degree sex abuse and misdemeanor public indecency. He was arrested after multiple reports of lewd acts on TriMet buses in Portland and Clackamas County. Witnesses and surveillance video helped lead police to Walter. He was sentenced to jail time instead of prison, because the crimes he pleaded guilty to were misdemeanors. He was also not required to register as a sex offender. The suspect's constant clandestine clippings have earned him the moniker ""The TriMet Barber."" He was also reportedly arrested more than five years ago after police say he applied superglue to a woman's hair and then cut it while riding the bus. He's currently in the Clackamas County Jail.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-york-city-murders-hit-record-low_n_6404470,1/1/2015,reuters,Murders In New York City Hit Record Low,"Jan 1 (Reuters) - Murders in New York fell to 328 in 2014, the fewest since the New York Police Department started keeping reliable numbers in 1963, the New York Times reported on Thursday. The biggest U.S. city, once notorious for high crime, had 328 killings last year, the newspaper said, citing police statistics. The figure is the lowest since at least 1963, when the police department began collecting reliable statistics, and is part of a decades-long fall in U.S. crime. Reports of major crimes in New York City fell to 105,428 through Dec. 28, from 110,728 in the same period in 2013. Murders are down 85 percent from their peak in 1990, the Times said. The New York Police Department did not have full-year crime statistics immediately available. Online police data showed 315 murders through Dec. 21, down from 328 for the same period the year before. Among other big U.S. cities in 2014, Chicago had the lowest number of murders since 1965 and the lowest overall crime rate since 1972, the Chicago Police Department said in a statement. In Philadelphia, violent crime was down 7 percent from 2013 through Dec. 21, though murders were slightly higher, police data showed. Los Angeles had a 12.3 percent upturn in violent crime through Dec. 27, according to the police website. New York recorded its first murder of 2015 when a 26-year-old man was shot in the Bronx borough, a police spokesman said. The next four years will change America forever.

There are a number of problems with this: Firstly, you may be so fabulous that you don't need or want to change any aspect of yourself. If you're happy with the way your life is, that's great -- and you don't need to feel pressured to lose weight, improve your appearance or spend more time with friends you don't really like that much. Secondly, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to make drastic life changes in January. In the northern hemisphere, January is a cold, dark and depressing month, and the last thing I need is to be expected to get through it without chocolate or whatever else I have over-optimistically given up. New Year's resolutions are also usually yearlong goals, and for most people, this can be too daunting, which just leads to failure. I have given up on the ""get healthier"" resolutions, and have tried to make smaller, more achievable goals like ""walk up the stairs when possible,"" which is made drastically easier by a phobia of elevators. Another possible alternative which, sadly I only thought of today, is starting to act on my resolutions at the start of December, which would prevent the unavoidable sense of failure felt on December 31 when you realize that you didn't even manage to stick to one goal you made a year ago. I had wanted to read one novel a week, so if I'd at least managed to read four books this month, I'd feel slightly better. The same goes with ""get healthier: style resolutions -- small changes are always going to get you further than ""don't eat chocolate, sugar or pizza"" resolutions, which despite my best efforts, I always manage to break by breakfast time on January 1. A nice idea is to make monthly goals in order to achieve something bigger which could seem daunting at first -- this works well with learning a new language, because you can aim to learn a certain number or words or phrases per week, and this builds up quickly over a number of months. As my New Year's resolution this year is not to make any, I have decided to take up a skill instead, which I feel has more of a positive spin than aggressively cutting something I love eating out of my diet. My goals for 2015 are to learn a new language and go to more exhibitions, and I am keeping my definitions of ""learn"" and ""more"" purposefully vague to avoid any feelings of disappointment when I enter 2016 a year from now, having visited two exhibitions and learnt four words of Portuguese. It is probably also worth remembering that despite what popular culture tells us, you don't need to wait until the New Year to make drastic life changes. If there is something you want to do to improve yourself or your life in general, you can start at any time. It's just probably best to take things slowly and make small-scale goals to avoid returning to square one after a couple of weeks.

Most, about 90 percent, don't want me to ask. Their shoulders slump, they look at the floor and they deflect. It breaks my heart -- not because they don't have one but because they get so down on themselves for having to say no. I'm here to say I get it. I've worn those shoes as a busy business owner myself. I never ask out of judgement or to shame anyone, but that's how they feel. Following are instructions for creating a very basic (and flexible) marketing plan that will bend with your ever-changing schedule. It is my new years gift to the countless professionals I've met who are making it happen, every day, running their businesses and legitimately do no not have time or the wherewithal to create a full-blown marketing plan for their business. Spend 20, okay maybe 30 minutes this week on this 4 step process and you'll have something to work with for 2015. Before we start, it's important to note that this is not your marketing consultant's marketing plan for your business in 2015 -- that comes later when you have a minute to gather your thoughts and realize you might be able to justify paying a professional. Nope, this is your ""I-run-the-business-have-no-extra-time-may-be-working-new-year's-day-seriously-no-time-for-a-big-thing"" plan. You will need a calendar, a highlighter, a pen or pencil and a handful of sticky notes. You can also do this on a computer/mobile device using your calendar app but for the quick half-hour in and out version, stick to analog. Step 1 - Highlight Dates Affected By Anything Set In StoneSo, standard holidays should be highlighted, the big conference you already paid to attend should be highlighted, Probably should go ahead and highlight date of the Super Bowl, Stanley Cup or US Open -- whatever you're into and might want to plan around. Highlight first and last days of school for the nearest district to your business. Highlight your birthday and the birthdays of those you should acknowledge. If you want to get fancy, use a different color for the personal stuff, but make sure it's highlighted if you need to be aware of it. Now highlight several days before and after any of the big holidays that might include promotions for your business. Those are key for build-up and wind down. Wondering why personal stuff might be on your marketing plan? Because you're busy running the business and it's important to plan around the big stuff in your own life -- it is meant to help you find balance without having to lose sight of everything on your plate. Step 2 - Write Down Events or Promos you are Pretty Sure Will HappenIf you always do a sidewalk sale the week before Christmas, write that down -- it should already be highlighted, at least partially. Do you have special offers for big local events or want to? Write it down. For example, in Austin every business should have SXSW convention and Austin City Limits music festival written on their calendar. These bring in business -- even if you're b2b, then it affects your client's businesses and you should be ready to work around it, prepare for it. If you know you are going to send out a monthly newsletter by email, write that down. Step 3 - Use the Sticky Notes to Put in Ideas for Promotions or ContentThey are sticky notes because you might move them around. I highly suggest you use the ""super sticky"" version of these magical notepads. They stay on and make this easier. For instance, always running behind when the holidays arrive because you've been too busy running the business to plan for a special promotion? Now is the time, yes in January, to plan for next year's special offers and marketing ideas. You have time to plan a little at a time and if it's on the calendar, you'll see it coming. Use the sticky notes to add in content ideas too -- what you might post on social media or in an email blast, or both. You can add stickies anytime, or email yourself if you're away and use the subject line ""marketing sticky"". Then you can find them easily when needed. Step 4 - Put it all in a file folder that sits on or near your deskKeep the plan an arm's length away. Consider writing down your social media and email marketing account logins on the inside of the folder. That way, if you need to delegate at any point, you can simply hand over the plan and that person can hit the ground running. If you need some marketing ideas, pull a sticky from one time to where you need it -- easy edits. If you find yourself answering the same question over and over, add a sticky note to share the answer with all of your followers and email subscribers. And that's pretty much it. What you have created is a living, breathing document that will change over time, will grow with your needs and can be adapted later. Again, it's not the work of a marketing Ph.D. -- it's a quick resource for the real world of a small business. You can finally say the words, ""Yes, I have a marketing plan"", knowing maybe It's not the end-all-be-all but it is at least a start. Hold your head high, plan in hand, ready to take on 2015. It's going to be a great year! #YouCanDoThis"
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biological-bad-luck-cancer_n_6404184,1/1/2015,reuters,Biological 'Bad Luck' Blamed In Two-Thirds Of Cancer Cases,"By Will Dunham WASHINGTON, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Plain old bad luck plays a major role in determining who gets cancer and who does not, according to researchers who found that two-thirds of cancer incidence of various types can be blamed on random mutations and not heredity or risky habits like smoking. The researchers said on Thursday random DNA mutations accumulating in various parts of the body during ordinary cell division are the prime culprits behind many cancer types. They looked at 31 cancer types and found that 22 of them, including leukemia and pancreatic, bone, testicular, ovarian and brain cancer, could be explained largely by these random mutations - essentially biological bad luck. The other nine types, including colorectal cancer, skin cancer known as basal cell carcinoma and smoking-related lung cancer, were more heavily influenced by heredity and environmental factors like risky behavior or exposure to carcinogens. Overall, they attributed 65 percent of cancer incidence to random mutations in genes that can drive cancer growth. ""When someone gets cancer, immediately people want to know why,"" said oncologist Dr. Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, who conducted the study published in the journal Science with Johns Hopkins biomathematician Cristian Tomasetti. ""They like to believe there's a reason. And the real reason in many cases is not because you didn't behave well or were exposed to some bad environmental influence, it's just because that person was unlucky. It's losing the lottery."" Tomasetti said harmful mutations occur for ""no particular reason other than randomness"" as the body's master cells, called stem cells, divide in various tissues. Tomasetti said the study indicates that changing one's lifestyle and habits like smoking to avoid cancer risks may help prevent certain cancers, but may not be as effective for others. ""Thus, we should focus more research and resources on finding ways to detect such cancers at early, curable stages,"" Tomasetti added. The researchers charted the cumulative number of lifetime divisions in the stem cells of a given tissue - for example, lungs or colon - and compared that to the lifetime cancer risk in that tissue. Generally speaking, tissues that undergo more divisions - thus increasing the probability of random mutations - were more prone to tumors.

No doubt some Members of Congress - presumably, the ones who aren't busy resigning for felony tax evasion or defending themselves for schmoozing with white supremacists -- will try to gin up an outrage festival and demand sanctions on the Palestinians for exercising their rights. ""Ring out the old, bring in the new."" Let's ignore these voices. Let's see if we can find ten conscientious Members of Congress who are willing to say, ""Actually, the Palestinians have the right to do this if they want, and they shouldn't be punished for signing up for the rule of law."" It's kind of funny, in a not ha-ha way, how twisted the public discourse in the U.S. is, that we even have to defend the proposition that the Palestinians should join the ICC if they want. But we do. Exhibit A: this New York Times editorial, slamming Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for applying for Palestine to join the ICC. The ""liberal"" NYT editors concede that ""prospects for a two-state solution grow dimmer by the day, with ... the Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, steadily expanding settlements, making the creation of a viable Palestinian state harder,"" and that ""in joining the International Criminal Court...the Palestinians could bring charges against Israeli officials for cases against their settlement activities."" But then -- in complete contradiction to that which they just conceded -- they claim that ""Abbas's actions will almost certainly make the situation worse, setting back the cause of statehood even farther."" Sadly, like still-too-many American liberals, the NYT editors claim to oppose Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank, but object far more strenuously to anyone actually trying to do anything concrete to stop it. Is it any wonder that ""prospects for a two-state solution grow dimmer by the day,"" when the purported tribunes of American liberalism oppose any practical and concrete measure to try to save it? Fortunately, in 2015, we don't need to rely on the ""liberal"" New York Times to defend the basic principles of decency and fair play. We can do it ourselves. You can write to Congress and the President here."

Called ""Only One,"" the track is sung by West from the vantage point of his late mother, Donda West, with McCartney adding accompaniment on keyboard. ""One day, you'll be the man you always knew you would be,"" West sings. ""And if you knew how proud I was, you'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that."" A press release announcing the song said ""Only One"" was the ""first publicly available recording from what has become a prolific musical collaboration between these two legendary artists."" The release also included some backstory on the project: In early 2014, Paul McCartney and Kanye West first began working together in a small bungalow in Los Angeles. The process that would result in ""Only One"" began with a simple brainstorming session between the two: With McCartney improvising on the keyboards and Kanye vocally sketching and shaping ideas in a stream-of-consciousness riff. When they played back the recording afterward, something remarkable happened. Kanye sat there with his family, holding his daughter North on his lap, and listened to his vocals, singing, ""Hello, my only one . . . "" And in that moment, not only could he not recall having sung those words, but he realized that perhaps the words had never really come from him. The process of artistic creation is one that does not involve thinking, but often channeling. And he understood in that moment that his late mother, Dr. Donda West, who was also his mentor, confidante, and best friend, had spoken through him that day. ""My mom was singing to me, and through me to my daughter,"" he said, astonished. We're in, and so is Kanye's wife, Kim Kardashian: People always ask me what my favorite Kanye song is and it's Only One. Kanye feels like his mom sang thru him to our daughter. I cry every time I hear this song Listen to the track over at West's website; it's also available for purchase on iTunes. Check out the lyrics to ""Only One,"" via West's site, below.

Hermann, who played Richard Gilmore on the fan-favorite TV show, died on Wednesday at the age of 71. Speaking to TV Line, Graham paid the following tribute. Ed Herrmann’s combination of pure charisma plus his distinctive voice lit up any room he entered. He had a gentlemanly manner, a wicked sense of humor, and a sharp wit. He was well-read, interesting, and just plain fun to be around. He had deep respect and love for the craft of acting and led by example. You wanted to be better prepared, or just plain better, because he always was. He brought such humor and humanity to all his work, but I know the character of Richard Gilmore had a special place in his heart. He loved our show and was touched by the enthusiasm of its fans. Graham also took to Twitter on Wednesday to remember the actor. My friend Ed Herrmann was the kindest, classiest, most talented man. It was an honor and a joy to know him, a devastating blow to lose him. Kelly Bishop, who played Herrmann's character's wife on the show, also spoke to TV Line about the star.

And a little hair of the dog always does the trick! Actually, dietitians argue that you're setting yourself up for a compound hangover by drinking your morning-after breakfast. We suggest you ignore the dietitians and combine booze with your favorite hangover-busting cures, just like in these kick-ass cocktails. We tasked Dave Shenaut -- former Oregon Bartenders Guild president and current bar director at Raven & Rose -- with doing just that.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/6-things-that-barack-obam_b_6403848,1/1/2015,matthew lynch,6 Things That Barack Obama Did for P-20 Education in 2014,"When Barack Obama assumed the presidency, a nasty set of problems confronted him in P-20 education. High student loan debt, lack of affordable early childhood education options and everything in between were put in the President's lap and have been the very issues he has addressed in both terms. Given the nature and sheer number of challenges, his administration has done a great deal to foster positive change and progress. In a bid to build upon his already stellar record on education Obama implemented a number of education reform initiatives in 2014. 1. Making colleges accountable for standardized test scores. In April, President Obama announced that colleges with education programs would soon be held accountable for the future standardized test scores of the pupils of their graduates, at least when it comes to federal fund incentives. The president's proposal plans to reward nearly $100 million per year in federal grants to education schools that have proven to turn out the best teachers -- some of that measured in the standardized test scores graduates are producing in their classrooms. Federal scholarship aid, then, will be based less on student need and more on the performance of graduates from those programs. 2. Plans to improve teacher preparation. The Obama administration unveiled a plan this year to regulate how the U.S. prepares teachers, stating that too many new K-12 educators are not trained properly or ready for the classroom. Under the proposal, the government would require states to issue report cards for teacher preparation programs at public universities and private colleges. Alternative programs run by school districts and nonprofits would not be exempt. For the first time, the rating systems would reflect on how teacher candidates perform after graduation. The system would consider whether they accept jobs in their subject field, how long they stay and how their students perform academically. The proposed changes will not take effect immediately; states would not be required to issue report cards for teacher programs until April of 2019. Under the proposal, states would rate programs as ""low-performing,"" ""at-risk,"" ""effective"" or ""exceptional."" Programs receiving ratings of ""low-performing"" or ""at-risk"" for two consecutive years would lose federal Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grants, which give up to $4,000 a year to teacher preparation candidates who consent to work full time for four academic years in high-need fields and struggling schools. While there is no evidence these regulations will lead to improvement, the proposed plan does seem to be on the right track to prepare our country's teachers for the reality of the modern day U.S. classroom. It is in everyone's best interest to train teachers right from the start to ensure our students are getting the best instruction possible from day one. 3. Tightened rules for undocumented K-12 students. This year the Obama administration strengthened its stance on protecting public school students who are undocumented immigrants. The policy includes guidelines on appropriate and inappropriate enrollment practices and it takes the place of similar wording from 2011. The guidelines are just a small piece of a larger push for immigration reform from the Obama Administration. In 2011, Obama showed his support for immigrants and their right to education when he enacted the Dream Act that halted deportations of students and in some cases, their families. While the student portion of this legislation got a lot of attention, it also took a closer look at avoiding deportations of low-priority immigrants without criminal records. Immigration reform is certainly a hot topic in Washington, especially as education funding seems to always be feeling a tight squeeze. Providing education to undocumented immigrant children, however, is an investment in the future economy of the country and should be considered a right -- even for those who have entered the country illegally, but not of their own accord. 4. Worked to improve Native American education. President Barack Obama has pledged to work with tribal nations to make sure Native Americans have equal educational and economic opportunities. The President said the administration is determined to partner with tribes, and that the relationship with Washington and tribal nations is the strongest it has ever been. His intended efforts include the expansion of opportunity among Native Americans. Dozens of steps intended to improve the Bureau of Indian Education are being rolled out by the administration with the goal of boosting the academic achievement of Native American students, and also support economic development in tribal communities. The efforts include creating a blueprint for redesigning the Bureau of Indian Education and supporting digital learning by providing schools and dormitories with high-speed Internet. I am so glad that Obama recognizes the many issues Native Americans in this country are facing. They deserve to have equal education and economic opportunities like the rest of us. I think Obama's efforts are spot on and hope that very soon, Native Americans will benefit from the changes he has initiated. 5. Implemented a millennial initiative that targets student loan debt.The Obama Administration formed an initiative targeted at Millennials (currently ages 18 to 34) and some of their most important life issues, including student loan assistance, technology use, job placement and educational spending by the government. The President's emphasis on the cost of higher education will certainly appeal to Millennials, many of whom came of age during the economic decline and are still thousands of dollars in debt from student loans. Addressing these concerns, along with how the government should and will help Millennials work through them, shows an understanding from the administration that seems to be lacking on the other side of the aisle. It's no secret that Millennials are increasing in influence but also face financial insecurity. The Millennial age group is also the most dominant electoral group and is expected to show a lot of influence in the midterm elections. Addressing the issues of this youngest adult generation is smart because it impacts the rest of the country too. The more secure Millennials are in their careers, finances and other areas of life, the better off the country as a whole. 6. Announced a $1 billion early education investment. In December, President Obama announced $1 billion in early education investments that will come from a combination of public and private commitments. Speaking at the White House Summit on Early Education, the President laid out the details for Invest in US, a public awareness campaign meant to bring attention to the great need for high quality early childhood education throughout the country. The campaign will run in partnership with the First Five Years initiative and its participating philanthropic organizations. The next four years will change America forever.

The President said that $333 million has already been committed by private partners, and another $750 million in federal funding will go towards programs like Early Head Start and the Preschool Development Grants. The President has been a staunch supporter of stronger early childhood education programs with federal backing since he first took office. This move represents more than just rhetoric, however. It shows the President's commitment to putting plans in motion to give American children, regardless of income, a chance to reap the proven benefits of early childhood endeavors. The first step to having K-12 students who are able to meet the academic demands of the contemporary classroom is to enroll those students first in strong preschool programs -- and that starts with making it affordable for all families.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-the-sony-hack-is-chan_b_6403808,1/1/2015,adam levin,How the Sony Hack Is Changing the Way I Work,"If the past two years have revealed anything, it's that every conceivable mode of communication comes with its share of serious privacy and security issues. Email can be hijacked, mail servers can be breached and malware can turn your smartphone into a peepshow. Wikileaks revealed that even our phone conversations are at risk. That said, don't panic! It's highly unlikely anyone is listening to your phone calls. (OK, it's possible, but you'd have to be incredibly sloppy or unlucky enough to download call-intercepting malware, or targeted by folks who can handle a price tag that hovers north of the million-dollar mark.) The more relevant point here is that the Big Data mills at the NSA that may or may not be crunching your calls don't care if you're negotiating the sale of Ford to General Motors, much less if you've been naughty or nice - unless you're a world leader or someone perceived as a threat to America. So what about the other, more likely ways you may be exposed? There are man-in-the-middle attacks that are fairly affordable for a hacker. There's malware from friend (hard to spot) and foe (you can't be alert to every danger every second of the day). It almost seems like the only way to be completely safe from intrusion is to have nothing you wouldn't want broadcast or skywritten on your smartphone, nothing you wouldn't want the world to know about in your browser history, not a single text message you want to keep private and no phone calls made or received that you don't want to share with Dr. Phil and his audience. This past year was nothing less than terrifying. JPMorgan Chase and Home Depot joined the ever-growing list of mega-breach victims. Sony Pictures was gutted, with career-killing emails sent hither and yon, servers erased and trade secrets and intellectual property joyously tossed like flower petals from a float in the Rose Bowl parade. The hack initially stopped the release of The Interview, costing the studio millions, and that's not taking into account future losses associated with class-action lawsuits brought by current and former employees whose personally identifiable information was stolen and published for the world to see, or enforcement actions by various and sundry state and federal regulators. It's major stuff. And then there were all those other cybercrimes of 2014. It all makes for a really uneasy feeling at the workplace. The trend here is simply too clear: Nothing is sacrosanct and nothing is beyond reach. And while there may be no way to keep prying eyes out of our email, there is a way to keep the most sensitive information pertaining to your business out of reach. With that thought foremost in my mind, it is, indeed, time to make some serious changes in 2015. Call me old-fashioned, but I think I'd rather take my chances with the government listening to my phone calls. How about you? When I say, ""phone call,"" I mean literally, like, on the phone -- and I say this because of all the ways we communicate, a landline affords the better shot at privacy and a more secure mode of communication. The act of getting out of a chair and walking down the corridor to talk to a colleague helps to burn off holiday excesses, builds inter-office rapport and can't be hacked. Email and text have supplanted the collegial walk-by. There are those who will say that it's not efficient to pick up the phone. I'm not sure I buy that. Email and text streamline workflow only in theory. Each is just a swipe or click away from the major time-sucks provided by social media. And the interaction that happens without the interference of keystrokes or thumbing a screen provides sparks that just don't happen in the dynamic-free zone of tit-for-tat correspondence. And again, a face-to-face or headset-to-headset conversation is probably the most secure mode of communication in the post-Sony hack world.

I'm sure it will take some getting used to, but if anyone at my office needs a fast answer from me, I'm going to ask that whenever possible they tap my doorframe or give me call. Beyond the security considerations, the truth is that I actually like talking to people and I ultimately learn more about whatever it is we're talking about. For all their convenience, emails and texts are far from perfect modes of communication. Much meaning is lost when communicating by keystroke. Anyone who's emailed a sarcastic quip that was taken literally will confirm this. There are other options. Sony Pictures had to revert to communication via fax during the days following the hack, but faxes leave too much to chance since you never know who's waiting on the other end of your transmission, and there's the added possibility that you might dial a wrong number. If smoke signals weren't so easy to spot, I'd suggest that route. And while it's true that you never know when a fake cell tower's going to roll into your neighborhood, using the phone and having more face-to-face discussions at the office are perhaps the better ways to engage in team building in 2015 through a group commitment to data security.

The massive sinkhole located in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Belize was made popular by pioneering conservationist Jacques Cousteau, who visited it in 1971 and declared it one of the world's best scuba diving sites. The researchers analyzed sediment samples from the Blue Hole, looking specifically at variations in color, grain size, and layer thickness. They also examined samples from the Belize Central Shelf Lagoon, a body of water attached to the mainland, noting differences in the samples' ratio of titanium to aluminum, which helps provide an estimate for rainfall levels. The analyses revealed low levels of precipitation and a drop in the frequency of tropical cyclones from 800 to 900 A.D. in the Yucatan peninsula--which suggests the region was hit by a major drought at the time, the researchers told The Huffington Post in an email. The research also suggested that another major drought hit the region between 1000 and 1100 A.D., around when the Maya city of Chichen Itza is believed to have fallen. ""When you have major droughts, you start to get famines and unrest,"" study co-author Dr. André Droxler, an earth scientist at Rice, told Live Science. The research on the lagoon was presented on Dec. 16 at the American Geophysical Union's 2014 Fall Meeting in San Francisco, and the study on the Blue Hole samples was published Jan. 2014 in the journal Scientific Reports. The research builds upon previous studies suggesting climate change precipitated the Mayas' downfall. A 2012 study of a stalagmite from a cave in Belize linked the region's population collapse to a ""drying trend"" between 600 and 1000 A.D. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-2015-gop-clown-car-bi_b_6402678,1/1/2015,richard zombeck,"The 2015 GOP Clown Car: Bigger, Meaner, and More Dangerous Than Ever","Another year gone and another string of long-winded, factually inaccurate, and manufactured comments from the clowns in the Republican Party are behind us. With every passing year that the little clown car pulls up it seems to get a little bigger and every year more and more clowns pour out and step up to the podium to obfuscate and pontificate. Nearly everything they say would lead one to believe that they are impervious to reality and yet their statements are made in such a way and with such confidence that it's as if they had received the message from God Himself. When you pay attention to the news and politics as much as I do, you get to a point where a facepalm is a frequent occurrence. Eventually eye rolls are more common. And hopefully, if you've managed to maintain a shred of your sanity, you get the occasional chuckle out of hearing someone in politics bloviate about something they apparently know nothing about. Having any faith in humanity makes it hard to believe or accept that some of these folks actually believe what they're saying. Common sense would dictate otherwise, but not everyone is blessed with common sense. After all, people vote for morons, usually against their own best interest, and people watch FOX News despite evidence that the channel gets its facts wrong more than 50 percent of the time. In fact, Fox News host Sean Hannity got the award for ""Worst Host"" in a poll conducted by the Mediaite website. Mediaite asked fellow media members to pick the best and worst of cable news networks: Fox, MSNBC, and CNN. Respondents were told that their votes would be kept anonymous to encourage honesty. Hannity won hands down and he didn't take it well as evidenced by an epic, public, all caps, tantrum on Twitter. The most ridiculous comments seem to come from Republicans and I would defy anyone to say otherwise. I have yet to see anyone come up with a list of comments from liberals that comes close, in volume or content, to lists of stupid things Republicans or conservatives say on a fairly regular and consistent basis. It might be low hanging fruit, but there's a lot of it and every time one of them opens their mouths America becomes a little more ignorant. Hannity isn't alone. The Republicans, as a whole, have been wrong about nearly everything this past year. As Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman writes in the New York Times: All year Americans have been bombarded with dire news reports portraying a world out of control and a clueless government with no idea what to do. Yet if you look back at what actually happened over the past year, you see something completely different. Amid all the derision, a number of major government policies worked just fine -- and the biggest successes involved the most derided policies. You'll never hear this on Fox News, but 2014 was a year in which the federal government, in particular, showed that it can do some important things very well if it wants to. There are some good points in the article and Krugman provides some clear examples of how the Republicans were ridiculously wrong about their cartoonish view of a tyrannical, weak, and useless government. Among the issues the right-wing clown machine got wrong were Ebola, the economy, and health care according to Krugman. While the GOP was busy spreading fear and propaganda, the rest of us watched as Ebola was not the epidemic that would wipe out the country the way the pre-midterm hysteria made it out to be. As it turns out the CDC (a government agency) knows what they're doing and America wasn't over run with Ebola or members of ISIS and Mexican drug cartels flesh-eating disease carrying zombies. The GOP gave it their best shot, though. Representative Phil Gingrey (GA) tried to tell us that illegal immigrants were carrying Ebola across the border via drug gangs: As a physician for over 30 years, I am well aware of the dangers infectious diseases pose. In fact, infectious diseases remain in the top 10 causes of death in the United States... Reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis are particularly concerning. Rep. Steve Stockman (TX) thought there was something more nefarious afoot and that any potential action or inaction by the federal government would somehow lead to American citizens losing their rights and freedom: It's just a strange non-response, a strange way of handling it and I think that if it does go forward and we do not control it, there may be an overreaction where the government starts taking away the rights of those that aren't that necessarily involved or need that to happen,"" he said. ""I hope that's not the case, but as you know this current government uses crisis to advance their philosophy and their agenda. In the end, conveniently after the midterms, it turned out that Ebola was limited to less than a half-dozen people in the U.S. and only one person died. We haven't heard about it since. The economy has improved dramatically. Private sector jobs are increasing, the stock market is going gangbusters, gas prices are down, and last quarter the economy showed the fastest growth in a decade. Forbes magazine even had the audacity to say that Obama's economy out-performed that of the GOPs lord and savior, the great Ronald Reagan. Not bad for a Muslim-Nazi-business-hating communist. That brings us to Obamacare, the single most hated GOP issue. Ten million more people with health insurance, most for the first time and tens of thousands of lives saved in a single year. Sure, the website didn't run too well for a month and that was covered ad nauseam on every news channel and pointed out by every member of the GOP around the clock, but when it comes to lives saved and made better? Crickets. Add to the obvious benefits that tens of thousands of bankruptcies and ruined lives that will be avoided. The media and the GOP went completely dark on the entire up-side. Apparently a lack of suffering doesn't make headlines. On Obamacare, Krugman writes: In fact, Year 1 surpassed expectations on every front. Remember claims that more people would lose insurance than gained it? Well, the number of Americans without insurance fell by around 10 million; members of the elite who have never been uninsured have no idea just how much positive difference that makes to people's lives. Remember claims that reform would break the budget? In reality, premiums were far less than predicted, overall health spending is moderating, and specific cost-control measures are doing very well. And all indications suggest that year two will be marked by further success. While the GOP fought affordable health care every step of the way by delaying, trying to repeal it, blocking, and even shutting down the government in the name of liberty, human suffering, and needless deaths, Obamacare remains, for now, a reality. The list of other things that Republicans were wrong about is fairly long, but here are a few that Krugman didn't get to that stand out. Marriage equality has been accepted by most of the country and children haven't magically become gay or started having sex with farm animals. Marijuana has been legalized for full use in two states and medical use in others and no cartels have taken over Midwestern towns -- in fact, drug cartels are out billions of dollars as a result. Obama's immigration policies haven't allowed swarms of illegal immigrants into the country with calves the size of cantaloupes and pregnant women from ISIS haven't dropped anchor babies on U.S. soil. Minimum wage has gone up in multiple states and corporations haven't moved to third world countries or had to apply for welfare. And you can now buy a Cuban cigar without being shot in the street. All in all, despite the GOPs best efforts, things have gone pretty well and some significant things have been accomplished. The next four years will change America forever.

A car full of gun loving, poor hating, veteran screwing, climate change denying, Wall Street deregulating, health care repealing, and wealthy old white man loving clowns. Their plans so far include repealing Dodd-Frank, cutting and privatizing social security, cutting pensions, defunding Obamacare, eliminating food stamps and welfare, raising taxes on the middle class and working poor, cutting taxes for the super-rich and corporations, and who knows how many other Benghazi, IRS, and impeachment hearings we'll have to endure. They have the numbers to do what they want and by this time next year we could be having a completely different conversation in a completely different country. While it hasn't been a great year, I'm thankful that the GOP has provided me with the low hanging fruit only they are capable of providing and I'm looking forward to 2015 and the prospect of more ridiculous claims and comments.

Well, of course it’s not that simple; for one thing, the earth is not as flat as the pages of a map, so maps must be distorted to some degree. Choices must be made about which towns and cities will be put on the map, where to draw certain borders. To some extent, nearly every map contains an agenda, whether political, sociological, or commercial. A recent book by Tim Bryars and Tom Harper, A History of the 20th Century in 100 Maps, charts the political and social upheavals of the last century by means of maps, digging below the functional surface to reveal how maps of the time reflected popular ideas, prejudices, and waves of progress. The 20th century, the authors explain, was a particularly fertile time for mapmakers, and the book showcases maps in the form of picture postcards, board games, and book endpapers, maps meant for government purposes and maps intended for mass consumption. The highly eclectic result serves in itself as a reminder of the myriad ways in which we see and interpret the world around us. The map excerpted below, a 1900 board game entitled A Trip to the Continent, may only seem like a map in the loosest sense, but its depiction of the geography and travel routes between England and Continental Europe offers a telling glimpse into its era. Though no rulebook is available, players would presumably race from London to Berlin, choosing from three available routes and likely using dice or a spinner to determine their progress. The game seems painfully simple, but the layout is fascinating. As the authors note, “A decade later a ‘race to Berlin’ would have carried entirely different connotations, but in the years leading up to the Great War, Germany was one of the top tourist destinations.” The concept of continental travel as a popular pastime also bespeaks the increasing ease of international travel around the turn of the 20th century, the authors point out: “Travel would never again be the preserve of a monied elite … Some Britons were already seeking out unspoiled corners where they wouldn’t hear another English voice, especially a ‘cockney’ or lower-class one.” Sound familiar? Here's the full board game, excerpted with permission from A History of the Twentieth Century in 100 Maps; for more about the game and 99 other fascinating maps from the previous century, consult the full book:  Reprinted with permission from A History of the Twentieth Century in 100 Maps by Tim Bryars and Tom Harper, published in the United States by the University of Chicago Press.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reading-challenges_n_6401738,1/1/2015,claire fallon,The Problem With Reading Competitively,"Many of us readers like to think of ourselves as unlike everyone else. We’re not macho or ego-driven, but retiring, introspective, and thoughtful, right? But anyone who’s spent time around bookworms knows we can be deeply competitive, whether we’re airily noting the time we read War and Peace in seventh grade or offhandedly mentioning that we read 200 books a year, no big deal. These two forms of literary competition tend to belong to warring factions, the snobs and the every-reader. The snob turns up her nose at the idea that reading 15 Y.A. books means anything at all, as she prefers to read Dostoevsky; the every-reader reviles snobs who “tell people how to read,” but often loves to humblebrag about how many books (Y.A. or non-) he plowed through last week. Regardless, we’re almost all competing, on some level, to be the best, most readery reader we know. Increasingly, with literary snobbishness on its heels (after all, it’s hard to love a snob), the every-reader seems to be dictating the rules, and the rules of the game are: read more books and win. New Year’s is a particularly competitive season, as we tot up our year’s worth of books and set more ambitious goals for next year. People write articles or tweets about their own reading resolutions, and suddenly even our ambitious goals seem pathetic, and must be augmented again. One writer felt the need to assure readers that though she’s not taking the Goodreads Reading Challenge in 2015, she’ll probably still read 100 books this year -- yes, even when we’re not competing, we’re competing. Admittedly, it’s hard to resist a little competition. For those of us who loved reading as kids, we quickly learned to associate reading massive piles of books with earning Accelerated Reader points and personal pan pizzas, and it’s hard to let go of that feeling of urgency even when we supposedly mature. My boyfriend has even gotten into it by proxy. Recently, he mentioned that a friend had told him that his wife reads 10 books a month. In a somewhat smug tone, he added, “I bet you read more than that, though, right?” Yep, just two bros, arguing over whose significant other reads more books every 30 days. I felt a petty urge to say “Yeah, of course,” but I knew I couldn’t -- and what’s more, I suddenly hated the part of myself that cared about “winning.” There’s a quote I often see on literary Pinterests and Facebook walls, usually Photoshopped onto an image of dusty bookshelves: “In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.” This quote, attributed to Mortimer J. Adler, the author of How to Read a Book, espouses an easy-to-love sentiment: It’s not about winning, but about having a rich experience. Yet how many of us self-identified bookworms love to casually drop into conversation that we read a book a day, or avidly update our Goodreads pages to ensure everyone knows we’ve read yet another book? Last year, my New Year’s resolution was to be a better reader, and it led to a blissful year of reading. Instead of spending my evenings with Netflix, I spent them with novels -- usually -- and I convinced my boyfriend to lower the volume of his football games so I could read on the couch without finding myself watching NFL RedZone all day. After starting as an editor at HuffPost Books, things have only gotten better. A friend asked me the other day if reading for work makes it less fun, and I honestly answered no; reading is a skill that grows more pleasurable and fulfilling the more we practice it, and being pushed to read more only enhances my joy in it. That said, I shy away from set resolutions to read a certain number of books next year. Pushing myself to read more and more books can lead to undesirable consequences -- dismissing longer or more difficult books as too much of a time investment, racing through books that would yield more if I read them more slowly. I don't just want to become a more prolific reader, but a better reader, and, in the words of Mortimer Adler, ""You must tackle books that are beyond you ... unless you stretch, you will not learn.""

Log in to hide these messages. There’s a small, competitive voice in my head urging me to make 2015 the year I read more books than ever, but my New Year’s resolution is to ignore that voice. I’m not even going to resolve to read the “impressive” books I shamefully long to be able to drop into party conversation, like Ulysses or Infinite Jest, though I plan to read them someday (apparently they're pretty good). Instead, I’m just resolving to use my reading time more meaningfully, not getting through books but letting them get through to me. I want to take more notes, maybe even annotate my pristine pages, and invest my time in fully exploring those books that offer the most to me as a reader. I want 2015 to be the year that I don’t pick up the 170-page book solely because the 600-page one would prevent me from carving new notches on my bookcase. After all, one of the best books I read this year demanded great commitment and many hours from me -- far more than most I read -- and it was worth every second. I want to read complex, stylized books like Eimear McBride’s A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing slowly, deliberately, examining the artistic choices and subtleties of meaning, not hastily, with a buzz in the back of my head reminding me of all the other books I need to get to next. We’ve long been proponents here at HuffPost Books of unaccelerated, even slow reading. This year, I am resolving to apply that philosophy more mindfully to my own reading practices. Here’s hoping that we’ll all stop feeling like we have to read at the speed of light -- and make sure everyone knows -- in the new year.

La actividad aeróbica o los ejercicios que necesitan de más oxigeno como caminar, trotar, nadar, bailar, esquiar, pedalear, favorecen el sistema cardiovascular, disminuyen la presión sanguínea y mejoran la circulación, lo que reduce el riesgo de ataques cardíacos y accidentes cerebrovasculares. 2. Ayuda en la prevención de cáncer de colon, ya que acelera el paso de los desechos por los intestinos. Asimismo, al regular los niveles hormonales, puede contribuir a evitar el cáncer de mama y de próstata. 3. Hacer ejercicio contribuye a una mejor salud mental, reduce el estrés, la ansiedad e incluso las fobias y los ataques de pánico. Es muy funcional como apoyo en el tratamiento contra la depresión, tan efectivo como los medicamentos, pero sin efectos secundarios. 4. El impacto en los huesos es muy positivo. En los niños puede aumentar la densidad ósea, en los adolescentes los fortalece y en la vida adulta retrasa la degeneración. Puede prevenir la osteoporosis. 5. Con el ejercicio el sistema inmune se acelera de manera temporal, aumenta su capacidad y defensas para el organismo. 6. Realizar actividad física con regularidad ayuda a mantener un nivel saludable de azúcar en la sangre, que no sólo contribuye a controlar el peso, sino a evitar el riesgo de padecer diabetes tipo 2. 7. Con el ejercicio puedes mantener tu peso ideal, ya que si quemas calorías es posible que alcances un equilibrio de energía. 8. El flujo de oxígeno al cerebro aumenta, por lo que la capacidad de aprendizaje, concentración, memoria y estado de alerta pueden mejorar de manera considerable. 9. Beneficia la calidad del sueño. Un estilo de vida activo puede significar un sueño más reparador y profundo, que estimula la concentración en el día, aumenta tu productividad y propicia un mejor estado de ánimo. 10. En los músculos, no sólo aumenta la oxigenación, tono, fuerza y volumen, también favorece la flexibilidad, la fuerza de los tendones y los ligamentos.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-breakthrough-with-cuba_b_6401040,1/1/2015,"william m. leo gr,e",The Breakthrough With Cuba: How It Happened and What Happens Next,"For weeks, rumors had been swirling around Washington and Havana that changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba were in the works. Then, on December 17, President Barack Obama and President Raúl Castro made simultaneous announcements of a radical change in relations between the two countries. Not only would USAID subcontractor Alan Gross and the three remaining Cubans spies of the Cuban Five be going home -- which was the deal most observers had anticipated -- but Cuba and the United States also would expand trade and travel, and restore full diplomatic relations. Although President Obama had said repeatedly that he thought the old policy of isolation and hostility toward Havana no longer made any sense, for six years he did little to change it. Then in one announcement, he reversed 50 years of U.S. policy, completely revamping the basic framework and premises of the relationship. What happened to finally break the log-jam? First, the political calculus changed. Recent polls from the Atlantic Council and Florida International University showed that the public in general and Cuban-Americans in particular supported reconciliation between Washington and Havana. Comments by prominent exiles like Alfie Fanjul and the Barcardi family expressing a desire to do business in Cuba showed that even stalwart anti-Castro leaders in the community were ready for change. Hillary Clinton's public declaration that the embargo ought to be lifted, and former Governor Charlie Crist's promise to go to Cuba during his gubernatorial run indicated that seasoned politicians recognized the shifting mood of the electorate. Weighing the evidence, the White House concluded that Cuba was no longer the third rail of Florida politics. And of course, Obama doesn't have to run for re-election anyway. The president deferred to Florida Democrats by not acting until after the mid-term elections, just as he did in 2010 when he delayed announcing more liberal travel regulations until January 2011. But the political decision to do something on Cuba had already been made and negotiations with Havana were already underway. Most of the foreign-policy establishment concluded long ago that Washington's policy of hostility toward Havana made no sense, but because Cuba was a low priority issue during Obama's first term, establishment figures rarely spoke out about it -- until they began to sense that the policy was in flux. When 44 former U.S. government officials signed an open letter to the president in May 2014 urging him to deepen U.S. engagement with the island, Cuba-watchers speculated that something must be afoot. Hardliners who opposed any change in U.S. policy (except to make it tougher) thought so, too, because they counter-attacked with a letter of their own signed by 17 members of Congress urging Obama to stand firm. Then the New York Times editorial board weighed in with not one but six editorials urging dramatic changes in policy toward Cuba. The unprecedented barrage of long, tightly argued pieces reverberated across the country, prompting both the Washington Post and Miami Herald to run counterpoints urging Obama to leave the policy of hostility in place. Surely, the rumor mill speculated, the venerable New York Times would not run such a series of editorials without at least talking with administration officials. And surely they would not waste so much ink if the White House signaled that the policy was set in stone. Ergo, the policy must be ripe for change. With a Republican Congress, Obama had no choice but to rely on executive authority to make the opening to Cuba. His willingness to use that power expansively on immigration reform implied that he realized any achievements during his last two years in office would have to be made despite Congress rather than with it. The Republican threats of lawsuits and appropriations cuts over immigration reform did not deter him from flexing his executive muscles yet again on Cuba, even if it meant throwing gasoline on the partisan political fire. Among Obama's initiatives is a directive to Secretary of State John Kerry to review Cuba's inclusion in the State Department's list of countries that sponsor international terrorism. Presumably, Kerry will remove Cuba from the list since there's no sensible rationale for it still being there. But taking Cuba off the terrorism list requires notification of Congress, which will give the likes of Senators Bob Menendez, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz a forum and an opportunity to lambast Obama's new policy. During the early December confirmation hearing for Tony Blinken, Obama's nominee to be Deputy Secretary of State, Menendez threatened a ""very significant response"" if the president changed Cuba policy without first consulting him. The other opportunity for the senators to howl will come when Obama nominates our new ambassador to Cuba. But even if Menendez and Cruz keep the nomination bottled up in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they cannot prevent the president from re-establishing full diplomatic relations with Cuba. Article II of the Constitution vests that power exclusively with the president. Having just coauthored a book with Peter Kornbluh on secret diplomacy (Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations between Washington and Havana), I wondered in the weeks leading up to the historic announcement whether secret talks might already be underway with Cuba. Now we know that these talks followed a classic pattern: only a handful of officials knew about the negotiations; the talks were held outside the country to avoid discovery; and the bargaining went on for months to produce an accord. But the scope of the resulting agreements is unprecedented in U.S.-Cuban relations, and the negotiators on both sides deserve enormous credit for bringing the talks to fruition. In April, the presidents of the Americas will convene in Panama for their Seventh Summit, and for the first time Cuba will be included. Obama's new Cuba policy is extraordinarily popular in Latin America, and the good will it has engendered will go far to revitalize U.S. relations with the entire hemisphere. The summit will also give Raúl Castro and Barack Obama an opportunity to talk in person about the next steps in the new relationship. When Richard Nixon went to China in 1972, the world breathed a sigh of relief that U.S. policy was finally getting back in touch with reality. On December 17, Barack Obama took an equally bold step by finally ending the cold war in the Caribbean. The reaction at home and abroad has been overwhelmingly positive, a few churlish conservative critics notwithstanding. Many loose ends remain to be tied up before the United States and Cuba will have fully normal relations, but a new chapter has been opened, and the idea of going back to the past already seems ridiculous and impossible. William M. LeoGrande is Professor of Government at American University and coauthor with Peter Kornbluh of the recent book, Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations between Washington and Havana.

Before serving as Koru's CEO, Kristen worked as COO of a global non-profit, launched mobile media devices for a Fortune 100 company and helped take Onvia, which she co-founded, public. How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?This is an ongoing process. I try hard to be ""always learning.""I grew up on a farm in Canada. We all want purpose and meaning in our work -- it's the human condition. However, I learned from a young age that hard work itself is meaningful because of how it makes us feel to fully commit ourselves to something difficult and get it done.I had an insatiable curiosity and because of it, I learned by doing. I was always throwing myself into the unknown because I was curious or I wanted adventure. It taught me that failure is an important step in learning and growing. I would try something, often impulsively because it seemed interesting, make a mistake and correct it fast in order to keep going.My current business, Koru, is founded on the concept of ""learning by doing."" And as a leader, one of my favorite mottos is ""fail fast and cheap."" Avoiding failure cuts off our opportunity for learning. Try things, and be willing to let go fast if it's failing. It's the only way to innovate.How has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at Koru?I took a year off before I went to college and lived and worked in Germany and Cyprus. That gap year gave me more real-world experience than my four years at university.After college, I worked in consulting for a number of years. I was constantly building strategy, framing problems and needing to work harder than I thought possible. I then co-founded and scaled a company, Onvia, from an idea to a public company. I learned how important it is to be purposeful about building a culture and how hard it is to hire good people fast. I then worked for World Learning, a global non-profit, and Microsoft, with dozens of it's subsidiaries. A valuable lesson I learned from these large and dispersed organizations is that the most valuable information is closest to the customer, in the minds of those who are with them from day to day. I ask customer-facing team members a lot of open-ended questions, and invite their voices into conversations about things like product, marketing and strategy.I learned how important a clear sense of mission is to the making of a great company, and that the ones I admire most are led by inspired, principle-driven people with a purposeful approach to culture.I've brought a little bit of all these experiences to Koru. We are working on having a huge impact and solving a really big and important problem: obliterating the statistic that 53 percent of recent college grads are un- or underemployed. We've built something that leverages ""experience"" as the best form of learning, we have assembled the best possible team to solve this problem, and we've ignited a culture that's based on a set of principles we passionately believe in.What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at Koru?The first years of running a startup that is working well are like a game of Whack-a-Mole. You just have one fuzzy hammer (limited resources) and there's always a field of problems that pop-up unexpectedly.That being said, it's exhilarating. I've been awed by the commitment of our team, what we've been able to achieve in our first year, and the integrity and character with which we've done it. I'm especially grateful to have won the co-founder lottery. It's statistically difficult to find a good partner to start a company with. I think Josh and I have the right Venn diagram of similarities, differences, personalities, temperament and appetite for impact to make it a great match.What advice can you offer to women who want to start their own business?I'd give the same advice to anyone wanting to start their own business.First -- Choose a problem, not a product/service/solution. You can have a cool product idea, but all successful businesses solve a specific problem for a particular customer. Ask the potential customer about their problem for as long as it takes for the solution to start unveiling itself.Second -- Be sure it's a problem you care so much about that it almost tortures you not to solve it. Starting a business is very hard and it will consume your life. Also, make sure you are aware of market trends, and land your business at the crest of a wave. It's hard enough to start a business. Don't make it impossible by working against nature.Third -- Ask yourself what you are willing to give up to solve the problem and be really honest with yourself. You will make compromises and other aspects of your life will get less of your attention. I suggest trying to keep as much constant in your life as possible when you start a business, and be clear about what you'll give up to make room in your life for your newly beloved company.Fourth -- Gather the brightest minds and hold an ideation session. One of the most important things I did was to make a list of all the people I knew (or wanted to know) who could help me with a first vision for how to address the problem. In our case, the problem was the 53% unemployment and underemployment rate of college graduates in the US. We had a two-day ideation session and in that time, we pushed thinking forward more than I could have in six months on my own. I also found my co-founder.What is the most important lesson you've learned in your career to date?Anything is possible, but not everything is possible. Harness the best available information from the right sources, make choices and move forward. That, and if you take your time to figure out what your dream is and share it with people you have developed an authentic relationship with, people will go out of their way to help you achieve those dreams, as audacious as they may be.How do you maintain a work/life balance?I stop pretending to. I forgive myself for letting the balance swing one way or the other, and try to make good choices. On his deathbed, my grandfather Jack's advice to his oldest son was: ""Have Fun."" Fun and love are two of life's most important ingredients. I try to honor Jack's wisdom and make more room for fun and love, and less for guilt and shame.What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?This is something I am asked quite often, and I've realized that I have a different view than most Americans. An important caveat here -- I'm not an authority, and am still trying to figure this out for myself. I think that the biggest issue for women in the workplace is worrying about women's issues in the workplace.Some context first. I was raised in a place, Quebec, where women (particularly in the French culture) are, more often than not, running the show. There was a set of spoken and unspoken assumptions that we could do anything we set our minds to, as long as we worked hard for it. I remember my father, who raised me, telling me at a young age that I could be prime-minister of Canada if I set my mind to it. I never had any other context. Here's what I think -- inequity problems won't be truly solved by debating or discussing issues. We should all be the future we hope for. I can't say what this means for others, but for me, it means always trying to be my best, assuming good intent in others and keeping my eye on the prize.I'm not ignoring reality. I know the statistics. And when I say to be the future you imagine, there is nothing passive about it. I make a habit of shutting down haters. If someone is sexist with me in the room, I'll do what I can to call it out, even use positional and personal power to embarrass them if it's really bad. I'm choosing to envision (and create) a world where everyone commits to using whatever power they have in any circumstance to shut down prejudice.How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?A great mentor of mine was the first venture investor in my first business, Nancy. She studied engineering in college, and was VP of Engineering at a top tech company and headed a top tier venture fund in Silicon Valley. She was the first woman I witnessed and experienced as an exceptional, superlative leader by behaving as an equal to those around her, and never letting the fact that she lived her whole career in a ""man's world"" be a factor. She inspired me to be who and how I am.Which other female leaders do you admire and why?I admire lots of leaders, male and female, and tend not to put them in separate categories. The women who have inspired me in particular are generally trailblazers who I've had direct experience with and who I've witnessed as inspired leaders, especially in challenging times.They are:· Carol Bellamy, former head of UNICEF and my boss at World Learning· Nancy Schoendorf, Venture Capitalist· Judy Kirton, my riding coach· Mary Gibb-Carsley, my grandmotherWhat do you want Koru to accomplish in the next year?Two things -Get the word out to every college graduate in the US that Koru is here to help them on the path to a meaningful and lucrative career.Establish Koru as the most trusted source for high growth employers to hire top entry-level talent."

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/germany-anti-muslim-marches_n_6403532,1/1/2015,reuters,Poll: One In 8 Germans Would Join Anti-Muslim Marches,"BERLIN, Jan 1 (Reuters) - One German in eight would join an anti-Muslim march if a rapidly-growing protest movement organized one in their home towns, according to an opinion poll published on Thursday. The survey highlighted growing support in Germany, as in other European Union countries including Britain and Sweden, for parties and movements tapping into voter fears that mainstream politicians are too soft on immigration. Some members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc worry that they risk losing support to the euro-skeptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has shifted its focus to immigration and includes many who also back the PEGIDA protest movement -- Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West. PEGIDA is holding weekly rallies in the eastern city of Dresden, and attracted more than 17,000 people to a Dec. 22 rally. A few small marches have taken place in other towns, and it plans to stage further rallies in other German cities. In her New Year address, Merkel urged Germans to turn their backs on PEGIDA's leaders, calling them racists full of hatred, and said Europe's biggest economy must welcome people fleeing conflict and war. A poll of 1,006 people by Forsa for Germany's Stern magazine found 13 percent would attend an anti-Muslim march nearby. It also found 29 percent of people believed that Islam was having such an influence on life in Germany that the marches were justified. While two thirds of those polled believed the idea of an 'Islamisation' of Germany was exaggerated, many Germans are concerned about the numbers of asylum seekers fleeing countries such as Syria.

The number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany surged to about 200,000 in 2014, four times the numbers in 2012. Net immigration has hit a two-decade high. AfD leader Bernd Lucke criticized Merkel's New Year address in comments due to appear in Friday's edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) paper, accusing her of disrespecting citizens. A New Year address should unite rather than divide people, he said, accusing Merkel of branding all those who joined PEGIDA marches as anti-immigrant without listening to their views. He said he saw no place for anti-immigrant sentiment in Germany, but that problems should be discussed properly to stop such views taking hold.

But January is also a great time to take stock of the things we're wasting time, energy and stress on, and to, in the oft-quoted words of Elsa from ""Frozen"": ""Let it go."" Below are 21 things we are going to stop giving a shit about in 2015. What would you add? 1. Juice cleanses. Let's call a spade a spade and acknowledge that cleansing is less about health than about quick weight loss -- and if that's really your goal, there are healthier, longer-lasting ways to go about it. Solid foods FTW. 2. Wearing matching socks. One day we may find the land of lost single socks. But today is not that day. 3. Making plans with people you don't actually want to see, to do things you don't want to do. Obligation relationships aren't good for anyone. And even if someone you adore is inviting you out, if you'd rather eat your own hand than go clubbing, it's probably best to just say no. 4. People who don't understand why Queen Bey's feminism is important. Bye, haters. 5. Worrying about finding ""the one."" More doing fun things, less stressing about one's single status. 6. Breaking the Internet. If it ain't broke, why break it? 7. Getting tons of ""likes"" on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram. Better to 'gram your avocado toast and sunsets for your own enjoyment, ""likes"" be damned. 8. Anything ""Princeton Mom"" says. Single ladies don't need her brand of ""straight talk."" Neither do rape survivors, or any other women, for that matter. 9. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). We'd rather focus on truly enjoying the things we are doing. 10. Being embarrassed about wearing yoga pants in public. Look, they're comfy. 11. Losing that last five pounds. So many things taste better than skinny feels. 12. Wearing shoes that aren't comfortable. Hobbling around in pain makes any experience about 100x less pleasant. 13. Worrying that a romantic relationship doesn't check all the boxes on every ""179,000 Ways To Know You're In The Right Relationship"" list on the Internet. 14. Feeling guilty about going to bed early. True love means never having to apologize for your REM cycles. 15. Feeling guilty about staying in bed late on a weekend day. Clearly, we just really love sleep. 16. Not ""putting yourself out there"" in ways that your (well-meaning) friends and family think you should be. If there's something truly worth ""getting out"" for, you'll be motivated. 17. Eating gluten-free. Unless, of course, you are actually allergic to gluten. 18. Planning something *~#epic~* for every birthday. Embrace simplicity. Day drinking at a bar or BBQing at a park can be just as fun (if not more fun) than having an expensive 28-person dinner followed by five other complicated activities. 19. Walking more Fitbit steps each day than your Fitbit ""friends."" Exercise is wonderful for your physical and mental health. We'd rather use that as the motivation than competing with or ""beating"" our friends. 20. People who don't give a shit about you. Again... bye, haters. 21. Trying to make everyone happy all of the time. Do what you can, and forgive yourself the rest. And perhaps take some time to focus on making yourself happy. Happy 2015, y'all!

If a song has cracked the Top 40 chart and has a tempo above 125 beats per minute (BPM), there's a good chance you'll hear it in the gym. In this look back at 2014, you'll find lots of songs that meet the criteria above -- along with a few outliers. Starting with the big winners, Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off"" was the most popular workout song of the year. (Not coincidentally, it's also the fastest song in the bunch below.) Calvin Harris is notable for being the only artist to make the top 10 twice. Plus, Maroon 5 and Nico & Vinz both had songs so catchy that folks didn't mind their slower tempos. Rounding out the list, there are remixes of rock tracks from OneRepublic and American Authors, a song from Meghan Trainor that proved even more popular in the gym than her breakthrough hit ""All About that Bass,"" and a soaring, club track that pits Cash Cash & Bebe Rexha against dance titans The Chainsmokers. On the whole, the list makes for an easy way to reflect on the year that's passed, get acquainted with any songs you might have missed, and prep the perfect mix to kick off your first workout of 2015. Here's the full list, according to a poll on Run Hundred -- the web's most popular workout music blog. Check out this month's top 10 workout songs on Run Hundred: www.RunHundred.com.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-become-a-morning-p_b_6200682,1/1/2015,rachel rofe,How to Become a Morning Person,"You've probably heard it since you were little: ""The early bird catches the worm."" ""Good for the worm,"" you might think. ""I'm hitting snooze."" Most of us would love to be morning people. We've heard about the benefits of waking up early time and time again. But it's easier said than done, and good intentions alone don't go very far. You need actionable, can-do strategies to make lasting change. Here are some battle-tested tips you can use to go from annoyed to animated every morning: Have your first activity of the day be something you love. It's a lot easier to get out of bed when you have something to look forward to. Create a great playlist, save a podcast you want to listen to for your morning walk, or schedule an exercise class with a friend. Plan out the ""hard"" things the night before. If you drink a morning smoothie, have everything pre-cut and ready to go in a Ziploc bag. If you want to exercise in the morning, have your workout clothes ready -- or even sleep in them. When you prepare in advance, getting up doesn't feel like as much work. Go to bed earlier. This isn't new, but consider the time you spend watching TV or surfing the Web. If you can cut that out in service to making lifestyle changes that make you feel a lot better, your quality of life may exponentially increase. It's worth testing, right? Set an alarm clock at night. Have an alarm clock that reminds you when it's an hour away from bedtime. Start shutting your electronics down and doing any other nighttime rituals you need to do. Put your alarm clock across the room. Hitting ""snooze"" over and over in the morning isn't giving you any quality sleep, so you may as well just get up when your alarm goes off. Once you get out of your comfortable bed to shut it off, it's a lot more likely that you'll stay up. Commit to waking up early for 21 days. Commit to waking up, even through the discomfort, an hour earlier every day for 21 days. Whenever you don't feel like doing it, remind yourself that it's only for 21 days. Some say it takes 21 days to create a habit, while others say that's a myth. Either way, committing for only 21 days is a great way to ""trick"" yourself. When you see how good you feel, you'll likely want to keep doing it. Become accountable with a friend who also wants to wake up earlier. Set a time for both of you to wake up. Text each other to show you've done it. Accountability is a very powerful motivator. Get perspective. The amazing Hal Elrod said in an interview, ""When the alarm clock goes off in the morning, it's life's first gift to you. But it's also life's first challenge or test. You say you want an extraordinary life, but the message we send to the universe is 'Well, no, no, no. I don't want it as bad as I want to lay here unconscious for another nine or ten minutes.' Then the alarm goes off again, and it's like, 'Yeah... I could wake up and become a better version of myself but I'm too lazy. I just want to lay, I don't have the discipline.'"" Remind yourself of this when you'd rather lay in bed -- it's powerful. Visualize yourself waking up early the next morning. Feel how it feels, what you see, and how you move throughout your day. Many people swear by this method. Remind yourself what the benefits will be. When your alarm goes off and you'd rather keep sleeping, remind yourself that you're about to get some ""me"" time, that you're going to be becoming healthier, or that you'll be enjoying some endorphins if you plan on exercising first. You can also feel proud of yourself for committing to something and sticking with it. Create a reward. If you're motivated by pleasure, tell yourself that if you wake up earlier for ""x"" days in a row, you'll reward yourself with something that you love. Maybe you buy yourself a present, take a day off, or do something else that will motivate you. Create a consequence. If you're motivated by pain, figure out what happens if you don't wake up earlier. Maybe you'll just be angry with yourself, maybe you'll feel like a failure, or keep having a life you're not proud of. You might also have to give money to a friend or do something embarrassing. You'll know what motivates you the most. Take deep breaths before you go to bed. If you're going to bed with stress and anxiety on your mind, it'll be a lot tougher to fall asleep and/or have high quality sleep. Take several deep breaths before you go to bed to help calm down your nervous system. If all else fails, start slowly. If you've tried other things and you just can't wake up 30-60 minutes earlier, try doing it gradually. Set your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier than you normally get up for a few days, then 30 minutes, then 45, and then 60. It might make it easier if your sleep routine isn't that different.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ten-conversations-every-c_b_6377412,1/1/2015,"samantha rodman, ph d",10 Conversations Every Couple Should Have in the New Year,"There are many articles that enumerate the types of conversations every couple needs to have prior to getting married, such as discussing their plans for how to parent, and their perspectives on money and religion. But I believe that there are 10 conversations that every couple needs to have on a regular basis in order to keep their emotional connection alive. They can help you realize what areas of their relationship may need to be worked on, whether this is done with more conversation or even with a couples counselor. In 2015, why not commit to having at least a few of these helpful conversations? By the way, if you want to know when you would use these questions, a good thing to do is an Emotional Check In, which is a weekly time (yes, put it on your Outlook) that you and your spouse sit together for a a half hour, no more and no less, to discuss only how the relationship is going. Many couples find this to be useful; it isn't such a long time that the less emotionally expressive partner is terrified, and it is long enough for both people to feel heard. So try a weekly Emotional Check In, and use some of these questions during it. (Note: If you're a devoted reader of this blog, you'll realize that many of these are questions I use in my Functional Couple Fridays interviews. So I walk the walk.) We otter ask each other some of these questions 1. What do you love about me?This question is wonderful to use on a regular basis. It makes partners feel great to know that there are specific things about them that are valued and appreciated within their relationship. Talking about this can bring partners back to the honeymoon stage, where all you ever did was talk about what you love about each other (and have sex). This conversation topic pumps out endorphins and makes both partners happy. 2. What do I do regularly that makes you happy?Not only does this give you the happiness benefits of having your effort noticed and recognized, but it can also be instructive to learn exactly what does and doesn't resonate emotionally with your partner. For example, if you're busting your butt to get a delicious dinner on the table every night for your husband, but he never mentions this as something that makes him happy, maybe you can relax and order take out sometimes. This can also lead into a productive discussion about love languages. 3. What is your favorite time we had together this week?Note I didn't say this month or today. A week is a good unit because you can remember most things easily, but some days are going to go by in a normal relationship without many good things happening. If you can't think of any favorite time within seven days, that's an indicator that you need to make more time as a couple, or that there are underlying issues with the relationship. And reminiscing about good times together, even as recently as that morning or a week ago, builds feelings of intimacy and closeness. 4. What are you looking forward to doing together as a couple?Looking forward to events can be even more enjoyable than the events themselves, according to research. So, figure out what you're looking forward to, whether it's tonight, next week, this summer, or as retirees. Or all of those! Talking about your plans together makes you feel like a team, and gives you positive thoughts to help you through tougher times in the relationship. 5. When did you first realize you loved me?Another romantic one that brings you back to the hormone- and endorphin-fueled stages of early love. These sorts of questions make people feel vulnerable and closely connected. 6. What do you think about our sex life?This should be a frank and honest discussion, where both partners try their hardest to be non-defensive and non-judgmental. If it was 20 years from now, wouldn't you wish you had this open discussion today? People have no idea what their partner wants if their partner won't tell them outright. I have treated couples where a man learned that a wife of decades never enjoyed or orgasmed from things he had been doing every time they had sex. Don't let this be you. 7. What do you think we have in common?This discussion builds closeness and a team feeling. Opposites don't actually attract; in most basic ways, couples that succeed are fairly similar. Elaborate on the ways that you have similar thoughts, feelings, goals, values, and interests. This will emphasize that you're a unit, and reaffirm your choice in partner. 8. Which of our differences do you think complement each other?In attachment theory, we've seen that avoidant partners often pair with preoccupied partners. Similarly, assertive partners often pair with passive ones. There are many ways in which two people with the exact same personality traits wouldn't work. One is often more laid back, one more responsible, one more intellectual, one more emotional, and so forth. This conversation helps you learn more about your partner, as well as realize why it may not be a bad thing that your partner is different than you. (Would you want to date you? Really? Completely?) 9. Do you trust me?Many if not most couples have issues in their history that makes them wary of fully trusting the other, whether this is something huge like infidelity, or something like a partner picking their parent over you during arguments. Trust needs to be discussed, and each partner needs to make a good faith effort to repair trust that has been broken. Often, this can be done with a couples counselor, if open discussion does not work. 10. What concrete things could I do to make you happier?This should be one to three things that a partner could reasonably do on a daily or monthly basis that would genuinely increase the other partner's quality of life. Having more sex, cleaning or doing some chore on your wife's timeline and specifications, scheduling more date nights, getting up with the kids, whatever. Be open to trying new things with the goal of enriching your marriage and making your partner feel valued and cherished. Hopefully those questions can make it into your conversation tonight. Let me know how it goes, and share if you found this useful! Till we meet again, I remain, The Blogapist Who Wants Your Marriage To Be Awesome.

Syrian television on Thursday aired footage of the New Year visit, accompanying it with patriotic music. It showed Assad talking to troops, embracing them and sharing a meal outside, in what was presented as a morale boost for soldiers on the frontline of the country's civil war. The conflict killed 76,021 people in 2014, just under half of them civilians, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday. The United Nations says around 200,000 people have been killed since 2011. No group enjoys significant momentum going into 2015, and Assad said last month he expected the conflict to be long and difficult. Assad, who is commander in chief, is not frequently pictured in public, though he has visited troops in the past, according to state media. The presidential website said the latest visit was to Jobar, northeast of Damascus. ""If there was an area of joy which remained in Syria, it is thanks to the victories that you achieved in the face of terrorism,"" Assad told troops, according to the Twitter account. State news agency SANA said he ""wished a speedy recovery to the wounded"" and praised their sacrifices. Lebanese channel al-Mayadeen also showed footage of the trip. Several bangs could be heard in the distance but it was not clear what caused them. Syrian forces have been trying to dislodge insurgents from Jobar, which was captured by anti-Assad fighters in 2013. While government forces control central Damascus, they have continued to face battles on the outskirts of the capital. According to the human rights observatory, Jobar was the target of at least 10 raids by the Syrian air force on Wednesday, as well as strikes by ground missiles. Neither the presidency account nor SANA said whether Syrian troops had gained control over all or just parts of the area. The Observatory, which gathers information from sources on the ground, said pro-government forces in Jobar had clashed with fighters from rebel and Islamic battalions and al Qaeda's Syria wing, Nusra Front. In an update on Thursday, the Observatory said government forces had fired machine guns on areas of Jobar overnight and that three rockets landed in the area in the morning. It added that at least 25 pro-government fighters were killed and dozens wounded in the previous day's fighting. Syrian state media did not mention any casualties.

The service at St. Peter's Basilica marks the Roman Catholic Church's World Day of Peace. This year's theme is ""No Longer Slaves, but Brothers and Sisters.""

We asked the pros at CheapAir -- and sifted through our favorite hacks -- for 7 tricks that will make 2015 the year you FINALLY get out there, and on a trip that goes smoothly, too. 1. Start flying in the morning.It's science: the later in the day you fly, the longer the delay you might face, as bad weather and other issues create a domino effect throughout the day. Experts advise avoiding flights between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. to decrease your chances of getting stuck. 2. Get TSA Precheck.CheapAir recommends signing up for TSA Precheck -- after an application, you'll whiz through security like a BOSS. 3. Pick a smart day to book.Fifty-four days before your trip is the magic number, if we're being precise. And remember: it's never too early to start strategizing for the next holiday season. 4. Stop checking baggage.You'll 1) avoid checked bag fees, 2) eliminate the chance of bags going missing and 3) have an excuse to invest in the best carry-on tote ever. CheapAir also points out that when flights are cancelled or delayed, airport staff may be more willing to help re-route passengers if they know they won't have to go to the trouble of re-routing checked bags. When you travel light, you're low-risk. 5. Pick up passengers in Departures, not Arrivals.Meeting your air traveler at Departures instead of Arrivals almost always means less crowds, CheapAir points out. Plus, they say airport police are less likely to make you move while you're waiting at the Departures curb. Don't be afraid to take advantage of cell phone lots as low-stress places to wait, too. 6. Turn your phone into a travel agent.With the right apps, your phone can nab same-day flights, teach you the local language and even identify the historic spot you're standing in. And when flight delays strike, CheapAir recommends hopping on the phone while waiting in line at the airport check-in desk to double your chances of finding a remedy. 7. Finally set those price alerts.Sites like Airefarewatchdog and Hopper keep you posted when prices dip on the routes you're looking to fly. Start the new year off right by setting alerts for all your dream trips, and watch 2015 be the year you take the trip of a lifetime.

Maryland lawmakers voted two years ago to abolish the death sentence for future offenders beginning 2013. O'Malley, a Democrat and possible White House contender, on Wednesday said that leaving the last four prisoners to await the death penalty ""does not serve the public good."" ""In a representative government, state executions make every citizen a party to a legalized killing as punishment,"" he said in a statement. The four prisoners, Vernon Evans, Anthony Grandison, Jody Lee Miles and Heath William Burch, had their sentences commuted by gubernatorial order to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Opponents of capital punishment applauded O'Malley's move - which came just weeks before he leaves office after two terms as Maryland's governor. ""Today's announcement gives further hope that support for the discriminatory and fatally flawed death penalty is waning,"" Amnesty International USA said in a statement. ""The U.S. cannot be seen as a country that truly values human rights as long as it continues to execute its citizens,"" the group said. All four inmates in Maryland were convicted of murder. A family member of two victims told the Baltimore Sun newspaper she was ""devastated"" to learn that Heath Williams Burch's sentence had been commuted. Burch was convicted of the 1995 murders of Robert Davis, 70, and Cleo Davis, 77, the newspaper said. The Davises' daughter, Mary Moore, said she had asked the governor three times not to remove Burch from death row. ""He'll have a life, and I don't think he should,"" she said. Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger, who supported retaining the death penalty in the state, said the capital sentences for all four men had been fair and upheld after numerous appeals. ""The governor should not be using his last days in office to show any mercy to these cold, calculating murderers,"" he said in a statement. There are currently 3,054 inmates on death row in the United States, according to the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center, which compiles statistics published by the Bureau of Justice.

Cameron Beckford's body was found in a bag in Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, according to police. The boy's mother, Dainesha Stevens of Frederick, Maryland, assisted police in locating the boy's body, according to her lawyer Mark Collins. Stevens, 24, was charged on Monday with felony child endangerment and tampering with evidence and is being held on a $150,000 bond, according to court records. ""She helped guide them to the general area ... and they were able to retrieve the child today,"" he said. According to authorities, Stevens called police on Monday to report that her 6-year-old daughter was missing and later disclosed she had abandoned her 14-month-old son. The girl was found in good condition and taken to the county's child services department, police said. During the investigation, Stevens told police that she and a male friend on Friday evening left Cameron on the front porch of a house in Columbus not far from where his body was later found, authorities said. ""I can't go into details, but she was asked to lie about her daughter going missing,"" Collins said. ""That was her way of saying that she needed help.""

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dzhokhar-tsarnaev_n_6403230,1/1/2015,associated press,Judge Rejects Requests To Delay Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Trial,"BOSTON (AP) — Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to overturn a judge's decision to not move his upcoming trial out of state. The appeal was filed with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hours after U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole denied the change-of-venue request and a motion seeking a nine-month delay in the start of the trial. The defense is now asking O'Toole to postpone jury selection, scheduled to begin Monday, pending the outcome of the appeal. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges connected to the April 2013 explosions at the marathon finish line, which killed three people and injured more than 260. He could face the death penalty if convicted. The defense lawyers, in their appeal to the higher court, again argued Tsarnaev couldn't receive a fair trial in the Boston federal courthouse a couple of miles from where the bombing occurred. Prosecutors, they said, were likely to depict the crimes as having affected not only those killed and injured but nearly the entire greater Boston community. ""Thus, every member of the jury pool is, in effect, an actual victim of the charged offenses,"" the defense attorneys wrote. As an alternative to ordering the trial moved, the lawyers suggested the appeals court order O'Toole to hold a hearing on ""disputed issues of fact"" and reconsider the previous change-of-venue motions. O'Toole said in his ruling earlier Wednesday he would provide a detailed explanation for it later. In rejecting Tsarnaev's first request in September to move the trial, O'Toole said defense lawyers had failed to show that extensive pretrial media coverage of the bombings had prejudiced the jury pool to the point an impartial jury couldn't be chosen in Boston. The defense has compared the coverage to that in the case of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose trial was moved to Denver. McVeigh was convicted and put to death for the bombing, which killed 168 people. In Wednesday's appeals court filing, Tsarnaev's lawyers noted The Associated Press recently named the aftermath of the marathon bombing the top Massachusetts news story of 2014 and Gov.-elect Charlie Baker, in response to a question posed by The Boston Globe in October, said Tsarnaev was the living person he despised the most. Prosecutors say Tsarnaev, 21, and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, planted and detonated two pressure cooker bombs. Tamerlan died following a firefight with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar was captured later that day, wounded and hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in suburban Watertown. Also Wednesday, O'Toole issued a decorum order, prohibiting courtroom spectators from wearing clothing, buttons or other items ""that carry any message or symbol addressing the issues related to this case that may be or become visible to the jury."" The ban includes law enforcement uniforms and badges, except for those worn by on-duty U.S. marshals or court security officers. Defense lawyers said in motions seeking a trial delay the prosecution has not handed over everything they have requested, including information they believe may show Tsarnaev was under his brother's influence. The defense also wanted more time to review information regarding Stephen Silva, who recently pleaded guilty to having possessed the gun prosecutors said the bombing suspects used to kill a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer.

The title of the video says the women are Italian workers and have been detained by al Qaeda's Syria wing Nusra Front, but websites and Twitter accounts used by the militant group did not mention the video, which did not include any logos of the group. The video published on YouTube shows two young women sitting and dressed in black robes and veils. One holds a sign which gives the date as Dec. 17, 2014. ""We supplicate our government and its militaries to bring us back home before Christmas,"" the other woman says in English, appearing to read from a prepared statement. ""We are in big danger and we could be killed. The government and its militaries are responsible (for) our lives."" An Italian foreign ministry spokesman declined to comment. In August the ministry said two Italian aid workers had been kidnapped in Syria, without giving their names. They had been working on humanitarian projects in the embattled northern city of Aleppo, the ministry said at the time, adding that all channels were being explored to obtain more information and secure their release. It did not give details of their captors. Nusra Front and the militant Islamic State group have held groups of Westerners hostage in Syria, which has descended into a splintered civil war. Islamic State beheaded several male hostages including aid workers and journalists in 2014. Nusra Front released hostages last year, including a group of Greek Orthodox nuns in March and a U.S. writer in August.

Here at HuffPost Divorce, we're a little less drastic when it comes to making New Year's resolutions. Now that it's nearly 2015, we're pledging ""new year, way less stressed-out stepfamily."" Below, nine resolutions to consider sticking to based on what we've learned from parents in our Blended Family Friday series  last year. 1. Quit trying to force a relationship with your stepkids. You may have bonus-parent dreams, but let it happen naturally.""My stepdaughters have two really great parents who love them to pieces. I don't have to be the 'mother' -- they already have a mom. I support their father with parenting, but for my personal relationship with them, I get to really enjoy the kids."" -- Brynn Bruno 2. Make regular family meetings a priority, even if it feels a bit forced at first. ""Early on in our marriage we began having weekly family meetings. This established a forum for good and healthy conversation. It wasn't always easy conversation and at times it was confrontational. But it was important to us that we learn how to communicate."" -- Sandi PattyPhoto courtesy of Sandi Patty 3. Carve out some time for date night with your spouse. (Bonus points if you don't talk about the kids.)""As a couple, my husband and I insist on having date night twice a month. It's pure enjoyment and relaxation: no kids, no dogs, and no stress. We also travel twice per year -- once with our kids and then alone. It's important to maintain your marriage outside of your kids. My husband and I always start to talk about our kids when we're away, but we're learning how to stop ourselves when we discuss them too much!"" -- Lisa Liggins-Chambers 4. Don't badmouth the other parents. Really, it's not worth it.""Talking trash about the exes or surrounding yourself with people who like to engage in that kind of talk is generally not a good idea. (I know, I know -- we've ALL done it, but make an effort to stay positive.) We want to aim for our higher selves on this front. Embrace your spouse’s ex. He or she could turn out to be an unexpected ally and maybe someday -- as in my case -- a really good friend."" -- Kama Fletcher 5. Accept that there's no neat time frame for truly feeling like a family.""When you blend two families you change everyone’s world. You hope it's eventually for the better, but the challenge is to take one day at a time and realize that what you want -- a new partner who you will spend the rest of your life with -- may not be what your children want. You deserve to be happy but it may take time for the kids to accept the new plan. Couples who are remarrying need to understand that."" -- Rob Walker(Photo by Sean O'Rourke) 6. Communicate with your ex. (Otherwise, you better believe your kids will play the two of you against each other.)""Since I remarried, my son is doing really well, but he still sometimes tries to play the parents against each other! Sometimes he will say, 'but daddy says…' or 'but Jeffy [his stepdad] lets me have candy…' The trick for us is maintaining communication with each other and doing our best to create consistent rules and boundaries. We always laugh when we are all in the same room together, because he will go from one parent to the next trying to get one of us to say 'yes' when the first parent says 'no.'” -- Claire James 7. It’s totally OK to allow each “subfamily unit” to have their special time together. ""So many newly blended families (ours included) expect an instant family unit, but it doesn’t work that way. It’s OK if one biological parent takes his or her biological kids out for an old family tradition or just some quality time alone together as the “original crew.” That doesn’t mean failure as a new stepfamily. It just means you acknowledge there was a family before the stepfamily, and that is OK."" -- Rachel Pross 8. But make a point to really savor the moments you have as a collective family.""My husband loves the 'happy reunions' we experience every week. Each Wednesday, Edwin and Ellie come home and we get that awesome “yay, we got the band back together” moment. Kids are easy to take for granted, and this keeps our times together precious. As for me, it’s seems corny, but there’s more to love. I love Edwin and Ellie as if they were my own flesh and blood, and my husband loves my children as his own too."" -- Cassandra Barnhart Cassandra Barnhart 9. Take the pressure off yourself to be a ""perfect"" family. Perfect families don't exist. ""Let me assure you, 'perfect' isn't going to happen. You are going to have a bad day where everything goes wrong, you are going to raise your voice and make the angry face (as my 5-year-old likes to call it). Your partner won't be perfect, either; he or she will make mistakes, you won't always agree on everything and you will both feel overwhelmed. The kids will have bad days, too -- days where they cry over broken Lunchable crackers (been there!), times where they will say they want their other parent. There will be moments of complete chaos and havoc will come at the worst moment possible and you'll think you can't do it anymore, but I can tell you from experience, those days don't last. Moments of craziness are quickly replaced with hugs, kisses, pillow fights and movie nights. The feeling of defeat gets knocked to the back-burner by feelings of more love than you ever dreamed possible. Pick your battles with everyone, including yourself ... Remind yourself everyday that you have been given another chance at love and cherish that opportunity."" -- Jessica Warrick If you'd like your own family to be featured on Blended Family Friday, please email us at divorce@huffingtonpost.com.

The Post, citing a statement emailed to the paper by one of Bush's aides late on New Year's Eve, said he even stepped down from the board of his education foundation. The statement added that he was still evaluating next steps for businesses for which he serves as an owner or principal partner, including consulting firm Jeb Bush & Associates, the Post reported. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Representatives for Bush were not immediately available. The news comes just days after Bush, the son of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush and the brother of former President George W. Bush, announced he was stepping down from the board of real estate investment trust Rayonier Inc. Bush said there were no disagreements between Rayonier and him. Bush, 61, said on Dec. 16 that he was actively exploring a run for the U.S. presidency in 2016 and would establish a political action committee in January that would allow him to engage with supporters and potential donors and determine whether sufficient support exists for a run. Bush served as Florida's governor between 1999 and 2007.

On the first day of a new year, as we look back with gratitude on an incredible 2014 and welcome 2015 with unbridled enthusiasm, we are so proud of the hard-earned milestones that have punctuated 2014, many of which were born from a very powerful [digital + women's empowerment] equation that continues to define who and what this agency is and does.  In January of last year, we featured inspiring stories about superhero(ine) women Sara Blakely, Fatima Bhutto and Angela Ahrendts on our blog Moxie Insider and Brown Paper Bag launched their Photo Trail series with my Instagram images, which hold clues to the #futureisgreen food project we're preparing to launch in 2015. Nokia empowered us to take our national Women in Media panel series and Moxie Mentorship program to Social Media Week Bangalore in February, during which time our panelists sparked an international furor amongst feminists on social media that resulted in articles in both The Huffington Post and Firstpost.  In March we launched our beloved Moxie Mentorship video featuring Asha, a young girl whose life is changed forever by our program, and saw our #ShesEmpowered social media campaign become a case study. With spring around the corner I took Moxie Mentorship to New York City in April, where we participated in Tina Brown's Women of the World Summit and met with a handful of people passionate about making #futureisfemale on a global scale. Back in Bombay, Team Moxie attended Mashable's Social Good Summit in Mumbai and interviewed their CMO Stacy Martinet about being a woman who is making #futureisdigital. I think I may have flown past Stacy in the friendly skies as she returned to NYC and I to Bombay, with my interview with Peek's Founder and CEO Ruzwana Bashir and a feature on Pantene's ""Sorry, We're Not Sorry"" #ShineStrong campaign appearing on the blog, in May and June respectively. Summer brought more #futureisgreen clues, with Vogue India featuring me in their special Vogue India Wellness Guide in July, while August saw the American edition of Vogue embrace everyone's favorite social media platform by giving their cover to The Instagirls. Harry Potter's Emma Watson was all grown up launching HeForShe with UN Women in September, and while celebrating Moxie Insider's first anniversary in October, we featured Vikas Bahl's short film for Vogue India's Vogue Empower campaign, entitled ""Going Home"" with talented young actress Alia Bhatt, as well as Elle India's #pinkselfie campaign for breast cancer awareness as part of our Instadiaries series. Last month talented lensman and one of the fashion community's first bloggers Scott Schuman of The Sartorialist set his sights on Mumbai and Delhi in an Instadiaries, which accompanied the viral video ""Potty-Mouthed Princesses Drop F-Bombs For Feminism"" with Ellen Degeneres, Jane Lynch, Zach Efron and more on our blog. Last but certainly not least, December saw the launch of The Huffington Post India and we celebrated Arianna Huffington's recent time here with an Instadiaries feature that included the requisite glittering sari, a Bollywood celebrity and quotes from Indian leaders. The launch was a powerful moment for me, as it's a story for The Huffington Post that first brought me to India nearly five years ago and changed my life forever, just as Asha's life was forever changed by Moxie Mentorship. It seems fitting that as I look back on Moxie Media's year, I'm looking back on five of mine and commemorating the memories alongside The Huffington Post India's very first articles. I hope you'll join Moxie and me on this journey in 2015. Happy New Year!

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-year-reflections-on-t_b_6402922,1/1/2015,david coates,New Year Reflections on the U.S. Global Role and Its Limits,"The first hours of a new year are always an ideal time for people across the globe to reflect on their contemporary condition. They are an ideal moment to look back, in the hope that serious reflection now can improve conditions going forward. And it is particularly vital that we in America take this moment of reflection as this new year begins, given the enormity of the impact of our condition on the rest of the global order. In the last days of 2014, the Obama administration made much of the formal ending of the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history now supposedly finally over. But in truth it is not finally over. Significant numbers of American troops are still deployed in Afghanistan, and will be for the foreseeable future; and in any case the Afghan war is simply part of a wider set of military engagements by American forces in the region that remain on-going. As the Obama Administration claims closure in Afghanistan, it continues to wage war in the Middle East - America's third such war since 9/11 -- leading the military campaign against ISIS, even though the US commander of special forces in the Middle East is recently on record as admitting that ""we do not understand the movement, and [that] until we do, we are not going to defeat it."" For as James Fallows commented at length in the current edition of The Atlantic, in spite of all our enormous expenditure on military personnel and equipment America keeps losing wars - or if not completely losing them, then at least regularly failing to translate superior US military capacity into desirable political settlements. For far too often for comfort, the more our men and women in uniform are deployed abroad, the more intransigent seem to be the problems that their deployment is designed to resolve. America may be the world's dominant super-power, and according to its own lights uniquely benign in that role, but the world it seeks to dominate is proving remarkably resistant to that supposedly benign dominance. So perhaps now is a good time to ask why? What is it about our contemporary political role that makes so much of what we attempt to do abroad ultimately self-defeating? Is the American military presence abroad really as benign and as indispensable as our political leaders regularly insist that it is? And if it is, why is that not universally recognized? I One way of answering such questions is to note that the United States is not the first global power to experience limits on its capacity to shape events beyond its shores, nor is it likely to be the last. For the past two millennia at least, other political systems -- not least those of Ancient Rome, early-modern Spain, nineteenth-century Britain, and Russia under both the Czars and the Soviets -- have for a significant period of time exercised political domain over wide areas of the then known world. But unlike the contemporary United States, each of those imperial adventures eventually came to a desultory end. Power won became power lost -- and often lost in both a dramatic and an irreversible fashion. If the United States is not one-day soon to repeat this standard imperial pattern of ascendancy, hegemony and decline, those who govern us now might do well to reflect upon the necessary limits of empire that these early examples of global dominance so clearly demonstrate. For these are limits that could one day also apply to the United States, and could do so regardless of how often conservative political commentators insist that the American role abroad is not in any meaningful sense imperial at all. Really -- not imperial at all? Well, consider America's contemporary condition in the light of at least these four regularly-visible limits of empire. Military Limits In the end, there always seems to be a serious military problem with empires. Empires cost a lot to build and a lot to maintain: a lot in money terms, a lot in terms of manpower and a lot in terms of political capital. Empires also invariably meet both resistance and push back from within the empire, and competition from other imperial entities beyond their borders, both of which ultimately inflate those costs substantially. This pattern of costs and resistance was very clear in the Soviet case, where ultimately the burden of Cold War competition and internal repression overwhelmed an economy stagnant for other reasons, and left the Soviet Union immersed in an Afghan war that it could not win and from which eventually it had ignominiously to withdraw. A similar pattern of imperial-overstretch brought Spanish power to an equally ignominious end in the Treaties of Westphalia and the Pyrenees between 1648 and 1659; and swept the British out of South-East Asia in 1942 and India by 1947. Empires regularly discover, that is, the truth of Talleyrand's often-quoted remark to Napoleon ""that you can do anything with a bayonet except sit on it."" Armies are so much better at winning power than at retaining it; and the costs of having to continually relearn this simple truth are surely ones that this time we will do well to avoid. Political Limits Military pushback against imperial rule would appear to be only one facet of a more general feature of empires: namely that they become more difficult to rule the larger they are and the longer they last. Partly this is because geographical size and communication capacity have historically been in tension. Certainly until the age of the internet, the farther away imperial subjects were from the metropolitan center, the longer it took for information and instructions to pass between them and those who ruled them. In the past, big empires were always based on indirect rule, and that indirect rule always and of necessity provided a space for resistance: either resistance by the traditional elites doing the local ruling, or by those they ruled venting their frustration with the colonial set-up at both the local and the metropolitan level. Settler colonies in particular were supremely difficult to effectively discipline from the metropolitan center, as Britain ultimately found to its great cost in the American case. The internet has now shrunk those distances, of course, but it has not taken them entirely away; and in any event the governance problems of empire invariably run deeper than simply issues of distance. For any difficulty the center has in controlling the periphery is normally matched, in grand global adventures of the contemporary American kind, by problems of control at (and over) the center itself. Even democratic governments with global pretensions have difficulty avoiding the emergence of an imperial presidency -- one which, though democratically elected, slips inexorably into non- or even anti-democratic practices in the defense of imperial power far away from its own shores. At the height of the Roman Empire, faced with issues of this kind, the republic rapidly gave way to what was effectively a monarchy. Modern empires don't inevitably collapse in that fashion, but they do face a similar problem of excessive executive autonomy. We need only think of the problem of executive capacity in the Washington DC of George w. Bush and Dick Cheney to recognize the persistence of that problem. Economic Limits It's not all bad news for empires, of course. Empires in their prime also attract a lot of subsidy. They take things from peoples less powerful than themselves, and do so with relative ease because of that imbalance of military capacity. They also find borrowing resources from others outside the empire easier than it might otherwise be because the collateral asked of them on such borrowing is invariably low, relative to the borrowing capacity of non-empires. In financial as well as in military terms, that is, power and privilege goes together. However, this financial arbitrage inevitably comes at a serious long term price, for empires at times enjoy a credit rating that is too good for their own long term viability. At the very least, empires tend to end up (as in the British case) with a serious division of interests between their financial and manufacturing sectors. At the very worst (as with Spain) for all their wealth, empires still end up dependent on credit provided by bankers based in circuits of capital that lie outside the territorial reach of the empire itself, credit which if withheld leaves the imperial army unpaid and the imperial military capacity momentarily out of central control. Armies win imperial control, but it is bankers who eventually determine if it can be sustained. Moreover, obtaining things easily because of imperial preference invariably weakens the ability of empires to generate those things themselves. It frees them from any immediate confrontation with the reality of market forces; and it alters the relative weight within their underlying economy of the sectors that manufacture things and those that merely play with money. Empires, as they succeed, invariably undermine the economic superiority on which that rise had initially been predicated. With Wall Street continuing to bounce back from the 2008 recession on a scale yet unmatched by Main Street, and with US-owned companies increasingly shifting their production off-shore in a global economy made safe for them by the US navy, it is hard not to see history repeating itself: first Rome, then Spain, England and now the United States. Cultural Limits Finally this: even privileged elites within dominant empires tend to wake up to the dangers of the erosion of the competitive strength of their domestic economy, if they wake up to it at all, too late. Empires rise but they also decline -- sometimes slowly, sometimes abruptly -- in part because both their governing classes (and their central populations) come over time to believe more and more in the naturalness and permanence of that superiority. They come to take their global position of power for granted, and lose sight of the very special conditions necessary for its retention and growth. They also come to swallow much of their own imperial rhetoric, so progressively losing the capacity to understand their own growing unpopularity in far-flung parts of the empire. A heightened tolerance of war, a double-standard in relation to the legitimacy of violence (alright if we inflict it on others but not alright if they inflict it on us), even a blindness to both the violence of poverty at home and the violence of empire abroad: all these seem to be inevitable features of the culture of empire. For although the specific content of ideas and claims differs empire by empire, the general character of the imperial mindset does not. It is always a mixture of excessive hubris and growing ignorance: hubris about the intellectual or racial superiority of the imperial culture, growing ignorance about the depth and complexity of cultures on the imperial periphery. As the global reach of an empire increases, so too does its cultural parochialism. Some empires, like the British, fall in total self-delusion. Others, like the Russian, fall when that self-delusion is possible no more. II Some high-quality imperial scholarship clings resolutely to the view that empires are a good thing, and that the possession of one is a sign of both present and future strength. But the bulk of the evidence available to us on the character and trajectory of global power would suggest otherwise. It would suggest that empires grow strong only because powers around them grow weak, and that imperial stability is more a function of that continuing weakness than it is of factors exceptional and special to the global power itself. It would suggest that empires fool themselves if they think that their superiority is endemic rather than contingent, and a reflection of their inner strengths rather than of others' external weaknesses. Take those external weaknesses away, and imperial decline seems to follow as surely as night follows day. The bulk of the evidence would suggest too that empires begin militarily strong, politically focused, economically advanced, socially cohesive and culturally dynamic; but that invariably they end up militarily exhausted, politically gridlocked, economically weakened, socially divided and culturally depleted. By almost any measure, there is plenty of military exhaustion, political stalemate, economic erosion, social division and cultural deprivation in contemporary America. Which is why -- as the New Year begins, and before the detail of day-to-day politics again drowns out the space for quiet reflection -- it is worth pondering whether any of that exhaustion, stalemate, erosion, division and depletion is the product of the presence in the modern world of something that we might properly recognize as an American empire.

Are you ready to start that new blog? Want some tips from some pros around the world on how to make it a great one? Everybody was blogging in 2014, and especially teachers. After all, blogging is an incredible way for teachers to share firsthand knowledge with their peers. We asked The Global Search for Education editorial team and our blogging advisors to submit their favorite teacher blogs and blog posts from around the world. We reviewed many great blogs. These 12 were our favorites. 1. Susan Bowles of Gainesville, Florida has been teaching since 1977. Earlier this year, she wrote a brave and moving letter about cheating children out of the fun of learning, entitled: ""Why I am refusing to give the FAIR test to my Kindergarteners"". She sent it to her superintendent and then posted it on the private Facebook group, Opt Out Alachua. The letter went viral. We love it Susan -- top of our list! 2. Lisa Currie's priority is ""improving students' social, emotional and mental health to reduce bullying and exclusion through our whole school curriculum."" Her blog post entitled: ""Why Teaching Kindness in Schools Is Essential to Reduce Bullying"" highlights the need for a culture of kindness in schools and is another big favorite on our list. 3. Todd Finley's ""30 Techniques to Quiet a Noisy Class"" gave teachers some terrific management tips on how to keep K-12 classrooms orderly. His blog post continues to stimulate discussion on how teachers can get their students attention. Another one for our Top 12! 4. Karen Lirenman, Canadian educator, got our and the rest of the world's attention when she had her kindergarten class tweet: What does it look like outside your window today? Her class received responses from all around the world. Her blog presents this and countless other examples of innovative ways to use social media in the classroom. (Learning and Sharing with Ms. Lirenman) 5. Craig Kemp, an educator in Singapore, is on our Top 12 for making waves with #whatisschool hashtag on Twitter, which has brought many new voices into conversations about education. His blog demonstrates how Skype, Twitter, and other applications can be used to stimulate learning in the classroom. (Mr. Kemp's Blog) 6. Like Vicki Davis, we believe every classroom matters. Vicki is inspiring in the way she surrounds herself with bright ideas and thoughtful sayings to stay positive. Her blog post: ""12 Choices to Step Back from Burnout"" was our favorite choice for tired teachers. 7. Pauline Hawkins' blog post, ""Why I'm Resigning After 11 Years as a Teacher"", coincided with her resignation last April. Hawkins wrote that she could ""no longer be a part of a system that continues to do the exact opposite of what I am supposed to do as a teacher -- I am supposed to help them think for themselves, help them find solutions to problems, help them become productive members of society."" Congratulations, Pauline, for articulating the issues and challenges so brilliantly! 8. Joe Bower shared some powerful lessons in his blog post titled: ""This will be my last year teaching in the hospital -- here are 3 things I learned"". 1. Children who are loved at home, come to school to learn -- children who are not loved at home, come to school to be loved 2. Children don't give adults a hard time -- they are just having a hard time. 3. Great teachers can do a lot -- overcoming poverty or inequity is not one of them."" 9. Tom Bennett a philosophy teacher from Glasgow, has been helping teachers tame classroom disruptions since 2010, which led to his immensely popular book, The Behaviour Guru. He continues to blog both personal anecdotes and insightful guides for behavior in school. Tom Bennett's Blog is another one for our Top 12. 10. Richard Wells, a Brit living in New Zealand, has an innovative blog on how to use iPads for school, i.e. it's not just about having new technology in the classroom. It needs to be moderated by intelligent teachers and a sharp support network. Thank you, Richard, for being one of the sharpest on our list! One of our personal favorites. 11. Silvia Rosenthal Tolisano, an educator in Brazil, blogs insightfully about contemporary education and her Globally Connected Learning blogs bridge voices from across the world. We're following Silvia in 2015! 12. Adam Steiner and Elizabeth Keefe pointed out we differentiate our instruction and our assessment, so why not our homework?

The project to reenact the performance, but this time in the Plaza of the Revolution, invariably brought back to us memories of that night in the Wilfredo Lam center and the hope that this time the microphones would be open to a larger number of Cubans. I confess that I came to reflect on where it would be best to raise the podium, to place the actors dressed in olive-green who would regulate the time of each person's speech, and how the white dove would look, fluttering over the shoulder of each orator. On the eve of December 30 I talked with Tania Bruguera who, hoarse and exhausted, already felt the cage closing around her. All the signs pointed to their not allowing her to even reach the Plaza and the political police unleashing a wave of repression against those who wanted to accompany her. I ventured to describe three possible scenarios she might face: that they would not let her leave her home, or would arrest her; that they would let her get to the plaza which would be taken over by a last-minute popular festival with cheap beer, parades and loud music; that they would let her stage Tatlin's Whisper, but fill the time at the microphone with voices shouting official slogans. There was no way to add to these variables one that would conclude with a chorus of plurality and tolerance making itself heard in front of the statue of José Martí. In that conversation I told her that ""The performance is already done; the artistic action achieved,"" because with her project Bruguera had unveiled the framework of censorship, cultural cowardice and repression that immobilizes Cuban life. Many of her artist friends had declined to accompany her, some acquaintances had called on her to concede and move Tatlin's Whisper to the interior some institution and others, more committed, had warned her that there was a plan to ""abduct her from the Plaza."" From the early hours of the morning the macabre dance of arrests and intimidation began. Ladies in White, activists, journalists and dissidents were jailed or blocked from leaving their homes. Many communicators had their cellphones cut off, text messaging cancelled and access to the government-operated Nauta email system restricted. In a whisper, information about what was happening began to surface. The 14ymedio team suffered a hard blow, with two reporters and a contributing writer arrested and our press office under a police operation for hours. The list of the jailed was growing and as communications began to work again we started calling each other to keep ourselves up-to-date. But the whisper turned into Tatlin's cry. One that is now heard through the phone lines, on Twitter, outside the police stations, where family members demand to spend the last day of the year with their loved ones. There is no microphone, no white dove, no one minute of freedom, but rather long hours of suffering and uncertainty. Tania, among all the scenarios we projected, we missed this one. You in jail and from there, dressed in the gray uniform of an inmate, you performed the most devastating and unforgettable of all your artistic actions. The Plaza is today in each one of us. 14ymedio, Cuba's first independent daily digital news outlet, published directly from the island, is available in Spanish here.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/that-day-after-christmas_b_6401324,12/31/2014,irene monroe,That Day After Christmas,"I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a running joke among the residents of my block is that, unfortunately, we sometimes have to tolerate unpleasant sights and whiffs of each others' garbage as a result of the way our gaggle of sanitation workers barrels from house to house, leaving unsightly reminders of our trash. When the sanitation truck rolls away, the area is strewn not only with our trash but with our trashcans and recycle bins now littering the block too. Each neighbor must retrieve his or her receptacles from a mountain of them. One neighbor who lives a couple of houses down from me calls trash day ""anti-trash day,"" as she cleans up after the sanitation workers. On the Friday after Christmas, when the sanitation truck drove away (pickup is usually every Thursday, but with Christmas falling on that day this year, it rolled over to Friday), another neighbor went to retrieve her receptacles expecting nothing out of the ordinary. But as she rolled them back into her yard, she couldn't believe what she found scrawled on the side of one of the receptacles: the ""N"" word. In 1998 the NAACP successfully convinced Merriam-Webster lexicographers to clearly designate the ""N"" word as a racial slur before the definition. Still, the ""N"" word is firmly embedded in the racist lexicon that was and still is used to disparage people of color, and our culture's cavalier use of the slur today speaks to how Americans of all races have become anesthetized to its destructive effects. While the battle to purge the ""N"" word from the American lexicon has been long, arduous, and unsuccessful, it is even harder to purge the sting of the word from the American psyche. Shocked by the sight of the epithet, my neighbor took a picture and hurried to remove the graffiti. But the stubborn oil pastel left an indelible mark, reminding her how hatred can be visited upon us so suddenly and unexpectedly. Cambridge, proudly dubbed ""The People's Republic of Cambridge,"" is often ranked as one of the most liberal cities in America. And with two of the country's premier institutions of higher learning -- Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- drawing students and scholars from around the world, the city rivals the UN in diversity and multiculturalism. Cambridge is also known for a lot of firsts in this country. For example, in 2004 it became the first city in Massachusetts -- and therefore in the United States -- to legally issue marriage-license applications to same-sex couples. It was also the first city in the country to elect an openly gay African-American mayor, Ken Reeves. And in 2008 Cambridge did it again, electing the country's first openly lesbian African-American mayor, E. Denise Simmons. Cambridge no doubt is a progressive city. In Cambridge, where racial tensions are far less pronounced than in Ferguson or New York City, particular between black communities and the police, people of color can feel somewhat removed from nagging reminders of intolerance and insensitivity. However, when you scratch below Cambridge's surface, intolerance and insensitivity can still be found. As in the South, where intolerance sees only race and tries to keep people in their place, Cambridge maintains its racial and class boundaries, not by designated ""colored"" water fountains, toilets, or restaurants but by neighborhood. The 02138 area code is a tony enclave, whereas the notorious Area 4 is a predominately black, poor, and working-class area. Cambridge may be multicultural, but sadly, it isn't integrated. In fact, fewer than five families of color reside on my block. The neighbor whose trashcan was vandalized is actually Southeast Asian, and her family has lived on the block for 20-plus years, with two children having graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and Buckingham Browne & Nichols School, respectively, and one now in attendance at Harvard. She and her family invited me to go with them to the police station to file their complaint. They wanted not only to make sure that the police had a record of the incident but to ascertain whether other residents of color anywhere in Cambridge had had similar experiences. While the Cambridge Police Department today is nothing like it was in 2009, when Cambridge police arrested renowned Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, who is black, for breaking into his own home after he found the front door jammed, the police officer who took my neighbors' complaint was politely dismissive as they showed him the photo and nervously struggled to explain the incident.

Discussions, questions and expectations have multiplied among us since the announcement from Barack Obama and Raul Castro about the reestablishment of relations between the United States and Cuba. We citizens have a lot of questions about the process and its influence on the future of our country. Tom Malinowski, United States Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor has responded to some of these questions for 14ymedio. Today we present his answers to our readers. Sanchez: The US has announced several measures to ease its policy towards Cuba. During the negotiations has the Cuban government shown a list of measures it is willing to implement? Malinowski: It is important to note that the measures announced by President Obama were not things he has asked of Cuban government. They have been steps we would like to take to empower the Cuban people. The objective is to strengthen the possibility that the people themselves can change the public policies of the Cuban government through greater access to resources and information, as well as to improve the quality of life for Cuban citizens who have lived with unnecessary social, economic and political restrictions imposed by the government. The Cuban government has indicated that it will release 53 political prisoners, an important first step for us, and it will also allow its people greater access to the internet. We have no illusions that it will be easy, but we feel that now we have an opportunity and we will be pushing hard. Q: Do you think President Obama or Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Cuba in the coming months? Would it not be against the embargo? R: President Obama has said that from now on senior US government officials will visit Cuba. Roberta Jacobson, Assistant Secretary of State for the Americas, will be responsible for the delegation that will travel to Havana in January 2015 for the round of negotiations about migration between the United States and Cuba. Secretary of State John Kerry has also said that he hopes to be the first Secretary of State in 60 years to visit Cuba. With regards to the embargo, US law prohibits certain transactions with agencies of the Cuban government. President Obama announced several modifications to the rules to facilitate the flow of resources and information to the Cuban people. In any case, visits of high officials will be part of the new diplomatic relationship between our countries. Q: Has legalization and an opening for a free and independent press in Cuba been among the topics discussed by the two governments? A:  Yes. A key focus of our policy will be to support civil society so that every Cuban can have the right to freedom of expression, association, assembly and the press. We will insist on these reforms in our meetings with the Cuban government working together with other countries in Latin American and Europe. We will continue to implement programs financed by the United States Congress to support fundamental freedoms, including freedom of the press and the free flow of information. The changes announced by President Obama eliminate one of the pretexts used by the Cuban government to persecute citizens who work to guarantee that the people have more freedoms. Now the focus of attention will not be on US policy toward Cuba, but on the policies of the Cuban government itself. Q: Is there a schedule with already defined timelines to put into effect the measures announced on 17 December? And if so, when will it be made public? A: President Obama wants to streamline the process so that the vision he presented in his speech is implemented as soon as possible The Secretary of State and all the members of president's cabinet understand the urgency that exists to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the new measures. The changes in our regulations to increase travel and trade will happen very quickly; the normalization of relations will depend on the Cuban government and also that of the United States. This issue will be discussed by the Undersecretary of State Roberta Jacobson in January. The next four years will change America forever.

Credit Desmond Boylan/Associated Press (Taken from the New York Times) [From the New York Times] HAVANA -- In one of my earliest memories, I am in a schoolyard before a campfire. The kids are screaming and jumping around it while the teacher stokes the flames, where a ridiculous Uncle Sam puppet is burning. This image came to mind on Wednesday, as I listened to the speeches of Raúl Castro and Barack Obama about the re-establishment of relations between Cuba and the United States. Generations of Cubans have grown up under the barrage of official propaganda against the United States. As the words directed against our neighbor to the north became more aggressive, our curiosity only grew. Overwhelmed by material precariousness, disillusioned because the so-called Raúl reforms have failed to fill their wallets or their plates, Cubans now dream of the material respite that might arrive from the other side of the Florida Straits. Without a fight, David, smiling, walks toward Goliath, who is about to open his bag of coins. The myth of the enemy is over; the difficult reality of coexistence has begun. Sara is a teacher I know at an elementary school in the Plaza of the Revolution municipality. Without the help sent by her daughter every month she couldn't survive. ""Now everything will be easier, especially because we'll be able to use American credit and debit cards here and my daughter is thinking of sending me one so I can get a little help whenever I need it,"" she said. Sara has decorated her classroom with a poster that includes images of the ""Cuban Five,"" spies whom the official propaganda considers heroes. (The Americans released the last three of them as part of a swap for a Cuban who had worked as an agent for American intelligence.) ""They are back, so we will have to change the bulletin board,"" she said with excitement and relief. Bonifacio Crespo helps a brother with accounting for their private restaurant in Havana. They already have a new business plan. ""We have the contacts to start importing raw materials, spices and many products for the menu, all we need is for them to expand the sending of packages from over there,"" he said, his finger pointing toward a cardinal point he believed was north. José Daniel Ferrer, a dissident, said that Havana had lost its ""alibi"" for political repression and economic control, and the independent magazine Convivencia (Coexistence) welcomed the news, but other dissidents worry that the government has yet to specify what it will do. The tension between the two governments lasted so long that now some people don't know what to do with their slogans, their fists raised against imperialism and their sick tendency to justify everything, from droughts to repression, on the grounds of being so close to ""the most powerful country in the world."" The worst off are the most recalcitrant members of the Communist Party, those who would die before chewing a stick of gum, drinking a Coke or setting foot in Disney World. The first secretary of their organization just betrayed them. He made a pact with the adversary, behind the scenes and over 18 long months. On Thursday, the party newspaper, Granma, was slow to reach the newsstands. Sometimes it is delayed when Fidel Castro publishes one of his delirious articles about the immensity of the galaxy or the memory of Hugo Chávez. In the long minutes of waiting, many speculated that Granma would arrive with some reflection from the comandante, but there was nothing. No evidence that would let us know whether he is for or against the risky step just taken by his brother. Many have read this silence as a sign of his delicate state of health, but by saying nothing, he has confirmed his political death, which is even more revealing and symbolic than his physical death will be. Representatives of civil society do not want the United States to ""extend a blank check"" to the longest-standing totalitarian regime in the Western Hemisphere unless four demands are met. First is the immediate release of political prisoners -- there are over 100, Elizardo Sánchez of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation estimates. Second is the ratification of United Nations human rights covenants. Third is the dismantling of the apparatus of repression: shameful assaults on so-called counterrevolutionaries, arbitrary arrests, demonization and intimidation of those who think differently and police surveillance of activists. Finally, the Cuban government must accept the existence of civic structures that have the right to express opinions, decide, question and choose -- voices that have not been represented in the current negotiations between the governments of Cuba and the United States. The road map drawn by the higher-ups has been hidden from us. An opportunity has been offered, despite the valid criticisms of many who question whether Uncle Sam has conceded too much, while his counterpart was too stingy to offer meaningful political gestures. Civil society must take advantage of it, elevate its voice, test the new limits of repression and censorship.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/has-d-day-arrived-for-cub_b_6402792,12/31/2014,yoani sanchez,Has D-Day Arrived for Cuba?,"Telephone conversation between Barack Obama and Raul Castro. (White House) 14ymedio, Yoani Sanchez, Havana, 17 December 2014 -- Today has been one of those days we imagine a thousand ways, but never as it finally happened. You prepare for a date on which you can celebrate the end, hug your friends who return home, wave a flag in the middle of the street, but D-Day is late. Instead, events arrive in fragments, an advance here, a loss there. With no cries of ""Long live free Cuba,"" nor uncorked bottles. Life obscures from us this turning point that we would mark forever on our calendars. The announcement by the governments of Cuba and the United States of the reestablishments of diplomatic relations surprises us in the midst of signs that pointed in the opposite direction, and also of exhausted hopes. Raúl Castro just postponed the third round of talks with the European Union, scheduled for next month, and this December 10 repression fell heavily on activists, as it does every International Human Rights Day. The first surprise was that, in the midst of the official bluster, of a certain turn of the ideological screw expressed in calls to redouble our guard against the enemy, the Plaza of the Revolution and the White House had been in talks for 18 months. Clear evidence that all this discourse of intransigence was just for show. While they made the island's citizens believe that even to cross the threshold of the United States Interest Section in Havana turned them into traitors to the homeland, the leaders in their olive-green were working out agreements with Uncle Sam. The deceits of politics! On the other hand, both Obama's statements, as well as Castro's, had a hint of capitulation. The US president announced a long list of moderating measures to bring the two nations closer, before the coveted and greatly demanded steps of democratization and political opening in our country would be achieved. The dilemma of what should have come first, a gesture from Havana or flexibility from Washington, has just been answered. However, the fig leaf of the American embargo remains, so that no one can say the resignation as been complete. Raul Castro, for his part, limited himself to announcing the new gestures from Obama and referring to the exchange of Alan Gross and other prisoners of interest of the American government. However, in his address before the national television cameras, he gave no evidence of any agreement or compromise from the Cuban side, aside from the reestablishment of diplomatic relations. The agenda on the far side of the Florida Straits we know in detail, but the internal one remains, as it so often does, hidden and secret. Still, despite the absence of public commitments on the part of Cuba, today was a political defeat. Under the leadership of Fidel Castro we would have never even reached an outline of an agreement of this nature. Because the Cuban system is supported by -- as one of its main pillars -- the existence of a permanent rival. David can't live without Goliath and the ideological apparatus has depended too long on this dispute. Do I listen to speeches or buy fish? In the central market of Carlos III, customers were surprised midday that the big TVs were not broadcasting football or videoclips, but a speech by Raúl Castro and later one by Obama through the Telesur network. The first allocution caused a certain astonishment, but the second was accompanied by kisses launched toward the face of the US president, particularly when he mentioned relaxations in the sending of remittances to Cuba and the delicate topic of telecommunications. Now and again the cry of ""I LOVE..."" (in English!) could be heard from around the corner. It is important to also say that the news had fierce competition, like the arrival of fish to the rationed market, after years of disappearance. However, by mid-afternoon almost everyone was aware and the shared feelings were of joy, relief, hope. This, however, is just the beginning. Lacking is a public timeline by which commits the Cuban government to a series of gestures in support of democratization and respect for differences. We must take advantage of the synergy of both announcements to extract a public promise, which must include, at a minimum, four consensus points that civil society has been developing in recent months. The release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience; the end of political repression; the ratification of the United Nations covenants on Civil, Political, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the consequent adjustment of domestic laws; and the recognition of Cuban civil society within and outside the island. Extracting these commitments would begin the dismantling of totalitarianism. As long as steps of this magnitude are not taken, many of us will continue to think that the day we have longed for is not close. So, we will keep the flags tucked away, keep the corks in the bottles and continue to press for the final coming of D-Day. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alan-gross-the-hook-that_b_6402786,12/31/2014,yoani sanchez,"Alan Gross, the Hook That Ended Up Being Swallowed","Demonstrations demanding the release of Alan Gross 14ymedio, Yoani Sanchez, Havana, 17 December 2014 - With the pessimism that has now become chronic in our society, many Cubans thought that Alan Gross would only leave Cuba, ""in a box,"" in an image allusive of a fatal outcome. The stubbornness shown by the Cuban government in its relations with the United States didn't presage a short-term solution for the contractor. This Wednesday, however, he has been exchanged for three Cuban spies imprisoned in the United States, bringing to a close a long and complicated political chapter for both parties. Gross was only useful alive and his health was rapidly deteriorating. And Raul Castro knew this very well. Hence, in recent months he raised the decibels around the proposed exchange for the agent Antonio Guerrero and the officials Ramón Labañino and Gerardo Hernández, all serving long sentences in the prisons of our neighbor to the north. To the extent that the 65-year-old contractor grew thin and lost his vision, official campaigns grew increasingly insistent about the exchange. When Gross threatened to kill himself, the alarms if the island's government went off and the negotiating schedule accelerated. Barack Obama, for his part, made clear that any change in policy toward Havana would come up against the insurmountable obstacle of an American imprisoned for ""threats against the security of the State."" Even the New York Times had suggested an exchange in one of its editorials on Cuba, and the publication of that text in such a prestigious newspaper was read as a preview of what would happen. As in every political game, we see only one part, while in the intricacies of power the threads of the agreement made public just today were being woven. For those of us who know the mechanism of pressure used by the Plaza of the Revolution toward its opponents, the capture of Gross itself was a move aimed at recovering the Interior Ministry's agents. The contractor wasn't arrested for what he did, but rather for what they could do with him. It was a simple hook and he was aware of this from the beginning. His crime was not in having brought satellite equipment to connect the Cuban Jewish community to the Internet, but rather in carrying in his pocket a passport that immediately converted him into a medium of exchange on the board of tense bilateral relations between Washington and Havana. If we review the five years of captivity endured by Gross, we see a well-designed information script that the Cuban government used to put pressure on the Obama administration. Each image that came to light publicly, each visitor allowed to see him, was authorized with the sole condition of reinforcing the exchange proposal. In this way, the Castro regime has managed to get its way. It has managed to exchange a peaceful man, embarked on the humanitarian adventure of providing connectivity to a group of Cubans, for intelligence agents that caused significant damage and sorrow with their actions. In the game of politics, totalitarian regimes manage to win over democracies because the former control the public opinion inside their countries, determine all legal results to suit their purposes, and can continue to waste their nation's resources trying to free the moles they sent to their adversary's camp. Democracies, however, end up conceding because they must answer to their own people, they must live with an incisive press that criticizes them for making or not making certain decisions, and because they are forced to do everything possible bring their dead and alive back home. The Castro regime has won, although the positive result is that Alan Gross has emerged alive from a prison that promised to turn into his grave. Now, we can expect long weeks of cheering and slogans in which the Cuban government will proclaim itself a victor in its latest battle. But, there is no space in the national pantheon for so many still-breathing heroes, and little by little, the recently returned agents will lose importance and visibility. The myth created for them from a distance will begin to fade. With the main obstacle for the re-establishment of diplomatic relations eliminated, the only unknown is the next step. Is the Cuban government planning another move to return to a position of force vis-a-vis the US government? Or are all the cards on the table this time, before the weary eyes of a population that anticipates that the Castro regime will also win the next move.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/beyond-selma---writing-th_b_6402740,12/31/2014,bennet kelley,Beyond Selma - Writing the Next Chapter in American Civil Rights History,"In November 2012, I worked with the Obama campaign's anti-voter suppression efforts in Florida. I was shocked when I saw that voters in largely Hispanic and African-American areas were forced to wait hours and hours to vote by design. The state had cut early voting from 14 to 6 days and added 11 constitutional amendments to the ballot (some written out in full) to make it more time consuming to vote such that one legislator compared the ballot to the Book of Leviticus. I also was told authorities did not deploy all available ballot boxes. Tasked with encouraging voters to wait for over 3 hours until 10:30 p.m. on a Saturday, I was struck with how little needed to be done. They knew why they were waiting and that only made them more determined to vote. I was reminded of the song ""Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Round"" and the voting rights marches in Selma during the Civil Rights era and thought how sad it is that here we stand nearly 50 years after Selma and African-Americans still had to fight for their right to vote. The next year, the Supreme Court gutted the enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act that enabled the Justice Department to block discriminatory voting restrictions in Shelby County v Holder. The Act had been reauthorized in 2006 without a single vote of opposition in the Senate, but in the Obama-era a bill to revive the provisions got nowhere last year despite bipartisan support. The struggle in Selma is now on movie screens across America for viewers to relive the brutality of Bloody Sunday and the ultimate triumphant march that drew Americans from all races and faiths from across the nation to take a stand for freedom and against bigotry and hate. In March, however, the world's attention will once again return to the Edmond Pettus Bridge for the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. It will be a tempered celebration because it has been a difficult two years for race relations in America. Obama's reelection victory unleashed a torrent of racist hate across social media, then came the killings of Treyvon Martin in Florida, Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York and the divisions their cases brought. More importantly, throughout the period we have steadily moved backwards on voting rights as states across the south and elsewhere took advantage of the Shelby County decision to enact a number of restrictive voting measures that are designed to suppress the African-American vote. I have one resolution for 2015 -- I'm going to Selma. As a child of Generation Jones, we always looked up to our Baby Boomer brethren who marched for civil rights when we had no need to for the victory had been won. That victory is in jeopardy.  I'm going to Selma. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Mickey Schwerner among others were killed for this most fundamental right -- the right to vote. They cannot cry for justice, instead it is the duty of the living to do so for them. I'm going to Selma. I do not expect a House of Representatives that has no shame over having a white supremacist in its leadership to listen to our pleas for action on voting rights legislation. I'm going to Selma. Martin Luther King once said, ""[h]istory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people."" Similarly, Benjamin Franklin said that ""[j]ustice will not be served until those who are as unaffected are as outraged as those who are.""  I'm outraged and I'm going to Selma. We are a generous nation that has come together to help those in need as we did after Katrina or to take a stand that we are one as we did after 9/11. The story of civil rights in America is not relegated to our history books or a movie but is still being written today. It is time to write the next chapter for civil rights in America. Once again we are called to take a stand for freedom and against bigotry and hate. I'm going to Selma. The next four years will change America forever.

Kafka skillfully navigates the line between blame and responsibility, between chance and conscious decision making, which are all so fundamentally different in the case of an adult and in the case of a child. Kafka never mailed the letter to his father, continuing a lifetime pattern of repressed emotions and lack of communication. We will never know how Kafka's father would have reacted to that letter, but one thing is clear: Connection and communication are essential if a relationship is to exist. The tremendous negative results of broken or unskillful communication are even more obvious in the light of Ferguson and Staten Island incidents. We live in one of the most prosperous nations in the world, one that even contains the word ""united"" in its name. Still, no fewer than 458 Americans died at the hands of police in 2013, compared with just eight in Germany and zero in both Japan and the UK. Deaths from police shootings: USA 458Germany 8Britain 0Japan 0http://t.co/7hHhuWiuNd pic.twitter.com/boleSgPvZx Also, the United States has the highest rate of incarceration in the developed world: 2.3 million men and women, or one in every 104 of the nation's adults, are behind bars. The incarceration rate is higher in the U.S. than it is in Russia, China or Iran -- company the U.S. should not want to be in. Although incarceration seems to be very popular in the U.S., research is ambiguous about its corrective value, specifically when it's about small offenses. But studies have consistently found that prisoners who maintain close contact with their family members while incarcerated have better post-release outcomes and lower recidivism rates. A 2011 report by the Vera Institute of Justice states: Research shows that incarcerated people who maintain supportive relationships with family members have better outcomes -- such as stable housing and employment -- when they return to the community. We can go a step further and argue that what needs to happen in offenders' lives is the exact opposite of incarceration: an increase in quality social relationships, not a complete cutoff from society and a concomitant increase in close relationships with other perpetrators. Like many children, Blair Sandlain went her entire childhood with her father behind bars, and this experience gave her the idea to create an app that helps families bridge the communication gap that incarceration so often entails. Connect Inmate, which is free to download, aims to make it easy for families to communicate in a meaningful way with incarcerated loved ones. She explains, ""Often times what keeps inmates out of trouble and gives them hope is the awareness that someone outside cares for them."" Meanwhile, however, the U.S.'s habit of incarcerating people has created a profitable private prison industry. As David Shapiro, a staff attorney with the ACLU National Prison Project, writes on CNBC.com: As incarceration rates skyrocket, the private prison industry expands at exponential rates. The number of inmates in private prisons increased by roughly 1600 percent between 1990 and 2009. In 2010, the two largest private prison companies alone took in nearly $3 billion in revenue, and their top executives each received annual compensation packages worth well over $3 million. According to the Vera Institute, in 2010 we spent $39 billion in public money on incarceration, a portion of which is generating large profits for private prisons. The questions is: What is the impact on American cultural and social relationships when we, as a nation, allow corporations to profit from incarcerating more and more of our very own citizens? Our knowledge of social and family relationships has changed significantly since 1919, when Kafka wrote -- but never sent -- that letter to his father. We now know so much more about the importance of meaningful human connection. And still it seems that, to a great extent, we prefer circulating money over creating social meaning.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/listen-up-my-favorite-ame_b_6402672,12/31/2014,lisa snedeker,Listen Up! My Favorite Americana Discoveries of 2014,"One of the reasons I attend Americana music festivals is for the opportunity to be exposed to new music and musicians I might never have sampled on my own. Following is a list of some my favorite Americana musical discoveries of 2014 in no particular order and where I first heard them. I hope that you will share your own discoveries. Sunliner -- Rooster Walk 6 and Reynolda House Backyard Barbecue and Brews Sunliner is a song-driven roots rock band that fuses the artistry of The Infamous Stringduster's lead singer and bass player Travis Book and his singer/songwriter wife Sarah Siskind, whose songs have been featured on ABC's hit show Nashville and Pretty Little Liars, among others. At SXSW 2013, Time Magazine called her ""one of the 5 best voices."" According to their website, Sunliner's sound is unique, encompassing rock, folk, country, jazz fusion and blues, but the music remains firmly rooted in the Virginia soil where they now make their home. Both amazing artists in their own right, I hope to hear more from this husband and wife team in 2015. Balsam Range -- MerleFest Balsam Range is made up of five outstanding acoustic musicians and singers from Western North Carolina. According to their website, for their band name they thoughtfully and respectfully adopted the name of a majestic range of mountains that surround part of their home county of Haywood, where the Smokies meet the Blue Ridge, the Balsam Range. The band received numerous top honors in the 2014 IBMA Awards, including Entertainer of the Year. Balsam Range was also honored as Vocal Group of the Year. Buddy Melton was named Male Vocalist of the Year, and Tim Surrett received a Mentor Award. The band's fifth album, Five, made its Billboard Chart debut at No. 4 and remained on the Billboard chart for an impressive six weeks. I heard them playing one afternoon at MerleFest and they had me at their single, ""Trains I've Missed."" I believe they will have your attention if you give them a listen.  Sturgill Simpson -- Prairie Home Companion (My backyard) So this one you may say doesn't count because I didn't hear him perform in person, but I did hear Sturgill Simpson perform on Prairie Home Companion ""live"" on my radio in my backyard and he is too good a find to leave off my list (and hey, it's MY list, after all, so who's to say who does and doesn't count?). If you haven't heard him, it's only a matter of time. He and his new album, Metamodern Sounds In Country Music, made a number of best of 2014 lists, including NPR's 10 Breakout Artists of 2014. He's been compared to Waylon and an early Hank Williams Jr., But don't take our word for it, judge for yourself here. The Deadly Gentlemen -- MerleFest The Deadly Gentlemen were the last act I caught at MerleFest 2014 before listening to Merle Haggard, who closed out this year's festival with an impressive performance. The only reason I happened to hear The Deadly Gentlemen was because they hit the Hillside Stage after Jerry Douglas, whom I will stand in the pouring rain to hear make sweet music with his dobro. Based out of NYC (yes I know, it seems unlikely that a band from THE city would be playing in the hills of Wilkesboro, N.C.), they had me wishing for more. I think you will, too, after you give them a listen here. After Jack - Rooster Walk 6 After Jack caught my attention at Rooster Walk with their amazing harmonies and foot-stomping, old-timey string band tunes. The Franklin County, Va., trio merged in 2011 after meeting while working as performers in a professional theater company, according to their website. Their first album, Echo, was produced by Aaron Ramsey of Mountain Heart. After Jack couples a modern sensibility with distinctly old-time energy to blend bluegrass, gospel and folk elements. The band won the Local Roots Band Competition at the Red Wing Roots Music Festival in July 2014. After Jack, which is scheduled to perform at Rooster Walk 7 over Memorial Day weekend, was named the 2014 Americana Vocal Band of the Year by the Appalachian Cultural Music Association and competed in the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Competition. Hackensaw Boys -- FloydFest The Hackensaw Boys caught my attention at FloydFest 2014 when someone mentioned they were tied to Old Crow Medicine Sbow, one of my all-time favorite groups. Turns out, according to Wikipedia, Phillip ""Jigsaw"" St. Ours played washboard in both Hackensaw and Old Crow early on (1999-2001), and then for Hackensaw in (2008). Like OCMS, The Hackensaw Boys are a lot of fun to watch, and I dare you not to dance when you hear them play. Sanctum Sully - MerleFest and Rooster Walk 6 I am slipping Sanctum Sully on this list because they had a new album in 2014, Southern Trees. To be honest, however, I actually discovered them last year for the first time at Rooster Walk 5. This rockin' bluegrass band is so good, and were so amazing at their MerleFest 2014 debut, I had to add them to this list so that I could share their music with an even wider audience. The hit TV show Moonshiners should use Sanctum Sully's Lost Cove as its theme song. Based out of Asheville, N.C., the band describes their music as coming from beer-stained bar stools where blues, rock and bluegrass swap stories and trade tall-tale tunes. The polished five-piece acoustic group has been voted one of Western North Carolina's top three bluegrass bands for four years running. As their website states, three-part harmonies, mandolin, guitar, banjo and bass, Sanctum Sully can certainly pull off a traditional bluegrass tune in style. They are also a lot of fun. Mountain Xpress describes Sanctum Sully as, ""Like Steep Canyon Rangers or Chatham County Line, the band's melodic pathways are paved mostly with pop, harnessing tangled acoustic instrumentation to make hooks as unavoidably catchy as mountain bramble."" Give them a listen. You won't be disappointed. Mandolin Orange --- MerleFest I caught a few strains of Mandolin Orange performing on the Americana stage and knew immediately I wanted to hear more. What I didn't realize at the time was the duo hails from Kernersville, N.C., just down the road from me. Over the past few years, according to their website, Mandolin Orange has shared bills with Rosanne Cash, Chatham County Line, the Steep Canyon Rangers and Abigail Washburn, and traveled as far as the UK to perform at festivals, including Ulster's 21st Annual Bluegrass Festival, Shakori Hills Grassroots and Hopscotch Music Festival. TAUK -- FloydFest TAUK is a bit of a divergence from the rest of my list, but after interviewing these guys from Oyster Bay, N.Y., at FloydFest and discovering how genuine they are and hearing everyone else's reaction to their music, I felt compelled to include them. The quartet keeps popping up on my Sirius radio as a reminder of what I heard from them last summer and their newest album, Collisions. Their website describes their music as heavy instrumental rock fusion created by Matt Jalbert (guitar), Charlie Dolan (bass), Alric ""A.C."" Carter (keyboard-organ) and Isaac Teel (drums). The Washington Post says: ""TAUK's instrumental music melds genres and styles, creating a hard-charging, often melodic fusion that -- thanks to a penchant for improv -- offers limitless possibilities"" and The Deli Magazine singles out the band's compelling melodic sense through explaining: ""the quartet has a rare ability to channel emotional melodic leads, and all without a lead singer.""

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-year-2014-for-organiz_b_6402624,12/31/2014,david macaray,The Year 2014 for Organized Labor,"It's something of a disgrace to have to admit that things have been so bad for organized labor for such a long time, that unless something truly horrendous or headline-grabbing happens during a particular year (e.g., an industry fails, a union membership is decimated), we tend not even to pay attention. So tepid and uninspiring is the labor landscape, even the occasional strike or boycott is met with a collective ""ho-hum."" Meanwhile, private sector membership continues to dwindle, workers' power continues to be eroded and corporations continue to find new ways of out-maneuvering the unions. While 2014 was one of those ""ho-hum"" years, there were some notable exceptions. By engaging in a collective protest of their abysmally low wages, fast-food workers at national restaurant chains and were able to attract some prime-time media attention. Granted, their time in the limelight was short-lived and ephemeral, but these orchestrated protests were not only a step in the right direction, they were way overdue. And Thomas Perez, who replaced Hilda Solis (and the interim Seth Harris), finished his first full year as Secretary of Labor in the Obama administration. Among the groups to endorse Perez's nomination were the AFL-CIO, UFW (United Farm Workers) and NAACP, so at the very least, Perez looked good on paper. The woman he's replacing, Ms. Solis, did an adequate job as Labor Secretary (she resigned to run for Congress), particularly in regard to assisting low-level restaurant, hotel and carwash employees (""carwasheros""), most of whom are Latinos, and many of whom are systematically victimized by unscrupulous bosses. In fact, the Department of Labor was able to get criminal charges to stick against a couple of corrupt Southern California carwash owners, guilty of cheating workers out of their pay. In the two years Perez has left on the job, he will have ample opportunity to show whether he's the real deal -- a labor reformer and crusader -- or just another ambitious, over-achieving Ivy Leaguer (Brown, Harvard Law) looking to pad his resume while sucking on the government teat (a la former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, another Harvard Law School product). The last really impressive Secretary of Labor we had -- arguably, second only to the legendary FDR appointee, Frances Perkins, the first woman Labor Secretary in history -- was Robert Reich, who served in Clinton's first term before resigning in exasperation. He now teaches at UC Berkeley. Anyone interested in a fascinating insider's look at the Department of Labor would be advised to read Reich's memoir, ""Locked in the Cabinet."" There was also a changing of the guard at the UAW (United Auto Workers), with Dennis Williams replacing outgoing president Bob King. Given its illustrious history and immeasurable influence on the American labor movement, focusing on the UAW's current state of affairs is almost too gruesome to contemplate. Once boasting of 1.8 million members, the UAW is now down to a mere 390,000. By all accounts, Williams is a gamer, a fighter, ready to push for the reinstatement of boiler-plate contract language (including elimination of two-tier wages and benefits). The only question is: At this late stage, does he have the muscle to do it? Because he'll need every resource he can scrounge up to pull it off. The year 2014 was a terrible one for public school teachers, as the greedy proponents of for-profit education attempted to demonize and vilify them, pretending that low test scores (themselves very misleading) were the direct result of substandard teachers -- not only a specious argument but one calculated specifically to destroy America's teachers' unions. Arguably, the only union that continues to behave like the proud unions of the 1950s and 1960s is the ILWU (International Longshore and Warehouse Union), and that's due solely to the fact that they have a firm grip on job security. As much as they would love to do so, the shipping companies can't relocate the West Coast ports to a Third World country, and pay cheap wages. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/minimum-wage-increases-the-justice-of-redistribution_b_6399030,12/31/2014,john r burbank,Minimum-Wage Increases: The Justice of Redistribution,"As we enter the new year, 3 million low-wage workers in 21 states will gain a small increase in their wages, thanks to increases in state minimum wages. People you know will see a wage increase -- your neighbor, your teenage kid, the person who serves you coffee and donuts. The minimum-wage increase is a good thing because it increases income in a small way to the workers on the low rungs of our economy. A stagnant minimum wage redistributes income from workers to owners and managers and, ultimately, shareholders and customers. As the minimum wage has failed to keep up with inflation and productivity increases, our political economy has redistributed significant income from low-wage workers to owners over the past 40 years. One reason this happened is that workers have no leverage vis-à-vis corporations. They are price takers for their labor. Minimum-wage increases reverse this redistribution so that workers win back a little bit of what they have lost. Minimum wages should be associated with value added instead of the powerlessness of workers to demand higher wages. But minimum-wage workers are not compensated for the value of their work for their employers. Raising the wage begins to remedy that undercompensation. If the wage goes too high, then employers will not hire workers, because their compensation exceeds the value of their work. But as we have seen, this is not the case with minimum-wage increases, which simply means that for the past decades workers have been paid less than the value of their work for employers. How does increasing the minimum wage redistribute income? An increase in the wage results in a decrease in the payments to managers and profits for the establishment. That's redistribution. We can argue that this might not happen because of productivity increases by the worker, but that merely means that the productivity increases (or a portion thereof) that might have gone to the employer instead go to the employee -- hence redistribution from owners to workers. Redistribution also can occur between worker and customer. If a restaurant increases prices due to an increase in the minimum wage, in an attempt to avoid a decrease in profits, then the customers pay more. These customers have the disposable income to patronize restaurants. We can make the assumption that the customers have greater incomes than the people who wait on them. Thus, an increase is again redistributive, with the increase coming from increased prices paid by customers. Imagine: In Seattle an Amazon IT person goes out to lunch. (It feels like they all do.) Instead of paying $15 at the Skillet truck, they pay $17. They have lost $2, and the Skillet truck workers will have seen an increase in their wages. Redistribution to minimum-wage workers is good for them and pushes up the floor for the bottom half of all wages. We too often equate increasing the minimum wage with living standards and poverty levels. This is dangerous for several reasons, including the fact that it sets a precedent for slicing and dicing the minimum wage: Do you have dependents? Do you pay for your own health insurance? How old are you? Are you paying for tuition yourself? All these are important questions, but taken to their logical conclusion, they move the minimum wage into welfare policy, so that an 18-year-old student could get paid less than a 25-year-old who is on her parents' health insurance, and she might get paid less than a single mom with one kid, who could get paid less than a spouse in a household with three kids, etc. These are life situations best handled by social policy, social insurance and the appropriate provisions of public goods and services. But a focus on the minimum wage as welfare policy debases the fact that we should be raising the minimum wage because we should be insuring that workers are paid the value of their work. That is, such a focus disrespects workers as workers. A lot of liberals don't want to call increases in the minimum wage ""redistributive."" It brings the reality of class conflict too close to the surface, apparently, and portrays workers as workers, not as victims. But in order for workers to not be victims, they must be compensated for the value of their work. That is not happening now, not in these United States. These state minimum-wage increases begin to reverse the damage, precisely because they are redistributive, from the owners of capital to the workers they employ. That is a good thing -- and an excellent beginning for the new year! The next four years will change America forever.

It was the year my second child was born. In terms of pop culture, it was a mixed bag. On a positive tip (I want to try using that phrase to see if I can bring it back), Michael Keaton made a comeback, U2 released one of their best albums in decades (don't hate), and Chris Pratt became a movie star. On a downside, we lost way too many talented people this year from Robin Williams to Joan Rivers to Philip Seymour Hoffman. In a word, it sucks. It will always suck. Williams' death in particular will always hurt because of all the good he brought to us all. Anyway, as we close another year, here are my personal favorite moments in pop - music, TV, and film. Arts aside, let's all appreciate what we have more in the new year, love each other more, and hurt each other less. Live love. Love life.

About A-Sides with Jon Chattman:Jon Chattman's music series features celebrities and artists (established or not) from all genres of music performing a track, and discussing what it means to them. This informal series focuses on the artist making art in a low-threatening, extremely informal (sometime humorous) way. No bells, no whistles -- just the music performed in a random, low-key setting followed by an unrehearsed chat.

""De Blasio: Apologize to the NYPD!!"" the sign, which flew up and down the Hudson River for about an hour and a half, read. NEW YORK: Banner reading “De Blasio: Apologize to the NYPD!!” flew over Hudson River for thousands to see. PHOTO - pic.twitter.com/Pnnb0Zk0WQ According to the New York Daily News, Michael Sheehan, a retired correction officer from Westchester County and son of an NYPD detective, was behind the stunt. ""The reason my father came home everyday was because none of his bosses placed him in such peril as you are doing with your mouth, Mayor de Blasio,"" he said in a statement. On Friday, a coalition of current and retired NYPD officers flew a banner above the Hudson that read, ""De Blasio, Our Backs Have Turned To You."" Tensions have been high between de Blasio and the police department following weeks of demonstrations protesting a grand jury's decision not to indict an NYPD officer in the choking death of Eric Garner, who was unarmed when he died in Staten Island in July. On December 20, two on-duty NYPD officers were killed ""execution style"" by a man who suggested he wanted revenge for Garner's death on social media. Following the officers' deaths, a number of NYPD officers and officials have publicly displayed their disdain for the mayor, who has shown support for protesters engaging in non-violent demonstrations. The day of the shooting, Pat Lynch, the head of the city's largest police union, said the mayor had ""blood on his hands."" During one of the slain officer's funerals, hundreds of cops turned their backs on de Blasio during his speech. A few days later, he was booed at an NYPD graduation ceremony.

""With these acts of passive-aggressive contempt and self-pity, many New York police officers, led by their union, are squandering the department’s credibility, defacing its reputation, shredding its hard-earned respect,"" the first, published on Tuesday, read.

At the end of the day, bullying -- whether in school or online -- is still bullying so strategies to combat cyberbullying have to be integrated into the entire school climate. There are a lot of programs that seek to accomplish this and what the good ones have in common is the understanding that young people themselves are an essential part of the solution. One such program, Community Matters, has been around since 1996. The Northern-California based non-profit reports that it has worked with more than 1,000 schools, agencies and organizations across 30 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and Canada. And, as its CEO and founder Rick Phillips said in an interview (scroll down to listen to 14 minute podcast) the organization's strategy is to ""see the young people in our schools (including those who may have engaged in bullying) not just as the perpetrator but as the solution."" He added that ""young people are in the best position to intervene because they see, hear and know about these things before an adult ever knows about them."" He said that ""young people are powerful,"" but ""adults underutilize youth.""

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-years-reflections-on-race-relations_b_6391130,12/31/2014,deborah l. plummer,New Year's Reflections on Race Relations,"To quote Pharrell Williams' hit song ""Happy,"" ""it might seem crazy, what I'm about to say."" In regard to race relations, there wasn't much to be happy about in 2014. Still, I'm happy and optimistic about race relations in 2015. Despite the celebration of 50 years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans remain as segregated as ever, particularly in our social patterns and in our attitudes about the progress we have made toward that more perfect union. Although standard segregation measures show that American cities are more integrated now than they have been since 1910, spatial racism as a pattern of housing development still exists. We connect globally through numerous devices with just a finger tap, yet we remain ethnocentric in our thinking. National polls reveal that the majority of Americans do not have friends that cross racial lines, and that our social networks only comprise those of our own race; thus we suffer from cultural encapsulation. The lessons to be learned from the racially charged comments of sports-team owners and the policing practices that result in the killing of unarmed black men and deep mistrust between law enforcement and black and brown communities remain on our segregated tables. Although I am not quite feeling the happiness of a room without a roof, I do believe that there are reasons to clap along and be encouraged that race relations can and will improve in 2015. I am not looking for another Martin Luther King Jr., or even for President Obama, to lead the way. A single person as leader cannot make the kind of changes necessary to improve today's race relations. We are beyond legislating race in America. The leadership that is required to mend current race relations has to come from a collective force so powerful that it can only result in forward movement. In my happy world, I envision a critical mass of everyday people who make these practices the norm: 1. Listening for understanding and not rebuttal. You know that you have achieved this if you ask probing or clarifying questions about what was just said in lieu of tapping your foot, waiting to pounce with an ingenious comeback. This practice is especially hard when you believe that (and sometimes even know that) you are right. Which brings me to my next point. 2. Releasing the need to be right. Support dialogues that hold multiple realities, work to understand what the other perspective might be, and continually ask, ""What would help me understand that perspective?"" In conversations about race, instead of trying to be right, ask yourself, ""How does this change the narrative on race relations? Does this comment elevate the conversation to something that will lead to progress?"" 3. Challenging assumptions. Question anecdotal generalizations that broadly paint any race (that includes white people) with broad strokes. Hold multiple realities and seek new ways of knowing. 4. Marrying intention and impact. Understand that a negative impact does not always come as a result of bad intentions. Understand that good intentions do not necessarily lessen a negative impact. 5. Being racially resilient. Racially resilient individuals are folks who stay engaged during racial clashes and don't give up until they are familiar with the script of multicultural living. Racial tensions become creative tensions that lead to new ways of knowing and trusting each other. 6. Fighting racial bias. The bad news is that neuroscience research indicates that parts of the brain, particularly the amygdala, are active in initial racial bias. The good news is that although racial bias may be neurologically based, racial biases are not inevitable. Mahzarin Banaji, a Harvard professor and a thought leader in studying unconscious bias, notes that we can actually train our brains to work against stereotypes and reduce biases by exposing ourselves to counterstereotypical messages and images as a way to limit unconscious bias. This is the image that I will hold as a promise of improved race relations in 2015. Of course, these practices are easier to write than to do. The doing part is very hard, and it takes a lot of collective doing to make any progress. Improving race relations requires cultural humility, knowing that ridding oneself of bias and becoming diversity-proficient is a lifelong journey. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/polar-vortex-of-2015s-cra_b_6402496,12/31/2014,chris weigant,Polar Vortex of 2015's Cray-Cray Banished Words,"As always, as we usher out the old year, our thoughts and browsers turn to the Lake Superior State University in beautiful Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan to see the newly-posted banished words list (the 40th anniversary list!). So I invite all ""wordies"" (oh, I'm a-gonna get some grief for that) to join in the fun! Here is the full list of banished words for 2015: Bae Polar vortex Hack Skill Set Swag Foodie Curate / Curated Friend-raising Cra-cra (cray-cray) Enhanced interrogation Takeaway [...] -Nation (sports) I have to admit, this year's list made me feel my age a bit, since there were several terms on the list that I either just flat-out didn't recognize or that I had to read the definitions for, in order to understand what they were talking about. Take ""bae"" for instance. I'd seen it hovering around online, but never bothered to figure out that it means ""before anyone else."" Or ""swag,"" which now is apparently a catchall word for what folks used to call ""cool."" To which, I can only say: ""Groovy, man."" To put it a different way: ""Dang these kids today."" Anyway, as usual the comments from people proposing words for the banished list were pretty amusing at times: [Bae] -- ""It's overused. I heard someone refer to their ramen noodles as 'bae'! If I was putting someone 'before anything else,' I would respect them enough to use their name."" ""The most annoying term of affection to show up in years. Also, the concept 'before anybody else,' developed AFTER the word became popular. Reason enough for it to be banned."" [Polar vortex] -- ""Wasn't it called 'winter' just a few years ago?"" ""What happened to 'cold snap'? Not descriptive enough?"" [Hack] -- ""I just received an e-mail for a book called 'Marriage Hacks.' I have seen articles about life hacks, home improvement hacks, car hacks, furniture hacks, painting hacks, work hacks and pretty much any other hack you can think of. There are probably even hacking hacks."" [Skill set] -- ""A skill is a skill -- that is it. Phrases such as 'I have the skill set to do that properly' or anything resembling that phrase, shows the speaker is seriously lacking skills in the art of conversation. Please try this, 'I have the skill... do you have the skills... this requires certain skills... he is very skilled... that was a skillful maneuver... See? No need for a skill set."" [Swag] -- ""The word 'swag' has become a shapeless, meaningless word used in various forms (such as 'swaggy') but with no real depth."" ""Whether it's a 'free gift' (banished in 1988) or droopy clothing, this word is neither useful nor fancy."" [Foodie] -- ""It's ridiculous. Do we call people who like wine 'winies' or beer lovers 'beeries'?"" ""Someone who enjoys food' applies to everyone on Earth. What's next? 'Oh, I'm an airie; I just love to breathe.' 'Could we do it at 11, instead? I'm kind of a sleepie.'"" [Curate / Curated] -- ""It used to have a special significance reserved mainly for fine art and museums. Now everything is curated. Monthly food and clothing subscription boxes claim to be finely 'curated.' Instead of abusing curated, why don't they say what they really mean: 'We did an online search and posted the first 25 items we found' or the 'curated selection of items in your box this month are a mix of paid placements and products that have failed to sell elsewhere.'"" [Takeaway] -- ""It's used all too frequently on news programs, as in, 'What is your 'takeaway' on a given situation.' 'What is our 'takeaway' on Congress' vote?' 'Is there any 'takeaway' on the recent riots?' I have heard Jon Stewart use it. I've heard Charlie Rose use it, as well as countless numbers of news talking heads, usually for all the wrong reasons. For me, a takeaway is a sports term, where one team is controlling the ball (or puck) and the other steals it, or took it away - a 'takeaway.' In the U.K., 'takeaway' food is known as 'to go' here in the Colonies."" [-Nation] -- ""Although a devout Wisconsin sports fan, I do not belong to Packer-Nation, Badger-Nation, Phoenix-Nation, or Brewer-Nation. Further, I am not aware of any team or mascot that has the carrying capacity to be a nation."" To which I'd like to add a few personal observations. ""Polar vortex"" is really the continuation of two trends. The first is the rediscovery by the national news organizations of ""weather."" Used to be, national news would ignore most weather events that were purely local in nature, even big events where a few people died. This is no longer the case, and every single weather disruption gets top billing nowadays (mostly because they all have dramatic videos to show the folks at home). The secondary trend -- and this is my own theory -- was when the East Coast got jealous, about 15 or 20 years ago, with the ""El Niño"" and ""La Niña"" weather patterns in California and the Pacific Ocean. The East Coast had blizzards, floods, storms, and other outdoor calamities, but the Left Coast was so hip they had cool names for weather trends. Obviously, they've been trying to catch up ever since. But maybe that's just me.... One footnote on ""swag,"" in its original banished meaning (free stuff): being of Germanic ancestry, I've always used either the pronunciation ""shwag"" (or even ""schwag"") because it sounds better to my ears. This has nothing to do with anything, I fully admit, but I thought I'd toss it out there for discussion. Also up for pedantic pondering: I've always seen ""cray-cray"" written with trailing Y's. It just looks better that way, at least to me. But then again, I am not a hip young user of social media, so what do I know? ""Foodie"" has long irritated me, just because it sounds so downright silly. Haven't noticed the rise of ""curated"" or ""friend-raising"" (shudder), which seems to be the practice of hitting up your pals for dough. ""Takeaway"" never really bugged me, but I can see how it could be considered annoying. On a more serious note, I think we can all agree that 2014 was the year that ""enhanced interrogation"" was fully de-euphemized back into the easier-to-understand ""torture."" And lastly, before I cram these all into a final paragraph, I lay the blame for ""-nation"" at the feet of New England fans. The first time I ever heard the term was in reference to the Boston Red Sox, and it is indicative of a peculiar delusion of this region's fans -- many of whom are confidently convinced that their team is equally beloved by everyone across this great land. Kind of like the delusion the Dallas Cowboys fans went through back in the 1970s, when they all wanted everyone to use ""America's Team"" to describe their local favorites. This is nothing more than thinly-disguised sports arrogance, folks. It now seems to be spreading beyond New England (to be fair, some Californians have used ""Raiders Nation"" for a long time, too), and I agree it should be banished. You love your team. We get it. But not everyone does -- and you cannot claim nationhood, unless you want to look silly. Get over it. In fact, since I'm on a roll, I think I'll just end with the sports theme for our big finish. I, of course, expect everyone in America to now consider themselves part of Giants Nation, after their stunning World Series win this year. Our bae Madison Bumgarner certainly showed everyone what a swag pitcher is capable of, with a skill set no other pitcher can match. I mean, was his nine-inning performance cray-cray, or what? The takeaway was, of course, that everyone else in America got the chance to become a San Francisco baseball fan this year. All of whom are invited to come to the city by the Bay (even if they have to friend-raise the money for the trip) to see a game and check out the Giants ballpark -- the best in the league as well, with concessions even foodies rave about! OK, I fully admit that, football-wise, San Francisco is in dire need of some life hacks, or perhaps a curated list of 25 available head coaches to fill Jim Harbaugh's departing shoes. But it's not like Harbaugh is going to face any enhanced interrogation techniques to divulge his coaching secrets in his new gig at the University of Michigan or anything -- although he might have to get used to a polar vortex or two. And no matter how much you use and abuse language (and no matter which sports teams your hearts and passports belong to), we'd like to wish everyone a very happy new year!

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/life-lessons_b_6378106,12/31/2014,sheryl kraft,The Wisdom I've Gleaned From Another Passing Year,"This year has zoomed by, and it's tough to sit with the fact that 2015 feels and sounds like its way in the future, rather than mere moments away. Time, which becomes such a precious commodity with each passing year, has a way of surprising me with its swiftness. Wasn't it just July? Didn't I just turn 50? But alas, it is the end of December and I just turned 60, and both facts startle me equally into a frenzied state of near-disbelief. I feel the need to do a double-take but know that my eyes will return to the same place...so why bother? I'd say that professionally, this was a good year. I was happy to have two articles published in Family Circle MagazineI also continued to expand my freelance client roster into other new health markets, both online and in print. One particularly fascinating story was a patient success story I wrote for a New York hospital about a three-way kidney transplant; I got to speak with the mother-son patient/donor team, as well as both physicians who performed the operations. The story details made me feel like I was reading a script from Gray's Anatomy! I love what I do. It gives me an opportunity to learn and uncover many interesting facts and stories. And the older I get, the more I realize that it is impossible to ever run out of new things to learn. Speaking of getting older, it bears repeating that in October, I celebrated my 60th birthday. Although I find it hard to comprehend that I am ""that old,"" I am grateful for the gift of growing older. But, really... Sixty? Me? I feel so much younger; I refuse to believe it, act it or look it! Old keeps getting younger, that's my motto. As it turns out, that's a good thing, medically speaking. A new paper published online by JAMA Internal Medicine says so. Researchers found that older people who felt three or more years younger than their chronological age had a lower death rate compared with those who felt their age or even older than their actual age. Here's an excerpt: "" Possibilities include a broader set of health behaviors than we measured (such as maintaining a healthy weight and adherence to medical advice), and greater resilience, sense of mastery and will to live among those who feel younger than their age."" It's a funny thing, this so-called aging. Ask most people around my age if they'd like to go back to being in their 20s, and you get a resounding, ""no way!"" We find value in our hard-won fight to gain wisdom, happiness and emotional balance. With each passing year, we uncover more about how to overcome challenges and navigate the world. Perspectives come sharply into focus, as do priorities. I watch as so many 20-somethings struggle to define themselves; impatient to get it right while afraid to make mistakes and often getting caught up in what we can now confidently call ""nonsense"" but what we once called ""disaster."" Which is precisely why other studies show that happiness levels shoot up after the age of about 50. Makes perfect sense, don't you think? And while I arm myself with healthy habits and some other things that are hailed as ""anti-aging,"" I'd much prefer to think of them as being part of an arsenal to help me age better and feel younger while doing it, rather than trying to fool the clock (or the eye!). I'm not anti-aging, I'm all for aging. I'm just hell-bent on doing it the best way I know how. After all, time passes way too quickly and if we don't jump on the bandwagon soon, we're gonna be left standing with nowhere to go. May 2015 usher in a steady supply of health, joy and heartwarming times spent with loved ones.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/state-of-denial_b_6391140,12/31/2014,dori hartley,Happy New Year! Is It 2016 Yet?,"Another year means only one thing to me -- I have to somehow get used to typing a 5 instead of a 4 when I write the year down. That's basically all of it in a nutshell. The real hurdle to bolt over is in remembering that the beginning of the year starts with a 20, and not a 19. As for future resolutions, or takeaway lessons that I received in this past year -- I suppose I have a few, though as I get older my requirements for a happy life tend to be less ambitious and more about what it takes for me to live in peace. I would have to say that the desire to live in peace is probably the barometer by which I measure all that either disturbed or supported me in this past year. The year 2014 really exposed for me the concept of jealousy versus generosity of spirit. Thanks to 2014, I know now that there are people who are completely unselfish in the way they show support for those who are fortunate enough to experience positive moments or situations. Adversely, there are those who are utterly threatened by the good fortune of others. Because jealousy is so hard to admit, rarely does it identify as threatened; in fact, in order for jealousy to fulfill its ultimately ugly destiny, it must be channeled into self-righteousness. Jealousy cannot stand happiness and will hopelessly attempt to rid it by dominating the atmosphere with malicious words and actions. It's a bit of human ugliness that is much like the pungent odor of a trash bin filled with rotting food. The stench of it can permeate even the happiest of events. Jealousy is a dramatic addition to a scenario that is both unnecessary and stingy. Jealousy expressed has but one goal: to syphon the joy out of a situation -- not for the purpose of experiencing the joy itself, but to relish and thrive in the pain caused by it. Jealousy produces a thoroughly joyless waste of time for all parties concerned. To be jealous of another's good fortune is to indulge in the oily residue of negativity. To be the object of someone else's jealousy is to endure the sickness of another's ego as it rampages through all the flimsy excuses it needs in order to fool itself into thinking it's justified. And no amount of, ""They're just jealous,"" can ever be a comfort, though some folks tend to think this is a good way to explain why people are so quick to want to destroy a person's euphoria over some nice moment. Personally, I don't take comfort in knowing someone is neurotic, or suffering from an inferiority complex, or just plain negative in how they deal with me, or the good fortune I've received this year. We're all neurotic to some degree. Watching a person transform their jealousy into hate so that they can deal with their own sense of inadequacy is a drama I've learned has no positive side -- it's exactly the kind of drama I will be happy to walk away from in 2015. Another of the things I won't be entertaining in the coming year is the idea of caring about what goes assumed as opposed to what is known as fact. On a personal level, I have come to a place where what 'you' think of me, what you assume I do or what you fantasize I'm feeling (for you, for the world, for art, for whatever) is irrelevant. We live lives surrounded by people who think they know us because of our status updates on Facebook. I can tell you this: until we've looked each other in the eye and had a moment of warm recognition that silently affirms, ""Oh my god, I can totally be friends with you!"" -- You don't know me, and I don't know you. Assume one thing only about me: I will walk away from anything and anyone if it takes away from my peaceful life. How it gets to that place -- the how's, why's and who's -- is the drama I avoid trying to decipher. This year also brought with it more worldly hate, violence and intolerance -- in fact, it was more than I could take, so I found a personal solution. If I am to not be affected by the inordinate amounts of poison that makes up so much of the news today, I have found that the number one way to combat everything that brings me down is by ignoring it. Yes, I practice the bliss of ignorance when it comes to world events. Am I aware of what's going on in this world? Yes. Do I wish to remain aware? No. And as the days turn into months, without the evening news and the perpetual reminders of war, hate crimes, sexual inequality, hate, hate and more hate in my life -- I find that without knowledge of every single heinous event that happens, I'm happier, stronger and generally filled with peace and creativity. So, how do I fight for peace of mind? I ignore war. And how do I deal with those who can't handle my willful ignorance, my need for detachment and my conscious choice to say no to a world of problems I want nothing to do with? I ignore them, too. Imagine a life without having to worry about health insurance, or being poor, or school shootings, or having a secure job, or being attacked, or being sick -- imagine that? That is how I live. I have chosen to live in a complete state of denial, and guess what? It works. As long as I don't make all the thousand things that can destroy me piece by piece into my religion, I can live the rest of my life in peace. It's a conscious decision, one that can be stated succinctly as: ""It's not that you don't exist, it's that you don't exist in my headspace."" I have a purpose -- to create art and move along. It's very simple. I'm lucky -- I actually know my purpose. Knowing what I'm 'here' for makes me cut to the chase much more easily. I follow what I love and I allow myself to become completely absorbed in what I love. This brings me happiness. As for the rest, it's all noise to me. To accept one's lot in life may not sound like a glamorous conquest, but in my world, I'm the only one calling the shots, so what I decide to feel with my emotions and what I decide to put my heart into should only ever be up to me. This is how I live. So, here's to 2015, or 2016, or whatever you want to call it. Cheers to the best in you.

The way to get back to fightin' form, is to begin to see yourself as empowered and capable.Plus, Rocky is hot ... and fun.So queue the music ( ... getting stronger....GETTING STRONGER....)Okay, love, for the next few minutes, I'm Burgess Meredith, and YOU? You, are the Italian Stallion. My job is help you train for the match. I'm gonna follow you around with a towel and a spit bucket and give you all my best tips. So, put your gloves on, drop down and give me five, and let's kick some mid-life crisis ass!1. Look for the Punch -- Keep Your Eyes Open. When the hard stuff is coming at you, it's tempting to tuck and run. Sometimes it makes sense to do this. But there is a difference between being strategic and being myopic.You need to look your opponent (adversity) in the eye. If you don't, that sucker is going to hunt you down and eat you for breakfast.So, the next time you are tempted to avoid, deny or, minimize when you are sad, mad, worried or afraid, turn around and look your pain dead in the eyes.Grab your suffering by its ears, bring it in close and kiss that bad boy right on the lips. (I realize Rocky didn't do a lot of kissing in the ring, but you get my drift.)Keep your eyes open about what is happening in your life. Become a merciless truth-teller (remember Ronna Detrick's advice about that?). Quit pretending. Stop saying ""it's okay"" if it's not. Stop excusing the chronic abusers in your life.Destructive people and situations will suck you dry. If they do, it's because you allowed it.2. Keep Moving -- and Modify Your Game Plan A common mistake when you're dealt a setback is to spend too much time in the misery. While it's certainly understandable to take a moment to catch your breath and regroup, you can't heal if you stay there too long.Get up and start moving forward, even if you just take one teeny tiny baby step at a time.Also, combine this tactic with our first strategy: keeping your eyes open.As you get back up off the mat, modify your game plan accordingly. This means that we if we have a situation or relationship that continually dogs us, we take ourselves out of harm's way.Stop giving energy to people, places and things that hurt you. Learn to set ground rules (boundaries) and say ""no"" to those things. That way, you'll have more space to say ""yes"" to the things that rock.3. When You're Backed into a Corner, Create an Opening.It's one thing to take one hit, but what if your life situation feels like an ongoing beating? This is a common experience at midlife because many of our relationships are naturally in transition at this time.The kids are growing up and moving on, we may be taking care of older relatives, we may be nearing retirement, etc.In addition to the micro-changes to our personal lives, we are each dealing with global changes as well. We have external pressures brought on by the economy, global unrest, etc.If you're feeling overwhelmed and blue, you gotta admit -- it makes sense!It's very difficult to deal with setbacks when they come in rapid succession like this. The way out of chronic suffering is to learn to create openings.One way to create an opening when you're taking a beating, is to answer this question: What about this situation is good?Find that thing, and capitalize on it.*****For example, say you are dealing with a health crisis. What can be good about that?Well, is your illness giving you permission to slow down and take care of yourself at last?Many people have been dealing with financial problems these last few years. Well, what can possibly be ""good"" about that?Perhaps your economic setback is giving you the opportunity to get ""right sized"" with life. Can you learn the important skill of matching your obligations with your resources? Maybe you are going to truly learn that you can be happy - truly happy - with less than you thought.Other common gifts that people overlook are these:Hardships teach us simplicity. They point us to our strengths and also to the places where we need to ask for healing.Hardships and setbacks illuminate our true circle of friends. When the dust settles around you, it is clear who is still standing by your side.These resources - the simplicity, clarity, and friendships - are going to be the firm bedrock upon which you build the next phase of your life.If you're wise, you will learn how to harness the tremendous transformational power of loss and suffering. If you do, adversity becomes the cornerstone of a your Mid-Life Temple -- your Legacy.What about you, love?

Nelson Moses Lassiter was excited about coming to terms with his sexuality. He imagined that, upon venturing out into the gay scene, he'd encounter a world more accepting than the one he was used to. What he discovered was not unlike the one he came from, though. He recalls what happened after hitting it off with a guy at a bar: I was like, ""Oh, would you want to grab a drink sometime?"" And he's like, ""You're really, really sweet, you're really nice, but I don't date black guys."" And he's just like, ""Well, you know, they're just not my type."" And I'm like, ""Well, what does that mean? You just don't like me because I'm black? That's weird."" It wasn't long after that experience that Nelson encountered more racism, this time from a black friend: He was actually rather upset at the fact that I was dating a white guy. We were hanging out, and I was telling him about this guy, and he was just like, ""Why are you dating white people? You know that they don't like us."" And I was like, ""What do you mean 'They don't like us'? Because I'm dating someone who likes me a lot. So what are you getting at?"" And he goes, ""What?

Faithful Catholics had the chance to see Pope Francis at his Wednesday general audiences, liturgical celebrations, Sunday Angelus prayers, and at special audiences. And they came in droves. The popular pontiff drew about 5.9 million people to the Vatican in 2014 -- slightly less than the 6.6 million he drew in his inaugural year, but still far ahead of predecessor Pope Benedict XVI. In 2011, Benedict attracted a total of 2.5 million, Crux reports. Francis beat those numbers with just his Angelus addresses, which attracted about 3 million. Easter was prime time for the pope, with more than 200,000 crowding into St. Peter’s Square for his Wednesday general audiences in April. In total, 1.2 million attended this year’s general audiences. Saint John Paul II drew 1.6 million in 1979 and 1.5 million in 2000. The statistics were calculated by adding up the number of invitations distributed and attendance requests received by the Prefecture for the Pontifical Household, according to News.Va. The Vatican doesn’t make adjustments for repeat visitors, so there may be some double counting. The numbers also don’t include audiences present at Francis’ trips outside of the Vatican -- like his visits to Israel, Turkey, and South Korea. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/natalie-cole-fought-the-b_b_8903800,1/1/2016,david hinckley,"Natalie Cole Fought the Battle of Having a Famous Father, And She Won","Natalie Cole battled much of her life to carve out a legacy of her own, and in the end achieved her greatest success when she embraced her famous father's. That's not a loss. That's a win. Natalie Cole, daughter of the late Nat King Cole (above), died Dec. 31 after suffering congestive heart failure. She was 65 and despite the cushion provided by her father's success, she didn't have an easy life. She was just nine days past her 15th birthday when her father died of lung cancer in 1965. She had a difficult relationship with her mother in her late teenage years. She was married and divorced three times and her autobiography recounts long struggles with addiction to drugs that included heroin and crack cocaine. In the midst of all that she also accomplished one of the toughest feats in the music biz for the child of a star. She not only became famous -- which isn't that hard when you have the name -- but she became respected, winning Grammys and selling tens of millions of records in popular, jazz and R&B styles. Singing almost from the time she could speak, she made her recording debut at the age of 6, a voice on Nat King Cole's iconic Christmas album. But she didn't plunge into show business. At the University of Massachusetts, where she graduated in 1972, she majored in child psychology and minored in German. When she did launch her professional career, she resisted everyone who suggested the easy door would be her father's style. ""I always loved his music,"" she said in a 1991 interview. ""But if I had started with that, I might never have been allowed to make my own music, the rhythm and blues or the pop. I would have been stigmatized as someone who does only this kind of music."" Recording in her father's style, she explained was really the easy path not for her, but for the music industry, which would have an instant marketing hook. ""Let's face it,"" she said. ""The music business is not a school of thought. It's not about quality or integrity. It's about making money. People's careers are compromised all the time to sell records."" Only her father's old label, Capitol, was willing to take a flyer on young Natalie, and it paid off. Recording in a style reminiscent more of Aretha Franklin, she scored top-10 R&B hits in the mid-1970s with her first eight singles. Five went to No. 1: ""This Will Be,"" ""Inseparable,"" ""Sophisticated Lady,"" ""I've Got Love On My Mind"" and ""Our Love."" She didn't hold that peak, as life intervened, but she kept singing and a decade later she was back in the top five with songs in a more pop style, including a famous seductive remake of Bruce Springsteen's ""Pink Cadillac."" Only after that did she take a deep breath and tackle her father's music and style. That led to the 1991 ""Unforgettable"" album, whose title track had her new vocal woven into a duet with her father's old one. ""Unforgettable"" became a radio hit that went way beyond radio, generating massive buzz and snagging her a Grammy for record of the year. Oh yeah, she also won album of the year. She was comfortable with the project, she said upon its release, because she felt she had now done enough other material so it wouldn't pigeonhole her. ""Someone who only has one of my albums only sees a small part of what I do,"" she said. ""If you just hear 'Pink Cadillac,' that's not the whole picture."" She also made a point of noting that she didn't simply go to the studio and put her voice on her father's songs. ""My father's music was very different from mine,"" she said. ""His arrangements were very tough and masculine, and since I was obviously singing with a female voice, that made the music a little lighter right away. ""Also, his approach to songs was much more straightforward. So I sing very differently than I sing my own material. The great long wailing notes, for instance -- they're out."" She said she also tried to walk the line between her father's original arrangements and styles that appealed to 1991 ears. ""Some had to be made more contemporary,"" she said, ""because they were so clearly dated. But we tried to do it subtly, like by adding more harmonics. On 'Nature Boy,' we put in a muted trumpet that gave it a Miles Davis kind of vibe. I loved that."" Natalie Cole would return to her father's kind of music several more times in a career that continued pretty much until the end. She also kept recording in other styles, becoming one of a handful of artists to win Grammys in pop, jazz and R&B categories.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lessons-from----surprise----burma_b_8903296,1/1/2016,rena pederson,Lessons From -- Surprise -- Burma,"Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi As the holiday lull ends and American presidential campaigns ramp up, it's a good time to look at the example of a leader in another part of the world: Burma. Why Burma? Burma (renamed Myanmar by military rulers), is where Aung San Suu Kyi is preparing for her party to assume leadership in Parliament in March. Her National League for Democracy swept an astonishing 78 percent of the seats in fall elections. One can only imagine the joy, relief and exhaustion the Nobel laureate must have felt, having led the struggle against military rule since 1989. She spent 15 of those years under house arrest.It's instructive to note some of the first things the democracy leader did after the election victory: First, she spent time meditating. She took time to calm her thoughts and restore her energy after months of expending herself on the campaign trail. Leaders who are pulled a hundred different directions by advisers, supplicants and commentators need time to think deeply and ""fill the well."" They seldom get the time. They should insist on it. Secondly, when Suu Kyi resumed public events, she led a national cleanup day. The 70-year-old put on a pair of plastic gloves and urged everyone to join her in picking up plastic bags and rubbish. Don't just stand there, she chided photographers, come help. The symbolism was Gandhi-esque. Our problems are many, Suu Kyi implied, everyone must pitch in to rebuild their broken country. She's right. She's the public face of reform, but she can't do it alone. Third, Suu Kyi extended a hand to the military leaders she had just unseated. She sought out current President Thein Sein, a former general who had been part of the military junta that kept her locked up. They discussed a smooth transition. She also met with the Commander in Chief of the Army, Min Aung Hlaing, because the army still controls key cabinet positions and 25 percent of the Parliament. They discussed cooperation. She even met with former Senior General Than Shwe, who had presided over the ruin of the country for two decades and amassed a vast personal fortune. It was Than Shwe who used the military to destroy ethic villages. It was Than Shwe who callously denied aid to cyclone victims and ordered attacks on unarmed monks. The aging and ailing general no doubt wanted to test if Suu Kyi would seek vengeance on him and his family. Apparently not. Instead, she has invited the military to help rebuild the country. She carefully studied the reconciliation process in places like South Africa and Czechoslovakia during her years of house arrest. She understands that violence and recrimination usually beget more violence. With power now within her grasp, she has pledged to be merciful to the people who were not. Fourth, she met with ethnic leaders and assured them they would have a voice in the government. The offer of a seat at the table was a message that needed to be heard. Much still needs to be done to resolve the bloody ethnic conflicts that have gone on for more than 60 years. But inclusiveness signals respect. It opens to door to dialogue. And dialogue opens the way to change. The process is sure to be messy. But the alternative is worse. Yes, there continue to be complaints about what Suu Kyi has or has not done. There are concerns she doesn't have enough bench strength to run the country, that her inner circle's too small, her temperament difficult. It's still uncertain whether constitutional barriers can be overcome so Suu Kyi can serve as President herself someday. But she is already demonstrating leadership in direct and indirect ways that are worth noting: •Take time to take stock and seek wisdom. •Rally more people to help solve problems. •Build bridges with your rivals, as Abraham Lincoln did. •Open the tent wider to people of differing backgrounds. Those goals are easier to say than do. Burma is no exception. But saying them is certainly a welcome contrast to an American election year dominated by negative personal attacks and catering to special interests. They are also a needed example for parts of the world where democracy and rule of law are in jeopardy. How many developing countries around the world can be named where power has been handed over peacefully by authoritarian governments -- and where the presumptive leader has called for forgiveness, inclusiveness and rule of law? That's precisely why Burma remains one of the rare success stories of 2015 and its transition deserves continued attention in 2016. Rena Pederson, a former speechwriter at the U.S. Department of State, is the author of ""The Burma Spring."""

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/its-no-surprise-that-turk_b_8903734,1/1/2016,john a. tures,It's No Surprise That Turkey's Erdogan Likes Adolf Hitler's Government,"Late Friday afternoon, reports circulated that Erdogan expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler's Nazi government. If it was a statement made by a democratic figure, it would be treated as a gaffe or bad joke in poor taste. But for the authoritarian Erdogan, it's a rare instance of his honesty, showing how the strongman really feels. Business Insider reported on the links Erdogan made between his vision of the new Turkish government that he is pushing for, and Hitler's regime. ""Asked on his return from a visit to Saudi Arabia late on Thursday whether an executive presidential system was possible while maintaining the unitary structure of the state, he said: ""There are already examples in the world. You can see it when you look at Hitler's Germany. There are later examples in various other countries,"" he told reporters, according to a recording broadcast by the Dogan news agency."" According to Reuters, Erdogan's government insisted that it's remarks were misconstrued, after domestic and international condemnation. ""'If the system is abused it may lead to bad management resulting in disasters as in Hitler's Germany ... The important thing is to pursue fair management that serves the nation,' [Erdogan's] statement said, adding it was unacceptable to suggest Erdogan was casting Hitler's Germany in a positive light."" Of course, in Erdogan's Hitleresque state, it would be a crime to suggest that Erdogan admired Hitler. Ironically, you could even be marched off to prison, for suggesting that Erdogan is authoritarian. In fact, Erdogan's government has arrested many people, including journalists and law enforcement officials of uncovering evidence of corruption or accusing him of authoritarian actions. He even targeted people living in the USA who are critical of him. Erdogan's excuse for such actions is that he claims his enemies are ""terrorists."" Turkey's social media, one of the few unregulated sources of news in Erdogan's government, immediately went into high gear, according to the New York Times: ""Let's do a close comparison between Hitler and Erdogan,"" one person wrote on Twitter. ""The only difference is that Hitler was a bit shorter."" People also shared a Photoshopped picture of Hitler with Mr. Erdogan's face superimposed on it. On a visit to Turkey during their June election, I found that the overwhelming majority of people I met really like their democratic system. Many didn't like Erdogan, but were afraid to say anything. Of those who did, half asked me to keep it anonymous, while the other half said they would be arrested anyway, and it didn't matter if I used their names. Here's a picture of an election poster for the ""ceremonial"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan from June of 2015. Despite his party's win in the November election, Erdogan's ruling AKP does not have the votes to give their leader the Hitleresque power that he wants. But he is seeking a referendum to get those powers, which would likely ensure that Erdogan and his family will rule this NATO ally of the USA indefinitely, in a most undemocratic manner. Should the United States break diplomatic relations with Erdogan's regime, help Turkey's civil society, review possible cuts to U.S. military aid to Turkey's government, or consider ""smart sanctions"" against Erdogan and his family? Erdogan's admission of admiration for Hitler demonstrates that doing nothing will not help the problem, any more than it did in the 1930s. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-end-of-the-desistance_b_8903690,1/1/2016,brynn tannehill,The End of the Desistance Myth,"Over the past few years, an endless parade of ""concerned"" people (trolls) have trotted out the same statistic over and over again: 84 percent of transgender kids stop being transgender on their own. They have used this to justify everything from reparative therapy, to denying medical care to transgender teens, to suggesting that reparative therapy on adults will work. The problem is that the desistance narrative is built upon bad statistics, bad science, homophobia and transphobia. For starters, the most cited study (Steensma) which alleges a 84 percent desistance rate, did not actually differentiate between children with consistent, persistent and insistent gender dysphoria, kids who socially transitioned, and kids who just acted more masculine or feminine than their birth sex and culture allowed for. In other words, it treated gender non-conformance the same as gender dysphoria. Worse, the study could not locate 45.3 percent of the children for follow up, and made the assumption that all of them were desisters. Indeed, other studies used to support this also suffered from similar methodological flaws. As a result, the 84 percent desistance figure is meaningless, since both the numerator and denominator are unknown, because you have no idea how many of the kids ended up transitioning (numerator), and no idea how many of them were actually gender dysphoric to begin with (denominator). When Dr. Steensma went back in 2013 and looked at the intensity of dysphoria these children felt as a factor in persistence, it turned out that it was actually a very good predictor of which children would transition. In other words, the children who actually met the clinical guidelines for gender dysphoria as children generally ended up as transgender adults. Further research has shown that children who meet the clinical guidelines for gender dysphoria are as consistent in their gender identity as the general population. For the past decade, the biggest promoter of the desistance myth was Dr. Kenneth Zucker at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto. He never missed an opportunity to speak to anti-LGBT organizations and news outlets, or to tout himself as the world's top expert in transgender children. He denied practicing reparative therapy, despite a 2003 report in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry which called his techniques ""something disturbingly close to reparative therapy for homosexuals."" Twenty years ago, though, Zucker was also pushing hard for reparative therapy of potentially gay children who were too effeminate, in order to prevent them from growing up to be gay. In 1990, Zucker wrote: Two short term goals have been discussed in the literature: the reduction or elimination of social ostracism and conflict, and the alleviation of underlying or associated psychopathology. Longer term goals have focused on the prevention of transsexualism and/or homosexuality. He felt that this was for the best, because, ""a homosexual lifestyle in a basically unaccepting culture simply creates unnecessary social difficulties."" In other words, force children to change, rather than working to change a homophobic culture. Along the way, Dr. Zucker became the darling of hate groups and their media outlets, such as Focus on the Family, NARTH, CourageC, Alliance Defending Freedom, Life Site News, American Family Association, Liberty Counsel, Family Research Council, Americans for Truth About Homosexuality (AFTAH), and Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays (PFOX). In effect, because of his position, Dr. Kenneth Zucker was the last ""respectable"" patron of reparative therapy. He took the model for ""fixing"" gay kids, slapped a new label on it, and sold it as a way to fix gender non-conforming children. When the transgender activists tried to bring attention to these abuses, Dr. Zucker attempted to silence them with threats of lawsuits. That is, until December 2015, when an independent investigation led to Dr. Zucker's firing and his clinic being closed. The investigation results were highly damning, finding: • The methods being used were 30 years out of date • The clinic assumed that all gender variant children need to be clinically ""fixed"" (i.e. they used coercive behavior modification on queer kids to make them act straight) • Children were pressured into being photographed without clothing • The clinic emphasized tests, treatment, methods with no scientific basis in evidence based medicine • CAMH staff asked pre-pubescent children questions that were highly sexual in nature • Former patients, parents, and therapists of former patients described the treatment as ""disturbing"" and ""harmful"" • CAMH hid affirming community and medical resources from patients • Dr. Zucker regarded being cisgender, heterosexual, and gender conforming as the ""best"" outcome • Dr. Zucker and his team could not conclusively demonstrate that what they were doing was not reparative therapy In a 2014 German study, 13 experts in treatment for gender identity were asked if CAMH's methods were ethical. 11 said no. The two who said yes were Dr. Zucker and another CAMH staffer. But, the most outrageous piece of information coming out of CAMH was Dr. Zucker's claims that gender dysphoria desisted in 80 percent of cases. However, when investigators reviewed the files of children admitted to CAHM, 42 percent of them never met the clinical criteria for juvenile gender dysphoria in the first place. In short, half of the kids Dr. Zucker claimed to ""cure"" were never transgender in the first place. He built his reputation convincing homophobic and transphobic parents that he could fix their kids. When someone actually got around to listening to the transgender community and pulled back the curtain, they found that the 80 percent desistance narrative was a fabrication of an attention seeking, creepy, reparative therapy promoting, snake-oil salesman. Despite this, anti-transgender concern trolls came out in force defending Dr. Zucker. They couldn't actually refute any of the findings of the investigation, so instead they played the concern troll card and falsely claimed that non-transgender children will be coerced into medically transitioning if therapists allow children to explore their gender expression and identity. This is a complete misrepresentation of what affirming therapy actually is. Dr. Colt Keo-Meier, the lead author of Division 44 (LGBT issues) of the American Psychological Association's guidance for treating transgender children, refutes this fear-mongering claim: The gender affirmative model supports identity exploration and development without an a priori goal of any particular gender identity or expression. Practitioners of the gender affirmative model do not push children in any direction, rather, they listen to children and, with the help of parents, translate what the child is communicating about their gender identity and expression. They work toward improving gender health, where a child is able to live in the gender that feels most authentic to the child and can express gender without fear of rejection. Dr. Keo-Meier is supported by a wave of new research showing that affirming therapy does not result in the parade of horribles alleged by the concern trolls. Gender variant youth know who they are just as much as the general population. Transgender youth who are receive affirming care have better health outcomes. Transgender youth on puberty delaying medication showed no health effects, and mental health outcomes as good as their cisgender peers. The desistance myth was promoted by reparative therapists, concern trolls and charlatans, while being no better than a percentage pulled out of a hat to begin with. It's time for the 80 percent desistance figure to be relegated to the same junk science bin as the utterly discredited link between vaccines and autism.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/love-after-death_b_8507836,1/1/2016,debra campbell,Love After Death,"Strangely, I still felt loved. My former partner stopped breathing, holding my hand; just as intimately as in life. For the previous two years we'd faced everything together. I could still feel his presence long after he died and it frustrated me, gutted me and buoyed me in equal measure. I felt the love but I couldn't get to it. I wrote this in the depths of grief; dark waters you've got to cross, to get to a better shore. On the morning he died, I watched his final breaths, saw them replaced by a palpable peace, where seconds before there had been only bone-agony. He wanted his life so passionately, until it was reduced to a wordless, twilight fever of hurt. Pain, chemo and hormones had laid waste to the life of his choosing. Now, after months of unrelenting suffering he was free; and I was freed from one gut-wrenching kind of helplessness only to be plummeted into a new one. The release from aching anticipation was obliterated by storm surges of grief that came in waves: Brace. Hit. Out of control. Ride. Drowning. Surface, gasping. You don't know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice. I wondered everyday if there was a way to get to him, to see him again, one more time, to feel him physically again? Was it possible? How could I get there?  The bereavement counsellor tried to comfort me with a story: Swimming in the water the dragonfly larvae dream of the air above the water because they can't see it or understand it from their world. The only way to see is to die as a 'swimmer' and become a 'flyer' instead, but once you become a 'flyer' you can't enter the water ever again. There are different realms but we can only experience each in turn, in the natural time. You can't leave the water 'til it's time and you can't return to visit once you're gone, but you're still out there, just changed. It was beautiful, but it was no help at all. Is that him, in that crowd? My brain would suddenly interject as I walked down the street. He's dead I would tell myself. But I'd look anyway. After a few weeks of grieving I'm so tired of my head, riding the roller-coaster of loss again and again. I crash, then come up to refocus my attention on living again; read a book with my son, do some coloring, punch the bag at the gym, work out dinner... get through the days on a micro-level, nerve by nerve. I can do this, I would tell myself...I can do this. But everything is a reminder, on a raw sensory level. Sometimes I give up and crumple onto the kitchen floor, back against the hard, cold silver oven where every night I had cooked our food, before I was broken. I go to our regular Sunday morning café. I know its going to hurt but I can't keep away from it any longer. I like the place and I want to invite the memory, call in the ghosts so I can commune, see what happens. The waitress greets me and I say ""Just me"". I want to ask her You remember him don't you, you know the man I was here with every week, you remember, right? He's gone, he's died. What can we do? Hey, by the way, how can the chairs still be there unchanged, when he's dead? That window there... it might have been there a hundred years, but where is he? You remember him don't you? Tell me you remember him! But I say none of that. I sit, order the same food and cry quietly to the table, watching my tears hit the newspaper until they stop and I begin to read between them. *** For months I wandered, I wrote, I punched the bag, I grief-journalled, I focused on my other loves. I asked the universe for guidance and help because I didn't know what else to do. Just keep holding on to myself and my loved ones, I would tell myself; Keep holding on until this moment is memory.I knew that feelings ebbed and flowed. I knew that no matter how bad I felt, if I gave grief my awareness and acknowledged it fully, it couldn't stay exactly the same forever. Nothing ever does. If you have grief, fasten yourself to your supports. Tie yourself to love wherever it still lives for you, then sink deep. Know somehow you will rise. Let love pull you up until you can swim freely again. Understand that death happens too easily to be the end. This post is part of Common Grief, a Healthy Living editorial initiative. Grief is an inevitable part of life, but that doesn't make navigating it any easier. The deep sorrow that accompanies the death of a loved one, the end of a marriage or even moving far away from home, is real. But while grief is universal, we all grieve differently. So we started Common Grief to help learn from each other. Let's talk about living with loss. If you have a story you'd like to share, email us at strongertogether@huffingtonpost.com.

Perhaps my distaste for such terms can be traced back to elementary school, where the teacher would write the word ""objective"" on the blackboard in giant letters. Then, we had to talk about why we were doing what we were going to do that day. Why didn't we just do the activity and then talk about it? I wondered. It seemed like such a waste of time.

All too often I hear clients say, ""I need to lose 20 pounds by my wedding"" or ""I'd better knock off 50 pounds before my high school reunion."" But focusing on a weight goal without appreciating every step of the process can leave you with a goal that's attainable but not sustainable. It's the ups and downs during the process itself that teaches you how to get to a place where you feel proud of your achievement. This enlightening journey often gets short shrift – especially when you set an unrealistic weight goal or an unreasonable time frame to achieve it. When work toward a goal (say, to lose a few pounds), you may start off feeling motivated, optimistic and prepared for any obstacles that may get in the way.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kids-with-allergies-are-more-likely-to-have-anxiety-and-depression_l_6110c88be4b0ed63e6574be6,1/1/2016,kathryn doyle,Kids With Allergies Are More Likely To Have Anxiety And Depression,"By Kathryn Doyle (Reuters Health) - Kids who have allergies at an early age are more likely than others to also have problems with anxiety and depression, according to a new study. As the number of allergies increase, so do internalizing behavior scores, the researchers found. Internalizing behaviors include disorders, like anxiety or depression, that develop when people keep their problems to themselves, or ""internalize"" them. “I think the surprising finding for us was that allergic rhinitis has the strongest association with abnormal anxiety/depression/internalizing scores compared to other allergic diseases,” said lead author Dr. Maya K. Nanda of the division of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology, at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. Rhinitis includes the “hay fever” symptoms of runny nose, sneezing and itchy, watery eyes. The researchers studied 546 children who had skin tests and exams at age one, two, three, four and seven and whose parents completed behavioral assessments at age seven. They looked for signs of sneezing and itchy eyes, wheezing or skin inflammation related to allergies. Parents answered 160 questions about their child’s behaviors and emotions, including how often they seemed worried, nervous, fearful, or sad. Kids who had allergic sneezing and itchy or watery eyes or persistent wheezing at age four tended to have higher depressive or anxiety scores than others at age seven, the researchers reported in Pediatrics. Anxiety and depression scores increased as the number of allergies increased. “This study can't prove causation. It only describes a significant association between these disorders, however we have hypotheses on why these diseases are associated,” Nanda told Reuters Health by email. Children with allergic diseases may be at increased risk for abnormal internalizing scores due to an underlying biological mechanism, or because they modify their behavior in response to the allergies, she said. Like other chronic diseases, allergic diseases may trigger maladaptive behaviors or emotions, she said, but some prior studies support a biologic mechanism that involves allergy antibodies triggering production of other substances that affect parts of the brain that control emotions. Earlier studies have found links between allergies and anxiety disorders such as panic attacks or generalized anxiety disorders, Nanda said. The new study took race, gender and other factors into account, “so the strong association between allergic disease and internalizing disorder we found is definitely present,” she said. The severity of mental health symptoms varied in this study. Some children had anxiety and depression that needs treatment, while others were at risk and required monitoring, she said. “We think this study calls for better screening by pediatricians, allergists, and parents of children with allergic disease,” she said. “Too often in my clinic I see allergic children with clinical anxiety (or) depressive symptoms; however, they are receiving no care for these conditions.” “We don't know how treatment for allergic diseases may effect or change the risk for internalizing disorders and we hope to study this in the future,” Nanda said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kids-with-allergies-are-more-likely-to-have-anxiety-and-depression_n_5684039be4b0b958f65aec88,1/1/2016,kathryn doyle,Kids With Allergies Are More Likely To Have Anxiety And Depression,"By Kathryn Doyle (Reuters Health) - Kids who have allergies at an early age are more likely than others to also have problems with anxiety and depression, according to a new study. As the number of allergies increase, so do internalizing behavior scores, the researchers found. Internalizing behaviors include disorders, like anxiety or depression, that develop when people keep their problems to themselves, or ""internalize"" them. “I think the surprising finding for us was that allergic rhinitis has the strongest association with abnormal anxiety/depression/internalizing scores compared to other allergic diseases,” said lead author Dr. Maya K. Nanda of the division of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology, at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. Rhinitis includes the “hay fever” symptoms of runny nose, sneezing and itchy, watery eyes. The researchers studied 546 children who had skin tests and exams at age one, two, three, four and seven and whose parents completed behavioral assessments at age seven. They looked for signs of sneezing and itchy eyes, wheezing or skin inflammation related to allergies. Parents answered 160 questions about their child’s behaviors and emotions, including how often they seemed worried, nervous, fearful, or sad. Kids who had allergic sneezing and itchy or watery eyes or persistent wheezing at age four tended to have higher depressive or anxiety scores than others at age seven, the researchers reported in Pediatrics. Anxiety and depression scores increased as the number of allergies increased. “This study can't prove causation. It only describes a significant association between these disorders, however we have hypotheses on why these diseases are associated,” Nanda told Reuters Health by email. Children with allergic diseases may be at increased risk for abnormal internalizing scores due to an underlying biological mechanism, or because they modify their behavior in response to the allergies, she said. Like other chronic diseases, allergic diseases may trigger maladaptive behaviors or emotions, she said, but some prior studies support a biologic mechanism that involves allergy antibodies triggering production of other substances that affect parts of the brain that control emotions. Earlier studies have found links between allergies and anxiety disorders such as panic attacks or generalized anxiety disorders, Nanda said. The new study took race, gender and other factors into account, “so the strong association between allergic disease and internalizing disorder we found is definitely present,” she said. The severity of mental health symptoms varied in this study. Some children had anxiety and depression that needs treatment, while others were at risk and required monitoring, she said. “We think this study calls for better screening by pediatricians, allergists, and parents of children with allergic disease,” she said. “Too often in my clinic I see allergic children with clinical anxiety (or) depressive symptoms; however, they are receiving no care for these conditions.” “We don't know how treatment for allergic diseases may effect or change the risk for internalizing disorders and we hope to study this in the future,” Nanda said.

So find a noise-free room, clear a space near your bed and turn down your thermostat, because better sleep leads to better health. Here are tips to reduce noise, help you unwind and make your bedroom a serene oasis for sleep. Having a super-cluttered bedroom may affect how well you sleep, suggests a recent study led by clinical psychologist Pamela Thacher. While the research, presented at the 2015 SLEEP conference held in Seattle in June, focused on people who consider themselves hoarders, the findings may apply to anyone who sleeps in cramped, chaotic surroundings. ""It seemed like even people without hoarding disorder had what we call a dose response – meaning that the more clutter you had, the more likely you were to have a sleep disorder,"" says Thacher, an associate professor of psychology at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. Because the bedroom is a private space, it's easier to let disorder grow. Bedrooms are often the biggest problem for hoarders, Thacher says, although living rooms and kitchens can hold ""wicked"" clutter as well. It's not ideal for anyone to sleep where they don't even have a clear path to the bedroom door. For people with hoarding and sleep issues in the study, sleepwalking was unexpectedly low on the list of nighttime problems. The reason is functional, Thacher believes: ""It's because their bedroom is very difficult to walk in. My guess is they are literally pinned into the bedroom in the way that most of us are not."" When Thacher treated insomnia patients in her practice, she'd encourage good sleep hygiene. That means ""taking care of the context and circumstances in which you sleep,"" she explains. Getting to bed at a reasonable hour, developing bedtime routines that don't include electronics and doing calm, peaceful things like writing in a journal instead of watching a scary or violent movie on TV are all ways to safeguard your sleep. ""A cool bedroom but also a clean bedroom might set your mind at rest,"" Thacher says. ""This might be something we could add to sleep hygiene."" She's conducting a new study, this time with non-hoarders – looking at whether people still have sleep problems after they declutter their homes. Light clothing, no blankets and a thermostat set at 66 degrees combine to create a cool, healthy sleep atmosphere. Mild cold prompts your body to make more ""good"" brown fat by transforming stored white fat and sugars into energy to keep you warm, says Dr. Francesco Celi, who led a 2014 National Institutes of Health study on the effects of overnight room temperatures. This nighttime activity boost, known as ""non-shivering thermogenesis,"" helps rid the body of excess blood glucose, says Celi, a clinical endocrinologist who is now chairman of the endocrinology and metabolism division at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. Cranking up your bedroom thermostat and sporting flannel pajamas has just the opposite effect. ""Prolonged exposures to warm temperature at 80 degrees resulted in an almost complete inhibition of brown [fat] tissue activity"" in study participants, Celi says. Small, persistent changes in the temperature of your environment make a difference, Celi says: ""The effects are very small in terms of body weight, but can be potentially important with respect of the glucose metabolism."" It's possible, his results suggest, that cooler sleep could have health implications for people at risk for diabetes. Reading a boring book to put yourself to sleep may backfire with an e-reader, according to a small studyappearing last January in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Participants who read an electronic book with a light-emitting device before bed took longer to fall asleep, produced less of the sleep-hormone melatonin and were less alert the next morning than those who read a printed book. It's not rocket science that noise hampers sleep – or that traffic sounds can keep you awake. Dr. Mathias Basner, an associate professor of sleep and chronobiology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, took a look at the effects of living near airport, rail and road traffic – alone or combined. ""It can be very disruptive,"" he says. A simple fix can ease rail or roadside noise. ""If you have the option to move your bedroom to the side of the house that is not exposed to traffic, that can be very effective,"" Basner says. ""If your window's facing the backyard, your noise levels may be much, much lower in rooms that are not facing the roadway."" That's less helpful if you live near an airport, like Philadelphia International Airport, the site of the study. Earplugs help some people more than others, Basner says. People who don't tolerate earplugs may get too distracted from internal noise, such as the sound of their heart beating or stomach growling. ""Usually [earplugs] are very good for blocking out the higher frequencies in the sound spectrum,"" he says. But they're not as effective for blocking low-frequency, rumbling noise, like the kind you get near a railway. Basner is concerned about health effects of unwanted noise that go beyond your hearing – like the way noxious noise increases the release of stress hormones in the body. And there's the impact on sleep. ""What I always find puzzling, in terms of sleep hygiene, is that we really spend a third of our lives in bed,"" Basner says. ""We are willing to spend a lot for a house or car … but not for our mattress."" Sleep may seem passive, but it's actually an active process, Basner says. ""A lot of things are happening. Memory is consolidated. Specific hormones are created exclusively during the night. We know that if you're not getting enough sleep on a chronic basis, there are all these negative health consequences that are linked to the sleep loss,"" he says. ""So getting enough and good-quality sleep is extremely important."" To Sleep Better, Stay Cool And Cut Clutter was originally published on U.S. News & World Report.

How It Works A Shelter. This 3-year-old dog came into Montgomery County Animal Shelter as a stray today. A Rescue. Lone Star Boxer Rescue was contacted by the shelter and they agreed to take him into their program immediately. A Volunteer. He was transported to their vet for further tests. There is a tumor on the inside of his cranial cavity under the bone. A Foster. It is inoperable and his life expectancy is 2 days. He is now in hospice care. A Decision-maker. I asked Leisha Stinchcombe, the director of the rescue group, ""Why did they pull this dog from the shelter today?"" Her response was, ""Just to make sure he knows love for a few days."" A Donation. Groups like this can only exist and do this badass work with our financial help. This dog is 1 of 3 terminally ill boxers that Lone Star took into their program today. Leisha commented: Adalard is his name. The day may not be easy but we are fierce with determination. This entire network of helpers in the world, who are far greater than me. I am deeply saddened yet humbled by the beauty I see in the unity of many teams. We alone, do not create this, and we cannot always repair. But we LOVE just as fiercely as we fight. Know that. For certain. Adalard. Noble strength. Wednesday (12/30/15)  What It Looks Like A Family. Lori Anderson, her husband James, and their daughters Bella and Ellie. It should be noted that Leisha initially declined Lori's offer for hospice foster care based on the fact she has small children and this was going to get ugly quickly. Lori insisted that Addy come to their home. Lori said: I thought a lot about Bella and Ellie and how it will effect them. I think it's extremely important that the girls learn about giving, loving and helping others in need, especially when they can't care for themselves.  ""The girls (5 and 7 years old) were with me when I picked him up from the vet. I told them about how special Addy is and how we are going to take care of him because he's very sick.""   ""I wasn't sure what to expect from this poor boy and was preparing myself for a very lethargic and slow moving pup. Well, to my utter surprise, in walks Adalard, nub wagging, bounce in his step, and ready to receive and give love.""  ""I spent some time talking to Dr. Gordon about Addy's condition, medications and how to help him the most. 'Spoil him rotten' was his advice.""  ""On our way to the store to load up on toys and treats, Ellie turns around to look at Addy who's in the back and says to me: ""Mom, he's smiling, look he's smiling at me!""  ""Adalard aka ""Addy"" has already made himself at home.""  ""He is amazing, sweet, gentle, kind, well socialized with fur friends and humans. LOVES his toys."" Ellie, 5, is featured here playing with Addy. She has Asperger's Syndrome (higher end of Autism spectrum) and a particularly special connection with animals.   ""It is evident that at some point he was part of a human family. We are so fortunate to be able to be part of his life. He may not have long, but his life will be full for as long as he does have.""   ""We want his life to have meaning.""   ""Yes, there will be sadness and tears, but it's important they learn that this is okay."" Let's see how far LOVE takes him.

America is great. Trump is disgusting. Anybody but Trump. #roseparade2016 pic.twitter.com/bXBJx1oZ9K ""America is great! Trump is disgusting. Anybody but Trump"" the skywriting read, referring to the 2016 GOP presidential front-runner. Witnesses on Twitter said five or six planes appeared to write the message, though it's not yet clear who the culprits were. Above @RoseParade 6 planes wrote. The entire message ""America is Great. #Trump is disgusting. Anybody but Trump."" pic.twitter.com/N41YwoqSkI Although we don't know why the skywriters find Trump ""disgusting,"" we've compiled some possible reasons for the sentiment: - He called for a ""complete shutdown"" of all Muslims coming to the U.S. and to keep a database of the ones already here. - A former KKK Grand Wizard called Trump a ""net positive"" for racists everywhere. - Trump believes sexual assault in the military should be expected, and generally just doesn't seem to care for women. - His vocabulary mostly consists of using the words ""weak,"" ""tough"" and ""loser."" A new terror warning was issued for European cties. At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart. Weak leaders! The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-3-most-crucial-lesson_b_8895252,1/1/2016,jo davidson,The 3 Most Crucial Lessons I Learned in 2015 as an Online Coach,"Building an online business is easy. I just wish someone had told me that sooner... These last 12 months have proved to be a magnificent period of change, flex, and eventually growth, in my coaching business. But, before I tell you about those 3 most crucial lessons I've learned, I'd like to share a little bit of background with you. It's only two short years since I decided to pursue entrepreneurship and build a coaching business, although in reality it feels like ten times as long. Of course, I'd been coaching for years in my management career, but going it alone is a completely different ballgame.  Since launching my business, I invested heavily, to the tune of more than £12,000 and thousands of hours, learning what it takes to build a successful, international business in the online world. I learned from many of the most respected and successful entrepreneurial minds out there. And yet, I didn't build a successful business. In fact, I barely even made a dent, as I watched my £40k/year management salary and savings dwindle away to next to nothing. And, it wasn't because I wasn't applying my knowledge; because I was. And, it wasn't because I didn't know enough; because I did. And, it wasn't even because building a successful career as an online coach is difficult; because, surprisingly, it really isn't. But there was a problem. A big fat problem. That problem led me to end up more than £35,000 in debt and unable to pay my mortgage and credit card bills for months on end. As a single mother with no outside financial support and no more credit available, it put me in very real danger of losing our home. It had me desperately panicking about how I would even put food on the table, let alone pay for school uniforms, outings and other unexpected expenses. It even brought me to the verge of folding my business and going back to a ""proper job"". So, what was that problem? Fear! It seems silly really. You always hear people say that successful people feel the fear and do it anyway. And I was sure that was what I was doing. I was completely convinced of it, in fact. After all, I had pushed out of my comfort zone tonnes of times, and conquered so many of the things I used to be afraid of. But, at a much deeper level, I was still hanging onto fear, without even realising it, because I was confusing my fear with being realistic. I was refusing to set massively ambitious goals, and get really focused and committed in my business, because I believed I simply wasn't capable of create that level of success. I was refusing to charge my worth, because I believed people wouldn't see my value and that they wouldn't be able to afford me anyway. I was refusing to get really visible and consistent with my message, because I was believed that no one was listening, that I was wasting my time, and that I was setting myself up for more disappointment. And so on. But, once I finally realised what was going on, and got really fricking serious about my success, that's when I began to learn these incredibly valuable lessons.  Lesson #1: Fear will kill your business dreamsI honestly believed that if I knew all of the online technical wizadry, and built my mailing list, and produced great content, and effectively used social media, then clients would simply find their way to me. But that simply isn't the way that it works, and constantly trying to learn more and more ""stuff"" from others, was actually just the manifestation of my fear of taking responsibility for my own success. For far too long, all that learning kept me from the important, value-adding activities that would ultimately transform my business. Because, it doesn't matter how much you know, if you are not applying it loudly and proudly in your business, every single day. If you're targeting less than £5k a month in your business, then don't be surprised about never making it to five or six figures. If you're afraid of talking money, or of charging your worth, then don't be surprised when every prospect you speak to thinks you're too expensive. If you're afraid to invest in yourself, and your success, then don't be surprised when clients find themselves afraid to invest in their success, with you. And, if you find yourself procrastinating (fear), struggling to create and innovate (fear), and afraid of getting out there online, on camera, on Periscope, on stage, and so on, then don't be surprised when you can't drive enough new people to your business, to seriously up-level and push your business into the major league. Lesson #2: Failure is not the worst possible outcomeI remember thinking that failing was the worst case scenario of launching my own business. I remember worrying about what people would think if I didn't succeed. My family. My friends. My enemies. The neighbours. Even strangers.  But, it was this year that I really came to appreciate that none of those things mattered. That actually, the only really important opinion, was my opinion of myself. And that, for me, the worst possible outcome would be to give up on my business and return to the rat-race hell that I had escaped from. In the end, the fear of having to go back to that was far more terrifying than people laughing at me for screwing up, and that's when I learned to own my story, and to admit the mistakes and near catastrophes in my journey, so that I could use it to help other women struggling along their own entrepreneurial path, to realise that they are not alone, and that they can make it work if only they are prepared to push past their own fears. Lesson #3: It is possible to create miraclesI should say from the get-go that I don't believe in the law of attraction. Nor am I of any religious faith. Although, if you do, then that's great and I'm genuinely happy for you. What I'm saying though, is that I use the term ""miracles"" loosely. In that, I now believe that it is entirely possible to take yourself from struggling to make anything at all, to earning 5 figures in just a month. And that seems pretty miraculous to me. You see, for me, I resisted believing in my ability to create what I didn't already have, for so long, that I wound up screwing up my ability to create what I wanted.  Because, beliefs inform choices. And choices guide actions. And I knew it. I knew it so well. But I didn't see what I was doing, and I'm willing to bet that, very often, you don't see it either. In other words, if you don't believe you can create massive success, on an absolute gut level, then you never will. Because you won't take the right actions, you won't invest in your success, and you will chase bright shiny objects instead of developing yourself as an entrepreneur. Even if, by some fluke, you do manage to luck your way into success, you will quickly sabotage it as your same old beliefs inform your choices, your choices guide your actions, and your actions destroy the progress you've made. So, what am I saying exactly? Well, by finally getting a grip of the fearful crap that was going around my head, and cultivating a mindset of mind-blowing success, I was finally able to stop struggling, get the support I needed, and explode my business results. And, if you're ready to make your success a non-negotiable priority, then I'm going to help you to do exactly the same. 2016 is my ""Year of Living Fearlessly"", and that starts with my Exclusive Group Coaching Programme for Women Entrepreneurs: ""From Struggling-2-Sensational"".

Whether you believe in miracles, have faith in the power of coincidence or simply agree that life is just a series of open doors for us to explore, the story of WOVEN  and the film makers is one that will inspire you to believe in the power of dreams. I personally met Salome Mulugeta and Nagwa Ibrahim the two female directors and producers by coincidence and since hearing their stories, backgrounds, dreams and passions to bring the story of WOVEN to life, I have been inspired to share it with the world through my eyes. I am not just surprised by their dedication to this movie and its story but also what the movie WOVEN stands for. It's exactly what I believe in and more! In the following listing, I will humbly share why I think the story of the filmmakers is incredible and why I can't wait to watch WOVEN.1.The film makers are WOMEN. In a time where Hollywood's Women Problem is at its peak, these two brave women assumed the roles of both the directors and producers of the independent feature film Woven. They are both very proud to see key roles filled by women in an industry where women are underrepresented. They are both empowered women leaders. In fact, they will soon be featured at the @sheisaleader campaign that features aspiring women from the Middle East and the North Africa region for their work and leadership. 2.They are committed to Diversity. In my recent Tedx talk in Munich, Germany, I was inviting people across the globe to celebrate, embrace and appreciate the diversity of our global world. Salome and Nagwa are already ahead of the game! Woven, a film driven by women, celebrates diversity with a cast and crew of all different backgrounds from around the world. The film's story takes the viewer through the journey of seven individuals from seemingly different backgrounds, whose paths converge after a tragic accident in NYC, depicting just how connected we are. In addition, Woven has a diverse crew including Ethiopians, Egyptians, Indians, Dominican Republicans, Iranians, Mexicans, Chinese, Jamaicans, African Americans and Caucasians. Way to go! 3.They believe in the power of dreams. Woven's story has been twelve years in the making. It started with a dream and an idea. Salome Mulugeta who originally studied broadcasting and journalism in Kansas city was an intern reporter at the local TV station which quickly turned permanent. She later moved to Los Angeles with an idea in mind to write a screenplay. Reporting encouraged her growing passion for a new medium, was drawn to the vibrant cinematic culture and found the challenge exhilarating. While in Los Angeles she met Ryan Spahn an actor and a screenplay writer. The two began to write ""Woven."" The movie and the two underwent through many challenges as any new filmmaker would have to face. Then over three years ago, Salome and Nagwa randomly met at a dinner party both initially were not going to attend but fate made both of them show up, connect and together bring Woven to fruition. And despite the many challenges along the way from script to screen, as experienced by most independent filmmakers, Salome and Nagwa refused to give up. According to my friend Amandeep Kaur the blogger of Simple Ways to Love Life Blogspot ""It took determination, tenacity, the amazingly diverse, collaborative effort of a team of people who worked behind the camera, the love and support of friends and family, and a Dream to complete the film."" ""There is no such thing as accident; it is fate misnamed."" ― Napoleon Bonaparte 4.They are multi-talented people. Salome Mulugeta (who originally studied Broadcasting and journalism) is the co/director, co/writer, producer and plays the leading role in the film. Post Woven, she has kept herself busy directing and producing commercials and several independent short stories. Her Ethiopian Airlines commercial went viral not very long after it was released. She also currently contributes content for the US based African channel a TV channel that showcases outstanding travel, lifestyle & cultural series, specials, bio's and documentaries into the modern lives of all people of African descent and developing nations who live in the western culture. She has produced and directed shows like The African Restaurant week, Muziki Ni, and is currently directing and hosting a debut show called A Day in the Life Of (2016). Meanwhile, Nagwa Ibrahim is an attorney by training specializing in immigration law and criminal defense, Nagwa additionally worked as a civil and human rights attorney, handling Guantanamo cases and other prisoner rights cases. Through her travels and work as an attorney, she learned about how extraordinary and inspiring the human experience is through the stories of real people, which inspired Nagwa to become a filmmaker where such stories can be heard felt and experienced in one space that transcends borders. Whether as a lawyer or filmmaker, she genuinely loves people and the ways in which we are all intricately connected as human beings. In addition, she is currently co-hosting the Sunday national radio show titled Middle East in Focus on KPFK that discusses news and views on the Middle East and relevant U.S. foreign policy. How I love these empowered women! 5.Collaboration and Labor of Love. . It's a movement in filmmaking to use a collaborative art form to convey the connectedness of humanity as symbolized both in front of the camera and behind the camera. We see Salome Mulugeta (one of the co-directors and co-producers) as one of the lead characters. In addition, (According to the movie makers) Woven definitely could not have happened without all the cast and crew who worked tirelessly to make the film come alive. Furthermore, the team points out that their own individual communities believed in both of them and helped with funds to get the film of the ground.6.With different Backgrounds and Experiences, they came together to tell the universal story of Woven. While all what comes to mind when we hear about Egypt and Ethiopia is the longstanding dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the construction of Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam along the Nile River or when we hear Coptic-Christian and Muslim is the possible tension that some media outlets try to sell to the world. Both Nagwa (Egyptian-Muslim) and Salome (Ethiopian-Coptic Orthodox Christian) went beyond these differences. In fact, when I asked them about it, they seemed surprised that I am even bringing it up. They even told me that it is something that they never even thought about. Simply a perfect example of an interfaith and diversity movement in action! 7.They are committed to storytelling. In the digital age we are living in, nothing is more powerful than storytelling. Both Salome and Nagwa are committed to telling diverse stories from around the world through film. Thus, connecting us to one another across borders. 8.Woven Already Has Audiences Awaiting Its Arrival. The interest and public response in WOVEN has been overwhelming. The trailer received more than 27K views in just one day (On EthioTube, the Woven trailer is one of the most watched videos) and the Woven Facebook page has over 6000 followers eagerly waiting for the movie's release. Please continue to follow the movie's Facebook page for more details. ########### ""As female filmmakers and the children of immigrants, Salome being Ethiopian American and Nagwa being Egyptian American, voices and stories like ours are all too often excluded from American cinema, which is why we both became filmmakers and came together to make Woven. With a female led cast and a female led producing and directing team, Woven has been an important passion project which we worked hard to financially, logistically and politically make possible, particularly in an industry where female directors and directors of color are severely underrepresented. Woven is a film intended to capture the visual beauty of Ethiopian culture and traditions, rarely depicted in American cinema while also highlighting the importance of the immigrant experience in the fabric of American culture, which we feel is particularly relevant at a time when xenophobia is on the rise. With a diverse cast and crew from around the world including Ethiopians, Egyptians, Indians, Dominican Republicans, Iranians, Mexicans, Nigerians, Chinese, Jamaicans, African Americans and Caucasians, we wanted to send a powerful message with Woven both in front and behind the camera about the importance of celebrating diversity. Although we had many challenges, we were able to make the dream of Woven into a reality, through the incredible support of our communities here in the U.S. and the community of filmmakers like Hala Lotfy committed to diverse storytelling across borders. With over 6,000 likes on facebook and 1,000,000 views of the Woven trailer on Ethiotube, we are so humbled by the support and excitement for the film's release."" --Salome Mulugeta and Nagwa Ibrahim Please watch a full Interview with the Film makers at the Independent Sources CUNY TV, Channel 75.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-entrepreneurial-gener_b_8893916,1/1/2016,chris herd,"The Entrepreneurial Generation, Millennials and Alternative Modes of Earning"," The Post-Industrial EconomyI read an incredibly interesting article yesterday: The Freelancer Generation: Why Startups And Enterprises Need To Pay Attention which set my mind racing towards the trends, developments and possibilities which will shape the new year. Although I don't agree with some of what is written, for the most part it is very insightful towards current employment trends. What i didn't agree with so much is that this is the freelance generation. Instead I believe that the uncertainty relating to global commodity markets married to an eroding belief from millennials that full-time employment brings security has bred very specific circumstances. This has led to a growing number of individuals with a propensity towards backing themselves to make a success utilising their skills in an entrepreneurial way. Simply they see greater reward and greater perks. I would argue then that this is the entrepreneurial generation, freelancer is too simplistic and does not convey the multitude of requisite skills necessary for success. You now need to embrace every facet of the entrepreneurial mindset to succeed; whether that is in the way you market your skills and services or in the way you exploit negligible niche opportunities transforming them into massive chances for success. There are several unarguable facts relating to the direction in which employment is moving. 2015 was unquestionably the year of the startup, whether you look at the number of unicorns blasting through the $1b valuation or the amount of companies birthed, at no time in history has it been easier, more fashionable or accessible to start up a startup or work for someone who is/has. Instead of falling into a long term career millennials are trusting themselves to carve their own paths through the cultivation of a professional network that they can rely on for support and employment. Converse to the linear careers their parents have taken, driven by serendipitous fortune, they are embracing the diversity and opportunity that an entrepreneurial approach to employment can bring and flourishing due to the acquirement of relevant skills and the ascertainment of opportunity they have found but which would never find them. They are the masters of their own destiny. Regardless of whether you're a full-time employee, a contractor or a freelancer it's in your best interest to pay attention to the developments of the entrepreneurial generation. The developments here will have far ranging implication to the general workforce moving forward. Whether multi-nationals embrace the startup approach to employment, by way of increasing productivity on a project to project basis or not, the entrepreneurial approach to employment is here to stay and here is why: An enabler of participationThe opportunity for entrepreneurialism has never been so great due to the rise of technology, enabling a truly global workforce, and connectivity, allowing anyone to be connected to anyone anywhere. Looking at it from an alternative angle the post-industrial economy is also an enabler. It provides cultures, genders and social classes historically discriminated against, forbidden or unable to contribute a route to participation and thereafter progression. Advances in technology have allowed for increased remote work which enables anyone, anywhere to work from everywhere. Not only can you work from home but you can also enjoy increased flexibility leading to a favourable work life balance prevented by a 9 to 5 way of life. The post-industrial economy has not only shrunk the world through connectivity it has brought a whole new workforce to the fore who had never previously been a consideration. The Past -- Post Internet ExplosionsETSY and eBay are an example of two platforms which have birthed a generation of micro-businesses and presided over the unprecedented growth of 'homtrepreneurs'. Mothers who historically had to stay at home were for the first time able to conduct their business during times that suited them. This has provided a disposable income to women, teenagers and men around the world who were able to sell their possessions or products to an almost unlimited market. The explosion of the internet set the ball rolling towards the developments we are currently seeing and what will follow. The Present -- Mobile PlatformsThe next logical step in development from eBay and ETSY is the utilisation of the mobile platform for financial gain, which has begun to flourish post the introduction of the first iPhone. It enables earning without any commitments or requirements. Where the industrial revolution enabled the employment of unprecedented numbers of women and children in production lines mobile platforms enable the exact opposite. They provide a safe and secure opportunity for a huge number of people to pursue the things that interest them and reward them with capital for their participation. For too long mobile platforms have exploited the network of users they have cultivated without giving back, but now we are beginning to see the emergence of companies which redress the balance. You're information, data and general commitment to Facebook values your contribution at around $128 per user but why don't you see a penny? It's obviously a simplistic question to pose which ignores the fact the company has shareholders, staff to pay and new products to develop but ultimately why should your personal life line the pockets of others? The next revolution in mobile, social media and technology will see the emergence of compensation for your compliance and contribution. The Future -- Full Global ParticipationAs we have progressed further into a globally connected world we have seen the permeation of opportunity with ever decreasing discrimination. This has taken some time to proliferate down to poorer nations due to the absence of technological infrastructure but even this is beginning to change as tech giants like google look to connect even the most remote tribes in africa to the internet. What I believe, and what i truly hope, is that the post-industrial economy enables independence on a scale not seen since the abolishment of slavery.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/question-for-bernie-donde_b_8903446,1/1/2016,nikolas kozloff,Question for Bernie: ¿Dónde Está Mi Revolución?,"Ever since he launched his long-shot bid for the presidency, Bernie Sanders has urged his followers to carry out a veritable ""political revolution."" Bernie has been far too cautious, however, when it comes to defining the contours of such a revolution. When pressed, he declares that his followers should come together for the purpose of voter drives, phone banking and the like. If he were ever elected to the White House, Bernie might even make use of his political revolution to help organize protests in advance of key votes in Washington. But here Bernie seems to be placing the cart before the horse. If the self-described democratic socialist doesn't win the Iowa Caucus, which is the first voting contest, there may not be a political revolution in the first place or a tangible role for Bernie's dedicated cadre of activists. It is baffling, and that is putting it mildly, that Bernie and his advisers have been so obtuse when it comes to crafting a viable media strategy designed to showcase the notion of political revolution front and center. In an earlier article, I sought to spell out some ways that Sanders might expand upon the concept of political revolution and thereby gain some traction in advance of key voting contests. If he were audacious, Bernie could call for mass protest during the actual presidential campaign. Just what type of protest, and to what end? Currently, Sanders is still a virtual unknown to many segments of the electorate including the crucial Latino bloc. Perhaps, Bernie should strike right at the core of Republican xenophobic ideology by calling for protests which highlight injustices within the U.S. immigration system. Deplorable Conditions The need for such pressure is long overdue. Indeed, members of Congress recently protested dire conditions at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. In one case, a Mexican immigrant died of pneumonia after receiving substandard medical care. In another instance, a Salvadoran immigrant who had been detained for a whopping four years died of intestinal cancer even after he had lodged complaints about his worsening medical condition. In one privately-owned California detention center, hundreds of migrants carried out a hunger strike after being subjected to medical neglect. However, detainees who dare to protest such backward treatment have been subject to repression. Reportedly, Latin American migrants who went on hunger strike against the authorities have been placed in solitary confinement. And when Central American women went on hunger strike at a detention facility in Texas, detainees were rounded up for transfer. The plight of migrants, not all of whom hail strictly from Latin America, has even spurred the growth of a new movement called #FreedomgivingHungerStrikes. Immigration on the Campaign Trail It goes without saying that the debate over appalling conditions within immigration facilities will not receive top-tier billing on the Republican campaign trail, which is more prone to race baiting and xenophobia. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders has issued statements in support of hunger strikers. To his credit, the Vermont Senator has called for the closure of private prisons while opposing solitary confinement and indefinite detentions. Bernie has also said that non-violent immigrant detainees should be allowed to reunite with their families as they await their day in court. Such moves must be applauded, and to be sure Sanders has improved in recent days when it comes to the overall issue of immigration [as I've written previously, however, the Vermont Senator has been a little quirky on the issue of borders and Bernie is reluctant to break with a certain strand of the ossified old guard nationalist labor establishment]. In a frontal assault on the likes of Trump, Sanders remarked that border security could be improved by investing in novel technologies in contrast to ""boondoggle walls"" which would set the stage for further militarization. Rather impressively, he also called for ending contracts with private detention centers and said he would do his utmost to eliminate ethnic profiling and discrimination at the border. Meanwhile, the Vermont Senator declares that if he is elected he will map out a ""swift legislative path"" for 11 million undocumented migrants. What is Bernie Waiting For? Fair enough, though one wonders how many Latinos are even aware of Bernie's policy proscriptions and the Vermont Senator seems very unwilling to craft a viable media strategy. Like it or not, presidential elections tend to revolve around personalities and the media cycle rather than policy, and by boycotting or criticizing the mainstream media Bernie seems to have consigned himself to obscurity within the Latino community. This is particularly jarring and self-defeating in light of the growing power of the Latino electorate in early voting states like Iowa and Nevada. Latinos are looking for a champion and a man of action, yet unfortunately Bernie seems unwilling to deliver. When asked if he'd visit facilities where immigrants have gone on hunger strikes, Sanders said he would try but sounded vague when it came to providing specifics. ""Given my schedule between Congress and the campaign, I can't promise you when and where it would be, but it is something that I am interested in doing,"" he said. What is Bernie waiting for? While it would be a stretch for the presidential candidate to go on a hunger strike himself, there are certainly ways that Bernie could marshal his followers and thereby recast the media narrative in the run-up to Iowa. As I wrote in a previous article, the Sanders campaign has embraced new technologies with a vengeance while recruiting talented young millennial coders. Bernie's own media company is called Revolution Messaging no less, and the firm has helped to build Sanders' presence on such platforms as Reddit. #FreedomgivingHungerStrikes At the flick of one button, Bernie could deploy his followers to support the burgeoning #FreedomgivingHungerStrikes movement. It is not a stretch to imagine millions of volunteers conducting phone banking on behalf of immigration protest and detainees, which might succeed in taking the air away from Trump. Such a campaign strategy would raise the moral bar and might also gain Bernie coveted visibility within the Latino community. To be sure, there's no assurance that such a strategy would be successful or even rouse the media from its perpetual torpor. What is more, in the aftermath of the San Bernardino terrorist attack immigration reform may not be such a popular topic among certain Americans. There's no guarantee, moreover, that calling for protest wouldn't wind up alienating mainstream segments of the electorate. These are all considerations, but as we begin the countdown to Iowa, Sanders may not have much to lose.

If you need some convincing, the cast and creator stopped by AOL.BUILD to give viewers the inside scoop on season two.  After the most intense opening night for the orchestra, season one ended with a playful and flirty stare between Hailey and Rodrigo which left fans wondering if and how their relationship will progress in the second season. ""It progresses in the way that I think that, while Hailey feels just happy to be there in the first season, in this season I think that she really wants to aggressively pursue her passion,"" said Lola Kirke. ""And there's an understanding that going for the person that she feels passionate about might be a major distraction and actually get in the way.""  That's not the only relationship progressing in season two. At the end of season one Bradford, played by executive producer Jason Schwartzman, finally asks Lizzie, Hannah Dunne's character, to dinner. ""At the risk of spoilers, yeah. And I think he's really like a ticket for Lizzie. [She] really kind of finds herself and a little more direction as to what she wants to do, than we've seen her previously,"" Hannah Dunne said. ""In the first season when she is really picking up a lot of different ideas of 'Oh I'll be a tattoo artist, or travel the world. I don't know what I'm gonna do'. With him she really develops.""  Paul Weitz, who co-produces the show with Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman, Alex Timbers had this to say about season two, ""We've gotten to know the actors better and that's really exciting. I feel like the female characters this year got stronger and stronger. Also, we're learning about the classical music world, its not like we're these aficionados who are sort of wanting to clue people in on what we know about classical music, we're actually learning about it as we do it."" Good thing Saffron Burrows is a cello pro - well, sort of. ""For this I learned about ninety seconds of each piece, you'll see in our seasons. They'll give us the music say, a week in advance and I'll learn that specific section and the problem I get into is when the camera rolls on and Paul or Roman will just say 'Let's just keep rolling' and you go 'Oh Christ,"" revealed Burrows. ""I'll watch the person playing next to me, out of the corner of my eye. You'll see me looking very concentrated, when I run past.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-soft-power-war-isis-d_b_8818866,1/1/2016,daniel garrie,The Need for Private-Public Partnerships Against Cyber Threats -- Why A Good Offense May be Our Best Defense.,"This article was written by  Daniel B. Garrie and David N. Lawrence. The Internet has delivered on its promise of social and economic progress. Unfortunately, it has also delivered unprecedented opportunities for scaling global conflict, terrorism, criminal activity, state and industrial espionage and vandalism. These risks continue to expand. Cybersecurity is a multidimensional problem that transcends the risk management and response capabilities of any single enterprise, industry, or sector. No enterprise, industry or sector has an answer or even a claim to superiority regarding cybersecurity threats. There is a simple operational premise that informs expert thinking about our exposure to the risks of cyber-attacks. ""If you can imagine it, they can do it. And even if you can't imagine it, they have -- and are working on it."" The costs of cyber attacks--financial, legal and reputational-- for organizations, businesses, and government agencies are growing at an alarming rate. The consensus annual cost of cyber-attacks to the global economy is around $445 billion. Even the most sophisticated enterprises know that it is not a matter of ""if"" they will be hit, but when and how bad. This means our money, intellectual property, private communications, market sensitive data, and identities remain at constant risk. To paraphrase FBI Director, James Comey: ""There are only 2 kinds of companies left in the world--those that have been hacked and those that don't yet know they've been hacked. No one is safe. Unfortunately, there is no simple fix --no app for that--not even adequate insurance."" The fact of the matter is that the solution to the problem of growing cyber threats is not simply a technology ""patch"". Cybersecurity has never really been a technology question to begin with. Technology and its digital portals are simply the newest conduits for a widening range of individual, group and state-sponsored actors seeking the familiar criminal and geopolitical ends of theft, fraud, espionage, extortion and destruction. Playing only defense against the sources of cyber threats has proven to be an expensive zero-sum game of Whack-a-Mole. In today's highly competitive global economy, it is not realistic to expect companies to stand idly by while their business interests are attacked and their resources are drained. Corporations may legally take defensive protective measures provided they are strictly defensive--and, hence, do not violate existing international or domestic law. These measures may also include remediation tools such as disinformation and so called ""honeypots"" Explain honeypots. It must be reiterated, however, that a corporation has to take great care in conducting cyber operations as the law clearly does not allow a company to initiate cyber hostilities. As most corporate lawyers lack the technical aptitude to properly attribute a cyber incident or to understand the appropriate response, their advice in the face of hostilities should err on the side of caution. Given the legal restraints, the best and default response to cyber hostilities is for a corporation is to contact the government to respond on its behalf. Of course this requires a strong partnership between the government and the private sector. Unfortunately, in the United States this partnership is in its infancy and is complicated by a host of problems including: distrust between the private and public sector, corporate reputational concerns, potential liability caused by a cyber incident, and sensitivity of operating in a global economy. This set of difficulties incentivizes both public and private actors to look only after their own interests, withhold critical information, and make decisions without consultation. As a result, the response to any cyber hostilities typically leaves the victimized corporation damaged, unsatisfied, and frustrated. See, e.g.,  Devlin Barrett & Danny Yadron, Sony, U.S. Agencies Fumbled After Hacking, WALL ST. J., Feb. 23, 2015, at B1. The government is aware of this problem and has taken steps to better coordinate a response to hostile cyber activities, while simultaneously promoting information sharing between the public and private sectors. Already, we have witnessed the beginnings of a potential ""game-change"". Although exact details have yet to be revealed, the U.S. government has signaled a willingness to consider offensive counter-measures against a state or state-sponsored actor (as was the case with Sony), terrorist group, or other threat to industry and infrastructure. On February 25, 2015 the Director of National Intelligence, as ordered by the President, established the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC). See Fact Sheet: Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, whitehouse.gov .(Feb. 25, 2015). The CTIIC, intended to be ""a national intelligence center focused on 'connecting the dots' regarding malicious foreign cyber threats to the nation and cyber incidents affecting U.S. national interests,"" has the mission of assisting ""relevant departments and agencies in their efforts to identify, investigate, and mitigate those threats."" Id. Additionally, on February 13, 2015 the President issued an Executive Order to promote private sector cybersecurity cooperation by authorizing greater intelligence sharing while protecting business confidentiality. See Executive Order--Promoting Private Sector Cybersecurity Information Sharing, Feb. 13, 2015 While these efforts are a significant step in the right direction, there is far more that needs to be done in responding to the ever-growing cyber threat to corporations. Cybercrime remains a ""virtually"" perfect crime and act of war. It is low risk and high reward. It is agile, cheap and remotely scalable. It constantly evolves as technology evolves such that law enforcement officials wind up responding to outdated threats. Victims have little or no recourse. Cybercrime in many ways does not fit within our current legal and law enforcement framework for domestic and international crime. Laws, courts, treaties and international boundaries have little efficacy in limiting cyber tactics, weapons and the targeting of civilians. Easily disguised and launched from safe havens, cybercrime carries little risk of detection, prevention, apprehension or punishment. With so much to gain and so little to lose, why stop? A robust public-private cyber partnership is needed--one that will consider more radical ideas. For example, a corporation that is the victim of a cyber incident must feel comfortable disclosing information with the government. On the other hand, a corporation that shares information with the government may face irreparable damage to their reputation and immense present or future customer claims through their disclosure. Only by creating a confidential reporting mechanism coupled with limiting financial liability will corporations be willing to openly report a cyber incident. One possibility is to adopt a regulatory regime similar to that imposed on financial institutions following the passage of the Patriot Act. Currently, a financial institution must notify the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of any transactions suggestive of criminal behavior, money laundering, or terrorist financing by filing a suspicious activity report (SAR). See The SAR Activity Review, By the Numbers, 8 FINCEN (June 2007) . To encourage this reporting the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) was instituted to prohibit ""financial institutions from disclosing the contents of a SAR or even its existence."" See 31 U.S.C. §5318(g)(2)(A)(i)). Other banking regulations provide a ""safe harbor"" and ""expand this confidentiality privilege and shield financial institutions from liability for reporting such activity."" 12 C.F.R. §21.11(k) and 31 U.S.C. §5318(g)(3) By shielding SAR reporting activity from ""discovery in civil litigation"" and limiting the financial liability of a corporation that reports suspicious activity, information sharing dramatically increased between financial institutions and regulators. This regulatory model is useful for those interested in increasing public-private information sharing involving cyber incidents as corporations have the same concerns as financial institutions when they file a SAR. Another possibility is to expand the powers of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court (or FISC) to allow companies to petition for a government response to cyber offenses committed against their interests. Presently in the United States the FISC is responsible for issuing warrants for domestic surveillance of suspected foreign operatives in the United States. See Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, , ALLGOV.com. But imagine a scenario whereby an American corporation in the aerospace industry is hacked and all investigations point to the responsible party being an agent of a sovereign nation. While the corporation may be able to recover fiscally through insurance policies, the damage caused by the hack to the company may be of permanent significance. Currently, there are few options for the victimized corporation. But with an expansion of the FISC, the aggrieved corporation would be able to petition a government body for redress. The government body, acting on behalf of the corporation, would make a special appeal for emergency action. If the expanded FISC agreed that action was necessary, the government actor would be permitted to take action against the sovereign nation with impunity. One possible variant of this idea would be to create a stand-alone cyber court to provide judicial oversight of the response rather than adding cyber jurisdiction to the FISC. These two relatively unexplored recommendations are not intended to be a panacea for the corporate cyber problem but rather illuminate the need for creativity in developing a response strategy. It will take unorthodox solutions to remove the disincentives currently inhibiting the public-private partnership. Yet, the importance of enhancing this public-private partnership cannot be overstated and is of utmost importance for both corporations and the national security of the United States. Neither corporations nor the government can afford to remain static as the speed and ferocity of cyber hostilities, in particular those launched by state actors against private companies, are the new normal.  Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta  succinctly summarized both the opportunities and threats created by the increased dependence on cyber operations when he stated in New York City on October 12, 2012 to the Business Executive for National Security: Cyberspace is the new frontier, full of possibilities to advance security and prosperity in the 21st century. And yet, with these possibilities, also come new perils and new dangers. The Internet is open. It's highly accessible, as it should be. But that also presents a new terrain for warfare. It is a battlefield of the future where adversaries can seek to do harm to our country, to our economy, and to our citizens. But the even greater danger -- the greater danger facing us in cyberspace goes beyond crime and it goes beyond harassment. A cyber attack perpetrated by nation states [or] violent extremists groups could be as destructive as the terrorist attack on 9/11. Such a destructive cyber-terrorist attack could virtually paralyze the nation. While the importance of cyberspace is obvious, the sobering truth is that cyber hostilities discussed by Mr. Panetta are now a reality. This could not be more clearly demonstrated than by the actions of North Koreans against Sony or the attack upon the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). It is time to stop reacting to these attacks and instead proactively develop a comprehensive response strategy built upon a corporate-government partnership. David N.

The latest haul for Clinton, 68, brings her 2015 fundraising total to $112 million, and gives her one of the best-funded campaign treasuries in the race for the November 2016 U.S. presidential elections. ""At the beginning of this campaign, Hillary Clinton set a goal of $100 million in primary contributions for 2015 and blew past that goal, raising more than $112 million in primary money for the year,"" her campaign said in a statement. It said she had raised $37 million for the primary campaign, the most for any non-incumbent in a non-election year, and $18 million for the Democratic Party in the fourth quarter. Clinton has prided herself on raising funds from women and donors of small amounts. In the most recent quarter, 94 percent of the money raised was in donations of $100 or less, her campaign said. The most recent filing comes just weeks before the first-in-the-nation ballots will be cast in the Democratic nominating contest, and Clinton's latest grab provides a much-needed cushion of support as she battles for support in key early voter states. Clinton's deep-pocketed repository reflects a heightened confidence in the Democratic front-runner's electability, having spent the summer months dogged by controversy surrounding her use of a private email server during her time as U.S. secretary of state under President Barack Obama. Clinton, who has led the Democratic pack with little interruption since her announcement of candidacy in April, spent the summer months battling accusations of inappropriate use of a personal email server during her time as secretary of state, throwing an unexpected wrench in what was initially seen as a clear path to the nomination. But following a marathon, 11-hour hearing on the national security ramifications of her personal server use, Clinton emerged from the scandal relatively unscathed, and her campaign reported their most lucrative fundraising hour in the hour after the hearing. According to a Reuters/Ipsos survey that ended on Dec. 24, Clinton leads the Democratic pack with 60 percent of possible support in the nominating contest. Sanders received 28 percent support and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley finished third with less than 4 percent possible support. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/agnes-martin_b_8893336,1/1/2016,catherine corman,Agnes Martin,"Agnes Martin, This Rain In the monograph Agnes Martin (D.A.P./Tate), the work is described variously as ascetic, immensely fragile, calm, direct, hypnotic, quiet and inward. Martin says her subjects are lightness and formlessness. Her work is so interior it does not invite more concrete description. After abandoning painting for years to drive across the country alone seeking ""silence and solitude,"" Martin moved from New York City to Taos, where she spent the rest of her life creating grids or parallel lines in muted palettes, devoted to what has been called ""the quiet drama of painting continuously for almost three decades."" She often drew her grids by hand, in graphite pencil, imparting a tremolo, her ""autographic trace,"" allowing her humanity to enter geometric forms. These flawed lines may also have been a nod to wabi sabi, the Japanese aesthetic tradition of finding beauty in imperfection, implying the quiet melancholy and ethereal longing accompanying acceptance of the impermanence of the world. In her essay, The Untroubled Mind, she writes: We say this rose is beautifuland when this rose is destroyed then we have lost somethingso that beauty has been lostWhen the rose is destroyed we grievebut really beauty is unattached Martin has been compared to Paul Klee and Kandinsky, but she resisted modern movements. Initially seen as an Abstract Expressionist, she later appeared to be a Minimalist. When asked which group she belonged to, she replied, ""I would like my work to be recognized as being in the classical tradition (Coptic, Egyptian, Greek, Chinese), as representing the Ideal in the mind."" She was inspired by William Blake, whose watercolor illustrations for Pilgrim's Progress she saw at the Frick Collection while living in New York. A gift from her beloved grandfather, Pilgrim's Progress remained meaningful throughout her life. The book may begin to explain her mysterious departure for the desert. One of the last paintings she made in the city was called Trumpet, and may have referred to a section of Pilgrim's Progress called The Man in the Iron Cage. After hearing a trumpet call in a dream, a man wakes shaking with fear. He says, ""I thought that the day of judgement was come, and that I was not ready for it."" Martin's painting, Trumpet, is a grid hand drawn in graphite, covered in soft strokes of luminous paint in a palette ranging from dove grey to pearl white. The grid may refer to the iron cage in which the man is held. Blake painted his version of The Man in the Iron Cage in watercolor, with the grid of the cage partly obscuring the man's body. Bunyan writes that the man in the iron cage is a former professor now jailed by his own despair at succumbing to ""the lusts, pleasures, and profit of this world; in the enjoyment of which I did then promise myself much delight: but now everyone of those things also bite me, and gnaw me like a burning worm."" William Blake, The Man in the Iron Cage Blake's illustration of the iron cage may have inspired Martin's later work, as her delicate paintings are illuminated like watercolors, and his palette in this work, pale blues, pinks and greys, are reflected in Martin's own. The iron cage, or all it represented in Pilgrim's Progress, is what she devoted her life to escaping. Agnes Martin, Untitled Agnes Martin, Untitled Her writings record this pursuit, resembling Blake's collection of metaphysical aphorisms, ""All Religions Are One / The Voice of One Crying the Wilderness"" in which he sought the origins of philosophy and religion. When Martin retreated to the desert, she read deeply in Eastern and Western spiritual traditions, including Calvinism, visionary Christianity, Platonism, Transcendentalism, Zen Buddhism and Taoism, noting significant quotes and impressions. She was especially drawn to Plato's Allegory of the Cave, in which the world is revealed to consist of shadows cast by ideal forms. The highest goal is to turn away from the shadows and see what is real.

Good thing is that they are both the same so they won't be hard to forget - @byingridvasquez Now ... 12.30.15 #SongBlogIV (my song of the day): ""Roses and Violets"" by Alexander Jean If you don't think you've ever heard of Alexander Jean, YOU ARE WRONG. Whether it's through dance, music or TV, the artistry of Alexander Jean, made up of Mark Ballas and BC Jean, has already been introduced to you. | @_AlexanderJean_BC Jean is singer, songwriter who has been around music from an early age. Her grandparents were in television variety shows fron the 50s and her parents did music as a hobby and her mother worked as a talent manager. Having released solo music on her own: BC has proven that she is both a talented vocalist and performer. I'd categorize her somewhere in between Pink and Alanis Morissette. She has the looks of your next Top 40 diva but she has the spunk and vocal capability to be much more than that. That's what makes me excited about this new duo. Just like a comment for the above video says ""no need to waste the voice on boring, sappy pop songs,"" it seems like BC has finally found her sound in Alexander Jean. It's important to note that she can give you music for Top 40 charts, though. Ever heard this song? Yea, she wrote it. Although both Mark and BC have both said that they wouldn't really classify their music as a certain genere (considering they take influence from everything like Gwen Stefani to Bohemian Rapsody), there's something different to their music when they're creating (and performing) it together. That performance was from Dancing With the Stars after show. If you may have not guessed it by now, Mark Ballas is a pro dancer on the show and has won two of its mirror ball trophies. Mark, the son of renowned ballroom dancers Shirley and Corky Ballas, attended Rosemead Preparatory School in London with coworkers (co-dancers?) and siblings Derek and Julianne Hough in their early teen years. While Julianne moved back to the United States before Mark and Dereck, they all were brought together in American when they booked Dancing With the Stars. While he's one of the most recognized and best dancers from Dancing With the Stars (E! Ranked him #2), his passion for the arts was first found in music. As a band member: And solo artist: (Fun fact: ""Get My Name""features fellow DWTS dancer Whitney Carson and was directed by Derek Hough). I think his magic number is two though - a duo. While the name ALEXANDER JEAN has managed to get more attention after a performance of their single on Dancing With the Stars, that quickly vanished. So it leads me to ask, if America's DWTS sweethearts can't get them more recognition, who (or what) can? I invite you to purchase their song (while we wait for their EP) on ITunes and help make their single the ""All of Me"" of 2016. In my book it already is. Now its your turn.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sally-mann-hold-still_b_8892766,1/1/2016,catherine corman,Sally Mann: Hold Still,"Sally Mann, Untitled (#49 Woven Branches 2, Frontispiece) Sally Mann opens her memoir, Hold Still (Little, Brown), by invoking the muese. An outdated word, the meuse is a mark left in the ground after a small animal leaves; the grass or dust bears an imprint of its departed body. The meuse is a natural parallel of photography, a trace left in the world by a person-a photographer's subject, or perhaps the photographer herself. The meuse is not the actual animal, but a mirror of presence, and this difference is important to Mann. She writes of her art, ""I needed the truth, or, as a friend once said, 'something close to it.'"" Another distinction important to Mann is that between art made by unexceptional people and that born of unknowable genius. She was moved by the book Art and Fear, which separates 'ordinary art,' made by hard working, everyday people, from that made by masters such as Proust or Mozart. The book says genius is rare, and yet good art continues to be made, as most art is ordinary art. Mann proudly identifies with this ethos, writing, ""Ordinary art is what I am making. I am a regular person doggedly making ordinary art."" She does not effortlessly call upon inspiration to provide her with masterpieces, but works tirelessly, with a devoted passion, detailed in her chronicles of the arduous work required for each image, spontaneous and accidental as it may seem. She shoots variations on a single composition for days with a heavy, time consuming view camera, and prints countless versions of the final image in a darkroom, often using antique developing and printing processes requiring a great deal of patience. Mann is fascinated by the ordinary, and feels that ""part of the artist's job is to make the commonplace singular."" Her photographs focus on the South, where she lives. ""I began looking for what I had to say where I usually find it,"" she writes, ""in what William Carlos Williams called 'the local.'"" After a series of notorious portraits of her children, she turned to the South for inspiration, photographing landscapes, Civil War battlefields, and her own farm in Lexington, Virginia. She feels a kinship with Southern writers like Faulkner, Welty and O'Connor, and with the music of the South: early jazz and the blues. ""We southerners,"" she writes, ""like Proust, have come to believe that the only true perfection is a lost perfection."" The Southern artist she feels closest to is Cy Twombly, who was a neighbor and family friend. Her father collected Twombly's early work, which decorated bookshelves and tabletops in her childhood home. Twombly, too, felt rooted in the South, despite moving to Rome in his late twenties. ""It all came from here. All those columns..."" he said, ""there are many, many things I never would have done if I'd been born somewhere else."" Mann recognizes the influence of Southern culture on Twombly's aesthetic and interests, the ""chivalric code and the lore of doomed military culture,"" whose strains can be seen in her own work: photographs of old battlefields, forests and landscapes that look nearly medieval-almost like settings of Arthurian legend. Mann quotes Shelby Foote echoing this sentiment. ""We were sick from an old malady, he said: incurable romanticism and misplaced chivalry...We were in love with the past."" She finds another lost word, ""hiraeth,"" helps explain her work. A Welsh term, it means ""distance pain,"" a yearning, a lamentation for a lost place. It also entails a near physical attachment to that place. The Southern landscape is where Sally Mann resides, in daily life, aesthetically, in her work, and in a deeper, spiritual sense. It is not just an artistic subject to her, or a metaphor, or a historically resonant locale. She writes, ""the landscape might in fact hold the key to the secrets of the human heart."" Ultimately this hiraeth, this deep longing, the sadness at loss coupled with the knowledge that it is sadness provoked by beauty, is at the root of an artistic legacy to which she feels intimately related. She senses it in Flaubert, who wrote, ""The antithesis of everything is always before my eyes. I have never seen a child without thinking that it would grow old, a cradle without thinking of a grave."" She quotes Beckett's Endgame, in which Hamm, trying to console a friend who has gone mad, points out the window to corn growing and ships arriving, saying, ""All that loveliness!"" But the madman sees it as ruin, and turns from the window. Flaubert and Beckett strike a chord with Mann; she, too, simultaneously sees loveliness and darkness. Reaching back further than Beckett and Flaubert, she calls upon the aesthetics of Edo era Japan, when the phrase mono no aware was used to describe the intertwining of beauty and melancholy, one depending on the other, neither able to exist alone. Literally translated, mono no aware means ""a sensitivity to ephemera."" This closely describes Mann's work. Like the meuse, each image derives from an impression that implies the absence of its subject, the beauty of the photograph suggesting sorrow at the loss of the moment it portrays. The children in her pictures are no longer children, their vulnerable, unbridled bodies now changed into self-aware adults.

Her captivating Civil War battlefields, with their lonely trees, delicate as lace on dim horizons, and gracefully curved dusty roads, are graveyards of men who gave their lives defending slavery. She presents them to us like mesmerizing jewels somehow both stunning and terrible to behold. ""For me,"" she writes, ""living is the same thing as dying, and loving is the same thing as losing, and this does not make me a madwoman; I believe it can make me better at living, and better at loving, and, just possibly, better at seeing.""

We figure they need a little help in deciding which darlings should make the shortlist when nominations are announced on Jan. 14. With studios' campaigns entering the homestretch, The Huffington Post's movie gurus, Matthew Jacobs and Joe Satran, have some suggestions to help the Academy make the tough choices. In an Oscar derby as open-ended as this one, anything could happen. Here are two perspectives on what should. Joe: ""Bridge of Spies""""Goodnight Mommy""""Ex Machina""""The Hateful Eight""""Joy""""Mad Max: Fury Road""""The Martian""""Room""""Spotlight""""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" You wouldn't want to be the protagonist of many of these movies. Most of them suffered tremendously. (And I didn't even include ""The Revenant,"" perhaps the most brutal of them all!) But the skillful filmmaking that went into them -- and it really was very skillful -- transformed their misery into my delight. Matt: ""The Big Short""""Brooklyn""""Carol""""Inside Out""""Mad Max: Fury Road""""The Martian""""Room""""Spotlight""""Tangerine"" It's hard to know where to stop when this category can include anywhere from five to 10 titles. My list of nine just barely misses ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" but I won't be mad if the Academy is as taken with BB-8 as the rest of the galaxy. Joe: Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Todd Haynes, ""Carol""George Miller, ""Mad Max: Fury Road""David O. Russell, ""Joy""Ridley Scott, ""The Martian"" I didn't like ""Carol"" quite as much as everyone else did -- I found it frosty, even, at times, inert -- but I have to admit that it was one of most beautiful, well-acted movies of the year. Still, I hope the award goes to Miller. Matt: Lenny Abrahamson, ""Room""Sean Baker, ""Tangerine""Todd Haynes, ""Carol""George Miller, ""Mad Max: Fury Road""Ridley Scott, ""The Martian"" It's hard to weigh the subtlety of ""Carol"" against the grandeur of, say, ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" but each of these five directors gave us the same thing: intimate character studies wrapped in flashy but effortless cinema. As much as I'd love to include a woman on this list (Marielle Heller would be my first pick, for ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""), it's Hollywood's fault that the pickings were so slim. See our full coverage of the Best Director race. Joe: Cate Blanchett, ""Carol""Brie Larson, ""Room""Jennifer Lawrence, ""Joy""Daisy Ridley, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""Charlize Theron, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" I'm obsessed, in this category, with Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron and Daisy Ridley: They brought a strength and ferocity to their roles that made them into true icons. But Lawrence and Theron have both won before and Ridley hasn't even been in the conversation. Brie Larson, meanwhile, was amazing, so I have no issue with her as the frontrunner. Matt: Cate Blanchett, ""Truth""Brie Larson, ""Room""Saoirse Ronan, ""Brooklyn""Charlotte Rampling, ""45 Years""Lily Tomlin, ""Grandma"" ""Carol"" will be rightfully seen as the defining Cate Blanchett film of 2015, but I thought she submitted stronger work in the unfairly maligned ""Truth."" (She was also great in ""Cinderella,"" by the way.) Still, this is Brie Larson's prize, and the rest of us are just Imperator Furiosa rounding up a bushel of ladies who defined the year in film. Others include Teyonah Paris (""Chi-Raq""), Bel Powley (""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""), Melissa McCarthy (""Spy"") and, of course, Charlize Theron (""Mad Max: Fury Road""). See our full coverage of the Best Actress race. Joe: Matt Damon, ""The Martian""Paul Dano, ""Love & Mercy""Leonardo DiCaprio, ""The Revenant""Tom Hanks, ""Bridge of Spies""Samuel L. Jackson, ""The Hateful Eight"" I'm not wild about any of these performances -- except Paul Dano's. His take on the young Brian Wilson was so uncanny that watching the 1960s parts of ""Love and Mercy"" felt like time travel. He's being campaigned as a supporting actor, while his co-star John Cusack is in contention for lead, but I think that's a mistake. I hope the Academy agrees. Matt: Christopher Abbott, ""James White""Matt Damon, ""The Martian""Paul Dano, ""Love & Mercy""Andrew Garfield, ""99 Homes""Michael B. Jordan, ""Creed"" Imagine a calendar where male leads couldn't hold a candle to the year's female stars. That was 2015. Most of the A-list Oscar players -- Leonardo DiCaprio (""The Revenant""), Johnny Depp (""Black Mass""), Eddie Redmayne (""The Danish Girl""), Will Smith (""Concussion"") -- turned in work that felt removed and performative. I'll echo Joe by saying that Paul Dano, in one of the year's best screen achievements, should be the lead contender to beat. See our full coverage of the Best Actor race. Joe: Joan Allen, ""Room""Jennifer Jason Leigh, ""The Hateful Eight""Rooney Mara, ""Carol""Kristen Stewart, ""Clouds of Sils Maria""Alicia Vikander, ""Ex Machina"" I guess it's a foregone conclusion that Vogue cover girl Alicia Vikander will be nominated for ""The Danish Girl,"" but I still prefer her in ""Ex Machina."" She captured the uncanny and seductive power of artificial intelligence as well as any actor ever has. Matt: Jennifer Jason Leigh, ""The Hateful Eight""Rooney Mara, ""Carol""Cynthia Nixon, ""James White""Kristen Stewart, ""Clouds of Sils Maria""Kristen Wiig, ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" This category is loaded, and it's a shame to omit Alicia Vikander (""The Danish Girl""), Elizabeth Banks (""Love & Mercy""), Tessa Thompson (""Creed""), Mya Taylor (""Tangerine"") and a host of others. But the supporting-actress hardware begins and ends with Rooney Mara, even if she's arguably a co-lead in ""Carol."" See our full coverage of the Best Supporting Actress race. Joe: Walton Goggins, ""The Hateful Eight""Oscar Isaac, ""Ex Machina""Michael Keaton, ""Spotlight""Mark Rylance, ""Bridge of Spies""Jacob Tremblay, ""Room"" Walton Goggins completely blew me away in ""The Hateful Eight."" There was something unhinged and committed about his performance as a Confederate sympathizer that made him seem alive in a way that few Quentin Tarantino characters do. Matt: Joel Edgerton, ""Black Mass""Idris Elba, ""Beasts of No Nation""Jason Mitchell, ""Straight Outta Compton""Mark Rylance, ""Bridge of Spies""Jason Segel, ""The End of the Tour"" If Johnny Depp and Tom Hanks were forgettable in ""Black Mass"" and ""Bridge of Spies,"" respectively, their supporting counterparts certainly were not. Hats off to Joel Edgerton and Mark Rylance for besting their upperclass screen partners. Really, any of these five men deserve this accolade. See our full coverage of the Best Supporting Actor race. Joe: Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, ""Inside Out""Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, ""Spotlight""David O. Russell, ""Joy""Quentin Tarantino, ""The Hateful Eight"" I think everyone is wrong about ""Joy."" People say that its plot was confused, bizarre and implausible -- but my take is that David O. Russell was intentionally playing with our expectations about how a plot should work. Indeed, I think the whole movie was a brilliant commentary on the art of screenwriting. There's not enough room to explain why here, but I might revisit the topic in an essay soon. Matt: Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch, ""Tangerine""Patrick Brice, ""The Overnight""Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, ""Inside Out""Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, ""Spotlight"" ""Spotlight"" accomplished so much with so few flourishes, but I maintain that ""The Overnight"" is the year's most under-appreciated comedic script. Regardless, this victory belongs to the ""Inside Out"" scribes. Imagine conceptualizing something half as eye-opening and original as that Pixar gem. Joe: J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""Emma Donoghue, ""Room""Drew Goddard, ""The Martian""Nick Hornby, ""Brooklyn""Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, ""The Big Short"" It initially seemed strange to me that ""The Force Awakens"" was competing in this category, but then I saw the genius of it: If you think about it as an adaptation of ""A New Hope,"" it's a near-perfect script. Matt: Drew Goddard, ""The Martian""Marielle Heller, ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""Nick Hornby, ""Brooklyn""Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, ""The Big Short""Phyllis Nagy, ""Carol"" We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscar-ballots-2016_n_568461cae4b0b958f65b3adc,1/1/2016,matthew jacobs,"Listen Up, Academy Members: Here's What The Oscar Nominations Should Look Like","Oscar voting began Wednesday, giving members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences until Jan. 8 to submit their ballots for this year's prizes. We figure they need a little help in deciding which darlings should make the shortlist when nominations are announced on Jan. 14. With studios' campaigns entering the homestretch, The Huffington Post's movie gurus, Matthew Jacobs and Joe Satran, have some suggestions to help the Academy make the tough choices. In an Oscar derby as open-ended as this one, anything could happen. Here are two perspectives on what should. Joe: ""Bridge of Spies""""Goodnight Mommy""""Ex Machina""""The Hateful Eight""""Joy""""Mad Max: Fury Road""""The Martian""""Room""""Spotlight""""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" You wouldn't want to be the protagonist of many of these movies. Most of them suffered tremendously. (And I didn't even include ""The Revenant,"" perhaps the most brutal of them all!) But the skillful filmmaking that went into them -- and it really was very skillful -- transformed their misery into my delight. Matt: ""The Big Short""""Brooklyn""""Carol""""Inside Out""""Mad Max: Fury Road""""The Martian""""Room""""Spotlight""""Tangerine"" It's hard to know where to stop when this category can include anywhere from five to 10 titles. My list of nine just barely misses ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" but I won't be mad if the Academy is as taken with BB-8 as the rest of the galaxy. Joe: Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Todd Haynes, ""Carol""George Miller, ""Mad Max: Fury Road""David O. Russell, ""Joy""Ridley Scott, ""The Martian"" I didn't like ""Carol"" quite as much as everyone else did -- I found it frosty, even, at times, inert -- but I have to admit that it was one of most beautiful, well-acted movies of the year. Still, I hope the award goes to Miller. Matt: Lenny Abrahamson, ""Room""Sean Baker, ""Tangerine""Todd Haynes, ""Carol""George Miller, ""Mad Max: Fury Road""Ridley Scott, ""The Martian"" It's hard to weigh the subtlety of ""Carol"" against the grandeur of, say, ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" but each of these five directors gave us the same thing: intimate character studies wrapped in flashy but effortless cinema. As much as I'd love to include a woman on this list (Marielle Heller would be my first pick, for ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""), it's Hollywood's fault that the pickings were so slim. See our full coverage of the Best Director race. Joe: Cate Blanchett, ""Carol""Brie Larson, ""Room""Jennifer Lawrence, ""Joy""Daisy Ridley, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""Charlize Theron, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" I'm obsessed, in this category, with Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron and Daisy Ridley: They brought a strength and ferocity to their roles that made them into true icons. But Lawrence and Theron have both won before and Ridley hasn't even been in the conversation. Brie Larson, meanwhile, was amazing, so I have no issue with her as the frontrunner. Matt: Cate Blanchett, ""Truth""Brie Larson, ""Room""Saoirse Ronan, ""Brooklyn""Charlotte Rampling, ""45 Years""Lily Tomlin, ""Grandma"" ""Carol"" will be rightfully seen as the defining Cate Blanchett film of 2015, but I thought she submitted stronger work in the unfairly maligned ""Truth."" (She was also great in ""Cinderella,"" by the way.) Still, this is Brie Larson's prize, and the rest of us are just Imperator Furiosa rounding up a bushel of ladies who defined the year in film. Others include Teyonah Paris (""Chi-Raq""), Bel Powley (""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""), Melissa McCarthy (""Spy"") and, of course, Charlize Theron (""Mad Max: Fury Road""). See our full coverage of the Best Actress race. Joe: Matt Damon, ""The Martian""Paul Dano, ""Love & Mercy""Leonardo DiCaprio, ""The Revenant""Tom Hanks, ""Bridge of Spies""Samuel L. Jackson, ""The Hateful Eight"" I'm not wild about any of these performances -- except Paul Dano's. His take on the young Brian Wilson was so uncanny that watching the 1960s parts of ""Love and Mercy"" felt like time travel. He's being campaigned as a supporting actor, while his co-star John Cusack is in contention for lead, but I think that's a mistake. I hope the Academy agrees. Matt: Christopher Abbott, ""James White""Matt Damon, ""The Martian""Paul Dano, ""Love & Mercy""Andrew Garfield, ""99 Homes""Michael B. Jordan, ""Creed"" Imagine a calendar where male leads couldn't hold a candle to the year's female stars. That was 2015. Most of the A-list Oscar players -- Leonardo DiCaprio (""The Revenant""), Johnny Depp (""Black Mass""), Eddie Redmayne (""The Danish Girl""), Will Smith (""Concussion"") -- turned in work that felt removed and performative. I'll echo Joe by saying that Paul Dano, in one of the year's best screen achievements, should be the lead contender to beat. See our full coverage of the Best Actor race. Joe: Joan Allen, ""Room""Jennifer Jason Leigh, ""The Hateful Eight""Rooney Mara, ""Carol""Kristen Stewart, ""Clouds of Sils Maria""Alicia Vikander, ""Ex Machina"" I guess it's a foregone conclusion that Vogue cover girl Alicia Vikander will be nominated for ""The Danish Girl,"" but I still prefer her in ""Ex Machina."" She captured the uncanny and seductive power of artificial intelligence as well as any actor ever has. Matt: Jennifer Jason Leigh, ""The Hateful Eight""Rooney Mara, ""Carol""Cynthia Nixon, ""James White""Kristen Stewart, ""Clouds of Sils Maria""Kristen Wiig, ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" This category is loaded, and it's a shame to omit Alicia Vikander (""The Danish Girl""), Elizabeth Banks (""Love & Mercy""), Tessa Thompson (""Creed""), Mya Taylor (""Tangerine"") and a host of others. But the supporting-actress hardware begins and ends with Rooney Mara, even if she's arguably a co-lead in ""Carol."" See our full coverage of the Best Supporting Actress race. Joe: Walton Goggins, ""The Hateful Eight""Oscar Isaac, ""Ex Machina""Michael Keaton, ""Spotlight""Mark Rylance, ""Bridge of Spies""Jacob Tremblay, ""Room"" Walton Goggins completely blew me away in ""The Hateful Eight."" There was something unhinged and committed about his performance as a Confederate sympathizer that made him seem alive in a way that few Quentin Tarantino characters do. Matt: Joel Edgerton, ""Black Mass""Idris Elba, ""Beasts of No Nation""Jason Mitchell, ""Straight Outta Compton""Mark Rylance, ""Bridge of Spies""Jason Segel, ""The End of the Tour"" If Johnny Depp and Tom Hanks were forgettable in ""Black Mass"" and ""Bridge of Spies,"" respectively, their supporting counterparts certainly were not. Hats off to Joel Edgerton and Mark Rylance for besting their upperclass screen partners. Really, any of these five men deserve this accolade. See our full coverage of the Best Supporting Actor race. Joe: Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, ""Inside Out""Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, ""Spotlight""David O. Russell, ""Joy""Quentin Tarantino, ""The Hateful Eight"" I think everyone is wrong about ""Joy."" People say that its plot was confused, bizarre and implausible -- but my take is that David O. Russell was intentionally playing with our expectations about how a plot should work. Indeed, I think the whole movie was a brilliant commentary on the art of screenwriting. There's not enough room to explain why here, but I might revisit the topic in an essay soon. Matt: Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch, ""Tangerine""Patrick Brice, ""The Overnight""Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, ""Inside Out""Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, ""Spotlight"" ""Spotlight"" accomplished so much with so few flourishes, but I maintain that ""The Overnight"" is the year's most under-appreciated comedic script. Regardless, this victory belongs to the ""Inside Out"" scribes. Imagine conceptualizing something half as eye-opening and original as that Pixar gem. Joe: J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""Emma Donoghue, ""Room""Drew Goddard, ""The Martian""Nick Hornby, ""Brooklyn""Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, ""The Big Short"" It initially seemed strange to me that ""The Force Awakens"" was competing in this category, but then I saw the genius of it: If you think about it as an adaptation of ""A New Hope,"" it's a near-perfect script. Matt: Drew Goddard, ""The Martian""Marielle Heller, ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""Nick Hornby, ""Brooklyn""Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, ""The Big Short""Phyllis Nagy, ""Carol"" We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/keeping-church-and-state_b_8903266,1/1/2016,john w. traphagan,Keeping Church and State Separate,"On January 1, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut, who had requested clarification about the meaning of the First Amendment to the Constitution. Jefferson described the Establishment Clause of First Amendment by writing, ""I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibit the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and state."" A wall of separation between church and state.  This is a very strong statement, very clear in meaning. First of all, it means that the government cannot make laws that favor one religion over any other, because it cannot make laws related to the establishment of a religion or the free expression of religious beliefs. Therefore, individuals can pray in school, but public schools cannot require people to pray. The government cannot endorse any particular religion -- meaning there can be no copies of the Ten Commandments in front of schools, nor nativity scenes in government buildings, nor Buddha statues in front of government offices. Religious leaders and their followers should relish in this wall of separation, rather than trying to knock it down. Why? Because it is there not only to keep religion out of government, but to keep government out of religion. The wall of separation goes both ways; the Establishment Clause protects not only the government from meddling by religious organizations, but protects religious organizations from interference with the practice of their beliefs by government as long as those beliefs do not require actions, like human sacrifice, that break laws not related to religious practice. Clearly from the perspective of Jefferson, as was the case with many of his peers, the fledgling U.S. was not intended to be a country with any particular religion -- and certainly not a Christian country. The objective was to create an environment in which people were free to believe what they want without the government getting in the way; the best way to do that is to keep church and state apart. Jefferson was committed to this separation because he had little faith in the capacity of a government run or even influenced by religious leaders to protect individual rights and ensure liberty for all. In a letter to Horatio Spafford in March of 1814, Jefferson wrote, ""In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own."" Nothing has changed as far as the truth of Jefferson's sentiments and the need to preserve the wall of separation between church and state as of 2016. Religious symbols, icons and phrases -- not just Christian, but any religion -- should be kept out of government buildings and organized prayer should be kept out of schools. This protects our freedoms, including the freedom of those who believe in ideas presented in documents like the Ten Commandments or the Lotus Sutra. Those on the Christian right who would break down this wall of separation are doing a disservice to themselves, because the loss of the separation between church and state weakens the capacity of the government to protect the rights of anyone to practice their religious beliefs freely. Of course, it is possible that many on the Christian right do not believe in freedom of religion and instead want America to be a Christian nation (by which they mean their particular brand of Christianity) that is intolerant of the beliefs of others, whether Buddhist, Jewish, Unitarian Universalist, atheist or anything else. If that is the case, then they do not support freedom of religion and, thus, do not support the Constitution and the principles upon which the United States was founded. That is their right as citizens of a free country. And the First Amendment, including the Establishment Clause, is the basis upon which that right is protected by the government. Such protection is the primary job of the government in a free society; it is not to support any particular religion. The next four years will change America forever.

Officials in Louisiana are checking levees daily, and Exxon Mobil Corp has decided to shut its 340,571 barrel-per-day refined products terminal in Memphis, Tennessee, as floodwaters threatened to inundate the facility just south of the city's downtown. ""All that water's coming south and we have to be ready for it,"" Louisiana Lieutenant Governor-Elect Billy Nungesser told CNN. ""It's a serious concern. It's early in the season. We usually don't see this until much later."" Workers in southwestern Tennessee were preparing sandbags on Friday in hopes of limiting damage from the Mississippi when it crests at Memphis next week, state emergency management officials said. Officials were also examining levees, to make sure they would hold. ""We're moving things up high and we've got our generators out and got some extra water,"" said Dotty Kirkendoll, a clerk at Riverside Park Marina on McKellar Lake, which feeds off the Mississippi. Flooding in the U.S. Midwest typically occurs in the spring as snowmelt swells rivers. Freezing temperatures that have followed the rare winter flooding have added to regional woes. Very unbelievable, had to share. Most of the deaths in Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas have been caused by people driving into flooded areas after days of downpours. The dead included a central Illinois teenager whose body was recovered on Friday near where a truck in which he was riding was found the day before. Another teen from the truck was still missing. Authorities also continued searching on Friday for country singer Craig Strickland, who had gone duck hunting on an Oklahoma lake during stormy conditions. His friend, Chase Morland, was found dead on Monday. Twelve Illinois counties have been declared disaster areas, and Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday ordered Illinois National Guard troops into flooded areas in the southern part of the state to mitigate flood damage and help with evacuation efforts. The Mississippi is expected to crest at Thebes, in southern Illinois, at 47.5 feet (14 meters) on Sunday, more than 1.5 feet above the 1995 record, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. Flood warnings were also in effect on Friday for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, the Carolinas, Alabama and Kentucky, the NWS said, while major flooding was occurring on the Arkansas River and its tributaries in that state. Dozens have died in U.S. storms, which also brought unusual winter tornadoes and were part of a wild worldwide weather system over the Christmas holiday period that also saw severe flooding in Britain. More than 100,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes in areas bordering Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina after floods due to heavy summer rains caused by El Niño, authorities have said. Global weather dominated conversation on social media over the holiday season after the international climate deal in Paris. Particularly hard hit in the United States in recent days has been Missouri, which has suffered historic flooding. Close to St. Louis on Friday, the Mississippi, the second-longest river in the United States, was falling after reaching near-record heights, the NWS said. The Meramec River, which meanders near St. Louis and empties into the Mississippi, broke height records on Thursday, sending a deluge of water over its banks and forcing the closure of two major highways.

The lawsuit accuses the comedian of portraying the women as liars in the press after they publicly shared allegations that Cosby engaged in sexual misconduct. The suit, which was first filed in December 2014 by Linda Traitz, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese, gained four more plaintiffs -- Louisa Moritz, Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis and Angela Leslie -- in November. Bill Cosby has countersued, arguing the women's allegations hurt his career. The judge, U.S. Magistrate Judge David H.

It is ""at least plausible that Mrs. Cosby is in possession of information"" relevant to the case, the 12-page ruling read. Camille Cosby had argued that conversations between herself and her husband were private. In the past year, more than 50 women have come forward to accuse Bill Cosby of incidents of sexual assault or misconduct. He has steadfastly denied all of them. The judge's ruling came just one day after Cosby turned himself in to authorities on an aggravated indecent assault charge based on the accusations of Andrea Constand -- the first criminal charges against the 78-year-old comedian despite years of hushed accusations. Constand described taking an ""herbal pill"" at the comedian's home that made her feel ""paralyzed"" before Cosby guided her to his couch, where he forcibly placed her hand on his penis and sexually assaulted her in 2004. She had been invited to visit under the pretense of discussing her career. If convicted on the assault charge, Cosby could be sentenced to five to 10 years in prison.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/if-you-like-cards-against_b_8895458,1/1/2016,k.n. granger,"If You Like Cards Against Humanity, Check Out These 8 Games"," The phenomenon that is Cards Against Humanity (CAH) seems to have reached a critical point where it's effectively in the mainstream. At least on the east coast, it's a game that many young people have on their shelves, next to the old Hasbro and Milton Bradley staples. The game was first published in May 2011, and has undergone many editions and expansions since; the creators are currently working on a sixth expansion. This game took off like wildfire, and thus this game is no longer confined to indie-loving circles who backed the original Kickstarter. However, maybe you're finding that you and your friends have over-played the game. ""Pretend You're Xyzzy"" makes it too easy to play pick-up games of CAH, leading to burn-out over the game. Also, the year 2014 wasn't a good year for CAH in the media; a trans teen named Jonah publicly burned a transphobic card, causing many who had enjoyed the game to examine it critically - some people removing over a hundred cards from the original decks. Even though the creators of CAH ultimately reject many of the original cards, persuasive articles like ""Why I Quit Playing Cards Against Humanity,""  (2014) and ""The Case Against Cards Against Humanity"" (2014) have accompanied the trend of people falling out of love with the game. One of the most great things about the rise of this game is the way it has revived gaming in person amongst friends (especially those who don't game regularly, and are otherwise stuck with the classics of Monopoly and Scrabble). The hard copies of CAH have become wildly popular among diverse folks of all ages and identities. In short, this game has helped people bond and connect in ways that ordinarily they wouldn't. This is a net positive. Other positives of the game include: the flexibility of integrating new players and letting bored players drop out, the ease of teaching the game, and the dirty elements of the game that create bonding experiences. Still, after playing a couple hundred times, you might be tired of CAH. Maybe you wish you had something to take its place and diversify your board game collection. If you're looking for games functionally similar to CAH, but that have a more inclusive flavor, check out the following games!  1. Slash: Romance Without Boundaries This game merits considerable attention because of its unique flavor. It's an independently published game that had a very successful Kickstarter in 2015. Functionally it's very similar to CAH. However, this is probably the nerdiest game on this list because of the content matter: in this game, you're pairing up potential love-matches between fictional characters, and justifying why you think they go well together. Basically, it's a game where you make fanfiction. It's amazing. So who do you think is a better romantic partner for Elsa from Frozen? Maybe Snow White, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves - Elsa just needs someone to take care of her, and Snow White's name has the word 'snow' in it, so that could work. Or perhaps a better pairing might be Mr. Freeze from Batman - Elsa is pretty much the only person he could ever mate with given his cryogenic suit situation. Final and winning option? Frosty the Snow Man - because once Elsa came out and built a snowman, she fell in love with it. Or something. The goal is to convince the judge to choose your pairing as the best. Given how subjective judges can be, 'playing to the judge' is critical to success in this game, same as in CAH. Watch a video about this game here.  2. Mad Scientist University This game is a delightful romp through silliness, and is kid-friendly (aside from the vaguely ableist name). The premise of the game is simple. Similar to CAH, each player is justifying their card choices to the judge. The judge is the 'instructor' and the other players are the 'students' in a zany science class. The instructor chooses an 'assignment' for the students to fulfill, and each student chooses a card to use as their method of fulfilling their assignment. For example, one of the assignments might be ""Get Something to Eat!"" and the project cards might include ""A Rubber Band,"" ""A Baseball Bat"" and ""Lemonade."" The goal of the game is to come up with as convoluted and silly a plot as possible to fulfill the assignment. For example, you might justify using ""Lemonade"" to ""Get Something to Eat!"" by saying something like this: So I get some lemonade from the cafeteria. Then I go to the lab and I get some zombiefying fluid and add it to the lemonade. Then I go outside and I convince all the students in the courtyard to drink from this pitcher of lemonade. Then all the other students turn into zombies, and I'll corrall them into the Arby's until the Arby's employees are so overwhelmed that they start giving all the zombies free roast beef sandwiches. And since zombies don't eat roast beef sandwiches, the zombies will give them all to me, and I'll have Gotten Something to Eat! BWAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!! Sounds fun, right? The flavor is meant to evoke themes similar to the film, Despicable Me. This game is probably the best game on this list to entertain younger folks, but it's still worth keeping around for adult board game nights.  3. Bad Medicine This is an indie game just published this year! It's designed by Gil Hova, an independent game designer who lives in New Jersey. The game is very similar to CAH in terms of the gameplay, with the goal to satisfy a choosy judge. The flavor reminds one of the television series, Better Off Ted, where big pharmaceutical companies try to cure 'maladies' through developing new drugs, and simultaneously dismissing the side effects of the drugs. A cheeky and sweetly cynical game, the net result is that you build up a portfolio of drugs to treat each malady, and a list of side effects that are 'not that bad.' Check out a description of play direct from the designer here.  4. Dixit This game, published by European company Libellud, involves the same flexibility of CAH, but also is unique in gameplay format. This game's primary merit is that draws upon a completely different area of the brain than CAH, and unlike CAH which is a good game to wind down with, Dixit is a good game to warm up the brain in preparation for a strategy game or other activity requiring active executive function. It requires careful attention to symbols and metaphor, and has a creative element that is absent from CAH. Gameplay involves choosing one card from your hand, just like in CAH, but all the cards are beautiful modernist paintings instead of words. Then you give a clue based on what you see in the picture, and then everyone submits cards based on that clue. You shuffle the cards, and then everyone votes on all the cards (face-up) to try and guess which one is the one that the clue-giver submitted. Successful clues frequently are phrases of poetry or quotes; for example, if a picture is an oil pump, you might clue ""I drink your milkshake"" (the quote being a reference to an iconic scene in the movie There Will Be Blood, which is about treacherous oil deals). Or maybe you have a picture prominently featuring a nose, and you might choose the clue ""A rose by any other name,"" and anyone who remembers that the next line is ""would smell just as sweet"" would probably vote correctly. Point is, you want to choose a clue that's obscure enough that not everyone at the game table will get it, but at least some people will. That's how you earn points and eventually win the game. Watch Wil Wheaton playing this game here.  5. Snake Oil This game is similar in concept to Bad Medicine, but the execution is quite different. This game is published by Out of the Box, and is great for all ages. The goal of this game is to sell silly items based on combinations of random words to the judge, who is playing a particular character. For example, the judge's character might be a surfer, and the cards drawn by person #1 might be ""wonder"" and ""bag,"" and they'd attempt to sell the surfer a bag of wonders, and justify how this is applicable to the surfer's character. Then person #2 might have drawn ""flower"" and ""bonanza,"" and they'd also attempt to sell this item to the surfer. The person who impresses the judge the most wins the round, and then the judge role rotates to the next player. This game sounds basic, but it can result in a lot of fun; it won a MENSA Select Award for 2012. Watch an entertaining example of playing this game here.  6. Love 2 Hate This game best captures the spirit of CAH. It's funny, it's inappropriate, and it's fresh - but it also very specifically avoids the offensive pitfalls of CAH. The game, published by Green Ronin this year, is functionally similar to CAH in that you are trying to please a judge - but unlike CAH, you're trying to complete the judge's sentence. The judge draws a card with words like ""hipsters,"" ""politicians,"" or ""monsters,"" and they decide if they love or hate the identity featured on the card. Then everyone submits phrases that might be applicable to the judge's perspective, ranging from the absurd to the cynical. You can watch how the game is played here.  7. Say Anything This game warrants special attention because of how original it is in terms of gameplay, but how it also manages to really capture the same (or better) level of bonding between players compared to CAH. The game also manages to remain fresh in spite of repeated playings because so much of it is player-generated content, and the players don't remain trapped with a set of limited choices. The game is published by North Star Games, (makers of another good game that didn't make it to this list, Wits and Wagers) and has reportedly earned over 30 awards, including the 2008 BoardGameGeek Best Party Game award. The game is slightly more complicated than CAH, but in a good way. The judge selects a card with a topic question, such as ""What's the best movie of all time?"" or ""What's the worst restaurant of all time?"" Each player writes down privately what they think the judge would answer. Then they all reveal their answers, and the judge privately chooses their favorite answer. All the players vote on what they think the judge has picked. Then the judge reveals their actual answer, and points are given accordingly. Watch Wil Wheaton demonstrate the gameplay of this game here.  8. This listicle was originally supposed to include seven games; this game was so great I had to change the title to make sure I included it. This superbly well-designed game was published in 2010 in Brooklyn, NY, and it therefore predates CAH while also surpassing it in quality and excellence. Designed by Colleen Macklin, John Sharp, and Eric Zimmerman, this game is published independently by an organization dedicated to the purpose, Local No. 12. This game takes conversation and makes it into a game, guiding players into interesting discussions that they might not ordinarily have. Moreover, there are six different ways of playing the game, which means that the deck has a lot more functionality than CAH. Watch an example of gameplay here. They have two expansions out currently, one about films and one about science fiction. Like CAH, you can buy it on Amazon or print and play it for free.  8.5. Apples to Apples Of course, I'd be remiss not to mention that CAH is originally based on the modern classic game, Apples to Apples. Published by Mattel, the game is just like CAH, but it's (almost) completely clean. They have a variety of versions including Sour Apples to Apples, which is a bit more competitive. The base game, which has become a ubiquitous addition to every mom's gaming shelf, was originally developed by Out of the Box, the same people who came up with the aforementioned game, Snake Oil! But Apples to Apples was sold to Mattel, which is how it got distributed so widely. In case you've never played it before, you can watch how the game is played here. Overall, there are tons of alternatives to Cards Against Humanity. Undoubtedly I missed some games that merit attention, so if you want to share, please add to the comments.

But it's important to remember the good moments - and 2015 did have some big ones. Our look back at the most inspiring videos and trends of 2015 documents everyday people showing strength and compassion, like 8-year-old Alex McKelvey performing 600 acts of kindness for strangers, or 86-year-old Ann Dilley continuing to take college classes for 36 years. There was teen mother Trameka Pope, who went from being homeless to becoming her high school valedictorian, and churches around the country who demonstrated the Christian virtue of generosity by giving huge tips to pizza delivery drivers. When it comes to happy tears, nothing beats videos of soldiers coming home to surprise their children - unless it's videos of crowds cheering with joy following the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage across the country. Other inspiring moments came in the wake of grief, like Robin Williams' daughter Zelda writing a powerful Instagram post about depression after her father's suicide, or the French father who comforted his young son after the Paris attacks, saying ""They may have guns, but we have flowers."" More recently, arson victim Safyre Terry received more than 700,000 Christmas cards from strangers around the world after her story went viral on Facebook. Here's to 2016 bringing us even more progress and faith in humanity. Happy New Year!

In a world where digital, physical and human converge, Collins helps their clients solve the puzzles of relevancy to build brands people can't live without. Collins works with notable brands such as Spotify, Target, Coca-Cola, Foursquare, ACE Group and Babyganics with the belief that the only way Collins can help their clients create meaningful experiences for their customers, is if Collins' own creative culture reflects the diversity of the world we live in today. One of few women of color to become President of a top-flight agency, Amber has made it her mission to reimagine what creative culture looks like for the industry - one that is inclusive of talent from all backgrounds. Amber comes from an accomplished career in account management where she's worked closely with clients to build their brands (and their businesses). While she spent the majority of her career in brand-building, including in key roles at Ogilvy & Mather, Saatchi & Saatchi and TBWA\Chiat\ Day. In 2009, Amber turned her focus to digital marketing when she joined agency T3. Amber was Managing Director of its New York office and grew it into a remarkable player, leading clients including Chase, Allstate and Pfizer. While Amber's experience across many industries and channels has honed her gifts in leading big, meaningful experiences for people, it's her daily experience as a wife, mom, daughter, sister and friend that reminds her why it matters. She graduated cum laude from Boston University with a degree in Psychology and Women's Studies. She lives with her husband and two young children in New Jersey. How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?I grew up in two very politically active households (my mother's in New York and my father's in New Jersey). Each had radically different forms of activism (one through education, the other through more tangible acts of protest). I found myself from an early age attending demonstrations and rallies. By the time I was in middle school I was organizing walk-outs and holding political fundraisers (well, an 11 year-olds version of a fundraiser). Being surrounded by people from very different backgrounds working together for an idea they believed in had a profound influence on me. Not to mention, learning at a young age that I had a voice and an ability - if not a responsibility - to affect change was powerful and motivating.As a business leader, these tenets still guide me. We work to build, evolve and create ideas that push our clients' businesses forward and we can't do that unless we have highly skilled, talented and diverse people working together to imagine, innovate and create. As a leader, I have to help create an environment where different people can come together, but feel united by a shared vision. I have to nurture a place where everyone knows they have a voice, and most importantly, has the ability to affect change - whether it be for our clients' brands or to our own internal culture. How has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at Collins?The most beautiful thing we can make for our clients are sales charts that curve up. I've worked for some phenomenal organizations. They've taught me what it really takes to deliver results. Our success lies purely in the people who work with us. And as many great organizations I have been with, I have also been in organizations where the culture was not conducive to collaboration, diversity, or debate. Leaders at these organizations say our industry has a ""talent problem"". But the problem is not with the talent. It's with an archaic, Mad-men-esque culture that doesn't allow the diverse thinkers of today's generation to thrive. And it's those businesses that are struggling, and will continue to struggle, as other more progressive companies learn how to evolve, adapt and create new creative cultures that will allow talent from all different backgrounds to thrive. What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at Collins?We've made some pretty massive strides in the last 8 months that could have only been made possible by working with a talented group of people. By the end of this year, we will have doubled in size, created a new framework for how we work internally and with our clients, won 10 new clients, opened a thriving San Francisco office and launched an internal ""Culture Club"" that sponsors outside events for our people to stay engaged within the design community. We've also just started to concept a new paid internship program that will identify high school students from economically disadvantaged school districts to spend the summer learning (and playing) with us. Last but not least, we've also worked hard to improve our employee benefits so we can make sure our people are taken care of. As with any company that is undergoing tremendous growth, we have some growing pains. Change, even for the better, is always a challenge to navigate. But we put our people first. If we can do that, the rest will follow. How can companies retain female millennials? Over the last couple of years I've felt a personal and professional mission to answer that very question. A year ago I would have said that we have to stop telling women they are the ones that have to change, and rather look at the culture of our professional organizations and see how they have to change. We need to start by raising awareness on institutional gender and racial biases in the workplace that impact employee retention and progress. We need to look at new models of how we allow both men and women to work so they have the flexibility and ability to be caregivers as well as employees. And we need to start paying women equal wages to men doing the same job. The big question that companies have to answer is ""What happens to our businesses if we don't?""What is the most important lesson you've learned in your career to date?It can be easy to confuse who you are with what you do for a living. Make sure that what you do for a living only represents a part of you. Leave room for all the other roles you can (and should) play in your life - ideally they should all influence each other. How do you maintain a work/life balance?I wish I could give you my five point plan but I'm not sure it's currently possible given our overarching culture of work in this country. When I started at Collins, the owners of the company (Brian Collins & Leland Maschmeyer) agreed that this was an important issue and that we needed to figure out what that looks like for our company. Currently, I have a work schedule that allows me to come in very early to the office and leave by 4:30pm so I can pick up the kids and then I work from home on Fridays. I remind myself on a daily basis that I can't be all things at one time, which allows me to focus and prioritize, and ultimately to be present and engaged whether it's at work or at home with my kids. What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?That we think women need to change (Lean in ladies!) instead of the change happening within the companies that hire them. That we think things like equal pay, institutional sexism, flexibility, and a culture of overwork are ""women's issues"" versus issues that impact and harm everyone, and most significantly, our families. How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?I don't know how you can move through your professional or your personal life without a mentor and/or a personal board of directors. It's made all the difference in the world for me. The more senior you become, the more isolated you can become. My mentors are both men and women who have been able to provide me perspective, insight and guidance. Oh, and a good laugh. Early in my career the head of our department had taken me under his wing and created some career changing opportunities for me. Year's later over coffee, I thanked him. And he said to me - ""Amber, all I did was provide you a stage and a spotlight, you did the rest."" Now that I'm a leader, it's what I try to do for others thanks to his influence and mentorship. Which other female leaders do you admire and why?Gay Gaddis - Founder and CEO of T3. Almost 20 years ago she did something revolutionary - she didn't want to lose some of her top talent (which happened to be women) and so when two women became pregnant at the same time she told them that after their maternity leave they could bring their babies back to work with them. This started the T3 and under program that allows mothers, fathers and their children to more easily transition back in to work and in to their new lives. It was a company realizing it needed to adapt to its talent, not the other way around. Mellody Hobson - President of Ariel investments. Not only does she lead an incredibly successful investment firm but she also talks openly about the things you're not supposed to talk about in business when you're a woman of color - that fact that you're a woman of color! Her TED talk ""Color Blind or Color Brave"" should be mandatory viewing for everyone.Anne-Marie Slaughter - President of The New America Foundation. Her provocative essay ""Why women still can't have it all"" has had me tossing and turning at night since I first read it two years ago. It prompted me and some other women to start a think tank - we know our current culture of overwork isn't working - for anybody - so we're looking to ideate solutions to change it. I don't want my daughter or my son to have to choose between being great at their job and being great at their lives. What do you want Collins to accomplish in the next year?We want to re-imagine what a creative culture looks like for our industry. That means creating a place where our people are sincerely valued, heard and supported. Where our people come in and feel inspired to inspire others. A culture where truly diverse creative talent comes together to solve the challenges our clients face, and where we help them create more meaningful experiences for their customers. That means creating an environment where women, people of color, gay, lesbian, straight, transgender, parents, caregivers, white dudes, introverts, extroverts, data seekers and intuitive feelers can all thrive. The way we see it, companies need to work for people. And we can only do that by having the most talented, spirited, and passionate people working with us every day. It's that tough. But it's that simple."

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mining-the-states-of-city_1_b_8894690,1/1/2016,john o'kane,Mining the States of City Minds: 2,"In ""Mining the States of City Minds,"" a recent blog, I introduced my approach to experiencing the texture of city life in Venice, California and writing up the resulting stories with a type of literary journalism. This kind of writing, with roots in the New Journalism of the 1960s, captures these stories as they happen in the streets and other sites of everyday life through scenes that are faithful to the action and events they emerged from. It lets characters speak for themselves, which gives the writing the feel of a fictional short story but also a more truthful approximation of the surfacing event through their differing perspectives or points of view. Like a Surrealist flaneur I amble through the city trolling for stories and find their potential elements in various clusters of activity, sometimes homeless camps, where these voices dramatize their challenging existences. They present the evidence that might lead to a larger story waiting to be told. This is the second in my series. In the first I captured the chaos ensuing from a crime in the streets, and especially the actions and impressions of one person suspected of committing it as he escapes into the bowels of the city. Here I capture another scene in a park at night where a few residents from the previous one are present along with others, including the suspect. ***** The Dog Park The Dog Park at night is devoid of canines. No Italian Greyhounds, Great Danes, Labradors, Airedales, Pekingeses, Pomeranians or French Poodles escorted by well-bred couples or their bronzed shadows; no pitbulls, mutts, mongrels or prairie dogs husbanded by the unemployed or Frisbee-levitating freaks. No echoes of the discordant barking symphonies that overspill the park during the day, or the blood-curdling howls, growls and yelps that erupt when the sublimation wears off and pet begets the wolf it momentarily supersedes, even sometimes giving way to a full-blown breeding struggle. Wyatt often found himself in the middle of these outbreaks, forced from his fitful slumber to play peacemaker to lords and serfs. The night was primitive communism. The degrees of victimization were more or less the same, the telltale scars and frayed threads were equal sartorial justice, the plots of land were squattable by all, no matter what the racial or gender preference. But the dog-eat-dog of the jungle gnaws away at the fabric. ""We gotta get otta here pretty soon, somethin's goin on out there...what we gonna do,"" says a male curled around a tree on the north end of the park, speaking to no one in particular. He could be anywhere between thirty and sixty, depending on the results from sifting through the street fallout in the light of day. Several others who are scattered down the mound from him look around, curious about who might be the object of his words. No one takes credit. ""Can't go back over there fer a while, that's fer sure!"" he continues. He's new to the area and hasn't been initiated. So most keep their distance, especially since he refuses to give his name. There's always the fear of outsiders spying on them, especially those with accents that are unfamiliar or apparently not true. And many on the street have minor warrants, failure to appear violations from when their lives above ground were starting to slide and they ignored too many petty citations, or more serious, ready-to-cuff ones. Life on the street can weaken moral restraints; even catapult some in directions they never intended. So as a result many assume cop until proven otherwise. The gossip is still rife about how a couple of the LAPD's finest actors could keep at it long enough to get Arnie who hung with the ""art"" crowd in the alley behind Beyond Baroque. He'd violated parole for hangin with Alf who was finishing his parole from a stint in the County for refusing to pay his bill for the breakfast special at the Café 50s. A few begin to move away from him. Some continue chatting about who the person might be who killed the guy in the alley the previous day. Others go on about their business. ""Doubt if he coulda had anything at all to do with it...it just doesn't make any sense!"" says a fifties-something male dressed in frayed and soiled military fatigues, referring to Wyatt, the main suspect. ""Yeah, but there was somethin funny about the way he was always leavin when we just got...member when we was havin that meetin over near the Free Clinic and he just stared at everyone and ran off?"" a young woman responds. A squad car dopplers past, briefly illuminating the Main Street side of the park, quashing the interchange. Angela and an unnamed male with a gray-streaked afro are making dinner plans. He'd just visited the dumpster behind Westminster, exhibiting his discoveries along the edge of the grass: a still-wrapped Big Mac, an unopened mini-bag of Chili Cheese Fritos, a clump of what appears to be chocolate cheese cake, a mound of crushed munchies on a large dinner plate, and several yet-to-be-clarified items he's in the process of preparing. ""Hey Angela,"" he blurts, ""ready for a real goormay dinner? Found a dead possum down the alley. If we can get us a fire goin...Mal over at Mao's scored me some sauce, though not sure what kind...could make us a mess a possum grinder sandwiches if we get everything together. Was a chef back in Tupelo for a few weeks and usta make some kickass grinders...possum's a delicacy in the south!"" ""I got it,"" he screeches, flailing his arms like he's gesturing with amens at a revival meeting. ""These folks round here gots more than they need have...gonna grab me a fire maker!"" He hustles to Pacific and crosses a couple hundred feet or so in front of a black and white speeding north, continuing to Clubhouse and then past to the alley and left toward the beach. He begins to scout the backyards. Angela caresses her companion's items and places them next to an adjacent tree, while seeing a male figure enter the park from the south. She notices that several park residents begin stirring in their roosts. Some start crawling toward the street. Lionel recognizes Wyatt coming toward him. ""Hey, you guys seen Willow?"" Wyatt's question gets no response. He watches as most everyone scampers out of the park, all except Lionel and the unnamed stranger, who's now nervously staring at Wyatt. ""Anyone seen Willow?"" Wyatt repeats, wondering why no one responds. ""Where's everyone going?"" ""Where ya been?"" Lionel fires back. ""Seems like just about everyone's looking for you since..."" ""...why, what you mean? Who?"" ""When's the last time ya saw Medic? Why ya wanna see Willow anyway?"" ""Don't remember anything...Why isn't she round? Something happen to her?"" ""You gotta get yerself together!"" The black and white returns and slips into the alley behind Clubhouse, its multi-colored light show illuminating the west side of the park and causing lights in several adjacent buildings to be turned on. The officers exit their car and proceed toward the beach, their flashlights exposing every nook and cranny en route. As they near the middle of the block Clara hails the officers from the top floor of her condo on the south side of the alley. ""There he is, over in that yard in the bushes!"" ""Close your window and stay inside,"" one of the officers spouts, while the other removes his weapon and moves slowly in the direction of the sighting.

He inches toward the officer with both hands in the air clasped around a small hibachi.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/whither-america_b_8903148,1/1/2016,marian wright edelman,Whither America,"""I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word[.]"" --Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech, December 10, 1964 The start of this New Year finds America at an inflection point as wars and terrorism abroad are echoed in violence, suspicion, and fear at home. How will we meet the moment? Hundreds of organizations and individuals have signed on to the urgent message of the campaign We Are Better Than This: “We grieve the many lives that have been lost or painfully transformed in recent weeks through extreme acts of violence. And we are appalled by the surge of divisive rhetoric that sows the seeds of more violence to come. A dangerous tide of hatred, violence, and suspicion is rising in America—whether aimed at Arab and Muslim Americans, women and the places we seek health care, Black people, immigrants and refugees, or people just going about their daily lives. This tide is made more dangerous by easy access to guns. When has hate ever led to progress? Is this really what we want America to be? We are better than this.” We are better than this. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great German Protestant theologian who died opposing Hitler’s holocaust, believed that the test of the morality of a society is how it treats its children. We flunk Bonhoeffer’s test every hour of every day in America as we let the violence of guns and the violence of poverty relentlessly stalk and sap countless child lives. A child or teen is killed by a gun every three and a half hours, nearly 7 a day, 48 a week. More than 15.5 million children are poor and children are the poorest age group in America—the world’s largest economy. And the younger children are the poorer they are. Children of color, already the majority of our youngest children, soon will be the majority of our children in 2020. Millions of them lack their basic needs for enough food, decent housing, health care and quality early childhood supports during their years of greatest brain development. And over six decades after Brown v. Board of Education, a majority of children of color are still waiting for a fair and equal chance to learn. A majority of all fourth and eighth grade public school students and more than 80 percent of Black and 73 percent of Hispanic students in these grades cannot read or compute at grade level and face dim futures as a jobless landscape looms. They also lack assurance that their lives matter and are at great risk of being sucked into a prison pipeline. Those of us who remember McCarthyism see familiar signs in the hateful rhetoric and hatred aimed at Muslims, refugees, and immigrants. Even children report being bullied and attacked and hearing hateful words. And the pervasive and relentless threat of violence and terror continues to attack and frighten children and adults from Syria to Paris to California and in our cities and rural areas. There is another way. Once again, Dr. King’s words lead us there—through a world that often can feel suffocated by “starless midnight” to belief in a new day. He warned us that excessive materialism, militarism, racism, and poverty could be America’s undoing but that it was up to us to act and combat these evils. The great Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, introducing Dr. King to a Rabbinical Assembly shortly before he was assassinated, said: “Where in America today do we hear a voice like the voice of the prophets of Israel? Martin Luther King is a sign that God has not forsaken the United States. God has sent him to us.” Heschel continued, “His mission is sacred…The situation of the poor in America is our plight, our sickness. To be deaf to their cry is to condemn ourselves.” Heschel believed, “Martin Luther King, Jr., is a voice, a vision, and a way. I call upon every Jew,” and I would add, every person of faith, “to harken to his voice, to share his vision, to follow his way. The whole future of America will depend on the impact and influence of Dr. King.” I would add the world. The next four years will change America forever.

In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech Dr. King also told us he had “the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.” And he said: “Civilization and violence are antithetical concepts... Sooner or later all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace, and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. If this is to be achieved, man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.” Let’s hear and decide that this is the voice we will follow into this New Year. And let us pray and act for an end to preventable poverty and violence in our nation beginning with our children.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-avoid-getting-blin_b_8895474,1/1/2016,bob berkowitz,How to Avoid Getting Blindsided in a Media interview,"Never go into a media interview without doing your homework. You should be clear about who the interviewer is and where he or she is coming from. Google the interviewer's past materials and figure out what his likes and dislikes are. What's her political bent? What's his take on business, especially yours? Has she ever voiced an opinion about your area of expertise? Are the questions confrontational or informational? Does he interrupt the interviewee or let the guest complete the answer? For example, Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business News often asks questions that are laced with her opinions while Charlie Rose is more neutral. Chris Mathews of MSNBC and Bill O'Reilly of Fox News Channel come from different ends of the political spectrum but they have at least one thing in common: it is rare for either to allow their guest to answer a question without interruption. And they are not shy about telling you what they think about your opinion. What's the background of the host or reporter? Do you have anything in common like growing up in the same city or attending the same college? Commonality can help create rapport. If you've read or seen one of their stories and found something genuinely interesting, mention it to them. Everyone likes praise. The next four years will change America forever.

She was abandoned in a cardboard box and left to fend for herself on a busy San Francisco street. She was born without functional legs, and when people would stop to peer into the box, they would walk away after noticing her birth defect. But Daffodil has since embarked on a happy new chapter. Thanks to the kindness of a passerby and the dedication of rescue workers, the little pooch has found a zippy new way to get around -- and a loving home to call her own. According to a blog post by the San Francisco SPCA, Daffodil was rescued by a Good Samaritan named Jene who had spotted the puppy on the street. “Even though many noticed the tiny dog, nobody stopped to help,” the organization wrote. “[Jene] told us that someone reached for the helpless little creature, and upon noticing her birth defect, decided to put her right back into that soggy cardboard box she was left in.” Jene decided to take the pooch home, but soon realized the animal needed more help and care than he could provide. That’s what prompted him to bring Daffodil to the SPCA, where rescue workers immediately got to work trying to find a way to improve the dog's mobility. “Despite her challenges, Daffodil was a typical puppy at heart: curious, playful, and so very adorable,” the SPCA wrote. “She had already learned to get around well enough, but couldn’t channel her puppy energy into playful romping, or chasing toys, or running in circles like the other dogs. In order to give her the life she deserves, one full of puppy playdates and trips to the beach, we decided to get Daffodil her very own set of wheels.” With the help of OrthoPets, a company that specializies in animal prosthetics, together with generous donations from strangers, Daffodil was soon fitted with a four-wheeled prosthetic that allowed her to move around with greater speed and efficiency. “[T]his resilient little puppy [ran] for the first time in her life. Just like that: she was given the chance, and she just went for it,” wrote the SPCA. In a happy twist to the story, Daffodil was later adopted by an employee of OrthoPets. According to the SPCA’s blog post, the employee, named Olivia, had fallen in love with the pooch after seeing photos and was determined to adopt the dog even though she lived in Colorado. “[Olivia] flew in from Colorado to take her home and provide her with a lifetime of love and specialized care. Because some people see value and love and potential and best friends -- even in a broken little dog,” the post said. The next four years will change America forever.

Authorities also continued searching on Friday for country singer Craig Strickland, who had gone duck hunting on an Oklahoma lake during stormy conditions. His friend, Chase Morland, was found dead on Monday. Twelve Illinois counties have been declared disaster areas, and Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday ordered Illinois National Guard troops into flooded areas in the southern part of the state to mitigate flood damage and help with evacuation efforts. The Mississippi is expected to crest at Thebes, in southern Illinois, at 47.5 feet (14 meters) on Sunday, more than 1.5 feet above the 1995 record, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. Flood warnings were also in effect on Friday for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, the Carolinas, Alabama and Kentucky, the NWS said, while major flooding was occurring on the Arkansas River and its tributaries in that state. Dozens have died in U.S. storms, which also brought unusual winter tornadoes and were part of a wild worldwide weather system over the Christmas holiday period that also saw severe flooding in Britain. More than 100,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes in areas bordering Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina after floods due to heavy summer rains caused by El Niño, authorities have said.

Particularly hard hit in the United States in recent days has been Missouri, which has suffered historic flooding. Close to St. Louis on Friday, the Mississippi, the second-longest river in the United States, was falling after reaching near-record heights, the NWS said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/changing-and-unchanging-cycles_b_8903002,1/1/2016,"lisa r,all",Changing and Unchanging Cycles,"On New Year's Eve, as we hum ""Auld Lang Syne"" and drink a cup of kindness, we celebrate the end of one year and the beginning of another. It might feel like a big deal to us here on earth, but from an astronomical perspective, it's just a day like any other -- as one planet circles one star, the sun, out of the galaxy's billions. But since we arbitrarily impose a beginning and an end on our equitable distribution of days, let's reflect on some of the cycles that dominate our existence: the big ones over which we have no control, the smaller ones we might hope to influence, and those about which we don't yet know. This way, we can make some resolutions that will outlast the echoes of our song. Patterns and repetition are comforting because they help us remember and understand events. Phenomena that occur on a regular basis generally have an underlying reason. The cosmos provides us with numerous examples. Isaac Newton deduced the law of gravity that allows us to predict elliptical orbits around a central object's gravitational pull. This is how the Milky Way attracts the sun, which takes roughly 240 million years to orbit the galaxy's center. And as we all know, the earth, along with all the other planets in our solar system, orbits the sun. The earth's cycle takes a year -- hence the holiday and festivities before us. The planets in the solar system are joined by objects with lesser celebrity status, such as asteroids and comets. Dwarf planets orbit too. ""Dwarf planet'' is a new category that includes the demoted Pluto, but also other objects of similar size that have been discovered since the 1990s -- objects that are big enough to take notice of (and are spherical) but not quite big enough to orbit alone. Like John Mayer, who formerly headlined on his own but now tours with the Grateful Dead, Pluto is no longer a solo act. The earth's rotation on its axis, creating the 24-hour cycle we know so well, is why Annie who gets her gun (back when that could be considered amusing) has the sun in the morning and the moon at night. It's also why orphan Annie knows the sun will come out tomorrow. (The moon rotates too -- but at a rate commensurate with that of its orbit. This results in a side of the moon we never see, sometimes colloquially, and inaccurately, called ""the dark side of the moon."" Being invisible to us does not make it dark -- the sun still shines on this hidden hemisphere.) Seasons result from the tilt of the earth's axis of rotation, which makes regions subject to differing amounts of the sun's radiation as the earth orbits around it. Long-term climate trends depend on other cyclical patterns too, such as the various Milankovitch cycles of thousands of years, named for the Serbian astronomer-mathematician Milutin Milankovitch, who realized that the periodic changes in the earth's ellipticity -- how far from circular the orbit is -- as well as changes in the earth's tilt, can result in climate changes that lead, about every 100,000 years, to ice ages and to shorter periodic weather patterns, too. However, these many-thousand-year cycles don't explain what is happening on time scales determined by human activity in the last few hundred years. Within the earth, too, patterns repeat themselves. Over a few hundred million years of geological activity, the plates of the earth are regenerated, and, over a shorter time scale, the ocean floor is reconfigured too. Movements of the continental plates are one of the drivers of another important cycle, the carbon cycle, so essential to life on our planet. The cycle of carbon in the atmosphere -- critical to our climate, and to life itself -- results in part from carbon that is released into the atmosphere through volcanoes and hotspots and is absorbed back into the earth. There is weak evidence that large-impact craters on earth -- those that arose from a kilometer-wide asteroid or comet hitting the earth -- also happen periodically. Research by my collaborators and me suggests that it could be the gravitational pull of dark matter in the midplane of the Milky Way that dislodges weakly bound comets at the edge of the solar system so that they are more likely to hit the earth in a 32-million-year cycle. Measurements being done currently will show whether such a dark matter disc exists. Though we are safe from any such hypothesized cataclysmic impact for another 30 million years, there are other cycles, ones over which we can exercise some control, that present much more immediate threats. We are repeatedly alerted to melting glaciers and increasingly dangerous storms. News about the Middle East changes in detail, but the general patterns remain the same. Gun shootings in America happen so regularly that the cycles of outrage and pushback are barely noticeable. Yet despite the recurring carousel of time, we enter each new year with optimism. It will be easier to maintain that belief in a better future if we think a little harder about how and when we can eject ourselves from undesirable patterns. The Paris climate agreement and its ancillary benefits can help us begin to make real progress in slowing down changes to the earth's climate, a cycle we have only a limited time to affect. Maybe we can curb, or at least slow down, other seeming inevitabilities, too. In the universe, cycles won't last forever as the solar system and the galaxy undergo changes. If we can keep in mind that humanity has the potential to change the cycles that we impose on ourselves, then maybe this new year we'll break that most reliable cycle of all -- making resolutions we don't have the fortitude to keep.

I haven't received phone calls from almost anyone. Very few people have communicated with me,” the 22-year-old told Colombia's W Radio on Wednesday, explaining why she’s been mostly silent about the incident. “That's because I had to grieve for what happened.” Gutiérrez had already started celebrating what she believed to be her victory at the Dec. 20 Miss Universe pageant when host Steve Harvey interrupted her revelry to announce that he'd read out the wrong name for the winner. In a mortifying on-air moment, the crown was then taken from a visibly stunned Gutiérrez -- and given to an equally flabbergasted Miss Philippines, Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach. Photos of the aftermath show an emotional Gutiérrez being comforted by her fellow contestants. After the on-air flub, Gutiérrez, who was named the first runner-up, was widely praised for responding to Harvey’s mistake with grace. “Everything happens for a reason,” she said backstage immediately after the mortifying incident. She later took to Instagram to congratulate Miss Philippines for her win. “Life continues and in the future we will find out why things happen the way they happen,” she wrote in her post. In her interview with W Radio this week, however, Gutiérrez had a few stronger words for what happened, calling the incident a “great shock” and a “great injustice.” “They did not do things the right way,” Gutiérrez said of the way the error was handled. “They could have done it, I don't know, the next day in a press conference or a press release,” she said, referring to the stripping of the crown. Still, Gutiérrez stressed that she was looking on the bright side. “I managed to make history, which I think is more important than winning the Miss Universe title,” she told W Radio.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/something-wicked-white-su_b_8902982,1/1/2016,rev. dr. susan brooks thistlethwaite,Something Wicked: White Supremacy as 2016's Urgent Faith Challenge," Something Wicked This Way Comes is not only a sinister 1962 fantasy novel by Ray Bradbury, it is also descriptive of the malevolent and growing power of white supremacy in the United States. This accelerating menace is an urgent faith challenge in 2016. Here's where we are today: African American children and adults are killed with impunity, callously injured and incarcerated at rates that make the United States a world pariah. Conservative presidential candidates are getting explicit support from white supremacist organizations that have crawled out of the woodwork, drawn by hateful rhetoric against African Americans, immigrants and Muslims. While white supremacy is by no means new, this is a new moment of accelerated marketing of fear and hate packaged as a promise that if you are a white person you can get a sense of control over your life. Never mind the real reason why you feel out of control is because your job went to China and your company executives spent your retirement. White supremacists, like the carnival barker in Bradbury's novel, know the secret desire for power in the human heart, and the buried fears that give rise to those desires, and they exploit them. Across a vast and diverse faith community, we have to recognize this desire and its powerful emotional lure: feeling superior as a white person over those of other races, especially over African Americans, is formative for many, taken in sometimes with mother's milk and continuously fed through culture, law, politics, economics and religion. Yes, religion. I know as a white Christian pastor and activist, I need to step it up, and confront this menace both within Christianity, as well as in society. A white God, a white Jesus, and a white church will never be allies in the struggle against white supremacy; they will, at best, be unconscious enablers. As sociologist of religion Dr. Cheryl Townsend Gilkes notes in her chapter ""Still the Most Segregated Hour, """"Religion is a motive force in the construction of the United States as a racialized society."" If a white person would be a faith ally in the struggle against white supremacy, it is crucial to look inward at religion and, frankly, change that, while at the same time attending carefully to those who are being crushed. Don't blithely assume you can help. This is where liberation theology can be helpful. Liberation theology always starts with contextual analysis, as Mary Potter Engel and I write in Lift Every Voice: Constructing Christian Theologies from the Underside. Let's start from the realization that white supremacy IS the context of the U.S., that it is a long-standing system of vast exploitation and immorality as Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote so powerfully in The Atlantic as ""The Case for Reparations."" ""Two hundred fifty years of slavery. Ninety years of Jin Crow. Sixty years of separate but equal. Thirty-five years of racist housing policy."" This, this is why white supremacy is wicked. Wickedness is more than sin and evil. It is, in fact, the malignancy of sin and evil combining and reinforcing each other, as Mary Potter Engel put it so well in our book: Evil and sin together may be called ""wickedness,"" the complex condition of the lack of right relation in the world in which we live naturally, socially, and individually. Evil is the systems created by centuries of oppression, sin is the ""free and discrete acts...that create or reinforce these structures of oppression."" Structures. Systems. White Christian complicity. Take those as a given. Then, move outside theology to get more help. Liberation theologies often use social science as a lever in rooting out dominance in traditional theologies and finding ways to make practical common cause in liberation struggles. Sociologists have described what they call wicked problems. These are problems that are driven by a vast number of interconnected forces that sustain and grow them. Wicked problems are characteristically difficult either to recognize or to solve. Horst Rittel, one of the first to formalize a theory of wicked problems, cites ten characteristics of these complicated social issues, some of which stand out as particularly applicable to white supremacy. Wicked problems ""have no definitive formulation"" as they have different patterns in different locations. White supremacy in Chicago, IL, for example, has important differences in terms of historical roots, as well as economic and political structures than the white supremacy of let's say, Charleston, South Carolina. Effective activists know this. They use this. White supremacy is a ""wicked problem"" because it ""bleeds."" That means there are no boundaries to its causes or its effects. Instead, white supremacy permeates education, law, law enforcement, economics, politics, religion and, broadly speaking, culture. Sexism, racism, homophobia, trans-phobia, Islamophobia and classism all need examination and action. One telling example: a ""celebration"" of an African American woman athlete such as Serena Williams devolves into a discussion of her arms or her general body shape, engaging in body shaming and reinforcing racist attitudes toward African American women. The model of Wicked Problems holds that those who would engage them must ""take responsibility"" for the consequences of their interventions. This is a big one for faith activists. Your good intentions don't, and I intend this in a theological sense, mean a damn. Don't just muck in. Study, care, consultation and coordination are a big part of being effective in dealing with even a part of wicked problems. It is also important to realize there is no ""solving"" wicked problems, there is only creativity that can tackle its many manifestations, subvert and mitigate their most destructive effects and engage creative alternatives. #BlackLivesMatter has rightly garnered respect and support from white faith organizers because of its specificity, creativity, analytical wisdom and strong actions. But it is crucial that white people of faith engage our fellow white citizens, Christian and non-Christian and do a lot of work. If you have read this far into this post, you already likely believe that. Here are some examples: Showing Up for Racial Justice is a ""national network of groups and individuals organizing white people for racial justice. Through community organizing, mobilizing and education, SURJ moves white people to act as part of a multi-racial majority for justice with passion and accountability."" SURJ was founded in 2009. It is telling that in January of 2015, there were only 12 chapters. Today there are 140, and 14 working groups such as SURJ Faith and SURJ Families. There are others, of course, such as GroundWork. This group, out of Wisconsin, organizes white people ""against racism and white privilege and for racial justice and equity in our daily lives from the heart, with dignity, and integrity."" It is collaborative and practical. Chicago Theological Seminary where I work, has been intensely focusing on racism and white privilege for several years. Many other seminaries have as well. Individual churches are making such commitments, such as All Saints Church in Pasadena. There are many others. This is all good, but like in Bradbury's novel, I see the wickedness of white supremacy as a storm rising in 2016, threatening and coming towards us. White supremacy is dangerously growing. There are crackles and flashes of astonishingly virulent hate and fear. We will need all the faith confidence we can muster against the ""principalities and powers"" (Romans 8:38-39). There is good news. I believe no matter how powerful wicked systems can be, they are no match for grace shared in community and the love of God and neighbor.

Lawrence could relate, kind of. As a younger woman, she explained, she'd scored a modeling gig for risqué teen clothier Abercrombie and Fitch. Yet her photos never saw the dim light of the retailer's mall stores. ""I didn’t know why,"" Lawrence began. ""My agent wrote and asked why. And they literally only responded with the photos."" ""Their whole idea was like, 'We want real people,'"" she said, explaining how the shoot took place on a beach where the models were asked to toss around a football. ""The other models were, like, playing football in a pretty way. Not me! In all of the photos I’ve got a red face, covered in sweat, my nostrils are flared, like Aagh!"" she said, demonstrating. ""At one point, a girl yelled, 'Get her away from me,'"" Lawrence added.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/of-female-action-figures_b_8902946,1/1/2016,"rabbi jonah c. steinberg, ph.d.",Of Female Action Figures," ""For I brought you out of the land of Egypt, and from the house of slavery I redeemed you, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam."" (Micah 6:4) Parts of the Internet erupted in a furor this holiday season when it transpired that a boxed set of action figures depicting characters from Star Wars: The Force Awakens omitted a figurine of Rey, the female lead of the film, the series' new hero. And no, not diminutive 'heroine,' à la Princess Leia - and à la Miriam in our Torah, who never quite emerges from the shadow of the brother she saves in our reading this week - but 'hero,' the character whose journey and development constitute the essential arc of the story. Rey gets more screen time than the new swashbuckling pilot, Poe Dameron, more than the old swashbuckling pilot, Han Solo (in fact, she gives Harrison Ford's character a good run for his swashbuckling, and his piloting), and on Rey's account the new Star Wars movie even arguably passes the Bechdel Test: she and another female character with a name have at least parts of a conversation with one another that are not about a man. (And yes, Star Wars is featuring in my message of Torah for a second week running. What can I say? I am a child of the original, 1976 film.) Toward the end of the biblical book of Genesis, which we finished reading last week, we find a list of ""all those of Jacob's household who came into Egypt, seventy persons."" Notably, if not improbably, the count consists entirely of men, with one exception, in the family of Asher, where we find ""...and Serach, their sister."" So, if the toy company judged that a female action figure would keep its play set from flying off the shelves, it was granting present-day children one seventieth less credit in that regard than our Bible gave ancient Israelites. Serach appears once more in the Torah, much later on, in the book of Numbers, when Moses conducts a census of the Israelites in the wilderness, and again, in a sole mention of a female name, we read, ""...and the name of the daughter of Asher was Serach."" On that basis, our ancient sages proposed that Serach, the daughter of Asher, lived all the way through all the generations of Israel's captivity, through the Exodus and the generation of desert wandering, and even - why not? - into the time of King David, some four hundred and fifty years later. ""I completed the minyan of Israel in Egypt,"" Serach declares, in a refreshing use of the traditional term for a stipulated number, when she calls out to David's military chief of staff, Yoav, according to the rabbinic elaboration of a story in the Second book of Samuel, taking Yoav by surprise as the peace-making ""wise woman"" of a city in the hill country of Ephraim that he has somewhat wantonly besieged. How did Moses know where Joseph's bones were buried, so as to fulfill the promise of carrying his remains out of Egypt? Serach told him. She had been there when Joseph died. On what basis did the Israelites finally accept Moses in the story we read this week? According to our rabbis, Serach kept a ""secret of redemption"" passed through her family from the time of God's promise to Abraham, and she waited for generations for someone to appear and pronounce the secret words. In fact, just about every time a helpful and mysterious female figure appears in scripture or is required by legend, one can count on our ancient rabbis to consider Serach the daughter of Asher a likely suspect. For more than two decades now, I have kept a file-folder titled ""The S Files,"" and I suspect I have not finished adding Serach-tales from traditional sources to it. The Talmud and the mystical Zohar say that Serach, like the Prophet Elijah, ""entered the Garden of Eden without tasting death"" - which I consider should make Serach a more ready candidate than Miriam for having a special cup in her name on the Passover Seder table along with Elijah's. I get a bit uneasy when a new Miriam-song is added to the traditional Elijah-one - after all, we know where Miriam is buried, as far as scripture is concerned, so while Miriam may ""dance with us"" again when the dead are resurrected, Serach, according to the most venerable sources, is still very much around and available to join Elijah at Seders, and in times of need. Now there's an unsung secret of redemption. I have even added my own exegetical conjecture to the file, over time. When Joshua, Moses' student and successor, passes away, he is buried in the city of his elder years, a place he requests as an old man, after his valedictory speech to the people, a town called Timnat-Serach in the hill country of Ephraim. (Joshua 19:50, 24:30) I have not yet found any ancient source that makes a point of this, but if you were Joshua - one of two men to have lived all the way through the Exodus and into the Promised Land - would you not wish to hang out, in your retirement, with someone who had seen it all as well? I picture Joshua and the even older Serach sitting on a hillside in Ephraim, musing together about young people and what's becoming of the land. The next four years will change America forever.

On the other hand, there is actually something discouraging in so much getting heaped on one rare female personage. An unnamed ""wise woman?"" Oh, that must be Serach - as though there could be no other. Now, what to make, exegetically, of the fact that the figurine of BB-8, the Star Wars franchise's adorable new robot, comes packaged under the plastic of Rey's container, rather than with Poe Dameron, the male character who actually brings the droid into the story? It seems all to be about whom we consider capable of standing in her or his own right as an action figure - a timeless and worthy spiritual goal.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/in-2016-bernie-sanders-defeat-clinton-trump_b_8902400,1/1/2016,h. a. goodman,"In 2016, Bernie Sanders Will Defeat Clinton and Dominate Trump to Become President","On November 8, 2016 Bernie Sanders will achieve a dominant victory over Donald Trump. Already, Sanders defeats Trump in the polls by a wider margin than Hillary Clinton, as illustrated in a December 22, 2015 Hill article titled ""In blockbuster poll, Sanders destroys Trump by 13 points"": Stop the presses! According to a new poll by Quinnipiac University on Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) destroys Republican candidate Donald Trump in a general election by 13 percentage points. In this new poll, Sanders has 51 percent to Trump's 38 percent. If this margin held in a general election, Democrats would almost certainly regain control of the United States Senate and very possibly the House of Representatives. It is noteworthy that in this Quinnipiac poll, Sanders runs so much stronger than Clinton against Trump... In the December 22 poll, Bernie Sanders defeats Trump by 13 points, while Clinton beats Trump by 7 points. There are numerous reasons Bernie Sanders will achieve this dominant victory over a billionaire xenophobe who panders to the fears and base passions of conservatives. First, Bernie Sanders warns against the influence of money and power in politics, and ""welcomes the hatred"" of the billionaire class that Trump personifies. Sanders won the Congressional Award from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, while Trump insulted Vietnam Veteran and former POW John McCain. There are a great many other reasons that I'll highlight in the future, when Sanders becomes the Democratic nominee. Overall, Bernie Sanders genuinely cares about ending wealth inequality and perpetual wars, while Trump is a buffoon who's spent most of his time making headlines for outrageous statements. Most importantly, Sanders is the antithesis of Trump and gives voters a stark contrast in choice; not so with Hillary. POLITICO writes that Clinton ""received donations from both him and son Donald Trump Jr. on separate occasions in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2007, according to state and federal disclosure records."" You'll never get a Clinton supporter to address these donations, or why Trump once felt it would be advantageous to become one of Clinton's donors. Trump also gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, in either a moment of pure altruism, or another campaign donation akin to Clinton's foreign donor scandal. While the recent Quinnipiac poll shows Clinton defeating Trump, the underlying data shows that generally, Americans don't trust the former Secretary of State. 59 percent of American voters believe Clinton is ""not honest and trustworthy."" 55 percent of American voters say ""she does not share their values."" 50 percent of American voters feel Clinton ""does not care about their needs and problems."" Like every other poll in 2008 and 2015 illustrating Clinton's wide lead over a challenger, voters say they'll vote for a candidate they don't trust, or feel doesn't care about their problems. If you view polls as gospel and place a premium on recent polls, then Quinnipiac also states 72 percent of Independents don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy. This is a dangerous number for Democrats since 43 percent of Americans according to Gallup are independent. Also, 49 percent (compared to 44 percent) of American women don't view Clinton as honest or trustworthy, while over 62% of voters ages 35-64 don't find Clinton honest or trustworthy. From ages 18 to over 65, there was no age group that found Clinton honest or trustworthy, and 59 percent of Americans age 18-34 don't find Clinton to be honest or trustworthy. 51 percent of registered voters have an unfavorable view of Clinton (compared to 43 percent), while Bernie Sanders has a positive net favorability of 9 points. Again, this Quinnipiac poll is from December 22, 2015. Most polls, like this one, contradict their findings; Americans will never vote for a candidate they don't like and don't trust, linked to an FBI investigation. On December 18, 2007 Gallup stated that Clinton Maintains Large Lead Over Obama Nationally. It never lasted, and I explain why Clinton is unelectable due to negative favorability ratings in this YouTube segment. Bernie Sanders will win the Democratic nomination because if Clinton was ever going to win, it would have been in 2008, not during an investigation of her emails by the FBI. On December 11, POLITICO explained why the FBI's investigation is just getting started in a piece titled ""State Department can't find emails of top Clinton IT staffer"": The FBI has taken possession of Bryan Pagliano's computer system... Clinton had personally paid Pagliano to maintain her home-made server, which is also currently in the FBI's possession. The agency has been investigating whether classified material was ever put at risk because she used her own server instead of the standard State email system. The State Department has designated about 1,000 of her emails as classified documents, which would never have been allowed on such a private system. Considering that hackers from various countries already tried to access Clinton's server, Pagliano pleaded the Fifth, and two computer systems are in the FBI's custody, this story won't end before Election Day. As for the belief that African American voters and other non-white Democrats will overwhelmingly vote for Clinton in South Carolina and throughout the South, people aren't poll numbers. A Daily Beast article on December 29, 2015 titled ""Hillary Clinton's Tone-Deaf Racial Pandering"" explains why poll numbers might not equate to votes: Hillary Clinton's minority outreach over the last week has rekindled the idea that she is a candidate who is out of touch, particularly when it comes to minorities. To many of us, her campaign's insistence that she is an abuela for Latinos and the changing of her Twitter logo to represent Kwanzaa came across as pandering at its worst... If more of Clinton's outreach attempts seem tone deaf or overly reliant on her previous successes than her present rapport with today's voters, it will be difficult for her to shake the image of being out of touch. It's important to also note that Clinton's attempt at pandering comes months after progressive groups pressured her to stop taking money from prison lobbyists. The Intercept writes ""As immigration and incarceration issues become central to the 2016 presidential campaign, lobbyists for two major prison companies are serving as top fundraisers for Hillary Clinton."" Finally, I find it bizarre that certain people still brand me as a Paul supporter, even though I'm a lifelong Democrat against perpetual war (I only wrote the piece because Obama had sent more Americans back to the Middle East and I'm vehemently opposed to more Americans dying in quagmires), and I now view the Paul article last year as a mistake. I'm also only voting for Bernie Sanders. Conversely, Hillary Clinton views Iraq as a ""mistake,"" yet her supporters have no problem seeing the former New York Senator as president. The Iraq war destabilized the Middle East, I simply angered fellow progressives. If you hear any wild conspiracy theories about me, or ridiculous accusations, simply send my detractors this YouTube segment. As for why I'm writing non-stop about Bernie Sanders, nothing epitomizes my desire to see Sanders as the Democratic nominee and president than this POLITIFACT article titled ""Yes, Clinton used the Bush administration line"": ""President Bush and Dick Cheney insisted there was a connection. Senator Clinton on the floor of the Senate suggested that there was such a connection,"" Obama said in an interview on MSNBC's Hardball on March 11, 2008. In that speech, Clinton explained her reasoning... ""He [Saddam] has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al-Qaida members..."" Sanders opposed Iraq and foreshadowed its tragic consequences, going against establishment Democrats and neoconservative Republicans; both would become even more intertwined with a Clinton presidency. In contrast, Clinton echoed Bush and Cheney talking points about al Qaeda in Saddam's Iraq. If you vote for anyone other than Bernie Sanders in 2016, you're simply not a progressive, especially knowing that Trump is a racist xenophobe and Clinton utilized the same tactics against Obama in 2008. You're also voting for endless wars with Trump or Clinton, while Bernie Sanders says ""I'll be dammed"" to more quagmires. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/minimum-wage-increase_n_6110c888e4b0ed63e6574bb2,1/1/2016,reuters,New Year Brings Minimum Wage Hikes For Americans In 14 States,"CHICAGO, Jan 1 (Reuters) - As the United States marks more than six years without an increase in the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, 14 states and several cities are moving forward with their own increases, with most set to start taking effect on Friday. California and Massachusetts are highest among the states, both increasing from $9 to $10 an hour, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures. At the low end is Arkansas, where the minimum wage is increasing from $7.50 to $8. The smallest increase, a nickel, comes in South Dakota, where the hourly minimum is now $8.55. The increases come in the wake of a series of ""living wage"" protests across the country, including a November campaign in which thousands of protesters in 270 cities marched in support of a $15-an-hour minimum wage and union rights for fast food workers. Food service workers make up the largest group of minimum-wage earners, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With Friday's increases, the new average minimum wage across the 14 affected states rises from $8.50 an hour to just over $9. Several cities are going even higher.

California and Massachusetts are highest among the states, both increasing from $9 to $10 an hour, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures. At the low end is Arkansas, where the minimum wage is increasing from $7.50 to $8. The smallest increase, a nickel, comes in South Dakota, where the hourly minimum is now $8.55. The increases come in the wake of a series of ""living wage"" protests across the country, including a November campaign in which thousands of protesters in 270 cities marched in support of a $15-an-hour minimum wage and union rights for fast food workers. Food service workers make up the largest group of minimum-wage earners, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With Friday's increases, the new average minimum wage across the 14 affected states rises from $8.50 an hour to just over $9. Several cities are going even higher. Seattle is setting a sliding hourly minimum between $10.50 and $13 on Jan. 1, and Los Angeles and San Francisco are enacting similar increases in July, en route to $15 an hour phased in over six years. Backers say a higher minimum wage helps combat poverty, but opponents worry about the potential impact on employment and company profits.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/virginia-highly-successful-anti-tax-lobby_b_8902804,1/1/2016,jared bernstein,"Yes, Virginia... There Is an Aggressive and Highly Successful Anti-Tax Lobby","The Wall Street Journal ran an interesting piece yesterday morning showing how the effective tax rate -- taxes as a share of income -- spiked up significantly in 2013 for the wealthiest taxpayers due to an increase in the tax rate on capital gains. This is important information and the piece appropriately highlights how the higher rate sharply increased the tax liability of the richest 400 taxpayers, whose effective rate went from 16.7 percent in 2012 to 22.9 percent in 2013. That's the highest effective rate paid by this top group since 2002, though it's still a 7 percentage point decline from the 29.9 percent rate that prevailed in 1995. Had these wealthy taxpayers faced that rate, their liability would have been $7.5 billion higher. For readers who also read the recent New York Times piece on the ""income defense industry"" of the wealthy-the extensive anti-tax infrastructure they've built up over the years to reduce their tax liabilities-this WSJ piece may have sown some confusion. For example, the Journal quotes a conservative commentator complaining about ""the mistaken narrative... that... high income Americans have used a combination of aggressive tax planning, loopholes and political influence to lower their tax burdens to unconscionably low levels."" So who's right? Does there really exist an industry of deeply funded anti-tax lobbyists whose sole purpose is to protect the holdings of their clients? Absolutely -- far from ""mistaken,"" that narrative is exactly right. Do they win every fight? Nope, and they lost the one that led the capital gains rate to go up in 2013. But to suggest that this one change alters the fundamental landscape of our tax avoidance problem would be an egregious overstatement. First off, as both the NYT and WSJ pieces stress, pushing for lower rates is but one part of the tax avoidance agenda. It's far more effective to get your income out of the tax base. As Gabriel Zucman, whose recent work on tax havens provides essential data for this debate, puts it in the WSJ piece, ""For billionaires, a lot of income never shows up on tax returns."" -- Zucman finds that the share of U.S. foreign profits booked in tax havens has grown from about 20 percent in the 1980s to 50 percent now. -- As I point out here, a group of tax analysts show in a forthcoming paper that the share of corporate stock held in taxable household accounts has fallen from around 80 percent in the mid-1960s to about 25 percent now, meaning most such stock is now untaxed or held in tax-favored vehicles, like individual retirement accounts. -- Business income ""passed through"" to the individual level is the single largest source of the ""tax gap"" (the difference between what people owe and what they pay; it amounts to over $300 billion/year). Sole proprietors, e.g., have been found to report less than half of their income to the IRS. One reason people pass through business income to the personal side of the code is to take advantage of the differential in top income tax rates, about 40 percent, and capital gains, which are now about 24 percent. That's still a very important form of tax avoidance, but the WSJ is certainly right to point out that the current cap gains rate is a lot higher than the 15 percent rate that previously prevailed. Finally, it should be lost on no one that if the tax suppression lobby can't get everything they want in lower rates or wider loopholes, they've got a new strategy that's proving to be alarmingly effective: defunding the IRS. Since 2010, the agency's budget is down 18 percent in real dollars; enforcement staffing is down by 20 percent. These cuts support the tax gap: Treasury estimates that each additional $1 spent on IRS enforcement yields $6 of additional revenue. The next four years will change America forever.

But that doesn't make them any less real and, unfortunately, they win a lot more of these fights than they lose.

Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports that the shooter fled the scene. Authorities apprehended a suspect on a nearby street shortly after the shooting, but are continuing a manhunt. Haaretz says that Israeli police have identified the suspect as a 29-year-old Palestinian citizen of Israel from the Northern Israeli town of Arara. He stole the gun used in the shooting from his father, who works in security. The suspect’s father contacted authorities after noticing the weapon was missing. There is a “growing consensus among security officials,” according to Haaretz, that the shooting, which took place on Dizengoff Street, a café-filled main street, was a terror attack. Nati Shakked, owner of Simta bar, which was attacked, told Reuters that the assailant had waited on a bench outside before taking a machine gun out of a bag and ""shooting in every direction."" A video captured the graphic moment the attacker opened fire. Lily, an owner of a nearby beauty salon who was in the bar at the time, told HuffPost that when she realized it was a shooting, she dropped to the ground and hid under the bar. Another woman who was in the bar told reporters of Israel's Channel 2 that she and seven others hid in a storage closet in the basement of a bar during the attack, ""lying down"" on the door to keep it from being penetrated.

Erdogan wants to change the Turkish constitution to turn the ceremonial role of president into that of a chief executive, a Turkish version of the system in the United States, France or Russia. Asked on his return from a visit to Saudi Arabia late on Thursday whether an executive presidential system was possible while maintaining the unitary structure of the state, he said: ""There are already examples in the world. You can see it when you look at Hitler's Germany. ""There are later examples in various other countries,"" he told reporters, according to a recording broadcast by the Dogan news agency. The ruling AK Party, founded by Erdogan, has put a new constitution at the heart of its agenda after winning back a majority in a November parliamentary election. It agreed with the main opposition CHP on Wednesday to revive efforts to forge a new constitution. Opposition parties agree on the need to change the constitution, drawn up after a 1980 coup and still bearing the stamp of its military authors, but do not back the presidential system envisaged by Erdogan, fearing it will consolidate too much power in the hands of an authoritarian leader.

As a result, RaiseAChild Founder and CEO, Rich Valenza, takes us behind the scenes of a facility that has served thousands of foster children, but seen by few adults. Tucked away, at an address that you won’t likely find on your GPS, is a facility that functions as the last resort for foster children in Los Angeles County. Each night, starting at about 6:30 p.m., the place begins to buzz. Social workers pull up in reserved parking spots right in front of the building. I watch as they unload their cars of children of all sizes, shapes and colors. Some workers enter the automated doors carrying babies, or holding the hands of young sibling groups. Others walk behind teenagers who don’t need help with the routine they know all too well. Regardless of the age of these children, they all have unfortunate similarities. Each child is likely to have experienced serious episodes of neglect or abuse. Fear, bewilderment, and anxiety are easy to read on each of their faces. Everyone of these children have been delivered to this facility because there are not enough foster parents in Los Angeles County to take them. Not even for one night. Upon arrival, all foster children are ushered down a long sterile hallway and processed through a medical clinic for an initial screening. From there, their social workers separate the children according to their age. Babies to 11-year-olds are delivered behind a secured blue metal door with a large sign that reads “Children’s Welcome Center.” It’s a large room that echoes from linoleum floors and sparse furnishing. By 9:30 each night, it is “lights out” as cribs and folded cots have been rolled out from the storage closet and lined up across the floor. Because sound carries across this room, one restless baby can easily wake all of the other children. But usually these children sleep soundly as this safe space likely provides the first sense of security in their lives for some time. Foster teens are walked to a different end of the facility and check in at a security guard’s station near an overhead sign that reads “Youth Welcome Center.” But this hardly seems like a welcoming place when each teen is then screened more carefully to insure that drugs, alcohol and weapons don’t find their way in. On the cold December night that I visited the Children’s Welcome Center, there were five children between the ages of one and nine expected to spend the night. The months of November and December, I am told, turn out smaller numbers of younger children to this Welcome Center because the holiday season generally generates more compassion for younger foster children. But starting in January, the nightly numbers of children begin to climb again. Typically, March and October are peak months with the number of children 11 and under rising to 20 or more. Teens in the foster system are not as lucky. It is exponentially more difficult to find foster homes willing to take in a teen. Each night up to 25 foster teens enter in the Youth Welcome Center for a hot meal, a fresh change of clothes, a clean shower and safe place to sleep. There are about fifteen “regulars” at various ages between 18 and 20 that show up at the door most every night. During the day these “regulars” fend for themselves on the streets of downtown Los Angeles but return at night to the one staple thing in their lives. “We have an unlocked policy here at the Youth Welcome Center,” said Valerie Coleman-Brown, a seasoned Youth Supervisor with a gentle manner. “At any time during the night, these teens are free to leave and return. We do our best to counsel them to stay safe and inside with us. We share stories of the streets that are so truthfully bad that we hope it changes their minds about walking out the doors. Sometimes it works. Recently, we developed a detailed form and ask them to complete and sign it. The form even asks them to describe their clothing and identifying marks all in an effort to really make the teens stop and think about risk and the decisions they make.” The main room of the Youth Welcome Center is cavernous and noisy from a television that is turned up too high. Three overstuffed naugahyde couches are pushed to the side to make room for the night’s roll out of cots. I am introduced to Bryana, a foster youth with a pure innocence about her. She agrees to sit with me for an interview. I start nervously by saying that she doesn’t have to answer any of my questions that she doesn’t want to. She acknowledges softly. “How long have you been in foster care,” I ask. “Since I was 13,” Bryana answers. “And how old are you now?” “I’m 15,” she said shyly. “My son is 15 and I have a daughter that is 14,” I offer in hopes of breaking the ice. “I adopted them from the county.” Suddenly, she spoke up. “It would be a big help if more parents would come in, not just for me, but for a lot of other kids that don’t have anywhere else to go. There are kids that have been here for like five weeks."" “And how long have you been here,” I ask. “Five weeks. No school. No nothing. I’m just here waiting.” “Let me ask you,” I said. “What would be your ideal home? Who would you hope to go with?"" She paused and looked straight in my eyes and answered, “My mom.” I flush with embarrassment for asking the question. “But really,” she covers my awkwardness. “I would like any house. Any parents with brothers or sisters. It doesn’t matter to me.” “May I ask about your mom,” I ask. “How is she?” “She’s fine,” Bryanna answered and offered nothing more. “Do you have brothers or sisters?"" “I have two brothers,” she said. “They were in the foster care system when they were babies. Me too. Eventually, we all got out of foster care. But then I got put back in when I was 13.” I was at a loss of words. “Is there anything else you want to add?” “Well, DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) is really good. I’ve been here so long that now they are like my family.” As I thanked Bryanna, I was struck by her last statement. This 15 year-old taught me a lesson. She opened my eyes. For in that moment, I realized that while I was judging the facility by its cold linoleum floors and institutional florescent lighting, I was totally missing what the foster children recognize and value as the true heart of the facility. It’s not the building structure, but it is the people who work there. That heart is all of the staff that show up night after night to help and care for these kids. I pass through another doorway. I met four women whose sole job is to work the phones throughout their entire eight hour shift. They are members of the Accelerated Placement Team and each of them log thousands of calls a week. Their shared purpose is to find available foster homes and beds for the 35,000 children in the foster system of Los Angeles County. “Wow, I am impressed how dressed up everybody is here,” I say. “Does this happen all the time?” “Actually, tonight is a casual day,” says Princess Rojas with a laugh and big smile. “Whatever movie you saw with frumpy social workers,” comments Rhonda Towles, “that is definitely not our group!” “So you are here to interview for a gay newspaper,” asked Michelle Fenison. I’m surprised by the directness of the question and stumble a bit on my reply. “Um, yes. I’m writing an article for the Huffington Post Gay Voices section.” “Well good,” Marocka Covington said. “Cause we have some things we would like to say to the LGBT community.” “Ok,” I say, unsure of where this is going. Marocka starts. “We understand that many foster youth who may self-identify as LGBT or questioning, feel that they aren’t accepted in some foster families and foster homes. That’s why we want to make sure we have a good representation from every community. Even if we have a good home for a foster youth, some of these teens are asking for a match with a parent or parents that mirrors their own demographic. We have more transgender children coming forward because society is changing. That is the next challenge for us, even though we have made in-roads in the gay community, we are not yet seeing that we have yet made that progress in the transgender community.” “We need a lot of help, especially from the transgender community,” Rhonda says. “It would be nice to have more resources for our transgender youth. We want more accepting foster homes. We find that the LGBT community is more accepting of children of all kinds.” “Some people think that teens in foster care are trouble,” said Marocka. “Truth is that many times, the foster kids are not really angry at their foster parents -- they are angry at the world for their predicament. But the biggest benefit to adopting from foster care is that you have these wonderful children to will love you for the rest of your life.” “You know,” I say, “several transgender people have expressed their concerns that they fear they won’t be permitted to foster and adopt.” “Well, they need to be reminded that there is a California law that they be accepted,” Marocka says forcefully. “So please let the transgender community know that they are welcomed and we are here to bring children to them, if they want them. Because transgender and gay people can love and care for children like anyone else."" “In my experience,” Marocka continues, “over 40 years now, I’ve seen successes in all kinds of family structures. On the flip side, we have many different kinds of children that really need to know that there are parents and homes out there that will that them and care for them. I tell you, these LGBT children are not aware that there are good foster parents out there that want them. Even when these children arrive here, many aren’t sure if we are going to accept them. They are very subtle about how they want to come out to us.” “I can understand that,” I answer. “Plus, I’ve heard of many instances when foster children who are questioning their own sexuality do come out to some foster parents, it creates a lot of havoc for themselves. As a result, 40% of homeless youth in Los Angeles identify as LGBT.” The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-help-friends-deali_b_8892340,1/1/2016,lev raphael,How to Help Friends In a Shame Spiral,"We've all felt the power of shame. We feel exposed, totally flawed, and hopeless to do anything about it. Shame can be so devastating that all we want to do is hide.  And watching a friend suffer a shame experience or listening to a friend share how ashamed they feel about a failure, a broken relationship, or a terrible mistake they've made can trigger shame in us, too. That's one of the paradoxes of shame: it's contagious. The immense power of shame can make us try to ward it off by saying the wrong things.  If a friend tells you she feels ugly, don't say, ""But you're so beautiful!"" If a friend says they feel like a failure, don't tally their successes for them. If a friend shares a humiliating mistake, don't counter with all the right choices they've made. When your friends are suffering, contradicting them isn't helpful, even if you mean well. What may seem to you like being helpful can have feel like emotional bullying or obtuseness. That sort of response can come across as denying what your friends are feeling, not understanding the depth of their misery, and perhaps even not caring enough. Be warm, be sympathetic, listen, empathize, ask how you can help. Don't rush to deny what they're feeling, or turn into a mindless cheerleader. That's never the most helpful move. It's harder to experience someone's shame along with them than it is to rush to try and ""fix it"" -- but the first option is the best one. Maybe they'll want a hug, maybe not. Listening and understanding without judgment or trying to make it go away is enough.

This has struck me as odd and incongruous from the very beginning -- it would be like people who are starving and scrounging for their next meal backing Chris Christie, or Marlon Brando (in his later years). Donald Trump has nothing in common with the overwhelmed, alienated, angry and forgotten. He may have the skill to speak to them as though he is sympatico, but he isn't. He has his every need -- and whim -- attended to immediately. He is the antithesis of alienated -- he is connected to power in every aspect of his life. Forgotten? He gets attention that makes Beyonce and Caitlyn Jenner positively scream with envy. And angry? That's pure performance art. Donald Trump isn't angry. He just knows how to play into that vein of real anger many people have.  So I have been baffled from Day One why Trump has the loyalty of so many people with whom he shares nothing more than (possibly) human DNA. They love a guy who has looked down on their ilk his entire life, and will continue to once this street fair ends in either his demise or his election. The raving, unfiltered yet practiced, almost joy-filled hatred of Donald Trump is regarded as political genius and evidently in 2016, as a requirement for national leadership. The pundits who laughed him off in June and took him seriously in September and now speak of the very possible reality of nominee Trump or president Trump, keep going back to the ""touch the chord"" chorus. Well, punditry, I am white. I am older. I am overwhelmed. I feel forgotten often, and alienated even more often. And there are times I allow myself to be overcome by anger at the injustice and unfairness and despair I see in the world, and sometimes in my life. I see the millions of unemployed and underemployed older people struggling to be heard and to feel relevant. Their government may have abandoned them, but more so, the corporate world, the tech world that gives new meaning to the old 1960s phrase ""Don't trust anyone over 30"" has abandoned them, made them feel that their voices, energy, talents and wisdom don't matter. But I have never fallen prey to Trumpism. I can't understand why a multibillionaire with a 1980s backroom Wall Street vocabulary and attitude towards women and minorities is the savior of the angry and the alienated. No one can explain to me how this guy will rid his hapless and deluded followers from their alienation and anger. By marginalizing those already on the margins? That won't create jobs for the 55-year-old who had been unemployed for three years. That won't make Google or Yahoo or Amazon want to retrain tens of thousands of older people they ""sort of"" want to help but regard as something out of a museum.  Vilifying the weak and hopeless has never made society better, and has at best, only momentarily made the disaffected and alienated feel better. So what's the end game? When I am feeling overwhelmed, alienated, forgotten and angry -- and I do as an older white man who doesn't feel I am listened to or valued for the considerable talents I have -- I don't turn to an arrogant, obscene rich guy for solace. I try to improve my situation as best I can by using what skills I have, and take my solace in knowing that blaming everyone darker, less fluent in English and more estrogen-endowed than I is a pathetic way to live.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-spin-instructor-taught-me-about-my-body_b_8870738,1/1/2016,rachel brehm,5 Things My Substitute Spin Instructor Taught Me About My Body,"Don't judge a blog by its title -- it's not what you think. My Wednesday morning spin class was taught by a substitute instructor today. In the place of my usual wonderful teacher was one of those drill sergeant-y types that thinks the louder the music is (and the louder he yells) the harder you will work. While it's true that the right music can evoke feeling, motivation, and inspiration -- music that loud just became noise. And the nonsense that spilled out of his mouth became even louder noise. Although his style and technique might work for many people, it did not work for me. These are the things that he said during the 50-minute class, and this is what it taught me about my body.1. What my instructor said: ""I will make you the best looking person at your holiday table,"" he bragged. (What I heard) Remember those sad days where your life goal was to be the smallest, best looking person at the holiday table? Yeah, I do. It sucked. Life was boring, rigid, and unadventurous. Be thankful that you have morphed into a more authentic person with other interests besides your body.2. What my instructor said: ""You've never met an instructor as effective at weight loss as me,"" he assured. (What I heard) You didn't show up here for me, you're here for yourself. You're here to feel strong, healthy, and because you like the way exercising makes you feel. The goal is not weight loss, and it never will be. 3. What my instructor said: ""I've lost 47 pounds from working out just like this,"" he informed. (What I heard) Don't let weight loss be a guide for your exercise, or for your life. Show up here because you want to, and move your body because it feels good. Challenge yourself with exercises that you enjoy, but remember to listen to your body. Oh and one more thing, sorry I've stolen your zen spinning experience and filled it with nonsense talk about how I can help you lose weight.4. What my instructor said: ""I'm teaching another spin class tonight at 7:30, I challenge everyone to take both classes,"" he urged. (What I heard) You're working out really hard right now. I challenge you to listen to your body, and do what makes you feel good. If you have the energy and desire to work out again later, go for it. If you feel that you need the time to rest and recover, go for it. If you have other interests or commitments like spending time with your family or doing some last minute holiday shopping, go for it. It's all about listening to your body and doing what's best for you. You do you.5. What my instructor said: ""I challenge you to think outside of the box,"" he barked. (What I heard) I know that this holiday season creates the opportunity for family gatherings, get-togethers with friends, office parties, and celebrations. Take this time to savor the traditions, memories, friendships, festivities, and delicious food. The holiday season also creates a lot of chatter about how much food we've consumed, New Year's resolutions, and dieting plans. Try to ignore the conventional aspirations that are pushed upon us by the media, by friends, and by family. Talking about weight loss resolutions and dieting is tired and passé. I challenge you to think outside of the box about what the New Year means to you. I challenge you to move the focus away from your body, and onto the things that make you happy. Although the spin instructor's intentions were to push me beyond my limit and give me a ""great"" workout that ultimately leads to weight loss, his words had the opposite effect on me. He reminded me of all the work I have done to move away from mainstream ideas about exercise, food, and weight loss. He reminded me of all the reasons why I love working out, and he reminded me that none of those reasons include weight loss. He made the absence of my regular instructor (the one who focuses on safe warmups, individual challenges, listening to your body, and preventing injuries) sorely missed -- and he taught me to drown out the noise of weight loss talk, let the blurry music take me to my zen place, and listen to my body's needs despite the loud commands. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/simple-ways-to-be-happier_b_8887702,1/1/2016,jennifer connolly,Simple Ways To Be Happier In 2016," Do you make New Year resolutions? I don't bother because they usually fall off my radar by mid January. Starting the year with failure is not my goal. Here are 25 simple things I will incorporate into my days in 2016. I don't need to do each one, everyday, to be moving toward my goal. Here's how I intend to improve myself, my life and my happiness in 2016. 1~ Not check into my email or social media before 9 a.m. 2~ Use my 5 Minute Gratitude Journal to remember the blessings in my life. Gratitude creates happiness and happiness is my goal. 3~ Focus on today. Reliving the past and anticipating the future wastes my present. 4~ Let go of my need to convince others of my opinion. 5~ Pay closer attention to my body's signals. If I feel a knot in my stomach, it means I'm making a bad choice. 6~ Stop overcommitting my time and simplify my life. 7~ Get out in nature everyday to connect with the majesty around me. 8~ Become more aware of the negative messages that creep into my self-talk, and change them. 9~ Treat myself to some pampering, self-care every day. 10~ Meditate for 20 minutes every morning to quiet the chatter in my brain. 11~ Be aware of the quality of food I put into my body. Quality is as important as quantity. 12~ Remember to thank people for their kindness. 13~ Spend less time at my computer and more time talking to loved ones. 14~ Focus on the positive things in my life. Focusing on the negative is like praying for more of it. 15~ Spend time stretching each day. The older I get the more important it is to be flexible, in both mind and body. 16~ Don't compare myself to others. 17~ Practice kindness. What goes around, comes around, and I want good karma knocking at my door. 18~ Embrace forgiveness. Remember the lessons learned, but forgiving releases negative energy I'm hanging on to. 19~ Schedule time to be silent each day. No music, TV, books or talking. Simply being quiet to hear my own thoughts. 20~ Be open to new experiences and let my life unfold without a white knuckled grasp on how I want it to be. 21~ Continue my Morning Pages, which helps empty the clutter that clogs my thoughts. 22~ Drink more water and less wine. 23~ Continue to organize and clear clutter from my life. 24~ Remember that I am enough and dump my need for approval from others. 25~ Practice non-judgement. Accept people and things as they are. How are you planning to be happier in 2016?

It's also a great time to hit ""refresh"" on the way you look at your life and the things you prioritize. This year, instead of vowing to hit the gym every day, we thought we'd make some un-resolutions and tally some of the things that we're going to cross off our list of stressors for the next year. Because, sometimes, you just need to give fewer f**ks about the things that are weighing you down. Below are 20 things we've vowed to stop giving a sh*t about in 2016. What would you add? 1. Having plans on a Friday night. After a long week, sometimes all you want to do is watch Netflix and order takeout. Own that instead of feeling guilty about it. 2. The sexual connotations of Netflix and chill. Maybe you just literally want to Netflix and chill! Watching Netflix and chilling while doing so sounds delightful! (See above.) 3. ""Putting yourself out there."" Yes, it's great to make new friends and open yourself up to new romantic connections if you're looking for them. But often the people who tell you to ""just put yourself out there!"" ignore the immense amount of effort and mental energy it takes to do that. Also, oftentimes finding new love is more about dumb luck than individual effort. 4. Watching every new TV show and listening to every hit song. There is way too much great television and music to keep up with it all. Just stick to the things that truly excite you. 5. Doing trendy workouts you don't enjoy. Hard pass on paying $45 a class to feel like death. 6. Making plans you have no interest in to catch up with people out of obligation. Ain't nobody got time for that. Instead, dedicate time and energy to nurturing the relationships you truly care about. 7. The perfect winged eyeliner. We officially give up. 8. Twitter trolls. This one is easier said than done, but often it's best to dedicate as little energy as possible to garbage humans on the Internet. 9. Getting tons of likes on Instagram. If you want to Instagram your brunch/weekend trip/view/funny sign/visiting BFF, do it because you want to, likes be damned. 10. Whether or not Hillary Clinton is ""likeable"" enough. Nope nope nope, moving along. 11. Making a big deal out of Valentine's Day. Whether you're in a relationship or not, putting too much importance on an arbitrary day as a marker of ""real"" love is more stressful than it's worth. 12. Wearing cute workout clothing. This is not meant to shame people who have and love said workout clothing. More power to you! But no one needs to feel obligated to look loungewear runway ready when heading off to gym. 13. Wearing 3-inch heels every day. If that's your style, again, you do you and rock it. But if you're putting your poor legs and feet through hell for a few extra inches, maybe don't. You'll still be just as gorgeous without the heels. 14. Finishing every book you start even when you aren't into it. Next time we get halfway through a novel and feel zero investment in the main characters, we're just gonna close it and give up. 15. Having the ""perfect"" body. You are enough, just as you are. Too much mental anguish goes into seeking an impossible standard. 16. Fake ""pasta"" made out of vegetables. Just eat the damn noodles if you want them. 17. Selfie shaming. Take and post as many fierce selfies as you want to. No one has the right to determine the images you put out there but you. 18. How your life compares to the lives of your former classmates/friends/siblings. Forget comparisons and arbitrary timelines. You do you. 19. Avoiding adding cheese in your salad. Life is short, put a little cheese on your lettuce. 20. People who don't give a sh*t about you. #BYE The next four years will change America forever.

Iowa is the first of the 'trinity' events that start the actual campaign, along with New Hampshire and South Carolina….[O]f the last six open GOP nominations, Iowa correctly picked two winners, New Hampshire four and South Carolina five. [T]he Trinity matters because it creates an early opportunity to seize momentum, demonstrate viability and garner media attention.” [HuffPost] ‘Great uncertainty’ about how the primaries will play out - More from Gaddie and Goidel: “The invisible primary has been unusually visible this election, with multiple televised debate-events feeding the public a steady stream of content….The campaign is particularly abrasive due to the combination of style and strategy. The result is a campaign environment where we are still sorting out contenders and therefore the events of the early primaries are uncertain. This is both fun from a gamesmanship standpoint, but also creates great uncertainty about how momentum and viability will be captured by the remaining contenders.” That uncertainty means primary polls still aren’t predictive - Nate Cohn: “You have undoubtedly heard that primary polls aren’t necessarily very predictive far from an election. With just a month to go until the Iowa caucuses, I’m writing to tell you that it’s still true….This phase of the race — the final stretch before Iowa and New Hampshire — can be the most volatile of the entire campaign….In recent primary campaigns, going back to the 2004 Democratic primary, those candidates who have led in Iowa or New Hampshire polls with just one month to go have lost as often as they have won. On average, candidates’ share of the vote at this stage differed from their final share of the vote by around seven percentage points. With many candidates running, it was not at all uncommon for a candidate to move by more.” [NYT] TRUMP LEADING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA, CLOSE RACE IN IOWA - Donald Trump is enjoying a lead of over 20 points in both New Hampshire and South Carolina polls. In New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Gov. Chris Christie (N.J.) are the nearest competitors, while in South Carolina Cruz, Rubio and neurosurgeon Ben Carson are in the second tier. In Iowa, Cruz holds a slight lead over Donald Trump in the HuffPost Pollster Iowa chart, averaging 30.8 percent to Trump’s 28.4 percent. Rubio is in a distant third, more than 15 points behind Trump. The close averages reflect inconsistency in the polls -- the last five polls have ranged a Cruz advantage of up to 9 points to Trump leading by 3 points.

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime). POLLSTERS SAY PUBLIC IMAGE OF POLLING HAS DECLINED - Carl Bialik: ""No votes have been cast yet in the 2016 election, but there may already be one set of losers in the campaign: pollsters’ reputations. And that’s according to the pollsters themselves. We asked people working at some of the nation’s most prominent polling outfits whether pollsters’ public image has improved or declined since the 2012 election. Of the 21 who answered, none said their public image had improved, and two-thirds said it had declined….Using a classic tactic in politics, many pollsters blamed the media….Pollsters said they shouldn’t be blamed if the media overstate the certainty of a poll’s finding about what the majority wants, or if policy makers put undue emphasis on what polls find. ‘Polls are not meant to be a blueprint for policy,’ said J. Ann Selzer of Selzer & Company, a Des Moines, Iowa, polling firm. ‘But, it is helpful to know where a majority stand — imagine a world where you did not know that.’” [538] HUFFPOST POLLSTER TWEAKS CRITERIA FOR INCLUDING POLLS IN CHARTS -- HuffPollster: “At HuffPost Pollster, we aim to be inclusive. We want to include every poll that makes an honest attempt to measure opinion in the relevant population, and we don’t discount polls solely because of the methods they use….At the same time, we agree that many pollsters are too lax in providing important details to help poll consumers assess their work. In 2010, Blumenthal wrote that Pollster would only include polls in its charts if their publicly accessible reports meet the National Council on Public Polls' ‘level 1’ disclosure requirements. For the last few years, we have accepted information via email, even when it’s not part of the pollsters’ public materials. However, we are now returning to the requirement that all of the NCPP’s minimal disclosure items must be available publicly before we will include that pollster’s polls in our charts….We will not make any changes to our procedures for the 2016 Republican and Democratic primary races at the national or state level….For the national 2016 general election, starting Jan. 1 we will only include polls from pollsters who have all of the NCPP level 1 disclosure information publicly available either on their poll releases or on their websites. Pollsters who are members of the American Association for Public Opinion Research's Transparency Initiative will be accepted without question.” [HuffPollster] MORE OF THIS WEEK'S POLLS -Most Americans think 2015 was a good year for them personally but not for the rest of the world. [YouGov] -A HuffPost/YouGov poll shows that 2015 didn’t bring an end to Americans’ economic worries. [HuffPost] -Support for religious protection varies depending on the religion in question. [AP] -A majority of Americans are okay with sacrificing civil liberties in exchange for safety. [ABC] -Partisanship deeply affects views on president Obama and terrorism. [WashPost] -Pope Francis and Donald Trump tie in second place for most admired man of 2015 behind Barack Obama. [Gallup] THIS WEEK'S 'OUTLIERS' - Links to the best of news at the intersection of polling, politics and political data: -Donald Trump's support is strongest among those who are less likely to vote in the primaries. [NYT] -Campaign lawn signs won't increase turnout, but they can potentially shift votes in a close race.

With just a month to go until the Iowa caucuses, I’m writing to tell you that it’s still true….This phase of the race — the final stretch before Iowa and New Hampshire — can be the most volatile of the entire campaign….In recent primary campaigns, going back to the 2004 Democratic primary, those candidates who have led in Iowa or New Hampshire polls with just one month to go have lost as often as they have won. On average, candidates’ share of the vote at this stage differed from their final share of the vote by around seven percentage points. With many candidates running, it was not at all uncommon for a candidate to move by more.” [NYT] TRUMP LEADING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA, CLOSE RACE IN IOWA - Donald Trump is enjoying a lead of over 20 points in both New Hampshire and South Carolina polls. In New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Gov. Chris Christie (N.J.) are the nearest competitors, while in South Carolina Cruz, Rubio and neurosurgeon Ben Carson are in the second tier. In Iowa, Cruz holds a slight lead over Donald Trump in the HuffPost Pollster Iowa chart, averaging 30.8 percent to Trump’s 28.4 percent. Rubio is in a distant third, more than 15 points behind Trump. The close averages reflect inconsistency in the polls -- the last five polls have ranged a Cruz advantage of up to 9 points to Trump leading by 3 points.

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime). POLLSTERS SAY PUBLIC IMAGE OF POLLING HAS DECLINED - Carl Bialik: ""No votes have been cast yet in the 2016 election, but there may already be one set of losers in the campaign: pollsters’ reputations. And that’s according to the pollsters themselves. We asked people working at some of the nation’s most prominent polling outfits whether pollsters’ public image has improved or declined since the 2012 election. Of the 21 who answered, none said their public image had improved, and two-thirds said it had declined….Using a classic tactic in politics, many pollsters blamed the media….Pollsters said they shouldn’t be blamed if the media overstate the certainty of a poll’s finding about what the majority wants, or if policy makers put undue emphasis on what polls find. ‘Polls are not meant to be a blueprint for policy,’ said J. Ann Selzer of Selzer & Company, a Des Moines, Iowa, polling firm. ‘But, it is helpful to know where a majority stand — imagine a world where you did not know that.’” [538] HUFFPOST POLLSTER TWEAKS CRITERIA FOR INCLUDING POLLS IN CHARTS -- HuffPollster: “At HuffPost Pollster, we aim to be inclusive. We want to include every poll that makes an honest attempt to measure opinion in the relevant population, and we don’t discount polls solely because of the methods they use….At the same time, we agree that many pollsters are too lax in providing important details to help poll consumers assess their work. In 2010, Blumenthal wrote that Pollster would only include polls in its charts if their publicly accessible reports meet the National Council on Public Polls' ‘level 1’ disclosure requirements. For the last few years, we have accepted information via email, even when it’s not part of the pollsters’ public materials. However, we are now returning to the requirement that all of the NCPP’s minimal disclosure items must be available publicly before we will include that pollster’s polls in our charts….We will not make any changes to our procedures for the 2016 Republican and Democratic primary races at the national or state level….For the national 2016 general election, starting Jan. 1 we will only include polls from pollsters who have all of the NCPP level 1 disclosure information publicly available either on their poll releases or on their websites. Pollsters who are members of the American Association for Public Opinion Research's Transparency Initiative will be accepted without question.” [HuffPollster] MORE OF THIS WEEK'S POLLS -Most Americans think 2015 was a good year for them personally but not for the rest of the world.

Not for bartenders cleaning up the sprays of joviality. Lying at the bottom of the stairs, a young woman, robbed of decency. Her bum is half-exposed. Why don't her friends help her up?What's going on here? I ask, bending down to check on her. She's awake, she gives me a look of disgust, some old guy with a grey beard is in my face. I look around for someone younger. Who is she with? I ask.A woman who looks like she must be in possession of a fake ID steps forwards. Her makeup can't hide her acne and it has a quality to it -- too many drugs with bad stuff cut into the mix. No one knows her, she says. It's 3 minutes to midnight. The DJ is playing, Don't You Want Me Baby, by the Human League. No one wants her. Is she Cinderella? F***. She won't budge, blocking the stairs. Drunks are tumbling around her. The frenzy is reaching a climax. Poppers are shooting upwards, roars cascade across the room, the DJ is counting down. I look at my exit gift for 2015. And my welcoming gift for 2016. She's crying now as the stampede to the future quickens. She's being left behind to perish on a filthy bar floor, friendless, hostile, people are saying goodbye to another year, most want to see the back of it. All I see is the back of a collapsed human sack. I have no choice. I grab her from behind and raise her like Christ raising Lazarus. Someone snaps a selfie with the drunk girl. F*** off, I yell. I won't be getting followers on Instagram. I settle her into a booth, bringing water, an ice pack for her bruised head, and the herd charges on. I go back to check on her. She's gone - like the year. The ice has melted."

And there's an unlikely source behind the spike in rapes: People the victims do not know. The researchers found that rapes reported by victims ages 17-24 increase by 28 percent on days when there are football games at Football Bowl Subdivision schools. FBS schools, previously known as D I-A schools, typically field the best teams in college football. Rape reports at FBS schools increase even more on days of home games, rising by 41 percent. The study used FBI crime data collected between 1991-2012 from 138 local and campus law enforcement agencies to compare the number of rape reports on game days to the number on non-game days. The research accounted for the number of reported rapes that usually occur on a particular day of the week or at a time of the year, which would seem to correct for much of the football season taking place during what is known as ""The Red Zone"" between the start of school and Thanksgiving, when freshman women are particularly susceptible to assault. In total, researchers were able to analyze 96 Division I football schools -- 55 of which were FBS schools and 41 of which were FCS or Football Championship Subdivision Schools, previously known as D-1AA schools. “What we really wanted to do in this study is to quantify the degree to which partying and alcohol consumption actually cause increases in reports of rape, and that’s why we decide to investigate the effects of Division I football games,"" said Jason Lindo, an associate professor of economics at Texas A&M University and one of the study's co-authors. The researchers estimate that football games could lead to as many as 770 rapes at the 128 schools that make up the FBS every year, and no fewer than 253. How far the estimate swings in either direction depends on how much you attribute the rise in reported rapes to the influx of people to the area on game day -- more people might just mean a higher chance of rape -- or to a change in behavior associated with alcohol consumption and party culture. The increase is most apparent among college-aged adults between the ages of 17 and 24. The researchers estimated that reports of college-aged offenders raping college-aged victims rose by 58 percent on the day of home games. And while there was some evidence of an increase in rape victims between the ages of 25 and 28, almost none of the victims were between the ages of 13 and 16. Lisa Maatz, vice president of government relations for the American Association Of University Women, was not as surprised by the report's top-line finding as she was by something else: The people said to be largely responsible for the rise in game-day rapes were offenders the victims did not know. Researchers found that reported rapes involving an offender the victim didn’t know increased by 61 percent on home game days and by 29 percent during away games. By contrast, reported rapes involving an offender the victim did know rose by 28 percent during home games and by a statistically insignificant amount during away games. Those numbers represent a startling spike in rapes by unknown offenders, since previous studies have shown that as many as 9 in 10 college-aged women victims know the person who assaulted them. This less-common type of rape seems much more prevalent on game days. Researchers pointed to other signs that the increased rapes are tied directly to college football culture. Games against school rivals or prominent football programs seemed to lead to a steep rise in reported rapes, as did upset victories (notably, schools did not experience a significant rise in reported rapes when the opponent won in an upset). And while away games that were televised appeared to lead to a much smaller but still notable rise in reported rapes, this was not true of games that were not televised. The effects were also felt much less at FCS schools, where football is a less prominent aspect of university life. There, home games appeared to lead to a 31 percent increase in reported rapes and away games had no effect. Division II and Division III games appeared to have no effect whatsoever on the number of reported rapes. The next four years will change America forever.

The metallic eyeshadow that brightened up your orbs has crept down to your cheeks, and the shimmering nail art you painted on at the last minute is still holding on for dear life. (Signs of a rockin' good time, right?) But how will you get the glitter off when you have to be at work (or meet up with family and friends)? Don't stress: We have simple tricks to wipe away all that shimmer from Make Up For Ever Pro Artist Lijha Stewart and celebrity manicurist Kimmie Kyees. EYES, LIPS & BODYUse a gentle eye makeup remover like Sens'Eyes to remove waterproof and highly-pigmented products without ending up with greasy residue. Be careful not to rub your eyes or lips aggressively -- it will cause more redness and can actually push glitter into the eyes and mouth. Start by saturating a cotton pad with your makeup remover, place on top of the eye area and lips, then gently wipe off product in small circular motions. To remove any remaining glitter, wash your face using a foaming face wash and a warm wash cloth. Instead of scrubbing with a face wipe, which can increase redness and irritation, try an oil-based makeup remover. This will emulsify all makeup and leave your skin soft. NAILSThe best way to get glitter nail polish off is to use a cotton pad wet with pure acetone. Wipe the nail until the polish loosens, then dab the nail with the cotton and leave to soak. Continue on to the rest of the nails, changing cotton pads when necessary. When you return to the first nail you left ""wet"" with polish remover, the product would have broken down the glitter so that it is easy to wipe off. To care for nails after the glitter is removed, use a soft buffer file to smooth and always apply cuticle oil to replenish the skin and nails from the acetone (as the formula can weaken and dehydrate nails over time).

The metallic eyeshadow that brightened up your orbs has crept down to your cheeks, and the shimmering nail art you painted on at the last minute is still holding on for dear life. (Signs of a rockin' good time, right?) But how will you get the glitter off when you have to be at work (or meet up with family and friends)? Don't stress: We have simple tricks to wipe away all that shimmer from Make Up For Ever Pro Artist Lijha Stewart and celebrity manicurist Kimmie Kyees. EYES, LIPS & BODYUse a gentle eye makeup remover like Sens'Eyes to remove waterproof and highly-pigmented products without ending up with greasy residue. Be careful not to rub your eyes or lips aggressively -- it will cause more redness and can actually push glitter into the eyes and mouth. Start by saturating a cotton pad with your makeup remover, place on top of the eye area and lips, then gently wipe off product in small circular motions. To remove any remaining glitter, wash your face using a foaming face wash and a warm wash cloth. Instead of scrubbing with a face wipe, which can increase redness and irritation, try an oil-based makeup remover. This will emulsify all makeup and leave your skin soft. NAILSThe best way to get glitter nail polish off is to use a cotton pad wet with pure acetone. Wipe the nail until the polish loosens, then dab the nail with the cotton and leave to soak. Continue on to the rest of the nails, changing cotton pads when necessary. When you return to the first nail you left ""wet"" with polish remover, the product would have broken down the glitter so that it is easy to wipe off. To care for nails after the glitter is removed, use a soft buffer file to smooth and always apply cuticle oil to replenish the skin and nails from the acetone (as the formula can weaken and dehydrate nails over time).

Our hope is that by telling their stories, we'll bring you closer to blended family bliss in your own life! Want to share your story? Email us at divorce@huffingtonpost.com. Katie Nemer and her son's stepmom, Julie Cox, blog about raising their blended family at Adventures In Co-Parenting. Besides being writing partners, they're very close friends, though both admit that forging that friendship didn't happen overnight. Below, the two moms share how they grew to be parenting partners for the sake of Katie's son (and Julie's stepson) Jackson. Hi Katie and Julie. Please introduce us to your family. Katie: I have a family of five: there's me, my husband Josh, Jackson (13), Zoe (5) and Preston (3). Julie: There are five of us in the Cox family: me, my husband JT and our three busy boys: Jackson (13), Declan (5) and Beckett (3). Julie, when did you come into JT and Jackson’s life? JT and I have been together for eight years, married for six. When we were introduced by mutual friends, I was very impressed with his dedication to Jackson -- his cute-single-dad status was definitely part of the initial attraction. Tell us a little bit about your co-parenting relationship and how it evolved. Katie: Not too long after JT and Julie first started dating, she called me up a week before school started and announced that she had gone school supply shopping with Jackson and gotten everything on his class list: the backpack, crayons, all of it. It’s a moment in time I will likely never forget; I couldn’t tell if I was totally pissed off that she had stepped on my toes by doing this with him and not asking me if I wanted to take him, or completely relieved that the school supply shopping was done and off my to-do list. I realized this was my opportunity to define our relationship: Either she would be ‘that woman’ who just stepped in and bought my son a backpack or she could be my new best friend, hand-delivered by the mom fairies to help me manage my complicated life. It was a very instinctive choice and I’ve never looked back. Julie: I don’t know the exact statistics, but I’m pretty sure there aren’t many people who are friends with someone who procreated with their spouse. And we’re not talking just smile-and-wave kind of friends here. We’re talking first-call-when-in-labor and dance-at-each-other’s-weddings kind of friends. To be honest, though, it wasn’t always this way. Initially, I was extremely intimidated by Katie. She had had a baby with my husband and it took a lot for me to not think about that every time we saw each other. Eventually though, after confronting my insecurities and realizing that this had the potential to be a very real and positive friendship, we have grown it into something we are very proud of and have come to count on. What are some of the biggest challenges of blended family life?Katie: A huge challenge that comes with co-parenting is accepting that sometimes your child is not with you. We have literally bartered out holidays at times (""You can have him for Easter because we had him for Christmas""). And even though I have been doing this for years, there are times I forget what weekend Jackson is with his Dad and Julie, and inadvertently attend a family event without him. It’s difficult knowing I am disappointing people who want to see him. I contemplated bringing a Jackson blow up doll to Thanksgiving once, but I figured Great Grandma H. would see through it. Julie: Co-parenting is a tough lesson in sharing for all of us, but especially for Jackson’s adoring little brothers. They have a hard time accepting when it’s not our “turn” to have Jackson for the week. Sometimes they just cry for their “big brudder” and my heart breaks for them. That being said, I’m pretty sure they are catching on that this is a soft spot of mine, because one of my 3-year-old’s recent crying fits was immediately followed up by a request for ice cream to help him not be sad any more. What's the best thing about being part of a blended family? What makes you proudest of your family?Katie: I always have the “Jackson board of directors” to run issues and big decisions by. And JT and Julie are super nerdy and make spreadsheets for everything, which is actually really helpful. I’m extremely proud of the fact that we have never once needed an attorney or mediator. We have always worked it out ourselves. Julie: I’m not going to lie, I love the shock value that comes along with telling people how well the four of us co-parents get along. Co-parents are so often painted as natural enemies, whereas really the opposite can be and should be true. What advice do you have for other bio-parents and stepparents who just can't seem to get along? Katie: Co-parenting is challenging but extremely rewarding, and anyone can do it. It has to be a conscious decision made by the adults to put the wants and needs of the kids before their own and let go of the past. Also do simple things like buy each other birthday cards or just say a kind word to show you still respect each other as people. Small but meaningful gestures like these truly can add peace to the chaos. Julie: Bad things may have happened to drive you apart, and those bad things may have led to bad blood. No matter what, though, you will always have one thing in common: love for your shared child(ren). If you are committed to being an active part of your child’s life, then you have to commit to being a part of the co-parent’s life. There is no way around this. As we’ve found, co-parenting isn’t always easy, but loving your kids is. What's your divorce or co-parenting-related New Year's resolution? Katie: I am notoriously a bit territorial. In 2016, I would like to promise my extremely intelligent, amazing son Jackson that I will be better about not making a huge fuss about him keeping his new fleece (or whatever) at our house. If he can’t take it with him, it won’t feel like his and I respect that. (In my defense, their house eats snow boots. But it’s OK because of the year our house ""swallowed"" all of Jackson’s pants.) Julie: Communicating with a teenager can sometimes be difficult. One-word answers, often coupled with an eye roll, seem to be Jackson's go-to responses to, well, everything. My co-parenting New Year’s resolution is to continue to work on my relationship with my stepson, even if it involves patiently dealing with his teenage communication walls. As a high school teacher, I cringe internally every time a student says negative things about a stepparent. I can't help but worry: Jackson will never say these things about me, right? Jackson and I share a lot of interests so there's a lot we can talk about. He is so important to me and I want to make sure he knows that, even if I get a couple of eye rolls in the process.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wall-street-lobbying-washington_n_6110c886e4b0ed63e6574b8e,1/1/2016,zachary d. carter,"Wall Street Got Burned In Washington This Year, For Once","So, that happened. It was a tough year to be a bank lobbyist in the nation's capital. Wall Street's biggest banks worked both houses of Congress, the Obama administration and five independent regulatory agencies, all to come away at year's end with approximately … nothing. An interest group accustomed to playing on offense was, at times, forced into defensive mode, protecting its turf with only modest success. Listen to HuffPost's analysis of the yearlong struggle over economic policy in this week's ""So, That Happened"" podcast. The fun starts at 21:54. Banks started the year with a long Washington wish list. They wanted to tie up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with reams of red tape. They wanted to charge high hidden fees on auto loans -- a practice that disproportionately hits the pocketbooks of people of color. They wanted to poke a big hole in the Volcker Rule, which bans banks from placing speculative securities bets with taxpayer-backed money. They wanted to let banks with assets measured in 12 figures operate with thinner capital cushions and larger amounts of risky borrowed money. They wanted to kill a new rule that would require financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients (amazingly, this is not already the law). The banks lost every one of these fights. Wall Street usually wins in Washington. The bank lobby closed out 2014 by securing subsidies for risky derivatives trading and a long delay in the implementation of the Volcker Rule. And indeed, this year's setbacks may be the inevitable result of too much winning the year before. But part of the larger problem for bank advocates is the new style of governance imposed by the Republican Congress: Lawmakers just don't pass many bills anymore. The bank lobby -- which had a history of generous campaign contributions to Democrats prior to the 2010 passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law -- can no longer rely on simply getting legislation passed and seeing it signed into law. And even if Congress did pass a straightforward bill curbing Dodd-Frank, President Barack Obama would almost certainly veto it. Instead, banks now have to hope that their pet projects get included in the year-end funding bill for the federal government. Obama has repeatedly warned lawmakers against approving spending bills that include major regulatory rollbacks. For bank lobbyists to succeed, they have to convince Republican leaders that their pet projects are worth risking a government shutdown, which the public would almost certainly blame on the GOP. As a result, lobbyists have to pursue bizarre, multi-stage strategies designed to give Republican leaders the ability to promise that bank handouts are, in fact, uncontroversial, bipartisan measures. These schemes begin with the introduction of the bill -- will any finance-friendly Democrats sign on as co-sponsors? -- and proceed to the committee level. House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has blocked most efforts to defang Dodd-Frank. But if a dozen bills are moving at the same time, each with a token Democrat or two in support, then Waters has to pick her battles. Something almost inevitably slips through. The bill then hits the House floor, where Republicans attempt to churn up Democratic votes. If enough Democrats flip, then GOP leaders can point to those votes as evidence that the measure belongs in a bipartisan year-end funding bill. That's exactly what happened in 2014 with subsidies for derivatives trades. When Waters and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) led the charge against the policy, then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) noted that over 90 Democrats had previously supported the measure on the House floor. Surely it couldn't be that bad. Most members of Congress -- Republican and Democrat alike -- don't have a strong grasp of financial policy. It's hard to know whether a favor requested by a bank lobbyist is a genuine technical correction or a cold-blooded attempt to swindle consumers. If a few otherwise progressive Democrats approve of a bill and Warren doesn't cry foul, then plenty of Democrats will be willing to get the lobbyists off their backs by voting in favor. And there are a few dozen House Democrats who will back bank lobbyists even when Warren draws a line in the sand. In November, 88 Democrats, including DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), voted in favor of a bill that would help auto dealers charge higher loan rates to black, Latino and Asian customers. It was the sort of thing that lobbyists had hoped might make it into the year-end spending package, but the passage of the bill prompted an uproar among activists online, and the provision never made it into the broader legislation. But while it's rare for bank lobbyists to lose all the battles they pick on Capitol Hill, it's still more unheard of for the industry to take fire the way it did this year. When lawmakers were examining a long-term highway bill, trying to figure out how to get it passed, they noticed a proposal from the Congressional Progressive Caucus to nix $17 billion in payments that the Federal Reserve makes to banks. The practice is a holdover from the early days of the central banking system, but now essentially functions as a thank-you to banks just being banks. Suddenly, bank lobbyists weren't trying to get deregulatory favors; they were trying to preserve a straightforward subsidy that was on the chopping block. This was a product of the bank lobby's partisan drift toward the GOP. Republicans are anti-regulation and anti-tax. Banks are into that stuff. But when the broader business lobby really wants the government to pay for something -- like, say, decent highways to ship goods over -- Republicans steadfastly refuse to pay for the maneuvers with tax increases of any kind. As a result, silly items like billions of dollars in free money for banks start to look like appealing targets. Banks didn't take the full $17 billion hit. Through aggressive lobbying, they were able to nudge it down to $7 billion. It could have been worse, but bank lobbyists didn't see it as a win. In retaliation, lobbyists for one bank scaled back a traditionally high-end holiday party they throw for members of Congress and key staffers, downgrading the culinary offerings to mini hot dogs and hamburgers.

Somewhere, in an alternate universe's version of 2015, Jeb Bush probably really is dominating the race for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. In our 2015, however, the long shadow over the pre-primary period has been cast by reality television mogul and sun-stained Velveeta loaf Donald Trump. Now with a few precious weeks remaining before the first caucus votes are cast, the GOP establishment is unsure where it was that they went wrong. To listen to the old guard try to cope with Trump, you'd think that everyone was suffering from hallucinations. But what if what Trump's actually done is revealed the true face of the GOP base to the party that had always imagined they could keep it tamed? And is this a dark cloud or a silver lining in disguise? Writer and podcast host Ana Marie Cox joins us in a special two-part podcast recording that continues at her show, ""The Brouhaha."" Meanwhile, at the end of the year, we take stock in how well Congress did in finishing all their work for the year, and in news that will surprise nobody, it turns out that the Senate has once again left a large number of judicial vacancies unfilled. But this year, it's the lack of a congressional authorization to make war on ISIS that reveals the true depths of your congresscritters' cowardice. Finally, was there really any good news this year? Well, one nice thing is that America's bank lobbyists actually failed to get their mitts on all the taxpayer boodle that they'd set their sights on this year. Never fear, they'll be back to have another go at it next year. ""So, That Happened"" is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney. Joining them this week are Huffington Post reporters Jen Bendery, Julia Craven and Shahien Nasiripour. This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Adriana Usero, with assistance from Peter James Callahan and Christine Conetta. The next four years will change America forever.

Somewhere, in an alternate universe's version of 2015, Jeb Bush probably really is dominating the race for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. In our 2015, however, the long shadow over the pre-primary period has been cast by reality television mogul and sun-stained Velveeta loaf Donald Trump. Now with a few precious weeks remaining before the first caucus votes are cast, the GOP establishment is unsure where it was that they went wrong. To listen to the old guard try to cope with Trump, you'd think that everyone was suffering from hallucinations. But what if what Trump's actually done is revealed the true face of the GOP base to the party that had always imagined they could keep it tamed? And is this a dark cloud or a silver lining in disguise? Writer and podcast host Ana Marie Cox joins us in a special two-part podcast recording that continues at her show, ""The Brouhaha."" Meanwhile, at the end of the year, we take stock in how well Congress did in finishing all their work for the year, and in news that will surprise nobody, it turns out that the Senate has once again left a large number of judicial vacancies unfilled. But this year, it's the lack of a congressional authorization to make war on ISIS that reveals the true depths of your congresscritters' cowardice. Finally, was there really any good news this year? Well, one nice thing is that America's bank lobbyists actually failed to get their mitts on all the taxpayer boodle that they'd set their sights on this year. Never fear, they'll be back to have another go at it next year. ""So, That Happened"" is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney. Joining them this week are Huffington Post reporters Jen Bendery, Julia Craven and Shahien Nasiripour. This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Adriana Usero, with assistance from Peter James Callahan and Christine Conetta. The next four years will change America forever.

It was a tough year to be a bank lobbyist in the nation's capital. Wall Street's biggest banks worked both houses of Congress, the Obama administration and five independent regulatory agencies, all to come away at year's end with approximately … nothing. An interest group accustomed to playing on offense was, at times, forced into defensive mode, protecting its turf with only modest success. Listen to HuffPost's analysis of the yearlong struggle over economic policy in this week's ""So, That Happened"" podcast. The fun starts at 21:54. Banks started the year with a long Washington wish list. They wanted to tie up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with reams of red tape. They wanted to charge high hidden fees on auto loans -- a practice that disproportionately hits the pocketbooks of people of color. They wanted to poke a big hole in the Volcker Rule, which bans banks from placing speculative securities bets with taxpayer-backed money. They wanted to let banks with assets measured in 12 figures operate with thinner capital cushions and larger amounts of risky borrowed money. They wanted to kill a new rule that would require financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients (amazingly, this is not already the law). The banks lost every one of these fights. Wall Street usually wins in Washington. The bank lobby closed out 2014 by securing subsidies for risky derivatives trading and a long delay in the implementation of the Volcker Rule. And indeed, this year's setbacks may be the inevitable result of too much winning the year before. But part of the larger problem for bank advocates is the new style of governance imposed by the Republican Congress: Lawmakers just don't pass many bills anymore. The bank lobby -- which had a history of generous campaign contributions to Democrats prior to the 2010 passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law -- can no longer rely on simply getting legislation passed and seeing it signed into law. And even if Congress did pass a straightforward bill curbing Dodd-Frank, President Barack Obama would almost certainly veto it. Instead, banks now have to hope that their pet projects get included in the year-end funding bill for the federal government. Obama has repeatedly warned lawmakers against approving spending bills that include major regulatory rollbacks. For bank lobbyists to succeed, they have to convince Republican leaders that their pet projects are worth risking a government shutdown, which the public would almost certainly blame on the GOP. As a result, lobbyists have to pursue bizarre, multi-stage strategies designed to give Republican leaders the ability to promise that bank handouts are, in fact, uncontroversial, bipartisan measures. These schemes begin with the introduction of the bill -- will any finance-friendly Democrats sign on as co-sponsors? -- and proceed to the committee level. House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has blocked most efforts to defang Dodd-Frank. But if a dozen bills are moving at the same time, each with a token Democrat or two in support, then Waters has to pick her battles. Something almost inevitably slips through. The bill then hits the House floor, where Republicans attempt to churn up Democratic votes. If enough Democrats flip, then GOP leaders can point to those votes as evidence that the measure belongs in a bipartisan year-end funding bill. That's exactly what happened in 2014 with subsidies for derivatives trades. When Waters and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) led the charge against the policy, then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) noted that over 90 Democrats had previously supported the measure on the House floor. Surely it couldn't be that bad. Most members of Congress -- Republican and Democrat alike -- don't have a strong grasp of financial policy. It's hard to know whether a favor requested by a bank lobbyist is a genuine technical correction or a cold-blooded attempt to swindle consumers. If a few otherwise progressive Democrats approve of a bill and Warren doesn't cry foul, then plenty of Democrats will be willing to get the lobbyists off their backs by voting in favor. And there are a few dozen House Democrats who will back bank lobbyists even when Warren draws a line in the sand. In November, 88 Democrats, including DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), voted in favor of a bill that would help auto dealers charge higher loan rates to black, Latino and Asian customers. It was the sort of thing that lobbyists had hoped might make it into the year-end spending package, but the passage of the bill prompted an uproar among activists online, and the provision never made it into the broader legislation. But while it's rare for bank lobbyists to lose all the battles they pick on Capitol Hill, it's still more unheard of for the industry to take fire the way it did this year. When lawmakers were examining a long-term highway bill, trying to figure out how to get it passed, they noticed a proposal from the Congressional Progressive Caucus to nix $17 billion in payments that the Federal Reserve makes to banks. The practice is a holdover from the early days of the central banking system, but now essentially functions as a thank-you to banks just being banks. Suddenly, bank lobbyists weren't trying to get deregulatory favors; they were trying to preserve a straightforward subsidy that was on the chopping block. This was a product of the bank lobby's partisan drift toward the GOP. Republicans are anti-regulation and anti-tax. Banks are into that stuff. But when the broader business lobby really wants the government to pay for something -- like, say, decent highways to ship goods over -- Republicans steadfastly refuse to pay for the maneuvers with tax increases of any kind. As a result, silly items like billions of dollars in free money for banks start to look like appealing targets. Banks didn't take the full $17 billion hit. Through aggressive lobbying, they were able to nudge it down to $7 billion. It could have been worse, but bank lobbyists didn't see it as a win. In retaliation, lobbyists for one bank scaled back a traditionally high-end holiday party they throw for members of Congress and key staffers, downgrading the culinary offerings to mini hot dogs and hamburgers.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/spring-studio-is-dead-lon_b_8901966,1/1/2016,daniel maidman,"Spring Studio Is Dead, Long Live Spring Studio","the entrance to Spring Studio, 64 Spring St. Some years ago, I lived in one of those artsy little towns which freckle the South. There was a main road in this town, and off to one side of it, a fenced-off bare lot. Walking past, one would notice slow changes in the lot: the digging of a foundation, laying in of beams, the start of a building. But only one person was ever there, a sunburned guy in muddy clothes who was always lugging supplies, or operating a heavy machine, or pushing a full wheelbarrow. This went on for a couple years, until one day there appeared, as if from nowhere, a complete, fairly large building, in glass, steel, and brick, adorned with beautiful carved wooden details. On the day it opened, we filed in, gawping at this apparition of a building. Inside were an atrium, and a balcony, and a second floor divided into studios. It turned out it was a new arts center, and that one guy we'd been seeing all that time had built it single-handed. Every day we'd seen him out there, he had patiently been building his building. He'd even carved the wooden details, and sanded and varnished them, and fitted them into place. It was both a gift to the local arts scene, and a solitary work of passion. Naturally, I wanted to talk with him about his project. So I made my way over and started chatting. He told me about it alright - and told me and told me. He couldn't stop running his mouth. He spoke in a tone both demanding and whiny, without a single space for a listener to reply. His gaze was intense but wandering, like a frightened and angry bird. Now it would fix on you, now on something else, now on nothing at all. He stood slightly too close to you, and leaned forward at the waist. It was a stressful and exhausting experience, spending even ten or fifteen minutes talking with this lone builder. I don't know his name. I don't know the name of his building, or its address. If I went back to the town, I would remember how to walk you there, and we could go in, and maybe still find him around the place. My encounter with this man made a lasting impression on me. In hindsight, I had the feeling that what I had encountered was greatness. I felt I had gotten a first-hand impression of the nature and price of greatness. I learned that greatness, at least this form of it, consisted in some way in going out, stubbornly and alone, every single day, for years and years, and continuing with a project plotted out in the misty past, and simply doing the work until the work was done. That this single-minded intensity of purpose, animating every part of a life, carries with it a terrible cost: that you lose, to some extent, your ability to be at ease with your fellow man, or even to communicate with him. That it makes you wild, and not wild in some romantic, feathered-hair sense, but wild in its harshest aspect: hard-bitten, terrified, cruel, ravenous. I have encountered this bare human voltage only a few times in my life. Having come near to it once, it is not hard to recognize when it comes by again. In 2005, I was preparing to move to New York. I made one of my periodic visits to the city, and I was drawing at the Met, as one will. Another artist was drawing nearby, so I went over to him and explained I would soon be moving to New York, and wondered where one goes for life drawing in the city. He said, ""Oh, Spring Studio of course."" Spring Studio between workshops So when I got to New York in the summer of 2006, I went to Spring Studio. It was a life-drawing workshop in the basement of a Soho building, its low arched ceiling oozing and rotten, walls lined with bookshelves, charcoal-smudged chairs and tables ringed around a raised model stand, and tucked in back among a heap of papers and desk lamps and electronic odds and ends, the appropriately-named mistress of the place: Minerva. Minerva at her desk Life drawing is the practice, often done in uninstructed workshops open to anyone who wishes to pay for the session, of drawing from a nude model. I have done this about twice a week since 1998. I have been to life drawing workshops in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, and any number of lesser cities. I have spoken with models and artists about the workshops in England, France, Italy, and points east. So far as I can tell, there is no institution anywhere quite like Spring Studio. Spring Studio runs three times a day, so that one might draw from morning to night every day of the week, if one were so disposed. It has a varied and professional cast of models, a quiet and studious atmosphere, no music, no drinks, good lighting, and a clockwork system of pose lengths and protocols. The attitude toward models is respectful and appreciative, and the attitude between artists is, by and large, amicable. Anyone who has experience with life drawing will understand that to have all these elements in the same place at the same time is virtually unheard of, let alone for 11 hours a day, every day, for years on end. Spring Studio does not make economic, logistical, or cultural sense. It earns almost no money. It is hair-raisingly difficult to schedule and to maintain in Manhattan. It is devoted to a practice disfavored in the general art world, and against the grain of a fast gratification culture. It only exists, and can only exist, because it is the life work of one passionate human being - Minerva Durham. As I began attending Spring Studio regularly, I got to know Minerva. She is, as one might expect, an unusual individual. At that time, she had a volatile personality: warm and welcoming, with a flipside of fury. I enjoyed being in her good graces, but lived in constant fear of somehow crossing her. She is in her late seventies now, and perhaps less volatile - more resigned to the inevitability of disappointment, more universal in her goodwill. It is impossible to complete a conversation with Minerva. Her conversation is like the meandering and deadly story which Hermes tells to Argus: you ask her one simple thing, and half an hour later find yourself still standing there, listening to random and only vaguely connected anecdotes, having forgotten the question, or whether it has been answered. Minerva Durham Many artists do not understand or appreciate models. Minerva sets a tone which has percolated outward amongst New York's figurative community: that models are to be respected, their safety assured, their rights honored, their work appreciated - that it is a privilege, easily revoked, to work with them. She has no illusions about models, understanding that modeling attracts a disproportionate share of flakes and neurotics. They are, however, her flakes and neurotics, and she is fiercely protective of them. Her concept of art and its making includes artist, model, knowledge, practice, and medium; she sees them as components of a complete system leading to the creation of the work, and she does not privilege any one part in her interaction with the system overall. Her dedication is to art, and she is ruthless about quality in the materials that go into its making. I have had occasion recently to speak about those lonely titans who carried figurative art on their backs across the long winter of the Contemporary years. Minerva Durham is one of those titans. She began close to the mainstream of the art world, and soon diverged from it, ruefully but permanently. She makes beautiful charcoal and pastel drawings, which are not shown, and she is temperamentally disinclined to give a damn about showing her work. Her calling, she has discovered over time, is as an educator and a Johnny Appleseed. This she does with unfailing vigor and good cheer. She has run Spring Studio since founding it in 1992. Minerva Durham, Banana Still Life 1, pastel and/or charcoal on paper, dimensions and date unknown She comes from a middle-class background, and her dealings with artists are predominantly with people of similar background. But she has forsaken comfort, and those closest to her have often been the poor and the desperate. This is no easy way to live. Her life is rigorously self-defined, and she prefers making her own choices and living with the consequences, over reaping the benefits of following society at large. She is cantankerous, eccentric, and impossible. If there is a more difficult way to do something, she'll find it. There is no physical thing she is capable of taking care of: not her body, her workplace, her artwork, or her possessions. She has a distracted smile which just barely conceals the steely truth, which is that she is consumed by an idea. She has been the happy servant of her idea these many decades, and the idea still possesses and consumes her, so that the idea is close to her, and everything outside its radius is dim for her, and seen uncertainly at best. Minerva, like my anonymous builder, is great. She has done one thing, consistently and energetically, a tiny bit of it every day, until she has created a mighty work. She has paid a high price for it: she lives with little safety net, and though she is far from alone, she depends on the ongoing affinity of the passionate for one another, a taxing and unstable way to live. Greatness makes life much harder than it needs to be, and it is no guarantor of happiness. In fact, it offers only itself: greatness. And this nearly inhuman quality is more precious, in my estimation, than almost anything. Therefore I think we ought to celebrate great people - if they combine goodness with their greatness - when we have the luck to cross paths with them. So much for Minerva. Minerva Durham, Amy Chaitlin, pastel on paper, dimensions and date unknown Now, to explain the title of this piece. After many years in the seeping (and, in summertime, fairly stinky) basement of whatever restaurant happens to occupy the ground floor of 64 Spring Street at any given time, the landlords have finally bowed to the financial temptations of Soho square footage and given Minerva and her little circus the boot. This has been not unlike the ending of ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" with much nostalgia and sorrow and tears and shuffling off of the fresh-made exiles. Kuan Ling Tsai, one of the many great models who has graced Spring over the years, flew back from Taiwan to model for the last session ever in the old space. Also, there was the hideous chore of sorting, giving away, throwing out, or boxing up a seemingly bottomless mess of books, sketchpads, pencils, file cabinets, wood horses, plaster casts, wax fruits, human bones, and so forth. I may have happened to miss most of this bit. part of the problem Old Spring Studio lived its time, and came to the end, and died. Not long after Minerva got the news, she was fixed up with a new space nearby, at 293 Broome Street. The great work continues with the first drawing session on January 3rd, and an opening reception today, the first day of the new year, from 2 to 8 p.m. It's not called Spring Studio anymore. It's called Minerva's Interim Drawing Studio. But that wouldn't have made as good a title for the piece. I have spent many happy hours at Spring Studio. The drawings I drew there progressed from highly variable to reliably pretty good. I made my transition there from an advanced student to a professional artist. I met many friends and several muses in the confines of 64 Spring St., and formed many thoughts, on art, on people, and on life, as my verbal brain wandered while my eye spoke to my hand. When one is very young, no specific thing seems like the thing which will form the substance of one's life. And yet specific things keep happening, and one looks back and finds that they were indeed the things one lived. Spring Studio was one of the things I lived, in all the grime of its surfaces, and dazzlement of its soul. I do not regret a minute of it. It has been an invisible institution of New York City, one of the hidden gems which makes the city great, and I have been lucky to live here in the time of its existence. I wish it many more years of creation.

The transition to the new year was marked by the descent of the traditional lighted crystal ball from atop a skyscraper amid fireworks and showers of confetti at the center of the famed Manhattan crossroads, the climax of an annual rite of winter dating back to 1904. With memories of the deadly attacks in Paris and California still fresh, police took extraordinary measures to ensure security at a gathering that has come to define the New York experience for many visitors to the largest U.S. city. But the event, broadcast live on national television, went off without a hint of trouble, as a festive mood prevailed despite - or perhaps because of - the heavy police presence. ""This is the center of the world on New Year's Eve,"" said Rick Milley, 60, who traveled from Boston with his wife, Debbie, 59, to ring in the new year in Times Square. ""This was on our bucket list,"" Debbie Milley said as the couple took pictures of themselves using a selfie stick. The pair have spent the holiday in New York before but never before in Times Square, a year-round tourist draw, filled with chain stores, family restaurants and flashy advertising displays. About 6,000 uniformed and undercover police officers, 500 more than last year, patrolled the area, with the force bolstered by mounted patrols, bomb-sniffing dogs, radiation detectors and hundreds of surveillance cameras. For the first time on a New Year's Eve, the city deployed its new Critical Response Command, which includes more heavily armed officers. The unit is trained to detect and respond to attacks, such those in Paris that killed 130 people on Nov. 13, or the rampage in San Bernardino, California, in which 14 were slain. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security ranked the Times Square celebration as a level-2 concern on its five-point scale of security risks for major public events, a designation one step below the top-rated level-1 classification given Friday's upcoming Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California. About 700,000 people are expected to turn out for the 127th Rose Parade. PENNED IN FOR THE PARTY The famous New Year's Eve ball, which is 12 feet (3.6 meters) in diameter and weighs nearly 6 tons, descended on a pole mounted on top of One Times Square, a narrow wedge of a building along 42nd Street at the southern end of the square. Mayor Bill de Blasio pushed the button that began the descent, leading to the 60-second countdown to midnight, when a giant illuminated ""2016"" sign flashed on, signaling the beginning of the new year. Crowds began assembling in Times Square hours before the official start of the festivities at 6 p.m. Thursday (2300 GMT), organized into neat pens formed by police barricades stretched for many blocks up Seventh Avenue and Broadway north of One Times Square. From a vantage point about 20 floors above, the revelers appeared to be tucked neatly into block-long honeycombs encircled by uniformed officers and support workers dressed in bright red coveralls. Cheers reverberated through the area as images from the entertainment stages played on a giant screen mounted on the building just below the pole supporting the crystal ball. On occasion, fireworks exploded above, sending flashes of light and wafts of smoke through the square. ""I always wanted to come here, but never took the chance,"" said James Gomez, 39, of New Haven, Connecticut, as he surveyed the area with friends looking for a prime viewing spot. Gomez came to Times Square even though he said he was concerned about the area being targeted in an attack. ""I'm scared,"" he said. In the hours before midnight, musical artists such as Carrie Underwood and Jessie J performed on stages set up in the area. More than 100 million Americans and 1 billion people worldwide were expected to watch the festivities on television. In Rochester, New York, a 25-year-old man accused of planning to attack a restaurant on New Year's Eve was arrested on Wednesday and charged with attempting to provide support to Islamic State, the U.S. Justice Department said. Afterwards, Rochester, about 330 miles (530 km) northwest of New York City, canceled its New Year's Eve fireworks display.

Before entering Times Square, visitors were required to pass through tight security checkpoints, with police stopping anyone from carrying backpacks and large bags while searching smaller bags and scanning people with metal detectors. The tradition of gathering in Times Square to celebrate the new year began in 1904, according to the Times Square Alliance, the area's business-development association. That was the year that the New York Times opened a new headquarters building at One Times Square and the city officially renamed the square after the newspaper.

PENNED IN FOR THE PARTY The famous New Year's Eve ball, which is 12 feet (3.6 meters) in diameter and weighs nearly 6 tons, descended on a pole mounted on top of One Times Square, a narrow wedge of a building along 42nd Street at the southern end of the square. Mayor Bill de Blasio pushed the button that began the descent, leading to the 60-second countdown to midnight, when a giant illuminated ""2016"" sign flashed on, signaling the beginning of the new year. Crowds began assembling in Times Square hours before the official start of the festivities at 6 p.m. Thursday (2300 GMT), organized into neat pens formed by police barricades stretched for many blocks up Seventh Avenue and Broadway north of One Times Square. From a vantage point about 20 floors above, the revelers appeared to be tucked neatly into block-long honeycombs encircled by uniformed officers and support workers dressed in bright red coveralls. Cheers reverberated through the area as images from the entertainment stages played on a giant screen mounted on the building just below the pole supporting the crystal ball. On occasion, fireworks exploded above, sending flashes of light and wafts of smoke through the square. ""I always wanted to come here, but never took the chance,"" said James Gomez, 39, of New Haven, Connecticut, as he surveyed the area with friends looking for a prime viewing spot. Gomez came to Times Square even though he said he was concerned about the area being targeted in an attack. ""I'm scared,"" he said. In the hours before midnight, musical artists such as Carrie Underwood and Jessie J performed on stages set up in the area. More than 100 million Americans and 1 billion people worldwide were expected to watch the festivities on television. In Rochester, New York, a 25-year-old man accused of planning to attack a restaurant on New Year's Eve was arrested on Wednesday and charged with attempting to provide support to Islamic State, the U.S. Justice Department said. Afterwards, Rochester, about 330 miles (530 km) northwest of New York City, canceled its New Year's Eve fireworks display.

Before entering Times Square, visitors were required to pass through tight security checkpoints, with police stopping anyone from carrying backpacks and large bags while searching smaller bags and scanning people with metal detectors. The tradition of gathering in Times Square to celebrate the new year began in 1904, according to the Times Square Alliance, the area's business-development association. That was the year that the New York Times opened a new headquarters building at One Times Square and the city officially renamed the square after the newspaper.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sport-and-society-for-are_b_8901790,12/31/2015,richard crepeau,Sport and Society for Arete-'Concussion' Movie Review,"Several months ago there was a minor flap over the fact that the National Football League was given the right to delete parts of the film ""Concussion"" before its general release to the public. At the time many, including myself, feared that the NFL would defang the bite of the film. It did not. In fact it's hard to imagine what the NFL censored in ""Concussion"" given the devastating nature of the final product which is now in release. Will Smith has the lead role as Dr. Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian doctor, who made the initial discovery of the existence of CTE in the brains of former NFL players whose lives had collapsed and ended at a relatively young age. The other major character in the film is Mike Webster whose life spiraled out of control. His eighteen year career as a center for the Pittsburgh Steelers endeared him to the football fans of that city, but his post-football life led to a major personality change, alcoholism, drugs, and lesser addictions, and destroyed his family life. His death was officially termed a heart attack but as the New York Times reported the psychological turmoil and physical problems were the result of repeated blows to the head. Dr. Omalu worked as a forensic pathologist in the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, coroner's office where he first encountered Mike Webster when he conducted the postmortem on Webster. In an examination of Webster's brain Omalu found ""tau,"" a substance that strangles the brain and often personality changes as those experienced by Mike Webster. Omalu linked Webster's tragic end to the head trauma endured by Webster during his football career. ""Concussion"" opens with a painful depiction of Webster's descent into his personal hell. Dr. Omalu is introduced at work where he will first encounter Mike Webster. From here the story opens out from Omalu's discoveries and into the world of science and the world of the National Football League. Omalu's life and work are the major focus of the film as he comes into conflict with the power of the NFL, the cult of football in America, and the corruption within the scientific community. It is a potent mix. What is revealed is the fact that for close to two decades the NFL did its best to prevent any connection between the concussions, the collapse of the lives of former players, and football. The NFL was aggressive in its effort to discredit any research making that connection. Repeatedly the film pounds away in subtle and not so subtle scenes of head-to-head hits on football practice fields, in game highlights from the NFL, and within the lives and deaths of former players. As Omalu's analysis gains traction the push back by the NFL grows. Omalu's boss is threatened by the FBI and IRS. Omalu's life in Pittsburgh is battered by threats to his employment that could lead to his deportation. He is subjected to threatening phone calls and his wife is harassed. Essentially what the NFL tried to do to Omalu was to dismantle his life in ways the lives of former NFL players were dismantled by brain diseases. The story moves forward at a good pace, there is tension aplenty, and above all what comes roaring off the screen is both the power and the corruption of the NFL. If you think that it is unlikely that the NFL had the ability to get the IRS, FBI and immigration authorities to act on their behest you are an innocent. The NFL has strong connections with the political establishment and a very close relationship with the FBI through its security division which is populated by ex-FBI agents and administrators who maintain their connections to the Bureau. In the end ""Concussion"" succeeds in telling the story of Bennet Omalu, warns of the dangers of concussions and football, and displays the power of the NFL and its willingness to sacrifice people's lives in the maintenance of their cultural dominance. ""Concussion"" will not destroy football in America; it should damage the credibility of the NFL, and lead everyone to understand the dangers inherent in this American sport and entertainment in which violence is an essential element.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/art-seen-through-the-lens_b_8900380,12/31/2015,anna agoston,Art Seen Through the Lens of its Architect," I am an architect who makes art. My education and practice as an architect have informed what I see, the way I think, and what, why, and how I make art. This is a look at my art through my architect's lens. I aim to expose facets of meaning according to the Vitruvian triad of structural integrity, beauty, and utility. Structure Architects think in terms of space and form, and structure is at the core of the architectural artifact. My Untitled project is a series of photographs of living plant elements photographed in parks and gardens. The series' parameters--defined and treated as structural elements--include print color, format, size, and borders. These shared parameters preserve the series' coherence and integrity and serve as a sculptural basis for my art by holding and framing each image. I obscure backgrounds to isolate subjects from their contexts. I strategically position my subjects within white frames to evoke feelings like withdrawal, sensuality, and love or sensations like gravity or levitation. The vertical spine of a Gingko Biloba leaf stretches sensually along the frame. The circular form of an Opium Poppy crown hovers in the upper part of the frame. I seek out and use symmetry to highlight imperfections or particularities of pattern and shape. Angling a subject's core axis up-down or right-left shows up natural asymmetries and imperfections along it, such as the minuscule irregularity on the rim of a Paphiopedilum Orchid's lower lip. Photographs shown together are arranged in a horizontal line sometimes broken into vertically-juxtaposed equal sequences. The series is to be read from left to right and top to bottom, as is Western text on a page. This arrangement brings out similarities and progressions in form--usually from the circular to the linear--and feeling. The images' positioning guides viewers from and allows them to compare one to the next. Beauty As an architect and artist, I strive to design dwellings and make art that are moving as well as aesthetically appealing. The Untitled series is an attempt to reveal the beauty intrinsic to each subject. Subjects are mostly tiny, simple plant elements found in ordinary, natural settings that I exalt by turning them into art that celebrates them. Plant elements are either shiny, fresh, newly-germinated stems, buds, and blossoms or weathered, withered boles, twigs, and leaves. The latter are reminiscent of Wabi-sabi, the traditional Japanese aesthetic that honors transience and imperfection in nature. Art results from the act of making an image beautiful and moving. To make my subject beautiful to the viewer, I polish and emphasize form with light and draw from a palette that ranges from the pure white of a wet surface catching the light to the rich black of deep depth of field. I print digitally on thick matte Hahnemühle paper because its fine, smooth surface creates high-quality prints that emphasize fine tonal graduations. Carefully-placed planes of focus form a tonal spectrum whose span expresses sharp foreground detail as well as soft background. The end result is an image that is compellingly beautiful. My interest in architectural structure followed naturally from an earlier fascination with organic structure. I had studied the organic unit, the cell, because I was curious about how singular characteristics could account for such diverse structures as hair and bone. Now, when I look at a black-and-white print of a Gingko Biloba leaf magnified six times, what I see is architecture: structure, form, and texture that remind me of Oscar Niemeyer's magnificent reinforced-concrete edifices. It is clearly the leaf's organic structure that determines the gracious--whether sophisticated or immature--way in which it hangs from the stem. Beauty also resides in the metaphor that an image may evoke. I do not give my photographs titles, preferring to allow viewers' minds to drift and form visual associations. My photographs do, however, have private nicknames referring to the personal metaphors that they evoke in me. Discerning symbols and identifying visual metaphors is part of my creative process. While I am taking a photograph, I may identify, seek to embed a discerned symbol or metaphor. For example, when I saw and felt a Madonna and Child in a minute germinating sprout, I worked on the image until it conveyed that metaphor to me. I am nevertheless conscious that, like Rorschach inkblots, visual metaphors are infinite in number, uncontrollable, and can only be suggested to others. Utility Whereas an artifact's utility or function is set in its programming, its function, when designed by an architect, can go beyond programming to encompass human experience of both exterior object and inner space. When presenting an architecture project, I first lay down facts about it. I lead the client around the outside of the edifice, highlighting its features and surroundings, and then move inside and through the plan from the entrance to any upper rooms, all the while pointing out how one experiences the inner spaces in concert with those visible through openings. ""La promenade architecturale,"" this movement through the building, and the resulting sequence of images unfolding before the observer, was central to Le Corbusier's architectural design. That concept shaped his buildings interiors and exteriors. Our physical experience of any architecture and art engenders emotions that in turn affect our emotional response to our environment. Le Corbusier collected natural objects and used them to draw up the natural laws that formally influenced his design of architecture objects, whether elements like stairways or entire buildings. He wrote: ""Around 1928 I felt a desire to expand my pictorial vocabulary and became interested in what I called objects of poetic reaction (objets à réaction poétique), any number of ordinary items that contain, summarize, and express the laws of nature, events understood as symbolically significant, etc. After that I began to work on the human figure."" (Le Corbusier, L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui, Special Issue, April 1948, p. 45). The purpose of my Untitled series is not to inform my architecture but to draw attention to and elevate the small but not insignificant plant elements encountered in daily life. A walk through the series is intended to provide an inner experience that will bring about a renewed sensitivity to the natural world. Magnifying little details of life that would otherwise go unnoticed exposes monumental beauty, triggers amazement, and revives from within. By inviting contemplation, my art transcends its subjects. Architects strive to design works that are internally and externally meaningful. We are concerned with an edifice's essence and also with its cultural and historic context. Similarly, my Untitled series, by focusing on subjects' structure and beauty, is an ode to natural forms that seeks to compel the viewer to see the world with new eyes, to feel it from within. What makes my Untitled series distinct is my use of digital technology to photograph living plants in their natural environments. Freed from the studio, I observe how the fall of natural light on subjects defines their form, and faced with the elements, like wind and sun, I take multiple photographs of a single subject until I get it right. In exploring the visual metaphor in living plants, I am building on the legacy of Edward Weston's still lifes; and my use of contemporary digital tools furthers the macro photography tradition of Karl Blossfeldt by making high-resolution photographs of plant forms in nature. Unlike Hilla and Bernd Becher, I am developing a romantic typology of forms in which feeling is perceptible. In my ongoing Untitled series, I am constructing a progressive sequencing of form and feeling. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-mothers-resumebecause-i_b_8901326,12/31/2015,kiri westby,A Mother's Résumé... Because it's 2016!,"I am one of roughly ten million American moms who've left the workforce to raise young kids, a percentage of the population that is steadily rising, not falling. Although I had a career in human rights advocacy and an expensive education under my belt, the decision came down to simple math. I could leave my kids with paid childcare, costing nearly all of my earning potential while away, or I could do the unpaid childcare myself. In the United States, which fails to provide affordable early childhood education, unlike many other developed countries, most mothers must make a similar choice. Some women are fortunate to have maternity leave or family caretakers to depend on, for a short while anyway, and a handful of women will net a few bucks after paying for coverage, taxes and commuting. With more than eleven million single moms in the US, 76% of which are gainfully employed, there are usually no affordable childcare options, trapping women in a cyclone of poverty. You either work and parent, barely making frayed ends meet, or you stay home with government assistance and withstand the shame of being ""unemployed"", even as you work your tail off. Recently, a mother in New York wrote about losing her child on his first day of daycare after she was forced to either return to work or quit her job, her difficult decision echoed in the hearts of millions of moms today. Republican lawmakers often label stay-at-home moms ""welfare queens"", claiming they drain the federal budget. In reality, government assistance makes up only 24% of federal spending, two-thirds of which goes to Medicare for people over sixty-five; Not to mention families who receive government assistance while working and paying taxes, a population that now makes up 56% of federal aid recipients. To add insult to injury, moms who stay home for a few years are often penalized when they return to the job market. Rather than being lauded for their newly attained skills, stay-at-home moms are treated as if they've taken a long vacation or lost touch with the modern world. The other night, I watched a scene in the popular TV show, Married. Actress Judy Greer plays a mother attempting to return to work after raising three kids, hoping for an office management job. Once she finds her old resume (on a floppy disk), she and a friend try to cleverly craft her mothering skills into resume appropriate terms. ""I once flew by myself with all three kids... while I was breastfeeding!"" She boasts. ""Ha! That is a baller move. But not something I would consider résumé material,"" her friend sighs, a look of pity. ""What!"" My sleep-deprived hackles suddenly up. Having recently endured the experience of raising small humans myself, I know for certain that there is no one more qualified to manage an office than a stay-at-home mother of three. I feel like I've been through some form of Navy SEAL training with just two. When I compare the me-of-today to the twenty-something-employee that I was before raising kids, it's no contest. Motherhood has turned me into a straight-up badass. There's got to be a way to reframe this because, frankly, the American job force needs highly trained, tough-as-nails moms in its ranks and, apparently, it doesn't know it yet. So I tried it. Instead of camouflaging the mom in my résumé, I put her right in there, front and center alongside my other applicable skills. Only I didn't get the job. Nor the one after that. A friend of mine tried it and she didn't get the job either. I started to think this was a bad idea. The business world obviously isn't ready to view motherhood as a ""real job"". Instead of being taken seriously, it appeared I was making a mockery of my ""work"", which only worked against me. I gave in and made a résumé without the mama-me, beefing up the small consulting work I was barely able to do on the side to, you know, pay for preschool. I made sure to hide all the 3:00 am bouncy struggles, the all-night-fever watches, the stunning achievement of teaching a child to walk...and then to run...and then to fly. But once I'd polished all the spit-up and tears from the page, it was utterly devoid of me. The most important on-the-job training I had ever received; the levels of multitasking mastered; the psychological torture of being on one's feet for twelve hours after only three hours of sleep; the diplomacy required to bring families together over holidays and clashing customs; and the sheer humility gained in volunteering to be covered with bodily fluids for years on end...none of it was in there. How could I interview for a job and pretend like I hadn't risen to superhuman status over the past six years? Resumegenius.com, Monster.com, Forbes.com each provide tips for hiding the parenting years when re-entering the job market. The Forbes article even recognizes that raising kids is skill building, stating, ""You've got a gazillion amazing new skills--this is indisputable. The problem? Many of your talents have been refined over the past few years through your most recent job as a stay-at-home parent...not a ""real job"". Each piece cautions against overtly mentioning one's kids, unless it comes up directly in an interview, asserting that employers will only hear ""sick days"" and ""family priorities."" From where I stand, employers should be reveling in the fact that they may have landed a dedicated, home-trained, Superhero. What are a few sick days compared to an employee that works every other day like her kids depend on it? Not to brag, but I can change a diaper, cook dinner, pay bills and order Christmas presents at the same time, and so can most of the moms I know. And let's just take a moment to recognize moms with multiples! Employers out there, if an applicant bravely mentions that they've had twins or more, hire them on the spot; their level of training has been a notch above the rest, their skills masterful. In order to flip-the-script on this whole fallacy, to define motherhood as the hardcore job training that it is, and to merge the two conflicting hats working moms struggle to wear every day, I created ""A Mother's Résumé"", because it's 2016. Here is my list of job-applicable skills that I gained while staying home with small children, available as its own downloadable image. Feel free to weave this info into your résumé, share it with other moms looking for work or print out a copy to remind yourself of ALL that you are. The more of us who own our maternal powers and proudly claim our at-home achievements, the more likely the business world will begin to recognize motherhood as an asset, rather than a liability. As 2016 dawns and we look to our next big ventures, let's collectively change the conversation to stop pretending like our metamorphosis into motherhood isn't relevant to our professional life. Heck, this is the year we might finally see a mom leading from the White House! If you are bold enough to try it, apply for a job using ""motherhood"" in your previous job experience, or as part of your relevant skills, and let me know how it pans out in the comments below. Or add some unique skills you've gained through parenting, I'm sure I've overlooked many. At the very least, let's agree to talk more about motherhood as the badge of bravery and growth that it is, rather than something to hide or isolate from our work. I can imagine a world where stay-at-home moms return to the job market proud of their hard earned, newly minted, human survival skills and confident that any prospective employer will feel the same...But it turns out, along with everything else we do, it's going to be up to us moms to create it.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reasons-to-hate-the-h8tef_b_8901684,12/31/2015,jackie k cooper,Reasons to Hate 'The H8teful Eight',"The H8teful Eight(The Weinstein Company) There are numerous reasons you should hate Quentin Tarantino's The H8teful Eight. The first is it is full of racist characters who use the N-word excessively. The second is it portrays brutality to women. The third is its excessive violence in general, and its blood-drenched scenes. Fourth, there are crude stories that roll off the lips of the characters. Yes, Tarantino pretty much says and does it all and wallows in the lack of political correctness. But then Tarantino is the Donald Trump of moviemakers. Political correctness does not attach itself to him. If other people had made this movie, they would have been drummed out of the Hollywood community. Quentin just gets stronger and stronger. He loves to shock and he loves the truth. If his story calls for nudity then the movie is going to have nudity. If it calls for blatant racism in its characters then those characters are going to be as racist as they can be. Whatever it takes to satisfy his cinematic goals, Quentin Tarantino does. H8teful Eight is a movie full of strong characters caught up in an ingenious plot. We meet the first four during a stagecoach ride. Originally on board are John Ruth (Kurt Russell), a bounty hunter with his prize Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). She is being taken to the Hangman in Red Rock, and Ruth is set to get ten thousand dollars for her delivery - dead or alive. A blizzard is moving in so the stagecoach is racing to get to Minnie's Haberdashery to wait out the storm. Slowing them down is Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), another bounty hunter who begs for a ride. Later they are flagged down by Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who also needs a ride. Finally, they reach Minnie's place where they find four men already there. There is the acting owner Bob (Damien Bichir), a hangman named Oswaldo (Tim Roth), a cowboy named Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), and a rebel colonel named Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern). Over the next twenty-four hours, this group will tell each other stories about their pasts and various other lies. They will also eye each other warily and plot how best to accomplish their goals and make a clean getaway. With Ruth, it is all about keeping Daisy alive until they can get to Red Rock. Some members of the group do not want that to happen. The acting in this movie is solid because the roles are all perfectly cast. Even so the two standouts are Goggins, who just gets better and better with each role he undertakes, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who knows how to be rawly observant as well as smart mouthed and sassy. These two are also the funniest characters in the movie. The movie is rated R for violence, profanity, and nudity. The nudity is provided by actor Craig Stark who gets to spend his entire time on screen naked in a snow-laden landscape. Brrrrr! As said, there are many reasons to hate The H8teful Eight but even more reasons to love it. The main reason being that everything in the film is unique. Nobody makes movies like Quentin Tarantino's movies. He has an eye for how the movie should look and an ear for what it should say. He comes out shooting and he stands his ground. When the film is over, the audience is in shock but they can't say they were not entertained. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-cosby-a-christmas-gift_b_8901554,12/31/2015,arnold steinberg,Is Cosby a Christmas Gift for Trump?,"On July 1, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez fired a gun in San Francisco. The bullet killed 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle. Just ten weeks earlier San Francisco had released Sanchez, who had been repeatedly convicted on drug and felony charges in Washington, Arizona, Oregon and Texas. The ""progressive"" sanctuary city had refused to honor a detainer from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to keep Sanchez in custody, so he could be deported, for the sixth time. The death of this vibrant and beautiful young woman was a tragedy, especially for her family. But ""Kate"" quickly became Exhibit A for Donald Trump, coming so soon after he started his presidential campaign with its focus on illegal immigration. More recently, in November, Trump began to oppose the influx of Syrian refugees. ""This could be one of the great Trojan horses,"" he opined in many interviews. Then, the San Bernardino terrorist attack occurred on December 2, further validation of The Donald as The Cassandra. Timing is working in Trump's favor again. Consider the following context that will now allow Trump to pivot on the ""women's issue,"" put Hillary Clinton on the defensive, and perhaps affect the general election, no matter who is the Republican nominee. Hillary has said that alleged victims of sexual assault ""have the right to be believed,"" - in effect prompting the then inevitable inquiry about Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assaults. Sure enough, earlier this month a woman in New Hampshire asked Hillary whether his accusers -- Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones -- should be believed. They should, Hillary replied tersely, be ""disbelieved based on evidence."" Last week Hillary provided a second opening when she criticized Trump's ""penchant for sexism"" and yet a third opening when she announced that Bill would soon campaign for her. Trump strategically lets the ""other guy"" throw the first punch (""they hit me first""), especially to put an issue in play (""they started this""). Hillary fell into the compound trap. And: ""If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!"" Trump twittered on Monday. Now a few days after Christmas, the Montgomery County District Attorney in Pennsylvania has given Trump an unintended gift. The charges of ""aggravated indecent assault"" against Bill Cosby, once revered as ""America's favorite father"" raise the issue of a powerful man sexually assaulting a trusting and vulnerable woman. Just as Cosby previously settled a civil suit, so too did Clinton pay money in settlement to Paula Jones. The public and different accusers over decades against Governor Clinton and then President Clinton are graphic and specific and part of a pattern of predatory sex. Clinton's accusers suggested more than improper advances in a hostile work climate, also sexual assault. Meanwhile, the Cosby story will not go away. The preliminary hearing January 14 for the criminal case will be part of a drawn out process complicated by more civil suits that will keep the issue alive. At least a fifth of next year's electorate, and a quarter of Democrats, were children at the time of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Some of the reporters are too young to remember. These voters and journalists are, regarding the possible Bill Clinton fallout for Hillary, political virgins. And the times have changed with more awareness of sex without consent. America still suffers under the delusion that Clinton was responsible for ""peace and prosperity."" Incompetent Beltway Republicans never let the electorate realize that Clinton inherited a peaceful world, with the fall of the Soviet Union and victorious Persian Gulf War, and inherited an upswing business cycle, plus the Internet boom. The false Clinton legacy may not be enough to save Hillary. A new consciousness holds powerful men like Clinton and his morally challenged spouse accountable. Trump initially has framed the issue as marital infidelity, even saying his own indiscretions are fair game. At first this seems a blunder, since the Clintons spun the impeachment as an attempt to criminalize an extramarital affair, rather than perjury. Further, most Americans think a politician cheating on his or her spouse is a private matter. Actually, Trump shrewdly lures Hillary and the media to dignify a dialogue he fully intends to escalate. As I write this, he just called Bill ""one of the great abusers of the world."" Within weeks, his discussion will turn to Hilary as an expedient and hypocritical enabler for Bill who therefore lacks moral standing to judge Trump's ""male chauvinism"" or even to speak on women's issues, and then as her husband's enforcer to put down ""bimbo eruptions"" - masterminding the intimidation and defamation of the victims. With the Cosby story on the ascendancy, Trump can uniquely raise the bar to define a ruthless Hillary. Trump doesn't hold back, never retracts and doubles-down and triples-down. This stuff will no longer be the province of right-wing websites. Unlike other candidates, only Trump commands massive real-time coverage for his bold attacks. Mainstream media will confront Hillary over repeated news cycles to respond each time Trump escalates. Even if Trump is not the Republican nominee, Hillary may become damaged goods for November.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-giant-leap-in-2016-africa_b_8901556,12/31/2015,david tereshchuk,A Giant Leap in 2016? Africa Is Narrowing its Techno-Gap,"Though for many of us the year ahead may look pretty dismal, 2016 promises one great breakthrough - a major step toward ending Africa's particular and hobbling form of the great Digital Divide. Poor connectivity has bedeviled much of the continent's internet access (or often sheer lack of access) but now a huge improvement is in the offing. It's a new subsea cable, to be laid off Africa's eastern coastline, enabling a reliable and affordable international connectivity service to both coastal and landlocked countries in Eastern, Central and Southern Africa. The project is being developed by Liquid Sea, a literally offshore subsidiary of Liquid Telecom, which already runs a pan-African network based on terrestrial fiber-optic cable supplemented by satellite links for rural and remote areas. Altogether, with offices from South Africa and Botswana in the south to Kenya in the East, taking in Democratic Republic of Congo in the center, it makes up the continent's largest single contiguous network crossing multiple national borders. Africa has benefited in many ways from the digital revolution - most notably in taking advantage of wireless technology - to leap-frog the conventional stumbling-block that having to lay cables had always presented. But internet coverage still remains uneven, to say the least. Les Cottrell (pictured below), who is based at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in Silicon Valley-land and runs the world's first global internet monitoring system (with the perhaps overly cute name PingER), will have the job of assessing how big a difference the new Liquid Sea connection finally gets to make. Cottrell, something of a legendary research scientist who was on the Nobel Prize-winning team that discovered the quark, is in no doubt of the daunting nature of Africa's need for net improvement, given so many countries' obdurate mix of poor connectivity overlaid across the sheer paucity of technical resources. He cites a visit he made to the biggest university in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He recalls: ""The University of Kinshasa has nearly 30,000 students, faculty, and research staff--but only 800 computers. And although its internal data network is fast enough to support on-campus e-mail, virtual library access, and online coursework, its link to the outside world is no better than that of a typical household in the United States or Europe."" And the unpalatable truth is that, despite some great advance in African development over the last decade and more, its effects are patchy, and taken as a whole, fewer than 16 percent of Africans have access to the Internet. That compares that with 63 percent of Europeans and 79 percent of North Americans. Cottrell has seen all too clearly what a disadvantage is placed upon Africans by such digital inequality. The economics of the entire process, he maintains, are skewed by poor network performance in Africa, with the total bandwidth available to shuttle data back and forth between African countries and the rest of the world amounting to less than 1 terabit per second. That's about one-seventieth of Europe's international bandwidth capacity. ""Making matters worse,"" Cottrell points out, ""the price for bandwidth in Africa is cripplingly high. While a university in Germany might pay about US $4,000 per month for 1 gigabit per second of bandwidth, a school in Kenya can expect to pay $200, 000 for the same service."" Things had started to improve when the soccer World Cup of 2011 was held in South Africa, and the ginormous demand of international communicators, not least the bandwidth-heavy TV networks, led to new western-coast undersea cables being laid. But these didn't afterward benefit many ordinary Africans, any more than they did the students and faculty of Kinshasa's university. Now Liquid Sea's underwater cable stretching from eastern South Africa to the Middle East, with onward connections to Europe, aims to contribute much more in building Africa's better connected digital future as whole. Liquid's CEO, Nic Rudnick, claims: ""The impact of Liquid Sea will be a far more reliable and ultra-fast connection for governments, businesses, schools and homes - in both coastal and land-locked countries across all of Africa."" And if it's not, the ever-vigilant Les Cottrell of PingER will be there to test and evaluate the network down to its fine gradations. He'll do that mainly through his basic measuring tool of the ""ping"" (like the sonar echo it is named after) as it travels from one computer to another far remote one - recording to the millisecond exactly how long that journey takes. All in all, though, Cottrell seems hopeful: ""As the continent continues to attract big investors and cutting-edge science research projects,"" he says, ""its internet performance will advance further still"".

These were the biggest Obamacare stories of the year about to end. Obamacare haters got another chance to deal a devastating blow to the law before the Supreme Court, and came up short, just as they had three years before. Chief Justice John Roberts again sided with the high court's four liberals, along with Justice Anthony Kennedy, to reject a lawsuit that was conceived and underwritten by libertarian and conservative activists. King v. Burwell was based on a fictitious history of the Affordable Care Act that attempted to gut the law by singling out a handful of words and claiming Obamacare only permitted health insurance subsidies in states that created their own health insurance exchanges, not in those with federally run marketplaces. The case threatened to rob millions of their health coverage, but in the end, all it did was rob a lot of people of time, attention and effort. There's a whole mess of stuff in the Affordable Care Act, but the chief and most measurable aim of the law is to get more people covered, and it's doing that. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates 17.6 million more people have health coverage than before Obamacare benefits kicked in on Jan. 1, 2014. Survey after survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Gallup and others show the percentage of Americans without health insurance is the lowest ever measured. Thanks, Obamacare. When the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in 2012, justices also ruled that states could opt out of the law's expansion of Medicaid coverage to low-income adults. Republican-led states like Florida and Texas continue to refuse these benefits to their poorest residents, but 2015 saw the list of states not expanding Medicaid shrink. Alaska, Indiana and Montana signed on, and now 30 states plus the District of Columbia are participating. Republican governors in South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming and elsewhere are still struggling to persuade state legislators to set aside their vehemence over Obamacare and adopt the expansion, but to no avail so far. One of the favorite pastimes of House Republicans is voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but 2015 brought a GOP majority to the Senate, too, enabling the upper chamber to get in on the fun and pass a budget bill that cuts out big chunks from the law. Next week, the House is slated to vote for it, too, and Obama will get a chance to veto a repeal bill for the first time. And then congressional Republicans can high-five each other and get back to not having a replacement for Obamacare. The dozens of repeal votes from 2011 to 2015 didn't actually ding the Affordable Care Act, and the changes Obama actually signed into law were pretty minor -- until this year. First, they undid part of the law that would have classified a lot of small businesses as big companies when it came to health benefits. But the biggest change -- and a significant loss for Obamacare and for the White House -- came with the enthusiastic support of congressional Democrats. Legislation Obama enacted this month delays the ""Cadillac tax"" on high-cost health insurance plans (a major source of revenue and a key tool in containing health care costs) along with taxes on medical device companies and health insurers. Bipartisanship! The health insurance exchanges closed out the 2015 sign-up period with nearly 12 million enrolled, surpassing federal officials' projections (but falling short of the Congressional Budget Office's expectations). The growth was a positive indicator of the viability of these new marketplaces, and contributed to the declining uninsured rate. During the course of 2015, the exchanges shed almost 2 million customers. Hundreds of thousands lost coverage because they didn't prove they were legal U.S. residents, and about a million saw their subsidies adjusted because their real income didn't match what they reported when they applied. And others cycled off the exchanges either to become uninsured or to obtain coverage from another source, like a job or Medicare. The market for individual health insurance has always been volatile, but this shrinkage raised worries about the future of the exchanges. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell sought to manage expectations before 2016 enrollment began by predicting meager growth on the health insurance exchanges. But preliminary enrollment figures appear promising. More than 8 million people have signed up with a month to go in the enrollment period. And it looks like a lot of them are new customers and, crucially, younger and less costly than those already covered by exchange plans. So the marketplaces are either on track to beat projections, or Burwell did a nice job spinning everyone beforehand. Obamacare premiums came in lower than Congressional Budget Office projections in 2014, and average increases in 2015 were in the mid-single digits. But ahead of the 2016 enrollment period that started last month, it became clear that pattern wouldn't repeat itself. Average premium increases were higher, and individual plans hiked prices by a whole lot more. Health insurance companies complained that Obamacare customers were sicker and more expensive than they expected, prompting fears that enrollment would stagnate as prices rose and drove out those who needed the coverage less, provoking even higher rate increases in the future. This led to a bunch of snide comments on Twitter about the name ""Affordable Care Act."" The jury is still out on whether historically low year-over-year growth in national health care spending in recent years was all (or mostly) the result of the recession and slow recovery, or whether Obamacare and private sector innovation are making the health care system more efficient. But what we do know now is that spending sped up in 2014, primarily driven by expanded health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Turns out spending a ton of money giving people health care spends a ton of money. Several parts of the Affordable Care Act have been described as ""death panels"" to scare people into thinking their medical care would be rationed by bureaucrats. But the most infamous example was when former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin used the moniker in a feverish Facebook rant to describe a provision of the legislation that became Obamacare that would allow Medicare to pay doctors who discuss end-of-life options with patients. Scaredy-cat Democrats pulled the policy from the bill, but the Obama administration did it through a regulation this year. Polls show the public supports it -- sorry, Gov. Palin! UnitedHealth Group is a minor player in the exchanges, but it's also the largest health insurance company in America. So when the company told investors it was losing money on Obamacare and might pull out, it raised eyebrows. Although other big insurers quickly said they had no intention of bailing on the exchanges, the UnitedHealth news was a reminder that Obamacare is still new -- and vulnerable. As a consolation prize of sorts to liberals who wanted the exchanges to include a government-run ""public option"" health care plan to compete with private insurers, Congress included seed money in the Affordable Care Act to found new, nonprofit health insurance cooperatives that were supposed to increase competition and keep prices down. It sort of looked like it might work at first, but then Congress cut their funding, these new companies started bleeding money, and half of them shut down, leaving hundreds of thousands of consumers scrambling to find replacements. You can't spell ""co-ops"" without ""oops."" There was no bigger champion of the Affordable Care Act than Steve Beshear, the Democrat who was governor of Kentucky until this month. Under Beshear, Kentucky expanded Medicaid; erected Kynect, a state-run health insurance exchange that stood as a model for other states; and slashed the uninsured rate. But Beshear couldn't run again because of term limits, and Republican tea party favorite Matt Bevin bested his Democratic opponent and now is in charge. While Bevin has backed off his vows to repeal the Medicaid expansion, he still wants to radically change the program and to scrap Kynect. Kentuckians may not agree with those aims, but they voted for him anyway. The next four years will change America forever.

One of the lesser-known goals of the Affordable Care Act is to enhance patient safety, especially in hospitals, where preventable errors kill tens of thousands of people every year. In a promising sign, the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported this year that these fatal episodes have been on the decline since Obamacare became law in 2010, and brought with it new policies including Medicare payment penalties for hospitals that don't improve patient safety.

Hundreds of thousands lost coverage because they didn't prove they were legal U.S. residents, and about a million saw their subsidies adjusted because their real income didn't match what they reported when they applied. And others cycled off the exchanges either to become uninsured or to obtain coverage from another source, like a job or Medicare. The market for individual health insurance has always been volatile, but this shrinkage raised worries about the future of the exchanges. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell sought to manage expectations before 2016 enrollment began by predicting meager growth on the health insurance exchanges. But preliminary enrollment figures appear promising. More than 8 million people have signed up with a month to go in the enrollment period. And it looks like a lot of them are new customers and, crucially, younger and less costly than those already covered by exchange plans. So the marketplaces are either on track to beat projections, or Burwell did a nice job spinning everyone beforehand. Obamacare premiums came in lower than Congressional Budget Office projections in 2014, and average increases in 2015 were in the mid-single digits. But ahead of the 2016 enrollment period that started last month, it became clear that pattern wouldn't repeat itself. Average premium increases were higher, and individual plans hiked prices by a whole lot more. Health insurance companies complained that Obamacare customers were sicker and more expensive than they expected, prompting fears that enrollment would stagnate as prices rose and drove out those who needed the coverage less, provoking even higher rate increases in the future. This led to a bunch of snide comments on Twitter about the name ""Affordable Care Act."" The jury is still out on whether historically low year-over-year growth in national health care spending in recent years was all (or mostly) the result of the recession and slow recovery, or whether Obamacare and private sector innovation are making the health care system more efficient. But what we do know now is that spending sped up in 2014, primarily driven by expanded health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Turns out spending a ton of money giving people health care spends a ton of money. Several parts of the Affordable Care Act have been described as ""death panels"" to scare people into thinking their medical care would be rationed by bureaucrats. But the most infamous example was when former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin used the moniker in a feverish Facebook rant to describe a provision of the legislation that became Obamacare that would allow Medicare to pay doctors who discuss end-of-life options with patients. Scaredy-cat Democrats pulled the policy from the bill, but the Obama administration did it through a regulation this year. Polls show the public supports it -- sorry, Gov. Palin! UnitedHealth Group is a minor player in the exchanges, but it's also the largest health insurance company in America. So when the company told investors it was losing money on Obamacare and might pull out, it raised eyebrows. Although other big insurers quickly said they had no intention of bailing on the exchanges, the UnitedHealth news was a reminder that Obamacare is still new -- and vulnerable. As a consolation prize of sorts to liberals who wanted the exchanges to include a government-run ""public option"" health care plan to compete with private insurers, Congress included seed money in the Affordable Care Act to found new, nonprofit health insurance cooperatives that were supposed to increase competition and keep prices down. It sort of looked like it might work at first, but then Congress cut their funding, these new companies started bleeding money, and half of them shut down, leaving hundreds of thousands of consumers scrambling to find replacements. You can't spell ""co-ops"" without ""oops."" There was no bigger champion of the Affordable Care Act than Steve Beshear, the Democrat who was governor of Kentucky until this month. Under Beshear, Kentucky expanded Medicaid; erected Kynect, a state-run health insurance exchange that stood as a model for other states; and slashed the uninsured rate. But Beshear couldn't run again because of term limits, and Republican tea party favorite Matt Bevin bested his Democratic opponent and now is in charge. While Bevin has backed off his vows to repeal the Medicaid expansion, he still wants to radically change the program and to scrap Kynect. Kentuckians may not agree with those aims, but they voted for him anyway. The next four years will change America forever.

One of the lesser-known goals of the Affordable Care Act is to enhance patient safety, especially in hospitals, where preventable errors kill tens of thousands of people every year. In a promising sign, the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported this year that these fatal episodes have been on the decline since Obamacare became law in 2010, and brought with it new policies including Medicare payment penalties for hospitals that don't improve patient safety. Good news for people who prefer not to die in the hospital for no good reason.

Nor the three who were killed at the Planned Parenthood center in Colorado. But our wealth in America should allow us to focus on long-term tragedies that plague not only our own people but our borthers and sisters around the world. It's the media's job, and everyone's, to put in perspective the dramatic awfulness that grabs our attention.Then we can really start saving lives."

After all, you're in advertising and are largely responsible for keeping the old ideas alive. I say ""advertising"" only because that's the modern term for it, but back in the good old days when we called things by their right names, there was an entire division of government devoted to this purpose: ""The Ministry of Propaganda."" Now we call it ""advertising"" for obvious reasons, but call it what you will: advertising, propaganda, public relations, indoctrination, lobbying, disinformation, brainwashing, spin, mind control, or manufacturing consent, they all have the same function -- getting people to think what you want them to think. Today, however, I want to talk about your persuading audiences to embrace old ideas that predate the FDR era over 80 years ago. Many are in awe of your uncanny ability at getting millions of working-class, middle-aged Americans on board with ideas that would clearly be against their self-interest. You've succeeded in having them want to return to an America when there was no social security, no health benefits, no Medicare, no minimum wage, no strong labor unions, no attempts at tax and bank reform -- the ""bad old days"" when there were no protections whatever for the average worker and they were at the mercy of the factory owners. This is how America was before the New Deal of the 1930's, and yet you've been able to repackage and sell this shredding of the social safety net to millions of today's Americans without their even realizing that this would cause them unparalleled misery! Now, that's salesmanship! You have experts scratching their heads as to how, in these desperate times, you've been able to pull this off, since it would threaten the very existence of these people! Care to give me an exclusive on what magic you used to accomplish this? You're really too kind. Well, I don't want to give away any trade secrets, like selling austerity, but look around at the times. Or, better yet, just listen to the presidential debates. You'll hear a large part of my handiwork in what these candidates are saying. I just sit down with them to help them organize their thoughts, and they just run with it. If you listen closely, they're tapping into very old ideas, ideas that have been around for thousands of years, ideas and feelings that appeal to the lowest in people: malice and hatred, bigotry and racism, intolerance and prejudice. This is what sells, and a few of them are going at it hammer and tongs! What's older in this world than sowing fear and suspicion, creating hysteria, and turning people against one another -- minorities, nations, races, or religions -- instead of calming the waters and urging people to live together in peace? You'd think you were back in Germany in the 1930's with all this scapegoating going on! Who would have thought that this kind of fear-mongering would come roaring back from the past and coming from the mouths of presidential candidates! You can't make this stuff up! Ratings have literally gone through the roof. Yes, I am rather proud of this piece of legerdemain which works wonders when you tell people that it's the end of the world. And why do people buy into this paranoia? For one reason only - they're frightened and an easy prey for these presidential wannabes. And it works, especially in times of collective madness when demagogues are coming out of the woodwork to infect the susceptible with their private delusions. All I do is to help shape the chaos, stand back, and enjoy the performance. But I spend most of my time on Capitol Hill, advising on policy and legislative proposals that attack the helpless and innocent, rob them of their rights, and make the lives of the poor and oppressed even more miserable than they already are. What is older than any of these old time-tested measures that go as far back as biblical times? Getting people all riled up with raw, primal fears which advance the agenda of our billionaire friends who help get our people re-elected. It's a win-win situation all around! ***But that's not the end by any means of what you've been up to. You've also been beating the tom-toms by lobbying politicians and resurrecting other old ideas that were part of America in years gone by. You're certainly part of a noble profession that puts teeth in old ""Silent Cal"" Coolidge's immortal one-liner that ""The business of America is business."" Only now you're hawking a wider assortment of products -- candy bars, dishwashers, automobiles, fear, panic, paranoia, government proposals and policies, and even political candidates. Word comes down about what the Big Boys want, and you prepare the country for it. It's like it used to be -- democracy in action when the people thought that they had a say! Please don't misunderstand me. I don't want to press the ""advertising"" angle too hard, since I know you also function as political consultant, think-tanker, talk radio host, columnist, general factotum, and hired gun for galvanizing the public on whatever needs selling. It naturally depends on the particular account you're assigned, and in some cases you'll doubtless want to check your conscience at the door before thinking up jingles to get the public to buy what you're selling, like recycling old ideas that go back before the Environmental Protection Agency was created decades ago. But I'd be remiss if I failed to commend your unflagging dedication and persistence in trying to undermine this agency since its inception! I shouldn't think it's necessary to believe in the products you're selling, although I'm sure that it helps, especially if you want a good night's sleep when you're jingling to justify what some squeamish consciences might label as criminal enterprises on the part of your clients, like contaminating drinking water, polluting rivers, and destroying the environment. But don't get me wrong. I don't mean to suggest that you've only been active in trying to gut the EPA. It seems you're everywhere these days, from upping pharmaceutical prices 550%, which cause the death of thousands as collateral damage since their meds are no longer affordable; to trashing social justice at universities that keep their professors in poverty; and abolishing political rights across all of America. But, then again, there are always winners and losers, for that's the beauty of our free enterprise system, which has made our country great! But it's fair to say that in whatever capacity you find yourself, when you honestly believe that what you're doing is honorable, it's a laudable calling. If, however, you're in it for the power or money, then that's something else. I know, I know what you're going to say, so why don't you say it? Well, if I don't do it, someone else will, so why not me? But I want it on record that I do have a code. I'd never promote cigarettes for home consumption and kids because I'm a true American and know the very real hazards caused by tobacco. I just couldn't live with myself if someone got cancer because of my actions -- although if they're being shipped overseas, well . . . . Besides, the money is good, and when it is, it's surprising what a conscience can get used to. Don't forget, I'm trained to think short-term, quarterly dividends. It comes with the territory. Nobody thinks long-term anymore. There's no money in it. Refreshing candor, to be sure, but you sell yourself short. You try to be flexible, open-minded, so open-minded, in fact, that you'll sell anything -- within, without, or beyond reason, even what may demoralize your own nation, put millions out of work, drag down the economy, or even destroy it, as long as it advances the interests of the party you're serving, no questions asked. That's very generous of you! Thank you! Any parting words? Well, they say that the truth will make you free, but not that it will always make you happy. Given a choice between truth and happiness, most will choose happiness over truth every time. Life is not about truth, but survival, and people prefer denial rather than facing uncomfortable truths. ""Humankind cannot bear very much reality,"" said T. S. Eliot somewhere. And then there's that old Latin adage: ""Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur"" or ""The world wants to be lied to, so why not oblige it!"" This little maxim has always been my inspiration, as I go about my work with a song in my heart trying to keep folks from looking into the face of Medusa and be turned into stone. However, I'm not the only one who does them this service. Look at the media! The entertainment industry! Hollywood! TV! The corporations! The politicians! Why, I'm a small-timer next to these people. They all tell lies to advance their agenda. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

I will not buy him an elevated water bowl or a doggie sofa. The fact that I live in Marin County, Calif., land of certified dog massage therapy, cashmere canine wardrobes and fake service-dog vests, only strengthens my resolve to stay normal. When Sheridan from Dairy Dell Doggie Care hands me the two-page menu of extras to consider for Scotch's weeklong stay, (i.e., ""furry blowout,"" ""extra bedtime cuddling by staff,"" and ""treadmill time""), I put up my hand and say nicely, ""Thank you, Sheridan. But he's a dog."" And yet. And yet: ever since white hair started sprouting up on my Brittany spaniel's perfect, mahogany-brown face, I began to sink into an embarrassing, only-half-ironic existentialist funk. ""What if I ship him off to Nicole?"" I threatened my husband and kids. Nicole is my hair colorist, to whom I hand over a small fortune every six weeks so my hair can try to look like Julianne Moore's. My family laughed at first, but has since asked me to stop saying this because they're starting to worry. But here's my deal: We get dogs to bring us one thing: JOY. Right? Uncomplicated joy. Your dog's job is to come when you call, love you all the time, and live to be, in all adorable doggy ways, a constant reminder that your life is right there, waiting to be enjoyed. Never mind that our dog regularly fails at most of his job. Most of the time, he treats us like a bad boyfriend, stopping for a moment to consider our jubilant calls and effusive praise with a blank stare before walking off in the other direction. But still, we adore him, just like all bad boyfriends are unjustifiably adored. And despite his poor dog performance, Scotch's rapidly changing appearance from gorgeous young thing to wizened elder is managing to unhinge me. What, in God's name, is wrong with me? Am I vain? Am I ageist? Am I a cliché of Man's Denial of Death? Also, what is the life expectancy of the cat? I really don't know. But what I do know is that I do not appreciate my Brittany turning into a daily reminder of the grim, inexorable march of time. I also do not appreciate my daughter constantly telling me that we better get another dog soon, because Scotch's life expectancy comes up right about the time she leaves for college. Do I need another living being I take care of to break my heart? No. I do not. Instead, I need my dog to stay beautiful and vital and mahogany-brown, and also to stop rolling around in rotting carcasses when I go trail running with him in the hills. Sadly, it's becoming ever more clear that he is not interested in any part of my plan. And so I am left with ""my work,"" as I am certain Oprah would call it. ""Julie,"" Oprah would say, holding me by my shoulders. ""Your work is to accept what is, with equanimity. There you'll find your best life."" Yes, Oprah, yes. My work, I understand, is to breathe into watching Scotch's face turn arctic white. To be OK as I watch his hip flexors seize up just a little more every month, right along with mine. My work is to practice -- it takes practice! -- being with the fact, that one day, my daughter will leave home. Scotch will stop running. And so will I. And that's life. Unless I call Nicole. I'll keep you posted. Earlier on Huff/Post50: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Now, finally, relief is in sight. For the first time since 2011, local, state and federal governments are providing a small but significant increase to prosperity. “There’s not a lot of positive contribution coming from the government sector, but when you’re talking about economic growth, less of a negative is a positive,” said Chris Varvares, senior managing director and co-founder of Macroeconomic Advisers.

These words, uttered half a decade ago by the head of intelligence for the NATO coalition force in Afghanistan, summon a far earlier American savagery. As the American empire affects to close the door on its war with Afghanistan, the words also serve as a sort of doorstop propping open our further intervention in this broken country. The war isn't really ending. Some 18,000 foreign troops will stay in Afghanistan, almost 11,000 of them American, under a new mission called ""Resolute Support."" U.S. forces will also have ""a limited combat role as part of a separate counterterrorism mission,"" according to the Wall Street Journal. Incredibly, we're not letting go. We're just disappearing the combat mission into global background noise. We're continuing to dehumanize part of humanity on the pretext of saving it. The updated version of ""the only good Indian is a dead Indian,"" redirected to the Taliban, was quoted a few days ago in a Der Spiegel article called ""Obama's Lists: A Dubious History of Targeted Killings in Afghanistan."" The article goes into detail about the administration's infamous ""kill lists"" and the hunting of upper- and mid-level Taliban leaders via helicopter and drone -- assassination by Hellfire missile -- which is an extermination methodology guaranteed to kill lots of innocent civilians along with (or instead of) the targeted Taliban operative. But, you know, that's war. The official ""end"" to the Afghan war, while it doesn't mean the end of combat operations, does offer us a moment of disturbing reflection on what has been accomplished these last 13 years, during the first of our wars allegedly to eradicate, but in fact to promote, terror. We poured at least a trillion dollars into the war, which claimed some 30,000 lives, over two-thirds of them civilians. The first thing that occurs to me is that, officially, these statistics mean nothing. U.S. Army General John Campbell, commander of the International Security Assistance Force, exemplified this by smothering the human toll of the war in simple-minded verbiage during a secret ceremony held last weekend in a gymnasium at ISAF headquarters in Kabul: ""Our new resolute mission means we will continue to invest in Afghanistan's future,"" he said. ""Our commitment to Afghanistan endures."" By the way, the ceremony, commemorating the war's shutdown, was secret because authorities feared the possibility of a Taliban attack. The United States and NATO, as everyone knows, are the losers, despite the bloated enormity of their military superiority. The Afghanistan war, like the Iraq war, was an utter failure even in terms of U.S. interests and geopolitical objectives. But any honest reflection requires a far more serious, all-encompassing look at the war's results. War is torture on a national scale. The nation of Afghanistan and its people are, of course, the primary losers in our ""investment"" in their future -- our investment in nation-wrecking. For instance: ""What has happened in Afghanistan over the last 13 years has been the flourishing of a narco-state that is really without any parallel in history,"" Matthieu Aikins said during a recent interview on Democracy Now. Aikens' article, ""Afghanistan: The Making of a Narco State,"" which ran recently in Rolling Stone, points out that, since the U.S. invasion, opium production in Afghanistan has doubled and the country now accounts for about 90 percent of the world's heroin traffic. Opium is about 15 percent of the country's gross domestic product, Aikens said -- even though Afghanistan is at the bottom of the drug trade economically. ""Afghan farmers only touch 1 percent of the value of the global opium trade,"" he said. Before 2001, opium production had been declining in Afghanistan, but, Aikens told Democracy Now, ""the U.S., in its quest for vengeance against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, partnered with the very warlords whose criminality and human rights abuses had created the conditions that led to the rise of the Taliban in the first place. And in many cases, these are the same individuals who were responsible for bringing large-scale opium cultivation to Afghanistan during the war against the Soviets."" War is also humanity's spiritual cancer. Up and down the ranks, dehumanization of the enemy rules. ""The only good Talib is a dead Talib."" This is the thinking that justifies mass bombing raids and kill lists. It also infects the souls of rank-and-file soldiers, such as the ""Kill Team"" described by Mark Boal in another extraordinary Rolling Stone story, this one published in March 2011. ""Among the men of Bravo Company,"" Boal writes, ""the notion of killing an Afghan civilian had been the subject of countless conversations, during lunchtime chats and late-night bull sessions. For weeks, they had weighed the ethics of bagging 'savages' and debated the probability of getting caught. Some of them agonized over the idea; others were gung-ho from the start. But not long after the New Year, as winter descended on the arid plains of Kandahar Province, they agreed to stop talking and actually pull the trigger."" Boal's article details the killing -- and dismemberment -- of Afghan civilians purely for sport and revenge. The details are gruesome: ""Then, using a pair of razor-sharp medic's shears, he reportedly sliced off the dead boy's pinky finger and gave it to Holmes, as a trophy for killing his first Afghan."" What a mockery the reality of war makes of the rhetoric that blesses it. The American empire holds a secret ceremony to skulk away from a failed mission. But this war isn't over. It won't be over until we vow, as a nation, not to start the next one. The next four years will change America forever.

What we have learned, thanks to Michael Grimm, the Congressman from New York's 11th Congressional District, is that being a congressman and a convicted felon are not mutually exclusive. Being both ultimately ended badly for Mr. Grimm but not because of any congressional rule or protocol. In April 2014, Congressman Grimm was confronted with a 20-count federal indictment alleging, among other things, that he was concealing income he received from a health food restaurant he once owned. Among other things, the store was a vehicle that enabled him to engage in tax fraud. On May 28, 2014, discussing the criminal charges with a reporter from Politico, Congressman Grimm expressed confidence he would be exonerated. On November 4 Congressman Grimm was elected to a third term in Congress and on December 23 Congressman Grimm pled guilty to a felony federal charge of filing false tax returns for the health food store he owned. Prosecuting attorney, Loretta Lynch, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York said the Congressman ""chose lies and deception over honest dealings with federal and state authorities as well as his own employees."" Notwithstanding his guilty plea, the good news, as far as the congressman was concerned, was that instead of standing trial in the spring on 20 federal charges he would be in Congress working on important legislation. As he told reporters after he'd entered his guilty plea: ""So long as I am able to serve, I will serve."" What he was saying is that being a convicted felon is no bar to serving in the United States House of Representatives. That probably surprises some of my readers. Mr. Grimm is, however, correct. Paragraph 1 of House Rule XXIII says members of the House ""shall behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House."" That reference, of course, does not apply to criminal behavior engaged in by a member of the House before joining that body, and, therefore, pleading guilty to such a crime while a member of Congress should not implicate paragraph 1. It might, however, implicate paragraph 10. That paragraph says a congressman receiving a sentence of 2 or more years' imprisonment ""should [not ""must""] refrain from voting on any question . . . unless or until judicial or executive proceedings result in reinstatement of the presumption of the [member's] innocence . . . . or the Member is reelected to the House after the date of such conviction."" Why the Rule refers to ""reinstatement of the presumption of innocence"" instead of ""exoneration of the charges"", is unclear. Although Rule XXIII does not require a convicted congressman to leave the House, two-thirds of the House could vote to expel Mr. Grimm but that has only happened twice since the civil war. On December 29,2014, Congressman Grimm announced that he was resigning from Congress saying: ""After much thought and prayer, I have made the very difficult decision to step down from Congress. . . .[It] is time for me to start the next chapter of my life."" His reference to "" prayer"" almost certainly refers not to Mr. Grimm addressing a deity, but to Majority Leader, John Boehner, addressing Mr. Grimm and urging him to resign from Congress so that Mr. Boehner's Republican caucus would not include a convicted felon. The ""new chapter"" to which Mr. Grimm refers is his upcoming time in prison. The foregoing discussion is of more than passing interest to one of Mr. Grimm's colleagues, Chaka Fattah. Mr. Fattah, a democrat, has just been elected to an 11th term in the House from West Philadelphia with 88 percent of the vote. He, like Mr. Grimm, is facing an encounter with the federal criminal justice system. The foregoing discussion may be of more than passing interest to him should he be convicted of criminal activity as seems more than a slight possibility. Federal prosecutors have had him in their sights for some time. In August 2014 his former chief of staff pled guilty to several counts of campaign finance fraud. Among improper payments made by the aide were payments to reduce Mr. Fattah's son's college debt. On November 7, 2014, another former Fattah aide pled guilty to one count of conspiring to commit honest services wire fraud, a charge someone smarter than this writer can explain. The kinds of questionable activities in which Mr. Fattah and his aides have been engaged are discussed at some length in The Philadelphia Tribune. The foregoing discussion of what consequences of a conviction meant for Mr. Grimm are certainly of no interest to Mr. Fattah-yet. He might want to keep it in mind for future reference, however.

The Senate Intelligence Committee's report on CIA Interrogation concluded the program ""created tensions with U.S. partners and allies...complicating bilateral intelligence relationships."" It said the program caused ""immeasurable damage to the United States' public standing, as well as to the United States' longstanding global leadership on human rights in general...."" Immeasurable is right -- in a literal sense it's impossible to gauge just how badly Washington's international U.S. image has been hurt by the CIA's torture. The CIA was never among the world's most trusted global brands, even among U.S. allies, but torture revelations have diminished U.S. claims to moral leadership and reduced its ""soft power."" An editorial in influential Spanish newspaper El Pais argued that the revelations mean the U.S. can no longer present itself as ""a beacon of freedom."" Releasing the report isn't what's hurt America's reputation -- making public and facing up to its mistakes are generally seen as a plus -- and the backlash attacks against American embassies and personnel overseas some warned would be triggered by the report's release hasn't happened. After Abu Ghraib and earlier revelations from Guantanamo it's not much of a shock for foreigners that the CIA tortured detainees and lied about it to other parts of the U.S. government, though details of rectal feeding and other abuses refreshed memories of what went on during the Bush presidency. Western government leaders have been fairly muted in their reaction to the revelations, and their responses have generally concentrated on applauding the U.S. for doing the right thing in owning up to its sins (the U.K. is facing a not dissimilar test of transparency now its 1970s treatment of the ""Hooded Men"" in Northern Ireland is under renewed scrutiny). There have been some calls for prosecutions of American officials, including from Members of the European Parliament and the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on Counterterrorism. But for governments complicit in hosting black sites or otherwise facilitating the CIA's torture, is difficult to condemn what happened too vigorously. U.S. allies that facilitated American torture might be nervous about closer scrutiny of where the CIA money went. ""To encourage governments to clandestinely host CIA detention sites, or to increase support for existing sites, the CIA provided millions of dollars in cash payments to foreign government officials,"" says the report. ""CIA Headquarters encouraged CIA Stations to construct a 'wish list' of proposed financial assistance to xxxxxxx [entities of foreign governments], and to 'think big' in terms of that assistance."" The Senate report estimates that the CIA Detention and Interrogation Program cost ""well over $300 million in non-personnel costs. This included funding for the CIA to construct and maintain detention facilities, including two facilities costing nearly $[number redacted] million that were never used..."" Following the release of the report, former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski admitted for the first time there had been a CIA ""black site"" in the country. Kwasniewski was in power from 1995 to 2005 and had previously denied the existence of a CIA site in Poland. Now he says there was a facility but that the Polish government had no knowledge of torture or mistreatment there.Around 50 countries are reported to have been involved in enabling the CIA program, either by hosting black sites or otherwise facilitating its operation. Some are now under pressure from their media and public for having enabled the torture, complicating their relationships with the US and making future co-operation more problematic. Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani described the revelations as shocking and inhumane, and announced that from now on the US would not be able to detain Afghans in the country. Lithuania and Romania are among the countries now exposed to possible international legal action for having hosted CIA torture facilities, and while the Thai government is keen to distance itself from the revelations, denying it hosted a secret prison, it is widely reported that Detention Site Green was based in the country.

President Bush's personal assurances to Irish government leaders that Shannon airport was not being used as a refueling stop for flights carrying detainees are still met with some skepticism in Europe, and after the guarantee given to Ireland the Bush White House told the European Union it wouldn't be offering assurances to other governments on a country-by-country basis. The revelations mean being seen as friends with the CIA is less attractive than ever, and will make it harder politically for some allies to partner with US intelligence agencies. But releasing the report was the right thing to do: in the long run continuing the coverup and refusing to admit what really happened would have hurt the U.S. far more."

As revelers nationwide bid goodbye to 2014, protesters brought in the new year by rallying in major U.S. cities, proving that the fight to end police brutality against black lives will not vanish anytime soon. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered to coincide with the evening’s celebrations. While the protests were more subdued than those held in recent weeks, many continued to rally and spread awareness of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. An activist holds her hands up during a protest march against police brutality that traveled from Union Square to Times Square on December 31, 2014 in New York City. About 100 protesters marched through New York City to Times Square on Wednesday evening where thousands were gathered to participate in the city’s popular New Year's Eve celebration. However, police reportedly blocked protesters from entering crowded areas and demonstrators instead staged “die-ins” in nearby areas. “Blow your whistle, raise your fist. We refuse to live life like this!” protesters chanted as they marched through the city. In Boston, activists held a peaceful protest outside the Boston Public Library where dozens of people staged a “die-in” to speak out against the recent deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice and Ezell Ford -- all of whom are black men who have lost their lives to police killings in the past year. Demonstrators protested and staged a die-in in Copley Square during First Night Boston 2015 on December 31, 2014 in Boston, Massachusetts Never in recent history has the concern over police brutality and racial profiling been more prevalent than it was in 2014. ""There's a lot of pressure for us not to do this but we thought it was a fundamental right that we have in this country,"" one protest organizer, Brock Satter, told CBS Boston. A small group of protesters gathered in Cleveland, Ohio, where 12-year-old Rice was shot and killed by a police officer in November. However, temperatures hit 20 degrees and the crowd reportedly began to disperse shortly before 11 p.m. “No New Year under this old system. We can't breathe,” signs read, a reference to Garner's death. Many of the night’s protests were organized by The Stop Mass Incarceration Network, which is a group committed to bringing an end to racial injustice in policing. The protests were planned to “Rock in the new year with resistance” as part of a collective effort to show the issues will not lose steam. Earlier on Wednesday, about 75 protesters stormed police headquarters in St. Louis with an “eviction notice” and called for amnesty for protesters charged with non-violent crimes. Five people were arrested while several other protesters were pepper-sprayed on camera. Meanwhile, signs posted on walls around the building read: ""We are informing you that the police department is scheduled to be reclaimed by its citizens today, December 31, 2014.” It was signed, “We the people.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/met-opera-a-new-merry-wid_b_6404302","1/1/2015","wilborn hampton","Met Opera: A New 'Merry Widow' With Renee Fleming In Widow's Weeds","It is hard to imagine a merrier widow than Renee Fleming, and she swirls through the Metropolitan Opera's sumptuous new production of Franz Lehar's popular operetta The Merry Widow with the ease of a woman who knows what she wants and knows how to get it. Joined by Kelli O'Hara, the Broadway star making her operatic debut, and the reliable baritone Nathan Gunn, the new staging by the acclaimed theater director Susan Stroman is an opulent spectacle that opened with a gala New Year's Eve premiere and will be repeated 13 more times during the season. It is an eye-popping production that the Met also will make available to audiences around the world on Jan. 17 when the matinee performance is simulcast in more than 2,000 theaters in 69 countries as part of its Live in HD series. Fleming, who has a penchant for tackling new roles, can now add operetta and Hanna Glawari, the farmer's daughter from Pontevedro who married a banker and inherited his millions when he died on their honeymoon, to her long resume. She teases her reluctant wooer Count Danilo, splendidly sung by Gunn, with the finesse of a gambler and she tosses off Lehar's melodious tunes, especially the ""Vilja Song,"" like they were dollops of cream on a Sacher torte. O'Hara is a small revelation in her first operatic outing, making the transition from the Broadway stage to the Met opera house seem as easy as a subway ride uptown. Her lovely soprano carries to the family circle and her acting talent brings credibility to the complicated role of the flirtatious Valencienne, the ambassador's wife who dallies with a young French dandy. Stroman, who has five Tony Awards to her credit as director and choreographer of Broadway musicals, brought in the designer Julian Crouch to re-create a grand set, abounding in chandeliers, for the Pontevedro Embassy in Paris (possibly too grand for a country facing bankruptcy), and a terrace garden with a view of Sacre-Coeur in the distance that morphs into a gilded Chez Maxim nightclub for the final act. Augmenting this splendid evocation of Belle Epoque Paris are William Ivey Long's costumes, widow's weeds for Fleming like few widows have ever worn, black bare-shouldered dresses dripping with diamonds, and ravishing ball gowns for O'Hara and the ladies and grandiose military attire, complete with plumed tricorn hats, for the Pontevedrian aristocrats. While the new Merry Widow is breathtaking to look at and a pleasure to hear, the staging is not without problems. The energy level flags at times, especially in the opening act when the exposition of the plot is unfolding, and there are too many pauses in the action. Operetta, a forerunner of the modern-day musical comedy, needs to move at the pace of a Broadway show, and any lag between the music and dialogue only serves to lessen the audience's involvement or concentration. But these are problems that can be corrected as the overall fine cast performs it more often. This Merry Widow is best when it is singing and dancing. Stroman's strongest suit is her choreography and from the opening waltzes and polkas to acrobatic folk dances to the shouting, skirt-flinging high steps of the grisettes at Maxim's, including a can-can during the set change, the dancing is one of the show's biggest attractions. And O'Hara is a marvel in the scene where she joins the grisette chorus line. Like most operettas, the story of The Merry Widow is a simple one. Hanna, now the toast of Paris and pursued by a horde of suitors whether available or not, keeps them all at bay. But the Pontevedro ambassador to France, Baron Zeta, wants her to marry a Pontevedrian in order to keep her millions in her native country and save it from bankruptcy. The Baron tries to enlist Count Danilo, a profligate playboy attached to the embassy, to the task. But Danilo and Hanna have a history and Danilo is not inclined to marry anyway. And Hanna wants to hear those three little words ""I love you"" from Danilo's own lips before she will even consider him. Then there's Valencienne's missing fan, with those same words written on them by her would-be French lover, to further complicate Zeta's plan. It's all froth and frivolity, but so is a lot of opera and most operetta. And that can be fun too provided there are enough bubbles to keep things light and airy.

Gunn is excellent as Danilo, his rich baritone a familiar fixture at the Met, and his duet with Hanna, familiarly known as ""The Merry Widow Waltz,"" is worth waiting for. Thomas Allen brings the role of Baron Zeta to life and Carson Elrod, in his Met debut, adds some much-needed comic relief to the role of the embassy factotum Njegus.

More specifically, how do young photographers “make it” amid all the chaos? One way is through Foam, an important center of photography in Amsterdam that has been giving out annual awards for young talent over the past seven years. This year, from a pool of 1,473 candidates across 71 countries, 21 artists have been selected. For the winners, it’s an invaluable opportunity for professional growth. Their work is touring the world: first Amsterdam, then Paris; now, at the East Wing Gallery in Dubai, until January 10th. Foam’s goal is not only to make these promising artists known to the world but also to reflect on how photography in general is changing. As we look at the winners’ work, it becomes evident that the relationship between photography and contemporary art is getting stronger and stronger. Some examples? Take the Japanese duo Nerhol, who create portraits of people by using overlapping sheets. While they seem to be digital images, they’re actually deeply unique 3D creations. Or the Canadian Émilie Régnier, who went to Africa to tell the story of the lives of young Africans who are reckoning with their future. Then there are David Lynch’s disturbing scenes, which have inspired Johnny Briggs. The latter has created some panoramas or characters with semi-human aspects quite troubling to the viewer. Yoshinori Mizutani's spectacularly direct, intimate photography reveals tiny parrots scattered throughout the sky of Tokyo. And no one's ever had closer contact with the most affluent social classes of Beijing than Charles-Henry Bédué, who dives into the realm of clothes, shoes, purses, cell phones and food, all of which are becoming symbols of power in the country. Behold, 31 photographs that will show you the future of photography. This post originally appeared on The Huffington Post Italy and was translated into English.

An Oregon man with a history of hair-related misdemeanors allegedly got caught cutting off some of a woman's locks in an Oregon City Dollar Tree store, police said. Jared Walter, 27, has been arrested several times in the past for touching himself while secretly cutting a victim's hair, according to KPTV. This time, he didn't get off so easily. The 31-year-old victim said she could feel him cutting her hair while she waited in line to pay for her items. ""So I just immediately started screaming and you know yelling like, 'get away from me,'"" she told the station. ""He is obviously showing that he is in no spot to be in public and is not a safe person."" Walter fled, but police tracked him down nearby. They charged him with harassment and also slapped him with a parole violation. KPTV reports: Walter pleaded guilty in May 2013 to charges including third-degree sex abuse and misdemeanor public indecency. He was arrested after multiple reports of lewd acts on TriMet buses in Portland and Clackamas County. Witnesses and surveillance video helped lead police to Walter. He was sentenced to jail time instead of prison, because the crimes he pleaded guilty to were misdemeanors. He was also not required to register as a sex offender. The suspect's constant clandestine clippings have earned him the moniker ""The TriMet Barber."" He was also reportedly arrested more than five years ago after police say he applied superglue to a woman's hair and then cut it while riding the bus. He's currently in the Clackamas County Jail.

The biggest U.S. city, once notorious for high crime, had 328 killings last year, the newspaper said, citing police statistics. The figure is the lowest since at least 1963, when the police department began collecting reliable statistics, and is part of a decades-long fall in U.S. crime. Reports of major crimes in New York City fell to 105,428 through Dec. 28, from 110,728 in the same period in 2013. Murders are down 85 percent from their peak in 1990, the Times said. The New York Police Department did not have full-year crime statistics immediately available. Online police data showed 315 murders through Dec. 21, down from 328 for the same period the year before. Among other big U.S. cities in 2014, Chicago had the lowest number of murders since 1965 and the lowest overall crime rate since 1972, the Chicago Police Department said in a statement. In Philadelphia, violent crime was down 7 percent from 2013 through Dec. 21, though murders were slightly higher, police data showed. Los Angeles had a 12.3 percent upturn in violent crime through Dec. 27, according to the police website. New York recorded its first murder of 2015 when a 26-year-old man was shot in the Bronx borough, a police spokesman said. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-years-resolutions-2015_b_6402040","1/1/2015","phoebe dodds","My New Year's Resolution Is to Not Make Any at All","It's that time of year again -- every friend, relative and magazine is telling you that you need to make some New Year's resolutions, because a new year means a new you, right? There are a number of problems with this: Firstly, you may be so fabulous that you don't need or want to change any aspect of yourself. If you're happy with the way your life is, that's great -- and you don't need to feel pressured to lose weight, improve your appearance or spend more time with friends you don't really like that much. Secondly, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to make drastic life changes in January. In the northern hemisphere, January is a cold, dark and depressing month, and the last thing I need is to be expected to get through it without chocolate or whatever else I have over-optimistically given up. New Year's resolutions are also usually yearlong goals, and for most people, this can be too daunting, which just leads to failure. I have given up on the ""get healthier"" resolutions, and have tried to make smaller, more achievable goals like ""walk up the stairs when possible,"" which is made drastically easier by a phobia of elevators. Another possible alternative which, sadly I only thought of today, is starting to act on my resolutions at the start of December, which would prevent the unavoidable sense of failure felt on December 31 when you realize that you didn't even manage to stick to one goal you made a year ago. I had wanted to read one novel a week, so if I'd at least managed to read four books this month, I'd feel slightly better. The same goes with ""get healthier: style resolutions -- small changes are always going to get you further than ""don't eat chocolate, sugar or pizza"" resolutions, which despite my best efforts, I always manage to break by breakfast time on January 1. A nice idea is to make monthly goals in order to achieve something bigger which could seem daunting at first -- this works well with learning a new language, because you can aim to learn a certain number or words or phrases per week, and this builds up quickly over a number of months. As my New Year's resolution this year is not to make any, I have decided to take up a skill instead, which I feel has more of a positive spin than aggressively cutting something I love eating out of my diet. My goals for 2015 are to learn a new language and go to more exhibitions, and I am keeping my definitions of ""learn"" and ""more"" purposefully vague to avoid any feelings of disappointment when I enter 2016 a year from now, having visited two exhibitions and learnt four words of Portuguese. It is probably also worth remembering that despite what popular culture tells us, you don't need to wait until the New Year to make drastic life changes. If there is something you want to do to improve yourself or your life in general, you can start at any time. It's just probably best to take things slowly and make small-scale goals to avoid returning to square one after a couple of weeks.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/start-2015-with-this-easy_b_6402306","1/1/2015","julie niehoff","Get a Jump on 2015 With This Easy 30-Minute Marketing Plan","I've asked many small business people the seemingly unwelcome question, ""Do you have a marketing plan?"" Most, about 90 percent, don't want me to ask. Their shoulders slump, they look at the floor and they deflect. It breaks my heart -- not because they don't have one but because they get so down on themselves for having to say no. I'm here to say I get it. I've worn those shoes as a busy business owner myself. I never ask out of judgement or to shame anyone, but that's how they feel. Following are instructions for creating a very basic (and flexible) marketing plan that will bend with your ever-changing schedule. It is my new years gift to the countless professionals I've met who are making it happen, every day, running their businesses and legitimately do no not have time or the wherewithal to create a full-blown marketing plan for their business. Spend 20, okay maybe 30 minutes this week on this 4 step process and you'll have something to work with for 2015. Before we start, it's important to note that this is not your marketing consultant's marketing plan for your business in 2015 -- that comes later when you have a minute to gather your thoughts and realize you might be able to justify paying a professional. Nope, this is your ""I-run-the-business-have-no-extra-time-may-be-working-new-year's-day-seriously-no-time-for-a-big-thing"" plan. You will need a calendar, a highlighter, a pen or pencil and a handful of sticky notes. You can also do this on a computer/mobile device using your calendar app but for the quick half-hour in and out version, stick to analog. Step 1 - Highlight Dates Affected By Anything Set In StoneSo, standard holidays should be highlighted, the big conference you already paid to attend should be highlighted, Probably should go ahead and highlight date of the Super Bowl, Stanley Cup or US Open -- whatever you're into and might want to plan around. Highlight first and last days of school for the nearest district to your business. Highlight your birthday and the birthdays of those you should acknowledge. If you want to get fancy, use a different color for the personal stuff, but make sure it's highlighted if you need to be aware of it. Now highlight several days before and after any of the big holidays that might include promotions for your business. Those are key for build-up and wind down. Wondering why personal stuff might be on your marketing plan? Because you're busy running the business and it's important to plan around the big stuff in your own life -- it is meant to help you find balance without having to lose sight of everything on your plate. Step 2 - Write Down Events or Promos you are Pretty Sure Will HappenIf you always do a sidewalk sale the week before Christmas, write that down -- it should already be highlighted, at least partially. Do you have special offers for big local events or want to? Write it down. For example, in Austin every business should have SXSW convention and Austin City Limits music festival written on their calendar. These bring in business -- even if you're b2b, then it affects your client's businesses and you should be ready to work around it, prepare for it. If you know you are going to send out a monthly newsletter by email, write that down. Step 3 - Use the Sticky Notes to Put in Ideas for Promotions or ContentThey are sticky notes because you might move them around. I highly suggest you use the ""super sticky"" version of these magical notepads. They stay on and make this easier. For instance, always running behind when the holidays arrive because you've been too busy running the business to plan for a special promotion? Now is the time, yes in January, to plan for next year's special offers and marketing ideas. You have time to plan a little at a time and if it's on the calendar, you'll see it coming. Use the sticky notes to add in content ideas too -- what you might post on social media or in an email blast, or both. You can add stickies anytime, or email yourself if you're away and use the subject line ""marketing sticky"". Then you can find them easily when needed. Step 4 - Put it all in a file folder that sits on or near your deskKeep the plan an arm's length away. Consider writing down your social media and email marketing account logins on the inside of the folder. That way, if you need to delegate at any point, you can simply hand over the plan and that person can hit the ground running. If you need some marketing ideas, pull a sticky from one time to where you need it -- easy edits. If you find yourself answering the same question over and over, add a sticky note to share the answer with all of your followers and email subscribers. And that's pretty much it. What you have created is a living, breathing document that will change over time, will grow with your needs and can be adapted later. Again, it's not the work of a marketing Ph.D. -- it's a quick resource for the real world of a small business. You can finally say the words, ""Yes, I have a marketing plan"", knowing maybe It's not the end-all-be-all but it is at least a start. Hold your head high, plan in hand, ready to take on 2015. It's going to be a great year! #YouCanDoThis"
"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biological-bad-luck-cancer_n_6404184","1/1/2015","reuters","Biological 'Bad Luck' Blamed In Two-Thirds Of Cancer Cases","By Will Dunham WASHINGTON, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Plain old bad luck plays a major role in determining who gets cancer and who does not, according to researchers who found that two-thirds of cancer incidence of various types can be blamed on random mutations and not heredity or risky habits like smoking. The researchers said on Thursday random DNA mutations accumulating in various parts of the body during ordinary cell division are the prime culprits behind many cancer types. They looked at 31 cancer types and found that 22 of them, including leukemia and pancreatic, bone, testicular, ovarian and brain cancer, could be explained largely by these random mutations - essentially biological bad luck. The other nine types, including colorectal cancer, skin cancer known as basal cell carcinoma and smoking-related lung cancer, were more heavily influenced by heredity and environmental factors like risky behavior or exposure to carcinogens. Overall, they attributed 65 percent of cancer incidence to random mutations in genes that can drive cancer growth. ""When someone gets cancer, immediately people want to know why,"" said oncologist Dr. Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, who conducted the study published in the journal Science with Johns Hopkins biomathematician Cristian Tomasetti. ""They like to believe there's a reason. And the real reason in many cases is not because you didn't behave well or were exposed to some bad environmental influence, it's just because that person was unlucky. It's losing the lottery."" Tomasetti said harmful mutations occur for ""no particular reason other than randomness"" as the body's master cells, called stem cells, divide in various tissues. Tomasetti said the study indicates that changing one's lifestyle and habits like smoking to avoid cancer risks may help prevent certain cancers, but may not be as effective for others. ""Thus, we should focus more research and resources on finding ways to detect such cancers at early, curable stages,"" Tomasetti added. The researchers charted the cumulative number of lifetime divisions in the stem cells of a given tissue - for example, lungs or colon - and compared that to the lifetime cancer risk in that tissue. Generally speaking, tissues that undergo more divisions - thus increasing the probability of random mutations - were more prone to tumors.

No doubt some Members of Congress - presumably, the ones who aren't busy resigning for felony tax evasion or defending themselves for schmoozing with white supremacists -- will try to gin up an outrage festival and demand sanctions on the Palestinians for exercising their rights. ""Ring out the old, bring in the new."" Let's ignore these voices. Let's see if we can find ten conscientious Members of Congress who are willing to say, ""Actually, the Palestinians have the right to do this if they want, and they shouldn't be punished for signing up for the rule of law."" It's kind of funny, in a not ha-ha way, how twisted the public discourse in the U.S. is, that we even have to defend the proposition that the Palestinians should join the ICC if they want. But we do. Exhibit A: this New York Times editorial, slamming Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for applying for Palestine to join the ICC. The ""liberal"" NYT editors concede that ""prospects for a two-state solution grow dimmer by the day, with ... the Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, steadily expanding settlements, making the creation of a viable Palestinian state harder,"" and that ""in joining the International Criminal Court...the Palestinians could bring charges against Israeli officials for cases against their settlement activities."" But then -- in complete contradiction to that which they just conceded -- they claim that ""Abbas's actions will almost certainly make the situation worse, setting back the cause of statehood even farther."" Sadly, like still-too-many American liberals, the NYT editors claim to oppose Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank, but object far more strenuously to anyone actually trying to do anything concrete to stop it. Is it any wonder that ""prospects for a two-state solution grow dimmer by the day,"" when the purported tribunes of American liberalism oppose any practical and concrete measure to try to save it? Fortunately, in 2015, we don't need to rely on the ""liberal"" New York Times to defend the basic principles of decency and fair play. We can do it ourselves. You can write to Congress and the President here."

But if footage from the unofficial afterparty is to be believed, it's a minor miracle that the city didn't burn to the ground. It's hard to take anything on the Internet at face value, but one thing's for sure: This video is cray cray. A Reddit user posted this raw footage to one of the site's video forums on New Year's Day.

Called ""Only One,"" the track is sung by West from the vantage point of his late mother, Donda West, with McCartney adding accompaniment on keyboard. ""One day, you'll be the man you always knew you would be,"" West sings. ""And if you knew how proud I was, you'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that."" A press release announcing the song said ""Only One"" was the ""first publicly available recording from what has become a prolific musical collaboration between these two legendary artists."" The release also included some backstory on the project: In early 2014, Paul McCartney and Kanye West first began working together in a small bungalow in Los Angeles. The process that would result in ""Only One"" began with a simple brainstorming session between the two: With McCartney improvising on the keyboards and Kanye vocally sketching and shaping ideas in a stream-of-consciousness riff. When they played back the recording afterward, something remarkable happened. Kanye sat there with his family, holding his daughter North on his lap, and listened to his vocals, singing, ""Hello, my only one . . . "" And in that moment, not only could he not recall having sung those words, but he realized that perhaps the words had never really come from him. The process of artistic creation is one that does not involve thinking, but often channeling. And he understood in that moment that his late mother, Dr. Donda West, who was also his mentor, confidante, and best friend, had spoken through him that day. ""My mom was singing to me, and through me to my daughter,"" he said, astonished. We're in, and so is Kanye's wife, Kim Kardashian: People always ask me what my favorite Kanye song is and it's Only One. Kanye feels like his mom sang thru him to our daughter. I cry every time I hear this song Listen to the track over at West's website; it's also available for purchase on iTunes. Check out the lyrics to ""Only One,"" via West's site, below.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/6-things-that-barack-obam_b_6403848","1/1/2015","matthew lynch","6 Things That Barack Obama Did for P-20 Education in 2014","When Barack Obama assumed the presidency, a nasty set of problems confronted him in P-20 education. High student loan debt, lack of affordable early childhood education options and everything in between were put in the President's lap and have been the very issues he has addressed in both terms. Given the nature and sheer number of challenges, his administration has done a great deal to foster positive change and progress. In a bid to build upon his already stellar record on education Obama implemented a number of education reform initiatives in 2014. 1. Making colleges accountable for standardized test scores. In April, President Obama announced that colleges with education programs would soon be held accountable for the future standardized test scores of the pupils of their graduates, at least when it comes to federal fund incentives. The president's proposal plans to reward nearly $100 million per year in federal grants to education schools that have proven to turn out the best teachers -- some of that measured in the standardized test scores graduates are producing in their classrooms. Federal scholarship aid, then, will be based less on student need and more on the performance of graduates from those programs. 2. Plans to improve teacher preparation. The Obama administration unveiled a plan this year to regulate how the U.S. prepares teachers, stating that too many new K-12 educators are not trained properly or ready for the classroom. Under the proposal, the government would require states to issue report cards for teacher preparation programs at public universities and private colleges. Alternative programs run by school districts and nonprofits would not be exempt. For the first time, the rating systems would reflect on how teacher candidates perform after graduation. The system would consider whether they accept jobs in their subject field, how long they stay and how their students perform academically. The proposed changes will not take effect immediately; states would not be required to issue report cards for teacher programs until April of 2019. Under the proposal, states would rate programs as ""low-performing,"" ""at-risk,"" ""effective"" or ""exceptional."" Programs receiving ratings of ""low-performing"" or ""at-risk"" for two consecutive years would lose federal Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grants, which give up to $4,000 a year to teacher preparation candidates who consent to work full time for four academic years in high-need fields and struggling schools. While there is no evidence these regulations will lead to improvement, the proposed plan does seem to be on the right track to prepare our country's teachers for the reality of the modern day U.S. classroom. It is in everyone's best interest to train teachers right from the start to ensure our students are getting the best instruction possible from day one. 3. Tightened rules for undocumented K-12 students. This year the Obama administration strengthened its stance on protecting public school students who are undocumented immigrants. The policy includes guidelines on appropriate and inappropriate enrollment practices and it takes the place of similar wording from 2011. The guidelines are just a small piece of a larger push for immigration reform from the Obama Administration. In 2011, Obama showed his support for immigrants and their right to education when he enacted the Dream Act that halted deportations of students and in some cases, their families. While the student portion of this legislation got a lot of attention, it also took a closer look at avoiding deportations of low-priority immigrants without criminal records. Immigration reform is certainly a hot topic in Washington, especially as education funding seems to always be feeling a tight squeeze. Providing education to undocumented immigrant children, however, is an investment in the future economy of the country and should be considered a right -- even for those who have entered the country illegally, but not of their own accord. 4. Worked to improve Native American education. President Barack Obama has pledged to work with tribal nations to make sure Native Americans have equal educational and economic opportunities. The President said the administration is determined to partner with tribes, and that the relationship with Washington and tribal nations is the strongest it has ever been. His intended efforts include the expansion of opportunity among Native Americans. Dozens of steps intended to improve the Bureau of Indian Education are being rolled out by the administration with the goal of boosting the academic achievement of Native American students, and also support economic development in tribal communities. The efforts include creating a blueprint for redesigning the Bureau of Indian Education and supporting digital learning by providing schools and dormitories with high-speed Internet. I am so glad that Obama recognizes the many issues Native Americans in this country are facing. They deserve to have equal education and economic opportunities like the rest of us. I think Obama's efforts are spot on and hope that very soon, Native Americans will benefit from the changes he has initiated. 5. Implemented a millennial initiative that targets student loan debt.The Obama Administration formed an initiative targeted at Millennials (currently ages 18 to 34) and some of their most important life issues, including student loan assistance, technology use, job placement and educational spending by the government. The President's emphasis on the cost of higher education will certainly appeal to Millennials, many of whom came of age during the economic decline and are still thousands of dollars in debt from student loans. Addressing these concerns, along with how the government should and will help Millennials work through them, shows an understanding from the administration that seems to be lacking on the other side of the aisle. It's no secret that Millennials are increasing in influence but also face financial insecurity. The Millennial age group is also the most dominant electoral group and is expected to show a lot of influence in the midterm elections. Addressing the issues of this youngest adult generation is smart because it impacts the rest of the country too. The more secure Millennials are in their careers, finances and other areas of life, the better off the country as a whole. 6. Announced a $1 billion early education investment. In December, President Obama announced $1 billion in early education investments that will come from a combination of public and private commitments. Speaking at the White House Summit on Early Education, the President laid out the details for Invest in US, a public awareness campaign meant to bring attention to the great need for high quality early childhood education throughout the country. The campaign will run in partnership with the First Five Years initiative and its participating philanthropic organizations. The next four years will change America forever.

The President said that $333 million has already been committed by private partners, and another $750 million in federal funding will go towards programs like Early Head Start and the Preschool Development Grants. The President has been a staunch supporter of stronger early childhood education programs with federal backing since he first took office. This move represents more than just rhetoric, however. It shows the President's commitment to putting plans in motion to give American children, regardless of income, a chance to reap the proven benefits of early childhood endeavors. The first step to having K-12 students who are able to meet the academic demands of the contemporary classroom is to enroll those students first in strong preschool programs -- and that starts with making it affordable for all families.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-the-sony-hack-is-chan_b_6403808","1/1/2015","adam levin","How the Sony Hack Is Changing the Way I Work","If the past two years have revealed anything, it's that every conceivable mode of communication comes with its share of serious privacy and security issues. Email can be hijacked, mail servers can be breached and malware can turn your smartphone into a peepshow. Wikileaks revealed that even our phone conversations are at risk. That said, don't panic! It's highly unlikely anyone is listening to your phone calls. (OK, it's possible, but you'd have to be incredibly sloppy or unlucky enough to download call-intercepting malware, or targeted by folks who can handle a price tag that hovers north of the million-dollar mark.) The more relevant point here is that the Big Data mills at the NSA that may or may not be crunching your calls don't care if you're negotiating the sale of Ford to General Motors, much less if you've been naughty or nice - unless you're a world leader or someone perceived as a threat to America. So what about the other, more likely ways you may be exposed? There are man-in-the-middle attacks that are fairly affordable for a hacker. There's malware from friend (hard to spot) and foe (you can't be alert to every danger every second of the day). It almost seems like the only way to be completely safe from intrusion is to have nothing you wouldn't want broadcast or skywritten on your smartphone, nothing you wouldn't want the world to know about in your browser history, not a single text message you want to keep private and no phone calls made or received that you don't want to share with Dr. Phil and his audience. This past year was nothing less than terrifying. JPMorgan Chase and Home Depot joined the ever-growing list of mega-breach victims. Sony Pictures was gutted, with career-killing emails sent hither and yon, servers erased and trade secrets and intellectual property joyously tossed like flower petals from a float in the Rose Bowl parade. The hack initially stopped the release of The Interview, costing the studio millions, and that's not taking into account future losses associated with class-action lawsuits brought by current and former employees whose personally identifiable information was stolen and published for the world to see, or enforcement actions by various and sundry state and federal regulators. It's major stuff. And then there were all those other cybercrimes of 2014. It all makes for a really uneasy feeling at the workplace. The trend here is simply too clear: Nothing is sacrosanct and nothing is beyond reach. And while there may be no way to keep prying eyes out of our email, there is a way to keep the most sensitive information pertaining to your business out of reach. With that thought foremost in my mind, it is, indeed, time to make some serious changes in 2015. Call me old-fashioned, but I think I'd rather take my chances with the government listening to my phone calls. How about you? When I say, ""phone call,"" I mean literally, like, on the phone -- and I say this because of all the ways we communicate, a landline affords the better shot at privacy and a more secure mode of communication. The act of getting out of a chair and walking down the corridor to talk to a colleague helps to burn off holiday excesses, builds inter-office rapport and can't be hacked. Email and text have supplanted the collegial walk-by. There are those who will say that it's not efficient to pick up the phone. I'm not sure I buy that. Email and text streamline workflow only in theory. Each is just a swipe or click away from the major time-sucks provided by social media. And the interaction that happens without the interference of keystrokes or thumbing a screen provides sparks that just don't happen in the dynamic-free zone of tit-for-tat correspondence. And again, a face-to-face or headset-to-headset conversation is probably the most secure mode of communication in the post-Sony hack world.

I'm sure it will take some getting used to, but if anyone at my office needs a fast answer from me, I'm going to ask that whenever possible they tap my doorframe or give me call. Beyond the security considerations, the truth is that I actually like talking to people and I ultimately learn more about whatever it is we're talking about. For all their convenience, emails and texts are far from perfect modes of communication. Much meaning is lost when communicating by keystroke. Anyone who's emailed a sarcastic quip that was taken literally will confirm this. There are other options. Sony Pictures had to revert to communication via fax during the days following the hack, but faxes leave too much to chance since you never know who's waiting on the other end of your transmission, and there's the added possibility that you might dial a wrong number. If smoke signals weren't so easy to spot, I'd suggest that route. And while it's true that you never know when a fake cell tower's going to roll into your neighborhood, using the phone and having more face-to-face discussions at the office are perhaps the better ways to engage in team building in 2015 through a group commitment to data security.

But as for exactly what caused the the ancient civilization to collapse around 900 A.D., that's long been a bit of a mystery. Now a team of researchers from Rice University and Louisiana State University think they may be one step closer to cracking the mystery, thanks in part to evidence from the ""Great Blue Hole."" The massive sinkhole located in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Belize was made popular by pioneering conservationist Jacques Cousteau, who visited it in 1971 and declared it one of the world's best scuba diving sites. The researchers analyzed sediment samples from the Blue Hole, looking specifically at variations in color, grain size, and layer thickness. They also examined samples from the Belize Central Shelf Lagoon, a body of water attached to the mainland, noting differences in the samples' ratio of titanium to aluminum, which helps provide an estimate for rainfall levels. The analyses revealed low levels of precipitation and a drop in the frequency of tropical cyclones from 800 to 900 A.D. in the Yucatan peninsula--which suggests the region was hit by a major drought at the time, the researchers told The Huffington Post in an email. The research also suggested that another major drought hit the region between 1000 and 1100 A.D., around when the Maya city of Chichen Itza is believed to have fallen. ""When you have major droughts, you start to get famines and unrest,"" study co-author Dr. André Droxler, an earth scientist at Rice, told Live Science. The research on the lagoon was presented on Dec. 16 at the American Geophysical Union's 2014 Fall Meeting in San Francisco, and the study on the Blue Hole samples was published Jan. 2014 in the journal Scientific Reports. The research builds upon previous studies suggesting climate change precipitated the Mayas' downfall. A 2012 study of a stalagmite from a cave in Belize linked the region's population collapse to a ""drying trend"" between 600 and 1000 A.D. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-2015-gop-clown-car-bi_b_6402678","1/1/2015","richard zombeck","The 2015 GOP Clown Car: Bigger, Meaner, and More Dangerous Than Ever","Another year gone and another string of long-winded, factually inaccurate, and manufactured comments from the clowns in the Republican Party are behind us. With every passing year that the little clown car pulls up it seems to get a little bigger and every year more and more clowns pour out and step up to the podium to obfuscate and pontificate. Nearly everything they say would lead one to believe that they are impervious to reality and yet their statements are made in such a way and with such confidence that it's as if they had received the message from God Himself. When you pay attention to the news and politics as much as I do, you get to a point where a facepalm is a frequent occurrence. Eventually eye rolls are more common. And hopefully, if you've managed to maintain a shred of your sanity, you get the occasional chuckle out of hearing someone in politics bloviate about something they apparently know nothing about. Having any faith in humanity makes it hard to believe or accept that some of these folks actually believe what they're saying. Common sense would dictate otherwise, but not everyone is blessed with common sense. After all, people vote for morons, usually against their own best interest, and people watch FOX News despite evidence that the channel gets its facts wrong more than 50 percent of the time. In fact, Fox News host Sean Hannity got the award for ""Worst Host"" in a poll conducted by the Mediaite website. Mediaite asked fellow media members to pick the best and worst of cable news networks: Fox, MSNBC, and CNN. Respondents were told that their votes would be kept anonymous to encourage honesty. Hannity won hands down and he didn't take it well as evidenced by an epic, public, all caps, tantrum on Twitter. The most ridiculous comments seem to come from Republicans and I would defy anyone to say otherwise. I have yet to see anyone come up with a list of comments from liberals that comes close, in volume or content, to lists of stupid things Republicans or conservatives say on a fairly regular and consistent basis. It might be low hanging fruit, but there's a lot of it and every time one of them opens their mouths America becomes a little more ignorant. Hannity isn't alone. The Republicans, as a whole, have been wrong about nearly everything this past year. As Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman writes in the New York Times: All year Americans have been bombarded with dire news reports portraying a world out of control and a clueless government with no idea what to do. Yet if you look back at what actually happened over the past year, you see something completely different. Amid all the derision, a number of major government policies worked just fine -- and the biggest successes involved the most derided policies. You'll never hear this on Fox News, but 2014 was a year in which the federal government, in particular, showed that it can do some important things very well if it wants to. There are some good points in the article and Krugman provides some clear examples of how the Republicans were ridiculously wrong about their cartoonish view of a tyrannical, weak, and useless government. Among the issues the right-wing clown machine got wrong were Ebola, the economy, and health care according to Krugman. While the GOP was busy spreading fear and propaganda, the rest of us watched as Ebola was not the epidemic that would wipe out the country the way the pre-midterm hysteria made it out to be. As it turns out the CDC (a government agency) knows what they're doing and America wasn't over run with Ebola or members of ISIS and Mexican drug cartels flesh-eating disease carrying zombies. The GOP gave it their best shot, though. Representative Phil Gingrey (GA) tried to tell us that illegal immigrants were carrying Ebola across the border via drug gangs: As a physician for over 30 years, I am well aware of the dangers infectious diseases pose. In fact, infectious diseases remain in the top 10 causes of death in the United States... Reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu, dengue fever, Ebola virus and tuberculosis are particularly concerning. Rep. Steve Stockman (TX) thought there was something more nefarious afoot and that any potential action or inaction by the federal government would somehow lead to American citizens losing their rights and freedom: It's just a strange non-response, a strange way of handling it and I think that if it does go forward and we do not control it, there may be an overreaction where the government starts taking away the rights of those that aren't that necessarily involved or need that to happen,"" he said. ""I hope that's not the case, but as you know this current government uses crisis to advance their philosophy and their agenda. In the end, conveniently after the midterms, it turned out that Ebola was limited to less than a half-dozen people in the U.S. and only one person died. We haven't heard about it since. The economy has improved dramatically. Private sector jobs are increasing, the stock market is going gangbusters, gas prices are down, and last quarter the economy showed the fastest growth in a decade. Forbes magazine even had the audacity to say that Obama's economy out-performed that of the GOPs lord and savior, the great Ronald Reagan. Not bad for a Muslim-Nazi-business-hating communist. That brings us to Obamacare, the single most hated GOP issue. Ten million more people with health insurance, most for the first time and tens of thousands of lives saved in a single year. Sure, the website didn't run too well for a month and that was covered ad nauseam on every news channel and pointed out by every member of the GOP around the clock, but when it comes to lives saved and made better? Crickets. Add to the obvious benefits that tens of thousands of bankruptcies and ruined lives that will be avoided. The media and the GOP went completely dark on the entire up-side. Apparently a lack of suffering doesn't make headlines. On Obamacare, Krugman writes: In fact, Year 1 surpassed expectations on every front. Remember claims that more people would lose insurance than gained it? Well, the number of Americans without insurance fell by around 10 million; members of the elite who have never been uninsured have no idea just how much positive difference that makes to people's lives. Remember claims that reform would break the budget? In reality, premiums were far less than predicted, overall health spending is moderating, and specific cost-control measures are doing very well. And all indications suggest that year two will be marked by further success. While the GOP fought affordable health care every step of the way by delaying, trying to repeal it, blocking, and even shutting down the government in the name of liberty, human suffering, and needless deaths, Obamacare remains, for now, a reality. The list of other things that Republicans were wrong about is fairly long, but here are a few that Krugman didn't get to that stand out. Marriage equality has been accepted by most of the country and children haven't magically become gay or started having sex with farm animals. Marijuana has been legalized for full use in two states and medical use in others and no cartels have taken over Midwestern towns -- in fact, drug cartels are out billions of dollars as a result. Obama's immigration policies haven't allowed swarms of illegal immigrants into the country with calves the size of cantaloupes and pregnant women from ISIS haven't dropped anchor babies on U.S. soil. Minimum wage has gone up in multiple states and corporations haven't moved to third world countries or had to apply for welfare. And you can now buy a Cuban cigar without being shot in the street. All in all, despite the GOPs best efforts, things have gone pretty well and some significant things have been accomplished. The next four years will change America forever.

A car full of gun loving, poor hating, veteran screwing, climate change denying, Wall Street deregulating, health care repealing, and wealthy old white man loving clowns. Their plans so far include repealing Dodd-Frank, cutting and privatizing social security, cutting pensions, defunding Obamacare, eliminating food stamps and welfare, raising taxes on the middle class and working poor, cutting taxes for the super-rich and corporations, and who knows how many other Benghazi, IRS, and impeachment hearings we'll have to endure. They have the numbers to do what they want and by this time next year we could be having a completely different conversation in a completely different country. While it hasn't been a great year, I'm thankful that the GOP has provided me with the low hanging fruit only they are capable of providing and I'm looking forward to 2015 and the prospect of more ridiculous claims and comments.

Well, of course it’s not that simple; for one thing, the earth is not as flat as the pages of a map, so maps must be distorted to some degree. Choices must be made about which towns and cities will be put on the map, where to draw certain borders. To some extent, nearly every map contains an agenda, whether political, sociological, or commercial. A recent book by Tim Bryars and Tom Harper, A History of the 20th Century in 100 Maps, charts the political and social upheavals of the last century by means of maps, digging below the functional surface to reveal how maps of the time reflected popular ideas, prejudices, and waves of progress. The 20th century, the authors explain, was a particularly fertile time for mapmakers, and the book showcases maps in the form of picture postcards, board games, and book endpapers, maps meant for government purposes and maps intended for mass consumption. The highly eclectic result serves in itself as a reminder of the myriad ways in which we see and interpret the world around us. The map excerpted below, a 1900 board game entitled A Trip to the Continent, may only seem like a map in the loosest sense, but its depiction of the geography and travel routes between England and Continental Europe offers a telling glimpse into its era. Though no rulebook is available, players would presumably race from London to Berlin, choosing from three available routes and likely using dice or a spinner to determine their progress. The game seems painfully simple, but the layout is fascinating. As the authors note, “A decade later a ‘race to Berlin’ would have carried entirely different connotations, but in the years leading up to the Great War, Germany was one of the top tourist destinations.” The concept of continental travel as a popular pastime also bespeaks the increasing ease of international travel around the turn of the 20th century, the authors point out: “Travel would never again be the preserve of a monied elite … Some Britons were already seeking out unspoiled corners where they wouldn’t hear another English voice, especially a ‘cockney’ or lower-class one.” Sound familiar? Here's the full board game, excerpted with permission from A History of the Twentieth Century in 100 Maps; for more about the game and 99 other fascinating maps from the previous century, consult the full book:  Reprinted with permission from A History of the Twentieth Century in 100 Maps by Tim Bryars and Tom Harper, published in the United States by the University of Chicago Press.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reading-challenges_n_6401738","1/1/2015","claire fallon","The Problem With Reading Competitively","Many of us readers like to think of ourselves as unlike everyone else. We’re not macho or ego-driven, but retiring, introspective, and thoughtful, right? But anyone who’s spent time around bookworms knows we can be deeply competitive, whether we’re airily noting the time we read War and Peace in seventh grade or offhandedly mentioning that we read 200 books a year, no big deal. These two forms of literary competition tend to belong to warring factions, the snobs and the every-reader. The snob turns up her nose at the idea that reading 15 Y.A. books means anything at all, as she prefers to read Dostoevsky; the every-reader reviles snobs who “tell people how to read,” but often loves to humblebrag about how many books (Y.A. or non-) he plowed through last week. Regardless, we’re almost all competing, on some level, to be the best, most readery reader we know. Increasingly, with literary snobbishness on its heels (after all, it’s hard to love a snob), the every-reader seems to be dictating the rules, and the rules of the game are: read more books and win. New Year’s is a particularly competitive season, as we tot up our year’s worth of books and set more ambitious goals for next year. People write articles or tweets about their own reading resolutions, and suddenly even our ambitious goals seem pathetic, and must be augmented again. One writer felt the need to assure readers that though she’s not taking the Goodreads Reading Challenge in 2015, she’ll probably still read 100 books this year -- yes, even when we’re not competing, we’re competing. Admittedly, it’s hard to resist a little competition. For those of us who loved reading as kids, we quickly learned to associate reading massive piles of books with earning Accelerated Reader points and personal pan pizzas, and it’s hard to let go of that feeling of urgency even when we supposedly mature. My boyfriend has even gotten into it by proxy. Recently, he mentioned that a friend had told him that his wife reads 10 books a month. In a somewhat smug tone, he added, “I bet you read more than that, though, right?” Yep, just two bros, arguing over whose significant other reads more books every 30 days. I felt a petty urge to say “Yeah, of course,” but I knew I couldn’t -- and what’s more, I suddenly hated the part of myself that cared about “winning.” There’s a quote I often see on literary Pinterests and Facebook walls, usually Photoshopped onto an image of dusty bookshelves: “In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.” This quote, attributed to Mortimer J. Adler, the author of How to Read a Book, espouses an easy-to-love sentiment: It’s not about winning, but about having a rich experience. Yet how many of us self-identified bookworms love to casually drop into conversation that we read a book a day, or avidly update our Goodreads pages to ensure everyone knows we’ve read yet another book? Last year, my New Year’s resolution was to be a better reader, and it led to a blissful year of reading. Instead of spending my evenings with Netflix, I spent them with novels -- usually -- and I convinced my boyfriend to lower the volume of his football games so I could read on the couch without finding myself watching NFL RedZone all day. After starting as an editor at HuffPost Books, things have only gotten better. A friend asked me the other day if reading for work makes it less fun, and I honestly answered no; reading is a skill that grows more pleasurable and fulfilling the more we practice it, and being pushed to read more only enhances my joy in it. That said, I shy away from set resolutions to read a certain number of books next year. Pushing myself to read more and more books can lead to undesirable consequences -- dismissing longer or more difficult books as too much of a time investment, racing through books that would yield more if I read them more slowly. I don't just want to become a more prolific reader, but a better reader, and, in the words of Mortimer Adler, ""You must tackle books that are beyond you ... unless you stretch, you will not learn.""

Log in to hide these messages. There’s a small, competitive voice in my head urging me to make 2015 the year I read more books than ever, but my New Year’s resolution is to ignore that voice. I’m not even going to resolve to read the “impressive” books I shamefully long to be able to drop into party conversation, like Ulysses or Infinite Jest, though I plan to read them someday (apparently they're pretty good). Instead, I’m just resolving to use my reading time more meaningfully, not getting through books but letting them get through to me. I want to take more notes, maybe even annotate my pristine pages, and invest my time in fully exploring those books that offer the most to me as a reader. I want 2015 to be the year that I don’t pick up the 170-page book solely because the 600-page one would prevent me from carving new notches on my bookcase. After all, one of the best books I read this year demanded great commitment and many hours from me -- far more than most I read -- and it was worth every second. I want to read complex, stylized books like Eimear McBride’s A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing slowly, deliberately, examining the artistic choices and subtleties of meaning, not hastily, with a buzz in the back of my head reminding me of all the other books I need to get to next. We’ve long been proponents here at HuffPost Books of unaccelerated, even slow reading. This year, I am resolving to apply that philosophy more mindfully to my own reading practices. Here’s hoping that we’ll all stop feeling like we have to read at the speed of light -- and make sure everyone knows -- in the new year.

La actividad aeróbica o los ejercicios que necesitan de más oxigeno como caminar, trotar, nadar, bailar, esquiar, pedalear, favorecen el sistema cardiovascular, disminuyen la presión sanguínea y mejoran la circulación, lo que reduce el riesgo de ataques cardíacos y accidentes cerebrovasculares. 2. Ayuda en la prevención de cáncer de colon, ya que acelera el paso de los desechos por los intestinos. Asimismo, al regular los niveles hormonales, puede contribuir a evitar el cáncer de mama y de próstata. 3. Hacer ejercicio contribuye a una mejor salud mental, reduce el estrés, la ansiedad e incluso las fobias y los ataques de pánico. Es muy funcional como apoyo en el tratamiento contra la depresión, tan efectivo como los medicamentos, pero sin efectos secundarios. 4. El impacto en los huesos es muy positivo. En los niños puede aumentar la densidad ósea, en los adolescentes los fortalece y en la vida adulta retrasa la degeneración. Puede prevenir la osteoporosis. 5. Con el ejercicio el sistema inmune se acelera de manera temporal, aumenta su capacidad y defensas para el organismo. 6. Realizar actividad física con regularidad ayuda a mantener un nivel saludable de azúcar en la sangre, que no sólo contribuye a controlar el peso, sino a evitar el riesgo de padecer diabetes tipo 2. 7. Con el ejercicio puedes mantener tu peso ideal, ya que si quemas calorías es posible que alcances un equilibrio de energía. 8. El flujo de oxígeno al cerebro aumenta, por lo que la capacidad de aprendizaje, concentración, memoria y estado de alerta pueden mejorar de manera considerable. 9. Beneficia la calidad del sueño. Un estilo de vida activo puede significar un sueño más reparador y profundo, que estimula la concentración en el día, aumenta tu productividad y propicia un mejor estado de ánimo. 10. En los músculos, no sólo aumenta la oxigenación, tono, fuerza y volumen, también favorece la flexibilidad, la fuerza de los tendones y los ligamentos.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-breakthrough-with-cuba_b_6401040","1/1/2015","william m. leo gr,e","The Breakthrough With Cuba: How It Happened and What Happens Next","For weeks, rumors had been swirling around Washington and Havana that changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba were in the works. Then, on December 17, President Barack Obama and President Raúl Castro made simultaneous announcements of a radical change in relations between the two countries. Not only would USAID subcontractor Alan Gross and the three remaining Cubans spies of the Cuban Five be going home -- which was the deal most observers had anticipated -- but Cuba and the United States also would expand trade and travel, and restore full diplomatic relations. Although President Obama had said repeatedly that he thought the old policy of isolation and hostility toward Havana no longer made any sense, for six years he did little to change it. Then in one announcement, he reversed 50 years of U.S. policy, completely revamping the basic framework and premises of the relationship. What happened to finally break the log-jam? First, the political calculus changed. Recent polls from the Atlantic Council and Florida International University showed that the public in general and Cuban-Americans in particular supported reconciliation between Washington and Havana. Comments by prominent exiles like Alfie Fanjul and the Barcardi family expressing a desire to do business in Cuba showed that even stalwart anti-Castro leaders in the community were ready for change. Hillary Clinton's public declaration that the embargo ought to be lifted, and former Governor Charlie Crist's promise to go to Cuba during his gubernatorial run indicated that seasoned politicians recognized the shifting mood of the electorate. Weighing the evidence, the White House concluded that Cuba was no longer the third rail of Florida politics. And of course, Obama doesn't have to run for re-election anyway. The president deferred to Florida Democrats by not acting until after the mid-term elections, just as he did in 2010 when he delayed announcing more liberal travel regulations until January 2011. But the political decision to do something on Cuba had already been made and negotiations with Havana were already underway. Most of the foreign-policy establishment concluded long ago that Washington's policy of hostility toward Havana made no sense, but because Cuba was a low priority issue during Obama's first term, establishment figures rarely spoke out about it -- until they began to sense that the policy was in flux. When 44 former U.S. government officials signed an open letter to the president in May 2014 urging him to deepen U.S. engagement with the island, Cuba-watchers speculated that something must be afoot. Hardliners who opposed any change in U.S. policy (except to make it tougher) thought so, too, because they counter-attacked with a letter of their own signed by 17 members of Congress urging Obama to stand firm. Then the New York Times editorial board weighed in with not one but six editorials urging dramatic changes in policy toward Cuba. The unprecedented barrage of long, tightly argued pieces reverberated across the country, prompting both the Washington Post and Miami Herald to run counterpoints urging Obama to leave the policy of hostility in place. Surely, the rumor mill speculated, the venerable New York Times would not run such a series of editorials without at least talking with administration officials. And surely they would not waste so much ink if the White House signaled that the policy was set in stone. Ergo, the policy must be ripe for change. With a Republican Congress, Obama had no choice but to rely on executive authority to make the opening to Cuba. His willingness to use that power expansively on immigration reform implied that he realized any achievements during his last two years in office would have to be made despite Congress rather than with it. The Republican threats of lawsuits and appropriations cuts over immigration reform did not deter him from flexing his executive muscles yet again on Cuba, even if it meant throwing gasoline on the partisan political fire. Among Obama's initiatives is a directive to Secretary of State John Kerry to review Cuba's inclusion in the State Department's list of countries that sponsor international terrorism. Presumably, Kerry will remove Cuba from the list since there's no sensible rationale for it still being there. But taking Cuba off the terrorism list requires notification of Congress, which will give the likes of Senators Bob Menendez, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz a forum and an opportunity to lambast Obama's new policy. During the early December confirmation hearing for Tony Blinken, Obama's nominee to be Deputy Secretary of State, Menendez threatened a ""very significant response"" if the president changed Cuba policy without first consulting him. The other opportunity for the senators to howl will come when Obama nominates our new ambassador to Cuba. But even if Menendez and Cruz keep the nomination bottled up in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they cannot prevent the president from re-establishing full diplomatic relations with Cuba. Article II of the Constitution vests that power exclusively with the president. Having just coauthored a book with Peter Kornbluh on secret diplomacy (Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations between Washington and Havana), I wondered in the weeks leading up to the historic announcement whether secret talks might already be underway with Cuba. Now we know that these talks followed a classic pattern: only a handful of officials knew about the negotiations; the talks were held outside the country to avoid discovery; and the bargaining went on for months to produce an accord. But the scope of the resulting agreements is unprecedented in U.S.-Cuban relations, and the negotiators on both sides deserve enormous credit for bringing the talks to fruition. In April, the presidents of the Americas will convene in Panama for their Seventh Summit, and for the first time Cuba will be included. Obama's new Cuba policy is extraordinarily popular in Latin America, and the good will it has engendered will go far to revitalize U.S. relations with the entire hemisphere. The summit will also give Raúl Castro and Barack Obama an opportunity to talk in person about the next steps in the new relationship. When Richard Nixon went to China in 1972, the world breathed a sigh of relief that U.S. policy was finally getting back in touch with reality. On December 17, Barack Obama took an equally bold step by finally ending the cold war in the Caribbean. The reaction at home and abroad has been overwhelmingly positive, a few churlish conservative critics notwithstanding. Many loose ends remain to be tied up before the United States and Cuba will have fully normal relations, but a new chapter has been opened, and the idea of going back to the past already seems ridiculous and impossible. William M. LeoGrande is Professor of Government at American University and coauthor with Peter Kornbluh of the recent book, Back Channel to Cuba: The Hidden History of Negotiations between Washington and Havana.

Before serving as Koru's CEO, Kristen worked as COO of a global non-profit, launched mobile media devices for a Fortune 100 company and helped take Onvia, which she co-founded, public. How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?This is an ongoing process. I try hard to be ""always learning.""I grew up on a farm in Canada. We all want purpose and meaning in our work -- it's the human condition. However, I learned from a young age that hard work itself is meaningful because of how it makes us feel to fully commit ourselves to something difficult and get it done.I had an insatiable curiosity and because of it, I learned by doing. I was always throwing myself into the unknown because I was curious or I wanted adventure. It taught me that failure is an important step in learning and growing. I would try something, often impulsively because it seemed interesting, make a mistake and correct it fast in order to keep going.My current business, Koru, is founded on the concept of ""learning by doing."" And as a leader, one of my favorite mottos is ""fail fast and cheap."" Avoiding failure cuts off our opportunity for learning. Try things, and be willing to let go fast if it's failing. It's the only way to innovate.How has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at Koru?I took a year off before I went to college and lived and worked in Germany and Cyprus. That gap year gave me more real-world experience than my four years at university.After college, I worked in consulting for a number of years. I was constantly building strategy, framing problems and needing to work harder than I thought possible. I then co-founded and scaled a company, Onvia, from an idea to a public company. I learned how important it is to be purposeful about building a culture and how hard it is to hire good people fast. I then worked for World Learning, a global non-profit, and Microsoft, with dozens of it's subsidiaries. A valuable lesson I learned from these large and dispersed organizations is that the most valuable information is closest to the customer, in the minds of those who are with them from day to day. I ask customer-facing team members a lot of open-ended questions, and invite their voices into conversations about things like product, marketing and strategy.I learned how important a clear sense of mission is to the making of a great company, and that the ones I admire most are led by inspired, principle-driven people with a purposeful approach to culture.I've brought a little bit of all these experiences to Koru. We are working on having a huge impact and solving a really big and important problem: obliterating the statistic that 53 percent of recent college grads are un- or underemployed. We've built something that leverages ""experience"" as the best form of learning, we have assembled the best possible team to solve this problem, and we've ignited a culture that's based on a set of principles we passionately believe in.What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at Koru?The first years of running a startup that is working well are like a game of Whack-a-Mole. You just have one fuzzy hammer (limited resources) and there's always a field of problems that pop-up unexpectedly.That being said, it's exhilarating. I've been awed by the commitment of our team, what we've been able to achieve in our first year, and the integrity and character with which we've done it. I'm especially grateful to have won the co-founder lottery. It's statistically difficult to find a good partner to start a company with. I think Josh and I have the right Venn diagram of similarities, differences, personalities, temperament and appetite for impact to make it a great match.What advice can you offer to women who want to start their own business?I'd give the same advice to anyone wanting to start their own business.First -- Choose a problem, not a product/service/solution. You can have a cool product idea, but all successful businesses solve a specific problem for a particular customer. Ask the potential customer about their problem for as long as it takes for the solution to start unveiling itself.Second -- Be sure it's a problem you care so much about that it almost tortures you not to solve it. Starting a business is very hard and it will consume your life. Also, make sure you are aware of market trends, and land your business at the crest of a wave. It's hard enough to start a business. Don't make it impossible by working against nature.Third -- Ask yourself what you are willing to give up to solve the problem and be really honest with yourself. You will make compromises and other aspects of your life will get less of your attention. I suggest trying to keep as much constant in your life as possible when you start a business, and be clear about what you'll give up to make room in your life for your newly beloved company.Fourth -- Gather the brightest minds and hold an ideation session. One of the most important things I did was to make a list of all the people I knew (or wanted to know) who could help me with a first vision for how to address the problem. In our case, the problem was the 53% unemployment and underemployment rate of college graduates in the US. We had a two-day ideation session and in that time, we pushed thinking forward more than I could have in six months on my own. I also found my co-founder.What is the most important lesson you've learned in your career to date?Anything is possible, but not everything is possible. Harness the best available information from the right sources, make choices and move forward. That, and if you take your time to figure out what your dream is and share it with people you have developed an authentic relationship with, people will go out of their way to help you achieve those dreams, as audacious as they may be.How do you maintain a work/life balance?I stop pretending to. I forgive myself for letting the balance swing one way or the other, and try to make good choices. On his deathbed, my grandfather Jack's advice to his oldest son was: ""Have Fun."" Fun and love are two of life's most important ingredients. I try to honor Jack's wisdom and make more room for fun and love, and less for guilt and shame.What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?This is something I am asked quite often, and I've realized that I have a different view than most Americans. An important caveat here -- I'm not an authority, and am still trying to figure this out for myself. I think that the biggest issue for women in the workplace is worrying about women's issues in the workplace.Some context first. I was raised in a place, Quebec, where women (particularly in the French culture) are, more often than not, running the show. There was a set of spoken and unspoken assumptions that we could do anything we set our minds to, as long as we worked hard for it. I remember my father, who raised me, telling me at a young age that I could be prime-minister of Canada if I set my mind to it. I never had any other context. Here's what I think -- inequity problems won't be truly solved by debating or discussing issues. We should all be the future we hope for. I can't say what this means for others, but for me, it means always trying to be my best, assuming good intent in others and keeping my eye on the prize.I'm not ignoring reality. I know the statistics. And when I say to be the future you imagine, there is nothing passive about it. I make a habit of shutting down haters. If someone is sexist with me in the room, I'll do what I can to call it out, even use positional and personal power to embarrass them if it's really bad. I'm choosing to envision (and create) a world where everyone commits to using whatever power they have in any circumstance to shut down prejudice.How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?A great mentor of mine was the first venture investor in my first business, Nancy. She studied engineering in college, and was VP of Engineering at a top tech company and headed a top tier venture fund in Silicon Valley. She was the first woman I witnessed and experienced as an exceptional, superlative leader by behaving as an equal to those around her, and never letting the fact that she lived her whole career in a ""man's world"" be a factor. She inspired me to be who and how I am.Which other female leaders do you admire and why?I admire lots of leaders, male and female, and tend not to put them in separate categories. The women who have inspired me in particular are generally trailblazers who I've had direct experience with and who I've witnessed as inspired leaders, especially in challenging times.They are:· Carol Bellamy, former head of UNICEF and my boss at World Learning· Nancy Schoendorf, Venture Capitalist· Judy Kirton, my riding coach· Mary Gibb-Carsley, my grandmotherWhat do you want Koru to accomplish in the next year?Two things -Get the word out to every college graduate in the US that Koru is here to help them on the path to a meaningful and lucrative career.Establish Koru as the most trusted source for high growth employers to hire top entry-level talent."

The survey highlighted growing support in Germany, as in other European Union countries including Britain and Sweden, for parties and movements tapping into voter fears that mainstream politicians are too soft on immigration. Some members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc worry that they risk losing support to the euro-skeptic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has shifted its focus to immigration and includes many who also back the PEGIDA protest movement -- Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West. PEGIDA is holding weekly rallies in the eastern city of Dresden, and attracted more than 17,000 people to a Dec. 22 rally. A few small marches have taken place in other towns, and it plans to stage further rallies in other German cities. In her New Year address, Merkel urged Germans to turn their backs on PEGIDA's leaders, calling them racists full of hatred, and said Europe's biggest economy must welcome people fleeing conflict and war. A poll of 1,006 people by Forsa for Germany's Stern magazine found 13 percent would attend an anti-Muslim march nearby. It also found 29 percent of people believed that Islam was having such an influence on life in Germany that the marches were justified. While two thirds of those polled believed the idea of an 'Islamisation' of Germany was exaggerated, many Germans are concerned about the numbers of asylum seekers fleeing countries such as Syria.

The number of asylum-seekers arriving in Germany surged to about 200,000 in 2014, four times the numbers in 2012. Net immigration has hit a two-decade high. AfD leader Bernd Lucke criticized Merkel's New Year address in comments due to appear in Friday's edition of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) paper, accusing her of disrespecting citizens. A New Year address should unite rather than divide people, he said, accusing Merkel of branding all those who joined PEGIDA marches as anti-immigrant without listening to their views. He said he saw no place for anti-immigrant sentiment in Germany, but that problems should be discussed properly to stop such views taking hold.

But January is also a great time to take stock of the things we're wasting time, energy and stress on, and to, in the oft-quoted words of Elsa from ""Frozen"": ""Let it go."" Below are 21 things we are going to stop giving a shit about in 2015. What would you add? 1. Juice cleanses. Let's call a spade a spade and acknowledge that cleansing is less about health than about quick weight loss -- and if that's really your goal, there are healthier, longer-lasting ways to go about it. Solid foods FTW. 2. Wearing matching socks. One day we may find the land of lost single socks. But today is not that day. 3. Making plans with people you don't actually want to see, to do things you don't want to do. Obligation relationships aren't good for anyone. And even if someone you adore is inviting you out, if you'd rather eat your own hand than go clubbing, it's probably best to just say no. 4. People who don't understand why Queen Bey's feminism is important. Bye, haters. 5. Worrying about finding ""the one."" More doing fun things, less stressing about one's single status. 6. Breaking the Internet. If it ain't broke, why break it? 7. Getting tons of ""likes"" on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram. Better to 'gram your avocado toast and sunsets for your own enjoyment, ""likes"" be damned. 8. Anything ""Princeton Mom"" says. Single ladies don't need her brand of ""straight talk."" Neither do rape survivors, or any other women, for that matter. 9. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). We'd rather focus on truly enjoying the things we are doing. 10. Being embarrassed about wearing yoga pants in public. Look, they're comfy. 11. Losing that last five pounds. So many things taste better than skinny feels. 12. Wearing shoes that aren't comfortable. Hobbling around in pain makes any experience about 100x less pleasant. 13. Worrying that a romantic relationship doesn't check all the boxes on every ""179,000 Ways To Know You're In The Right Relationship"" list on the Internet. 14. Feeling guilty about going to bed early. True love means never having to apologize for your REM cycles. 15. Feeling guilty about staying in bed late on a weekend day. Clearly, we just really love sleep. 16. Not ""putting yourself out there"" in ways that your (well-meaning) friends and family think you should be. If there's something truly worth ""getting out"" for, you'll be motivated. 17. Eating gluten-free. Unless, of course, you are actually allergic to gluten. 18. Planning something *~#epic~* for every birthday. Embrace simplicity. Day drinking at a bar or BBQing at a park can be just as fun (if not more fun) than having an expensive 28-person dinner followed by five other complicated activities. 19. Walking more Fitbit steps each day than your Fitbit ""friends."" Exercise is wonderful for your physical and mental health. We'd rather use that as the motivation than competing with or ""beating"" our friends. 20. People who don't give a shit about you. Again... bye, haters. 21. Trying to make everyone happy all of the time. Do what you can, and forgive yourself the rest. And perhaps take some time to focus on making yourself happy. Happy 2015, y'all!

In an attempt to tackle all 236 episodes, here's a list of the ones that you (and your Phoebe friend) absolutely, no-questions-asked must watch right away. We've got the one where Joey puts his head inside a turkey, the one where Ross yells ""PIVOT"" a lot and the one with the lobsters. Get More: Friends Episodes,Friends,Friends Games Why watch it? What starts as a friendly bet ends in an apartment switcheroo and the revelation that nobody knows what Chandler actually does for work. (He's not a ""transponster,"" for the record.) 2. Season 3, Episode 2: ""The One Where No One's Ready""Best line: ""Look at me, I'm Chandler, could I be wearing any more clothes?"" Why watch it? Couch cushions make great hostages. 3. Season 5, Episode 14: ""The One Where Everyone Finds Out"" Best line: ""They don't know we know they know we know. "" Why watch it? Phoebe and Chandler try to force sexual chemistry in an attempt to disprove that Monica and Chandler are actually seeing each other. It's gooey and romantic and slapstick-y all at once. 4. Season 5, Episode 9: ""The One With Ross' Sandwich""Best line: ""MY SANDWICH?!"" Why watch it? Ross' life falls apart and we're so down to watch that happen. 5. Season 4, Episode 23/24: ""The One With Ross' Wedding""Best line: ""I Ross ... take thee, Rachel."" Why watch it? What seemed like the most random hook up became the show's most endearing couple. Too bad these episodes also took out Emily's dignity. 6. Season 5, Episode 8: ""The One With All The Thanksgivings""Best line: ""Here, Monica, you can finish off these pies. There was no room in the fridge."" Why watch it? Everyone's had crappy holidays but 1988 Geller family Thanksgiving takes the cake when we find out Monica accidentally chopped off one of Chandler's toes. 7.

Season 2, Episode 14: ""The One With The Prom Video""Best line: ""He's her lobster!"" Why watch it? Big kisses, new catchphrases, pre-nose job Rachel Green and home videos from the '80s. Yes please. 9. Season 7, Episode 23/24: ""The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding""Best line: ""Monica, I though this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle, I realized how simple it was. I love you. And surprises that come our way, it's ok, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with."" Why watch it? Uh, did you read those vows? 10. Season 6, Episode 9: ""The One Where Ross Got High""Best line:""Rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good."" Why watch it? Lady fingers do not belong with beef. 11. Season 6, Episode 15/16: ""The One That Could Have Been""Best line: ""I thought a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die."" Why watch it? Rachel's unhappily married to Barry, Phoebe is a high-rolling investment banker, Joey is wildly successful, Monica dates Dr. Boring, Chandler is a failed funny man and Ross is still in his sexless marriage to Carol. Even when things are so wrong, they feel so right. 12. Season 1, Episode 7: ""The One With The Blackout""Best line: ""I'm trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!"" Why watch it? We meet Paolo and a vicious cat, find out the weirdest places the gang has had sex and the golden rule: always accept gum from a Victoria's Secret model. 13. Season 5, Episode 16: ""The One With The Cop"" Best line: ""PIVOT!"" Why watch it? PIVOT! PIVOT! PIVOT! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! 14.

If a song has cracked the Top 40 chart and has a tempo above 125 beats per minute (BPM), there's a good chance you'll hear it in the gym. In this look back at 2014, you'll find lots of songs that meet the criteria above -- along with a few outliers. Starting with the big winners, Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off"" was the most popular workout song of the year. (Not coincidentally, it's also the fastest song in the bunch below.) Calvin Harris is notable for being the only artist to make the top 10 twice. Plus, Maroon 5 and Nico & Vinz both had songs so catchy that folks didn't mind their slower tempos. Rounding out the list, there are remixes of rock tracks from OneRepublic and American Authors, a song from Meghan Trainor that proved even more popular in the gym than her breakthrough hit ""All About that Bass,"" and a soaring, club track that pits Cash Cash & Bebe Rexha against dance titans The Chainsmokers. On the whole, the list makes for an easy way to reflect on the year that's passed, get acquainted with any songs you might have missed, and prep the perfect mix to kick off your first workout of 2015. Here's the full list, according to a poll on Run Hundred -- the web's most popular workout music blog. Check out this month's top 10 workout songs on Run Hundred: www.RunHundred.com.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-become-a-morning-p_b_6200682","1/1/2015","rachel rofe","How to Become a Morning Person","You've probably heard it since you were little: ""The early bird catches the worm."" ""Good for the worm,"" you might think. ""I'm hitting snooze."" Most of us would love to be morning people. We've heard about the benefits of waking up early time and time again. But it's easier said than done, and good intentions alone don't go very far. You need actionable, can-do strategies to make lasting change. Here are some battle-tested tips you can use to go from annoyed to animated every morning: Have your first activity of the day be something you love. It's a lot easier to get out of bed when you have something to look forward to. Create a great playlist, save a podcast you want to listen to for your morning walk, or schedule an exercise class with a friend. Plan out the ""hard"" things the night before. If you drink a morning smoothie, have everything pre-cut and ready to go in a Ziploc bag. If you want to exercise in the morning, have your workout clothes ready -- or even sleep in them. When you prepare in advance, getting up doesn't feel like as much work. Go to bed earlier. This isn't new, but consider the time you spend watching TV or surfing the Web. If you can cut that out in service to making lifestyle changes that make you feel a lot better, your quality of life may exponentially increase. It's worth testing, right? Set an alarm clock at night. Have an alarm clock that reminds you when it's an hour away from bedtime. Start shutting your electronics down and doing any other nighttime rituals you need to do. Put your alarm clock across the room. Hitting ""snooze"" over and over in the morning isn't giving you any quality sleep, so you may as well just get up when your alarm goes off. Once you get out of your comfortable bed to shut it off, it's a lot more likely that you'll stay up. Commit to waking up early for 21 days. Commit to waking up, even through the discomfort, an hour earlier every day for 21 days. Whenever you don't feel like doing it, remind yourself that it's only for 21 days. Some say it takes 21 days to create a habit, while others say that's a myth. Either way, committing for only 21 days is a great way to ""trick"" yourself. When you see how good you feel, you'll likely want to keep doing it. Become accountable with a friend who also wants to wake up earlier. Set a time for both of you to wake up. Text each other to show you've done it. Accountability is a very powerful motivator. Get perspective. The amazing Hal Elrod said in an interview, ""When the alarm clock goes off in the morning, it's life's first gift to you. But it's also life's first challenge or test. You say you want an extraordinary life, but the message we send to the universe is 'Well, no, no, no. I don't want it as bad as I want to lay here unconscious for another nine or ten minutes.' Then the alarm goes off again, and it's like, 'Yeah... I could wake up and become a better version of myself but I'm too lazy. I just want to lay, I don't have the discipline.'"" Remind yourself of this when you'd rather lay in bed -- it's powerful. Visualize yourself waking up early the next morning. Feel how it feels, what you see, and how you move throughout your day. Many people swear by this method. Remind yourself what the benefits will be. When your alarm goes off and you'd rather keep sleeping, remind yourself that you're about to get some ""me"" time, that you're going to be becoming healthier, or that you'll be enjoying some endorphins if you plan on exercising first. You can also feel proud of yourself for committing to something and sticking with it. Create a reward. If you're motivated by pleasure, tell yourself that if you wake up earlier for ""x"" days in a row, you'll reward yourself with something that you love. Maybe you buy yourself a present, take a day off, or do something else that will motivate you. Create a consequence. If you're motivated by pain, figure out what happens if you don't wake up earlier. Maybe you'll just be angry with yourself, maybe you'll feel like a failure, or keep having a life you're not proud of. You might also have to give money to a friend or do something embarrassing. You'll know what motivates you the most. Take deep breaths before you go to bed. If you're going to bed with stress and anxiety on your mind, it'll be a lot tougher to fall asleep and/or have high quality sleep. Take several deep breaths before you go to bed to help calm down your nervous system. If all else fails, start slowly. If you've tried other things and you just can't wake up 30-60 minutes earlier, try doing it gradually. Set your alarm clock 15 minutes earlier than you normally get up for a few days, then 30 minutes, then 45, and then 60. It might make it easier if your sleep routine isn't that different.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ten-conversations-every-c_b_6377412","1/1/2015","samantha rodman, ph d","10 Conversations Every Couple Should Have in the New Year","There are many articles that enumerate the types of conversations every couple needs to have prior to getting married, such as discussing their plans for how to parent, and their perspectives on money and religion. But I believe that there are 10 conversations that every couple needs to have on a regular basis in order to keep their emotional connection alive. They can help you realize what areas of their relationship may need to be worked on, whether this is done with more conversation or even with a couples counselor. In 2015, why not commit to having at least a few of these helpful conversations? By the way, if you want to know when you would use these questions, a good thing to do is an Emotional Check In, which is a weekly time (yes, put it on your Outlook) that you and your spouse sit together for a a half hour, no more and no less, to discuss only how the relationship is going. Many couples find this to be useful; it isn't such a long time that the less emotionally expressive partner is terrified, and it is long enough for both people to feel heard. So try a weekly Emotional Check In, and use some of these questions during it. (Note: If you're a devoted reader of this blog, you'll realize that many of these are questions I use in my Functional Couple Fridays interviews. So I walk the walk.) We otter ask each other some of these questions 1. What do you love about me?This question is wonderful to use on a regular basis. It makes partners feel great to know that there are specific things about them that are valued and appreciated within their relationship. Talking about this can bring partners back to the honeymoon stage, where all you ever did was talk about what you love about each other (and have sex). This conversation topic pumps out endorphins and makes both partners happy. 2. What do I do regularly that makes you happy?Not only does this give you the happiness benefits of having your effort noticed and recognized, but it can also be instructive to learn exactly what does and doesn't resonate emotionally with your partner. For example, if you're busting your butt to get a delicious dinner on the table every night for your husband, but he never mentions this as something that makes him happy, maybe you can relax and order take out sometimes. This can also lead into a productive discussion about love languages. 3. What is your favorite time we had together this week?Note I didn't say this month or today. A week is a good unit because you can remember most things easily, but some days are going to go by in a normal relationship without many good things happening. If you can't think of any favorite time within seven days, that's an indicator that you need to make more time as a couple, or that there are underlying issues with the relationship. And reminiscing about good times together, even as recently as that morning or a week ago, builds feelings of intimacy and closeness. 4. What are you looking forward to doing together as a couple?Looking forward to events can be even more enjoyable than the events themselves, according to research. So, figure out what you're looking forward to, whether it's tonight, next week, this summer, or as retirees. Or all of those! Talking about your plans together makes you feel like a team, and gives you positive thoughts to help you through tougher times in the relationship. 5. When did you first realize you loved me?Another romantic one that brings you back to the hormone- and endorphin-fueled stages of early love. These sorts of questions make people feel vulnerable and closely connected. 6. What do you think about our sex life?This should be a frank and honest discussion, where both partners try their hardest to be non-defensive and non-judgmental. If it was 20 years from now, wouldn't you wish you had this open discussion today? People have no idea what their partner wants if their partner won't tell them outright. I have treated couples where a man learned that a wife of decades never enjoyed or orgasmed from things he had been doing every time they had sex. Don't let this be you. 7. What do you think we have in common?This discussion builds closeness and a team feeling. Opposites don't actually attract; in most basic ways, couples that succeed are fairly similar. Elaborate on the ways that you have similar thoughts, feelings, goals, values, and interests. This will emphasize that you're a unit, and reaffirm your choice in partner. 8. Which of our differences do you think complement each other?In attachment theory, we've seen that avoidant partners often pair with preoccupied partners. Similarly, assertive partners often pair with passive ones. There are many ways in which two people with the exact same personality traits wouldn't work. One is often more laid back, one more responsible, one more intellectual, one more emotional, and so forth. This conversation helps you learn more about your partner, as well as realize why it may not be a bad thing that your partner is different than you. (Would you want to date you? Really? Completely?) 9. Do you trust me?Many if not most couples have issues in their history that makes them wary of fully trusting the other, whether this is something huge like infidelity, or something like a partner picking their parent over you during arguments. Trust needs to be discussed, and each partner needs to make a good faith effort to repair trust that has been broken. Often, this can be done with a couples counselor, if open discussion does not work. 10. What concrete things could I do to make you happier?This should be one to three things that a partner could reasonably do on a daily or monthly basis that would genuinely increase the other partner's quality of life. Having more sex, cleaning or doing some chore on your wife's timeline and specifications, scheduling more date nights, getting up with the kids, whatever. Be open to trying new things with the goal of enriching your marriage and making your partner feel valued and cherished. Hopefully those questions can make it into your conversation tonight. Let me know how it goes, and share if you found this useful! Till we meet again, I remain, The Blogapist Who Wants Your Marriage To Be Awesome.

Syrian television on Thursday aired footage of the New Year visit, accompanying it with patriotic music. It showed Assad talking to troops, embracing them and sharing a meal outside, in what was presented as a morale boost for soldiers on the frontline of the country's civil war. The conflict killed 76,021 people in 2014, just under half of them civilians, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday. The United Nations says around 200,000 people have been killed since 2011. No group enjoys significant momentum going into 2015, and Assad said last month he expected the conflict to be long and difficult. Assad, who is commander in chief, is not frequently pictured in public, though he has visited troops in the past, according to state media. The presidential website said the latest visit was to Jobar, northeast of Damascus. ""If there was an area of joy which remained in Syria, it is thanks to the victories that you achieved in the face of terrorism,"" Assad told troops, according to the Twitter account. State news agency SANA said he ""wished a speedy recovery to the wounded"" and praised their sacrifices. Lebanese channel al-Mayadeen also showed footage of the trip. Several bangs could be heard in the distance but it was not clear what caused them. Syrian forces have been trying to dislodge insurgents from Jobar, which was captured by anti-Assad fighters in 2013. While government forces control central Damascus, they have continued to face battles on the outskirts of the capital. According to the human rights observatory, Jobar was the target of at least 10 raids by the Syrian air force on Wednesday, as well as strikes by ground missiles. Neither the presidency account nor SANA said whether Syrian troops had gained control over all or just parts of the area. The Observatory, which gathers information from sources on the ground, said pro-government forces in Jobar had clashed with fighters from rebel and Islamic battalions and al Qaeda's Syria wing, Nusra Front. In an update on Thursday, the Observatory said government forces had fired machine guns on areas of Jobar overnight and that three rockets landed in the area in the morning. It added that at least 25 pro-government fighters were killed and dozens wounded in the previous day's fighting. Syrian state media did not mention any casualties.

The service at St. Peter's Basilica marks the Roman Catholic Church's World Day of Peace. This year's theme is ""No Longer Slaves, but Brothers and Sisters."" ""All of us are called (by God) to be free, all are called to be sons and daughters, and each, according to his or her own responsibilities, is called to combat modern forms of enslavement. From every people, culture and religion, let us join our forces,"" he said. Last month Francis appealed to consumers to shun low-cost goods that may be the product of forced labor or other forms of exploitation. That message was sent to heads of state and governments, international institutions and parishes throughout the 1.2 billion-member Church. The Argentine pope has made defense of migrants and workers a central issue of his papacy. At a Vespers service on New Year's Eve, he condemned administrators and criminals in Rome accused of pocketing public funds meant to help poor migrants, urging a ""spiritual and moral renewal.""

We asked the pros at CheapAir -- and sifted through our favorite hacks -- for 7 tricks that will make 2015 the year you FINALLY get out there, and on a trip that goes smoothly, too. 1. Start flying in the morning.It's science: the later in the day you fly, the longer the delay you might face, as bad weather and other issues create a domino effect throughout the day. Experts advise avoiding flights between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. to decrease your chances of getting stuck. 2. Get TSA Precheck.CheapAir recommends signing up for TSA Precheck -- after an application, you'll whiz through security like a BOSS. 3. Pick a smart day to book.Fifty-four days before your trip is the magic number, if we're being precise. And remember: it's never too early to start strategizing for the next holiday season. 4. Stop checking baggage.You'll 1) avoid checked bag fees, 2) eliminate the chance of bags going missing and 3) have an excuse to invest in the best carry-on tote ever. CheapAir also points out that when flights are cancelled or delayed, airport staff may be more willing to help re-route passengers if they know they won't have to go to the trouble of re-routing checked bags. When you travel light, you're low-risk. 5. Pick up passengers in Departures, not Arrivals.Meeting your air traveler at Departures instead of Arrivals almost always means less crowds, CheapAir points out. Plus, they say airport police are less likely to make you move while you're waiting at the Departures curb. Don't be afraid to take advantage of cell phone lots as low-stress places to wait, too. 6. Turn your phone into a travel agent.With the right apps, your phone can nab same-day flights, teach you the local language and even identify the historic spot you're standing in. And when flight delays strike, CheapAir recommends hopping on the phone while waiting in line at the airport check-in desk to double your chances of finding a remedy. 7. Finally set those price alerts.Sites like Airefarewatchdog and Hopper keep you posted when prices dip on the routes you're looking to fly. Start the new year off right by setting alerts for all your dream trips, and watch 2015 be the year you take the trip of a lifetime.

Maryland lawmakers voted two years ago to abolish the death sentence for future offenders beginning 2013. O'Malley, a Democrat and possible White House contender, on Wednesday said that leaving the last four prisoners to await the death penalty ""does not serve the public good."" ""In a representative government, state executions make every citizen a party to a legalized killing as punishment,"" he said in a statement. The four prisoners, Vernon Evans, Anthony Grandison, Jody Lee Miles and Heath William Burch, had their sentences commuted by gubernatorial order to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Opponents of capital punishment applauded O'Malley's move - which came just weeks before he leaves office after two terms as Maryland's governor. ""Today's announcement gives further hope that support for the discriminatory and fatally flawed death penalty is waning,"" Amnesty International USA said in a statement. ""The U.S. cannot be seen as a country that truly values human rights as long as it continues to execute its citizens,"" the group said. All four inmates in Maryland were convicted of murder. A family member of two victims told the Baltimore Sun newspaper she was ""devastated"" to learn that Heath Williams Burch's sentence had been commuted. Burch was convicted of the 1995 murders of Robert Davis, 70, and Cleo Davis, 77, the newspaper said. The Davises' daughter, Mary Moore, said she had asked the governor three times not to remove Burch from death row. ""He'll have a life, and I don't think he should,"" she said. Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger, who supported retaining the death penalty in the state, said the capital sentences for all four men had been fair and upheld after numerous appeals. ""The governor should not be using his last days in office to show any mercy to these cold, calculating murderers,"" he said in a statement. There are currently 3,054 inmates on death row in the United States, according to the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center, which compiles statistics published by the Bureau of Justice.

Cameron Beckford's body was found in a bag in Big Walnut Creek in Columbus, according to police. The boy's mother, Dainesha Stevens of Frederick, Maryland, assisted police in locating the boy's body, according to her lawyer Mark Collins. Stevens, 24, was charged on Monday with felony child endangerment and tampering with evidence and is being held on a $150,000 bond, according to court records. ""She helped guide them to the general area ... and they were able to retrieve the child today,"" he said. According to authorities, Stevens called police on Monday to report that her 6-year-old daughter was missing and later disclosed she had abandoned her 14-month-old son. The girl was found in good condition and taken to the county's child services department, police said. During the investigation, Stevens told police that she and a male friend on Friday evening left Cameron on the front porch of a house in Columbus not far from where his body was later found, authorities said. ""I can't go into details, but she was asked to lie about her daughter going missing,"" Collins said. ""That was her way of saying that she needed help.""

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dzhokhar-tsarnaev_n_6403230","1/1/2015","associated press","Judge Rejects Requests To Delay Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's Trial","BOSTON (AP) — Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to overturn a judge's decision to not move his upcoming trial out of state. The appeal was filed with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hours after U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole denied the change-of-venue request and a motion seeking a nine-month delay in the start of the trial. The defense is now asking O'Toole to postpone jury selection, scheduled to begin Monday, pending the outcome of the appeal. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty to federal charges connected to the April 2013 explosions at the marathon finish line, which killed three people and injured more than 260. He could face the death penalty if convicted. The defense lawyers, in their appeal to the higher court, again argued Tsarnaev couldn't receive a fair trial in the Boston federal courthouse a couple of miles from where the bombing occurred. Prosecutors, they said, were likely to depict the crimes as having affected not only those killed and injured but nearly the entire greater Boston community. ""Thus, every member of the jury pool is, in effect, an actual victim of the charged offenses,"" the defense attorneys wrote. As an alternative to ordering the trial moved, the lawyers suggested the appeals court order O'Toole to hold a hearing on ""disputed issues of fact"" and reconsider the previous change-of-venue motions. O'Toole said in his ruling earlier Wednesday he would provide a detailed explanation for it later. In rejecting Tsarnaev's first request in September to move the trial, O'Toole said defense lawyers had failed to show that extensive pretrial media coverage of the bombings had prejudiced the jury pool to the point an impartial jury couldn't be chosen in Boston. The defense has compared the coverage to that in the case of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, whose trial was moved to Denver. McVeigh was convicted and put to death for the bombing, which killed 168 people. In Wednesday's appeals court filing, Tsarnaev's lawyers noted The Associated Press recently named the aftermath of the marathon bombing the top Massachusetts news story of 2014 and Gov.-elect Charlie Baker, in response to a question posed by The Boston Globe in October, said Tsarnaev was the living person he despised the most. Prosecutors say Tsarnaev, 21, and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, planted and detonated two pressure cooker bombs. Tamerlan died following a firefight with police several days after the bombings. Dzhokhar was captured later that day, wounded and hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in suburban Watertown. Also Wednesday, O'Toole issued a decorum order, prohibiting courtroom spectators from wearing clothing, buttons or other items ""that carry any message or symbol addressing the issues related to this case that may be or become visible to the jury."" The ban includes law enforcement uniforms and badges, except for those worn by on-duty U.S. marshals or court security officers. Defense lawyers said in motions seeking a trial delay the prosecution has not handed over everything they have requested, including information they believe may show Tsarnaev was under his brother's influence. The defense also wanted more time to review information regarding Stephen Silva, who recently pleaded guilty to having possessed the gun prosecutors said the bombing suspects used to kill a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer.

The title of the video says the women are Italian workers and have been detained by al Qaeda's Syria wing Nusra Front, but websites and Twitter accounts used by the militant group did not mention the video, which did not include any logos of the group. The video published on YouTube shows two young women sitting and dressed in black robes and veils. One holds a sign which gives the date as Dec. 17, 2014. ""We supplicate our government and its militaries to bring us back home before Christmas,"" the other woman says in English, appearing to read from a prepared statement. ""We are in big danger and we could be killed. The government and its militaries are responsible (for) our lives."" An Italian foreign ministry spokesman declined to comment. In August the ministry said two Italian aid workers had been kidnapped in Syria, without giving their names. They had been working on humanitarian projects in the embattled northern city of Aleppo, the ministry said at the time, adding that all channels were being explored to obtain more information and secure their release. It did not give details of their captors. Nusra Front and the militant Islamic State group have held groups of Westerners hostage in Syria, which has descended into a splintered civil war. Islamic State beheaded several male hostages including aid workers and journalists in 2014. Nusra Front released hostages last year, including a group of Greek Orthodox nuns in March and a U.S. writer in August.

Here at HuffPost Divorce, we're a little less drastic when it comes to making New Year's resolutions. Now that it's nearly 2015, we're pledging ""new year, way less stressed-out stepfamily."" Below, nine resolutions to consider sticking to based on what we've learned from parents in our Blended Family Friday series  last year. 1. Quit trying to force a relationship with your stepkids. You may have bonus-parent dreams, but let it happen naturally.""My stepdaughters have two really great parents who love them to pieces. I don't have to be the 'mother' -- they already have a mom. I support their father with parenting, but for my personal relationship with them, I get to really enjoy the kids."" -- Brynn Bruno 2. Make regular family meetings a priority, even if it feels a bit forced at first. ""Early on in our marriage we began having weekly family meetings. This established a forum for good and healthy conversation. It wasn't always easy conversation and at times it was confrontational. But it was important to us that we learn how to communicate."" -- Sandi PattyPhoto courtesy of Sandi Patty 3. Carve out some time for date night with your spouse. (Bonus points if you don't talk about the kids.)""As a couple, my husband and I insist on having date night twice a month. It's pure enjoyment and relaxation: no kids, no dogs, and no stress. We also travel twice per year -- once with our kids and then alone. It's important to maintain your marriage outside of your kids. My husband and I always start to talk about our kids when we're away, but we're learning how to stop ourselves when we discuss them too much!"" -- Lisa Liggins-Chambers 4. Don't badmouth the other parents. Really, it's not worth it.""Talking trash about the exes or surrounding yourself with people who like to engage in that kind of talk is generally not a good idea. (I know, I know -- we've ALL done it, but make an effort to stay positive.) We want to aim for our higher selves on this front. Embrace your spouse’s ex. He or she could turn out to be an unexpected ally and maybe someday -- as in my case -- a really good friend."" -- Kama Fletcher 5. Accept that there's no neat time frame for truly feeling like a family.""When you blend two families you change everyone’s world. You hope it's eventually for the better, but the challenge is to take one day at a time and realize that what you want -- a new partner who you will spend the rest of your life with -- may not be what your children want. You deserve to be happy but it may take time for the kids to accept the new plan. Couples who are remarrying need to understand that."" -- Rob Walker(Photo by Sean O'Rourke) 6. Communicate with your ex. (Otherwise, you better believe your kids will play the two of you against each other.)""Since I remarried, my son is doing really well, but he still sometimes tries to play the parents against each other! Sometimes he will say, 'but daddy says…' or 'but Jeffy [his stepdad] lets me have candy…' The trick for us is maintaining communication with each other and doing our best to create consistent rules and boundaries. We always laugh when we are all in the same room together, because he will go from one parent to the next trying to get one of us to say 'yes' when the first parent says 'no.'” -- Claire James 7. It’s totally OK to allow each “subfamily unit” to have their special time together. ""So many newly blended families (ours included) expect an instant family unit, but it doesn’t work that way. It’s OK if one biological parent takes his or her biological kids out for an old family tradition or just some quality time alone together as the “original crew.” That doesn’t mean failure as a new stepfamily. It just means you acknowledge there was a family before the stepfamily, and that is OK."" -- Rachel Pross 8. But make a point to really savor the moments you have as a collective family.""My husband loves the 'happy reunions' we experience every week. Each Wednesday, Edwin and Ellie come home and we get that awesome “yay, we got the band back together” moment. Kids are easy to take for granted, and this keeps our times together precious. As for me, it’s seems corny, but there’s more to love. I love Edwin and Ellie as if they were my own flesh and blood, and my husband loves my children as his own too."" -- Cassandra Barnhart Cassandra Barnhart 9. Take the pressure off yourself to be a ""perfect"" family. Perfect families don't exist. ""Let me assure you, 'perfect' isn't going to happen. You are going to have a bad day where everything goes wrong, you are going to raise your voice and make the angry face (as my 5-year-old likes to call it). Your partner won't be perfect, either; he or she will make mistakes, you won't always agree on everything and you will both feel overwhelmed. The kids will have bad days, too -- days where they cry over broken Lunchable crackers (been there!), times where they will say they want their other parent. There will be moments of complete chaos and havoc will come at the worst moment possible and you'll think you can't do it anymore, but I can tell you from experience, those days don't last. Moments of craziness are quickly replaced with hugs, kisses, pillow fights and movie nights. The feeling of defeat gets knocked to the back-burner by feelings of more love than you ever dreamed possible. Pick your battles with everyone, including yourself ... Remind yourself everyday that you have been given another chance at love and cherish that opportunity."" -- Jessica Warrick If you'd like your own family to be featured on Blended Family Friday, please email us at divorce@huffingtonpost.com.

The Post, citing a statement emailed to the paper by one of Bush's aides late on New Year's Eve, said he even stepped down from the board of his education foundation. The statement added that he was still evaluating next steps for businesses for which he serves as an owner or principal partner, including consulting firm Jeb Bush & Associates, the Post reported. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Representatives for Bush were not immediately available. The news comes just days after Bush, the son of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush and the brother of former President George W. Bush, announced he was stepping down from the board of real estate investment trust Rayonier Inc. Bush said there were no disagreements between Rayonier and him. Bush, 61, said on Dec. 16 that he was actively exploring a run for the U.S. presidency in 2016 and would establish a political action committee in January that would allow him to engage with supporters and potential donors and determine whether sufficient support exists for a run. Bush served as Florida's governor between 1999 and 2007.

On the first day of a new year, as we look back with gratitude on an incredible 2014 and welcome 2015 with unbridled enthusiasm, we are so proud of the hard-earned milestones that have punctuated 2014, many of which were born from a very powerful [digital + women's empowerment] equation that continues to define who and what this agency is and does.  In January of last year, we featured inspiring stories about superhero(ine) women Sara Blakely, Fatima Bhutto and Angela Ahrendts on our blog Moxie Insider and Brown Paper Bag launched their Photo Trail series with my Instagram images, which hold clues to the #futureisgreen food project we're preparing to launch in 2015. Nokia empowered us to take our national Women in Media panel series and Moxie Mentorship program to Social Media Week Bangalore in February, during which time our panelists sparked an international furor amongst feminists on social media that resulted in articles in both The Huffington Post and Firstpost.  In March we launched our beloved Moxie Mentorship video featuring Asha, a young girl whose life is changed forever by our program, and saw our #ShesEmpowered social media campaign become a case study. With spring around the corner I took Moxie Mentorship to New York City in April, where we participated in Tina Brown's Women of the World Summit and met with a handful of people passionate about making #futureisfemale on a global scale. Back in Bombay, Team Moxie attended Mashable's Social Good Summit in Mumbai and interviewed their CMO Stacy Martinet about being a woman who is making #futureisdigital. I think I may have flown past Stacy in the friendly skies as she returned to NYC and I to Bombay, with my interview with Peek's Founder and CEO Ruzwana Bashir and a feature on Pantene's ""Sorry, We're Not Sorry"" #ShineStrong campaign appearing on the blog, in May and June respectively. Summer brought more #futureisgreen clues, with Vogue India featuring me in their special Vogue India Wellness Guide in July, while August saw the American edition of Vogue embrace everyone's favorite social media platform by giving their cover to The Instagirls. Harry Potter's Emma Watson was all grown up launching HeForShe with UN Women in September, and while celebrating Moxie Insider's first anniversary in October, we featured Vikas Bahl's short film for Vogue India's Vogue Empower campaign, entitled ""Going Home"" with talented young actress Alia Bhatt, as well as Elle India's #pinkselfie campaign for breast cancer awareness as part of our Instadiaries series. Last month talented lensman and one of the fashion community's first bloggers Scott Schuman of The Sartorialist set his sights on Mumbai and Delhi in an Instadiaries, which accompanied the viral video ""Potty-Mouthed Princesses Drop F-Bombs For Feminism"" with Ellen Degeneres, Jane Lynch, Zach Efron and more on our blog. Last but certainly not least, December saw the launch of The Huffington Post India and we celebrated Arianna Huffington's recent time here with an Instadiaries feature that included the requisite glittering sari, a Bollywood celebrity and quotes from Indian leaders. The launch was a powerful moment for me, as it's a story for The Huffington Post that first brought me to India nearly five years ago and changed my life forever, just as Asha's life was forever changed by Moxie Mentorship. It seems fitting that as I look back on Moxie Media's year, I'm looking back on five of mine and commemorating the memories alongside The Huffington Post India's very first articles. I hope you'll join Moxie and me on this journey in 2015. Happy New Year!

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-year-reflections-on-t_b_6402922","1/1/2015","david coates","New Year Reflections on the U.S. Global Role and Its Limits","The first hours of a new year are always an ideal time for people across the globe to reflect on their contemporary condition. They are an ideal moment to look back, in the hope that serious reflection now can improve conditions going forward. And it is particularly vital that we in America take this moment of reflection as this new year begins, given the enormity of the impact of our condition on the rest of the global order. In the last days of 2014, the Obama administration made much of the formal ending of the war in Afghanistan -- the longest war in American history now supposedly finally over. But in truth it is not finally over. Significant numbers of American troops are still deployed in Afghanistan, and will be for the foreseeable future; and in any case the Afghan war is simply part of a wider set of military engagements by American forces in the region that remain on-going. As the Obama Administration claims closure in Afghanistan, it continues to wage war in the Middle East - America's third such war since 9/11 -- leading the military campaign against ISIS, even though the US commander of special forces in the Middle East is recently on record as admitting that ""we do not understand the movement, and [that] until we do, we are not going to defeat it."" For as James Fallows commented at length in the current edition of The Atlantic, in spite of all our enormous expenditure on military personnel and equipment America keeps losing wars - or if not completely losing them, then at least regularly failing to translate superior US military capacity into desirable political settlements. For far too often for comfort, the more our men and women in uniform are deployed abroad, the more intransigent seem to be the problems that their deployment is designed to resolve. America may be the world's dominant super-power, and according to its own lights uniquely benign in that role, but the world it seeks to dominate is proving remarkably resistant to that supposedly benign dominance. So perhaps now is a good time to ask why? What is it about our contemporary political role that makes so much of what we attempt to do abroad ultimately self-defeating? Is the American military presence abroad really as benign and as indispensable as our political leaders regularly insist that it is? And if it is, why is that not universally recognized? I One way of answering such questions is to note that the United States is not the first global power to experience limits on its capacity to shape events beyond its shores, nor is it likely to be the last. For the past two millennia at least, other political systems -- not least those of Ancient Rome, early-modern Spain, nineteenth-century Britain, and Russia under both the Czars and the Soviets -- have for a significant period of time exercised political domain over wide areas of the then known world. But unlike the contemporary United States, each of those imperial adventures eventually came to a desultory end. Power won became power lost -- and often lost in both a dramatic and an irreversible fashion. If the United States is not one-day soon to repeat this standard imperial pattern of ascendancy, hegemony and decline, those who govern us now might do well to reflect upon the necessary limits of empire that these early examples of global dominance so clearly demonstrate. For these are limits that could one day also apply to the United States, and could do so regardless of how often conservative political commentators insist that the American role abroad is not in any meaningful sense imperial at all. Really -- not imperial at all? Well, consider America's contemporary condition in the light of at least these four regularly-visible limits of empire. Military Limits In the end, there always seems to be a serious military problem with empires. Empires cost a lot to build and a lot to maintain: a lot in money terms, a lot in terms of manpower and a lot in terms of political capital. Empires also invariably meet both resistance and push back from within the empire, and competition from other imperial entities beyond their borders, both of which ultimately inflate those costs substantially. This pattern of costs and resistance was very clear in the Soviet case, where ultimately the burden of Cold War competition and internal repression overwhelmed an economy stagnant for other reasons, and left the Soviet Union immersed in an Afghan war that it could not win and from which eventually it had ignominiously to withdraw. A similar pattern of imperial-overstretch brought Spanish power to an equally ignominious end in the Treaties of Westphalia and the Pyrenees between 1648 and 1659; and swept the British out of South-East Asia in 1942 and India by 1947. Empires regularly discover, that is, the truth of Talleyrand's often-quoted remark to Napoleon ""that you can do anything with a bayonet except sit on it."" Armies are so much better at winning power than at retaining it; and the costs of having to continually relearn this simple truth are surely ones that this time we will do well to avoid. Political Limits Military pushback against imperial rule would appear to be only one facet of a more general feature of empires: namely that they become more difficult to rule the larger they are and the longer they last. Partly this is because geographical size and communication capacity have historically been in tension. Certainly until the age of the internet, the farther away imperial subjects were from the metropolitan center, the longer it took for information and instructions to pass between them and those who ruled them. In the past, big empires were always based on indirect rule, and that indirect rule always and of necessity provided a space for resistance: either resistance by the traditional elites doing the local ruling, or by those they ruled venting their frustration with the colonial set-up at both the local and the metropolitan level. Settler colonies in particular were supremely difficult to effectively discipline from the metropolitan center, as Britain ultimately found to its great cost in the American case. The internet has now shrunk those distances, of course, but it has not taken them entirely away; and in any event the governance problems of empire invariably run deeper than simply issues of distance. For any difficulty the center has in controlling the periphery is normally matched, in grand global adventures of the contemporary American kind, by problems of control at (and over) the center itself. Even democratic governments with global pretensions have difficulty avoiding the emergence of an imperial presidency -- one which, though democratically elected, slips inexorably into non- or even anti-democratic practices in the defense of imperial power far away from its own shores. At the height of the Roman Empire, faced with issues of this kind, the republic rapidly gave way to what was effectively a monarchy. Modern empires don't inevitably collapse in that fashion, but they do face a similar problem of excessive executive autonomy. We need only think of the problem of executive capacity in the Washington DC of George w. Bush and Dick Cheney to recognize the persistence of that problem. Economic Limits It's not all bad news for empires, of course. Empires in their prime also attract a lot of subsidy. They take things from peoples less powerful than themselves, and do so with relative ease because of that imbalance of military capacity. They also find borrowing resources from others outside the empire easier than it might otherwise be because the collateral asked of them on such borrowing is invariably low, relative to the borrowing capacity of non-empires. In financial as well as in military terms, that is, power and privilege goes together. However, this financial arbitrage inevitably comes at a serious long term price, for empires at times enjoy a credit rating that is too good for their own long term viability. At the very least, empires tend to end up (as in the British case) with a serious division of interests between their financial and manufacturing sectors. At the very worst (as with Spain) for all their wealth, empires still end up dependent on credit provided by bankers based in circuits of capital that lie outside the territorial reach of the empire itself, credit which if withheld leaves the imperial army unpaid and the imperial military capacity momentarily out of central control. Armies win imperial control, but it is bankers who eventually determine if it can be sustained. Moreover, obtaining things easily because of imperial preference invariably weakens the ability of empires to generate those things themselves. It frees them from any immediate confrontation with the reality of market forces; and it alters the relative weight within their underlying economy of the sectors that manufacture things and those that merely play with money. Empires, as they succeed, invariably undermine the economic superiority on which that rise had initially been predicated. With Wall Street continuing to bounce back from the 2008 recession on a scale yet unmatched by Main Street, and with US-owned companies increasingly shifting their production off-shore in a global economy made safe for them by the US navy, it is hard not to see history repeating itself: first Rome, then Spain, England and now the United States. Cultural Limits Finally this: even privileged elites within dominant empires tend to wake up to the dangers of the erosion of the competitive strength of their domestic economy, if they wake up to it at all, too late. Empires rise but they also decline -- sometimes slowly, sometimes abruptly -- in part because both their governing classes (and their central populations) come over time to believe more and more in the naturalness and permanence of that superiority. They come to take their global position of power for granted, and lose sight of the very special conditions necessary for its retention and growth. They also come to swallow much of their own imperial rhetoric, so progressively losing the capacity to understand their own growing unpopularity in far-flung parts of the empire. A heightened tolerance of war, a double-standard in relation to the legitimacy of violence (alright if we inflict it on others but not alright if they inflict it on us), even a blindness to both the violence of poverty at home and the violence of empire abroad: all these seem to be inevitable features of the culture of empire. For although the specific content of ideas and claims differs empire by empire, the general character of the imperial mindset does not. It is always a mixture of excessive hubris and growing ignorance: hubris about the intellectual or racial superiority of the imperial culture, growing ignorance about the depth and complexity of cultures on the imperial periphery. As the global reach of an empire increases, so too does its cultural parochialism. Some empires, like the British, fall in total self-delusion. Others, like the Russian, fall when that self-delusion is possible no more. II Some high-quality imperial scholarship clings resolutely to the view that empires are a good thing, and that the possession of one is a sign of both present and future strength. But the bulk of the evidence available to us on the character and trajectory of global power would suggest otherwise. It would suggest that empires grow strong only because powers around them grow weak, and that imperial stability is more a function of that continuing weakness than it is of factors exceptional and special to the global power itself. It would suggest that empires fool themselves if they think that their superiority is endemic rather than contingent, and a reflection of their inner strengths rather than of others' external weaknesses. Take those external weaknesses away, and imperial decline seems to follow as surely as night follows day. The bulk of the evidence would suggest too that empires begin militarily strong, politically focused, economically advanced, socially cohesive and culturally dynamic; but that invariably they end up militarily exhausted, politically gridlocked, economically weakened, socially divided and culturally depleted. By almost any measure, there is plenty of military exhaustion, political stalemate, economic erosion, social division and cultural deprivation in contemporary America. Which is why -- as the New Year begins, and before the detail of day-to-day politics again drowns out the space for quiet reflection -- it is worth pondering whether any of that exhaustion, stalemate, erosion, division and depletion is the product of the presence in the modern world of something that we might properly recognize as an American empire.

Are you ready to start that new blog? Want some tips from some pros around the world on how to make it a great one? Everybody was blogging in 2014, and especially teachers. After all, blogging is an incredible way for teachers to share firsthand knowledge with their peers. We asked The Global Search for Education editorial team and our blogging advisors to submit their favorite teacher blogs and blog posts from around the world. We reviewed many great blogs. These 12 were our favorites. 1. Susan Bowles of Gainesville, Florida has been teaching since 1977. Earlier this year, she wrote a brave and moving letter about cheating children out of the fun of learning, entitled: ""Why I am refusing to give the FAIR test to my Kindergarteners"". She sent it to her superintendent and then posted it on the private Facebook group, Opt Out Alachua. The letter went viral. We love it Susan -- top of our list! 2. Lisa Currie's priority is ""improving students' social, emotional and mental health to reduce bullying and exclusion through our whole school curriculum."" Her blog post entitled: ""Why Teaching Kindness in Schools Is Essential to Reduce Bullying"" highlights the need for a culture of kindness in schools and is another big favorite on our list. 3. Todd Finley's ""30 Techniques to Quiet a Noisy Class"" gave teachers some terrific management tips on how to keep K-12 classrooms orderly. His blog post continues to stimulate discussion on how teachers can get their students attention. Another one for our Top 12! 4. Karen Lirenman, Canadian educator, got our and the rest of the world's attention when she had her kindergarten class tweet: What does it look like outside your window today? Her class received responses from all around the world. Her blog presents this and countless other examples of innovative ways to use social media in the classroom. (Learning and Sharing with Ms. Lirenman) 5. Craig Kemp, an educator in Singapore, is on our Top 12 for making waves with #whatisschool hashtag on Twitter, which has brought many new voices into conversations about education. His blog demonstrates how Skype, Twitter, and other applications can be used to stimulate learning in the classroom. (Mr. Kemp's Blog) 6. Like Vicki Davis, we believe every classroom matters. Vicki is inspiring in the way she surrounds herself with bright ideas and thoughtful sayings to stay positive. Her blog post: ""12 Choices to Step Back from Burnout"" was our favorite choice for tired teachers. 7. Pauline Hawkins' blog post, ""Why I'm Resigning After 11 Years as a Teacher"", coincided with her resignation last April. Hawkins wrote that she could ""no longer be a part of a system that continues to do the exact opposite of what I am supposed to do as a teacher -- I am supposed to help them think for themselves, help them find solutions to problems, help them become productive members of society."" Congratulations, Pauline, for articulating the issues and challenges so brilliantly! 8. Joe Bower shared some powerful lessons in his blog post titled: ""This will be my last year teaching in the hospital -- here are 3 things I learned"". 1. Children who are loved at home, come to school to learn -- children who are not loved at home, come to school to be loved 2. Children don't give adults a hard time -- they are just having a hard time. 3. Great teachers can do a lot -- overcoming poverty or inequity is not one of them."" 9. Tom Bennett a philosophy teacher from Glasgow, has been helping teachers tame classroom disruptions since 2010, which led to his immensely popular book, The Behaviour Guru. He continues to blog both personal anecdotes and insightful guides for behavior in school. Tom Bennett's Blog is another one for our Top 12. 10. Richard Wells, a Brit living in New Zealand, has an innovative blog on how to use iPads for school, i.e. it's not just about having new technology in the classroom. It needs to be moderated by intelligent teachers and a sharp support network. Thank you, Richard, for being one of the sharpest on our list! One of our personal favorites. 11. Silvia Rosenthal Tolisano, an educator in Brazil, blogs insightfully about contemporary education and her Globally Connected Learning blogs bridge voices from across the world. We're following Silvia in 2015! 12. Adam Steiner and Elizabeth Keefe pointed out we differentiate our instruction and our assessment, so why not our homework?

I confess that I came to reflect on where it would be best to raise the podium, to place the actors dressed in olive-green who would regulate the time of each person's speech, and how the white dove would look, fluttering over the shoulder of each orator. On the eve of December 30 I talked with Tania Bruguera who, hoarse and exhausted, already felt the cage closing around her. All the signs pointed to their not allowing her to even reach the Plaza and the political police unleashing a wave of repression against those who wanted to accompany her. I ventured to describe three possible scenarios she might face: that they would not let her leave her home, or would arrest her; that they would let her get to the plaza which would be taken over by a last-minute popular festival with cheap beer, parades and loud music; that they would let her stage Tatlin's Whisper, but fill the time at the microphone with voices shouting official slogans. There was no way to add to these variables one that would conclude with a chorus of plurality and tolerance making itself heard in front of the statue of José Martí. In that conversation I told her that ""The performance is already done; the artistic action achieved,"" because with her project Bruguera had unveiled the framework of censorship, cultural cowardice and repression that immobilizes Cuban life. Many of her artist friends had declined to accompany her, some acquaintances had called on her to concede and move Tatlin's Whisper to the interior some institution and others, more committed, had warned her that there was a plan to ""abduct her from the Plaza."" From the early hours of the morning the macabre dance of arrests and intimidation began. Ladies in White, activists, journalists and dissidents were jailed or blocked from leaving their homes. Many communicators had their cellphones cut off, text messaging cancelled and access to the government-operated Nauta email system restricted. In a whisper, information about what was happening began to surface. The 14ymedio team suffered a hard blow, with two reporters and a contributing writer arrested and our press office under a police operation for hours. The list of the jailed was growing and as communications began to work again we started calling each other to keep ourselves up-to-date. But the whisper turned into Tatlin's cry. One that is now heard through the phone lines, on Twitter, outside the police stations, where family members demand to spend the last day of the year with their loved ones. There is no microphone, no white dove, no one minute of freedom, but rather long hours of suffering and uncertainty. Tania, among all the scenarios we projected, we missed this one. You in jail and from there, dressed in the gray uniform of an inmate, you performed the most devastating and unforgettable of all your artistic actions. The Plaza is today in each one of us. 14ymedio, Cuba's first independent daily digital news outlet, published directly from the island, is available in Spanish here.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/that-day-after-christmas_b_6401324","12/31/2014","irene monroe","That Day After Christmas","I live in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a running joke among the residents of my block is that, unfortunately, we sometimes have to tolerate unpleasant sights and whiffs of each others' garbage as a result of the way our gaggle of sanitation workers barrels from house to house, leaving unsightly reminders of our trash. When the sanitation truck rolls away, the area is strewn not only with our trash but with our trashcans and recycle bins now littering the block too. Each neighbor must retrieve his or her receptacles from a mountain of them. One neighbor who lives a couple of houses down from me calls trash day ""anti-trash day,"" as she cleans up after the sanitation workers. On the Friday after Christmas, when the sanitation truck drove away (pickup is usually every Thursday, but with Christmas falling on that day this year, it rolled over to Friday), another neighbor went to retrieve her receptacles expecting nothing out of the ordinary. But as she rolled them back into her yard, she couldn't believe what she found scrawled on the side of one of the receptacles: the ""N"" word. In 1998 the NAACP successfully convinced Merriam-Webster lexicographers to clearly designate the ""N"" word as a racial slur before the definition. Still, the ""N"" word is firmly embedded in the racist lexicon that was and still is used to disparage people of color, and our culture's cavalier use of the slur today speaks to how Americans of all races have become anesthetized to its destructive effects. While the battle to purge the ""N"" word from the American lexicon has been long, arduous, and unsuccessful, it is even harder to purge the sting of the word from the American psyche. Shocked by the sight of the epithet, my neighbor took a picture and hurried to remove the graffiti. But the stubborn oil pastel left an indelible mark, reminding her how hatred can be visited upon us so suddenly and unexpectedly. Cambridge, proudly dubbed ""The People's Republic of Cambridge,"" is often ranked as one of the most liberal cities in America. And with two of the country's premier institutions of higher learning -- Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- drawing students and scholars from around the world, the city rivals the UN in diversity and multiculturalism. Cambridge is also known for a lot of firsts in this country. For example, in 2004 it became the first city in Massachusetts -- and therefore in the United States -- to legally issue marriage-license applications to same-sex couples. It was also the first city in the country to elect an openly gay African-American mayor, Ken Reeves. And in 2008 Cambridge did it again, electing the country's first openly lesbian African-American mayor, E. Denise Simmons. Cambridge no doubt is a progressive city. In Cambridge, where racial tensions are far less pronounced than in Ferguson or New York City, particular between black communities and the police, people of color can feel somewhat removed from nagging reminders of intolerance and insensitivity. However, when you scratch below Cambridge's surface, intolerance and insensitivity can still be found. As in the South, where intolerance sees only race and tries to keep people in their place, Cambridge maintains its racial and class boundaries, not by designated ""colored"" water fountains, toilets, or restaurants but by neighborhood. The 02138 area code is a tony enclave, whereas the notorious Area 4 is a predominately black, poor, and working-class area. Cambridge may be multicultural, but sadly, it isn't integrated. In fact, fewer than five families of color reside on my block. The neighbor whose trashcan was vandalized is actually Southeast Asian, and her family has lived on the block for 20-plus years, with two children having graduated from Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and Buckingham Browne & Nichols School, respectively, and one now in attendance at Harvard. She and her family invited me to go with them to the police station to file their complaint. They wanted not only to make sure that the police had a record of the incident but to ascertain whether other residents of color anywhere in Cambridge had had similar experiences. While the Cambridge Police Department today is nothing like it was in 2009, when Cambridge police arrested renowned Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, who is black, for breaking into his own home after he found the front door jammed, the police officer who took my neighbors' complaint was politely dismissive as they showed him the photo and nervously struggled to explain the incident.

Discussions, questions and expectations have multiplied among us since the announcement from Barack Obama and Raul Castro about the reestablishment of relations between the United States and Cuba. We citizens have a lot of questions about the process and its influence on the future of our country. Tom Malinowski, United States Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor has responded to some of these questions for 14ymedio. Today we present his answers to our readers. Sanchez: The US has announced several measures to ease its policy towards Cuba. During the negotiations has the Cuban government shown a list of measures it is willing to implement? Malinowski: It is important to note that the measures announced by President Obama were not things he has asked of Cuban government. They have been steps we would like to take to empower the Cuban people. The objective is to strengthen the possibility that the people themselves can change the public policies of the Cuban government through greater access to resources and information, as well as to improve the quality of life for Cuban citizens who have lived with unnecessary social, economic and political restrictions imposed by the government. The Cuban government has indicated that it will release 53 political prisoners, an important first step for us, and it will also allow its people greater access to the internet. We have no illusions that it will be easy, but we feel that now we have an opportunity and we will be pushing hard. Q: Do you think President Obama or Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Cuba in the coming months? Would it not be against the embargo? R: President Obama has said that from now on senior US government officials will visit Cuba. Roberta Jacobson, Assistant Secretary of State for the Americas, will be responsible for the delegation that will travel to Havana in January 2015 for the round of negotiations about migration between the United States and Cuba. Secretary of State John Kerry has also said that he hopes to be the first Secretary of State in 60 years to visit Cuba. With regards to the embargo, US law prohibits certain transactions with agencies of the Cuban government. President Obama announced several modifications to the rules to facilitate the flow of resources and information to the Cuban people. In any case, visits of high officials will be part of the new diplomatic relationship between our countries. Q: Has legalization and an opening for a free and independent press in Cuba been among the topics discussed by the two governments? A:  Yes. A key focus of our policy will be to support civil society so that every Cuban can have the right to freedom of expression, association, assembly and the press. We will insist on these reforms in our meetings with the Cuban government working together with other countries in Latin American and Europe. We will continue to implement programs financed by the United States Congress to support fundamental freedoms, including freedom of the press and the free flow of information. The changes announced by President Obama eliminate one of the pretexts used by the Cuban government to persecute citizens who work to guarantee that the people have more freedoms. Now the focus of attention will not be on US policy toward Cuba, but on the policies of the Cuban government itself. Q: Is there a schedule with already defined timelines to put into effect the measures announced on 17 December? And if so, when will it be made public? A: President Obama wants to streamline the process so that the vision he presented in his speech is implemented as soon as possible The Secretary of State and all the members of president's cabinet understand the urgency that exists to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the new measures. The changes in our regulations to increase travel and trade will happen very quickly; the normalization of relations will depend on the Cuban government and also that of the United States. This issue will be discussed by the Undersecretary of State Roberta Jacobson in January. The next four years will change America forever.

Credit Desmond Boylan/Associated Press (Taken from the New York Times) [From the New York Times] HAVANA -- In one of my earliest memories, I am in a schoolyard before a campfire. The kids are screaming and jumping around it while the teacher stokes the flames, where a ridiculous Uncle Sam puppet is burning. This image came to mind on Wednesday, as I listened to the speeches of Raúl Castro and Barack Obama about the re-establishment of relations between Cuba and the United States. Generations of Cubans have grown up under the barrage of official propaganda against the United States. As the words directed against our neighbor to the north became more aggressive, our curiosity only grew. Overwhelmed by material precariousness, disillusioned because the so-called Raúl reforms have failed to fill their wallets or their plates, Cubans now dream of the material respite that might arrive from the other side of the Florida Straits. Without a fight, David, smiling, walks toward Goliath, who is about to open his bag of coins. The myth of the enemy is over; the difficult reality of coexistence has begun. Sara is a teacher I know at an elementary school in the Plaza of the Revolution municipality. Without the help sent by her daughter every month she couldn't survive. ""Now everything will be easier, especially because we'll be able to use American credit and debit cards here and my daughter is thinking of sending me one so I can get a little help whenever I need it,"" she said. Sara has decorated her classroom with a poster that includes images of the ""Cuban Five,"" spies whom the official propaganda considers heroes. (The Americans released the last three of them as part of a swap for a Cuban who had worked as an agent for American intelligence.) ""They are back, so we will have to change the bulletin board,"" she said with excitement and relief. Bonifacio Crespo helps a brother with accounting for their private restaurant in Havana. They already have a new business plan. ""We have the contacts to start importing raw materials, spices and many products for the menu, all we need is for them to expand the sending of packages from over there,"" he said, his finger pointing toward a cardinal point he believed was north. José Daniel Ferrer, a dissident, said that Havana had lost its ""alibi"" for political repression and economic control, and the independent magazine Convivencia (Coexistence) welcomed the news, but other dissidents worry that the government has yet to specify what it will do. The tension between the two governments lasted so long that now some people don't know what to do with their slogans, their fists raised against imperialism and their sick tendency to justify everything, from droughts to repression, on the grounds of being so close to ""the most powerful country in the world."" The worst off are the most recalcitrant members of the Communist Party, those who would die before chewing a stick of gum, drinking a Coke or setting foot in Disney World. The first secretary of their organization just betrayed them. He made a pact with the adversary, behind the scenes and over 18 long months. On Thursday, the party newspaper, Granma, was slow to reach the newsstands. Sometimes it is delayed when Fidel Castro publishes one of his delirious articles about the immensity of the galaxy or the memory of Hugo Chávez. In the long minutes of waiting, many speculated that Granma would arrive with some reflection from the comandante, but there was nothing. No evidence that would let us know whether he is for or against the risky step just taken by his brother. Many have read this silence as a sign of his delicate state of health, but by saying nothing, he has confirmed his political death, which is even more revealing and symbolic than his physical death will be. Representatives of civil society do not want the United States to ""extend a blank check"" to the longest-standing totalitarian regime in the Western Hemisphere unless four demands are met. First is the immediate release of political prisoners -- there are over 100, Elizardo Sánchez of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation estimates. Second is the ratification of United Nations human rights covenants. Third is the dismantling of the apparatus of repression: shameful assaults on so-called counterrevolutionaries, arbitrary arrests, demonization and intimidation of those who think differently and police surveillance of activists. Finally, the Cuban government must accept the existence of civic structures that have the right to express opinions, decide, question and choose -- voices that have not been represented in the current negotiations between the governments of Cuba and the United States. The road map drawn by the higher-ups has been hidden from us. An opportunity has been offered, despite the valid criticisms of many who question whether Uncle Sam has conceded too much, while his counterpart was too stingy to offer meaningful political gestures. Civil society must take advantage of it, elevate its voice, test the new limits of repression and censorship.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/has-d-day-arrived-for-cub_b_6402792","12/31/2014","yoani sanchez","Has D-Day Arrived for Cuba?","Telephone conversation between Barack Obama and Raul Castro. (White House) 14ymedio, Yoani Sanchez, Havana, 17 December 2014 -- Today has been one of those days we imagine a thousand ways, but never as it finally happened. You prepare for a date on which you can celebrate the end, hug your friends who return home, wave a flag in the middle of the street, but D-Day is late. Instead, events arrive in fragments, an advance here, a loss there. With no cries of ""Long live free Cuba,"" nor uncorked bottles. Life obscures from us this turning point that we would mark forever on our calendars. The announcement by the governments of Cuba and the United States of the reestablishments of diplomatic relations surprises us in the midst of signs that pointed in the opposite direction, and also of exhausted hopes. Raúl Castro just postponed the third round of talks with the European Union, scheduled for next month, and this December 10 repression fell heavily on activists, as it does every International Human Rights Day. The first surprise was that, in the midst of the official bluster, of a certain turn of the ideological screw expressed in calls to redouble our guard against the enemy, the Plaza of the Revolution and the White House had been in talks for 18 months. Clear evidence that all this discourse of intransigence was just for show. While they made the island's citizens believe that even to cross the threshold of the United States Interest Section in Havana turned them into traitors to the homeland, the leaders in their olive-green were working out agreements with Uncle Sam. The deceits of politics! On the other hand, both Obama's statements, as well as Castro's, had a hint of capitulation. The US president announced a long list of moderating measures to bring the two nations closer, before the coveted and greatly demanded steps of democratization and political opening in our country would be achieved. The dilemma of what should have come first, a gesture from Havana or flexibility from Washington, has just been answered. However, the fig leaf of the American embargo remains, so that no one can say the resignation as been complete. Raul Castro, for his part, limited himself to announcing the new gestures from Obama and referring to the exchange of Alan Gross and other prisoners of interest of the American government. However, in his address before the national television cameras, he gave no evidence of any agreement or compromise from the Cuban side, aside from the reestablishment of diplomatic relations. The agenda on the far side of the Florida Straits we know in detail, but the internal one remains, as it so often does, hidden and secret. Still, despite the absence of public commitments on the part of Cuba, today was a political defeat. Under the leadership of Fidel Castro we would have never even reached an outline of an agreement of this nature. Because the Cuban system is supported by -- as one of its main pillars -- the existence of a permanent rival. David can't live without Goliath and the ideological apparatus has depended too long on this dispute. Do I listen to speeches or buy fish? In the central market of Carlos III, customers were surprised midday that the big TVs were not broadcasting football or videoclips, but a speech by Raúl Castro and later one by Obama through the Telesur network. The first allocution caused a certain astonishment, but the second was accompanied by kisses launched toward the face of the US president, particularly when he mentioned relaxations in the sending of remittances to Cuba and the delicate topic of telecommunications. Now and again the cry of ""I LOVE..."" (in English!) could be heard from around the corner. It is important to also say that the news had fierce competition, like the arrival of fish to the rationed market, after years of disappearance. However, by mid-afternoon almost everyone was aware and the shared feelings were of joy, relief, hope. This, however, is just the beginning. Lacking is a public timeline by which commits the Cuban government to a series of gestures in support of democratization and respect for differences. We must take advantage of the synergy of both announcements to extract a public promise, which must include, at a minimum, four consensus points that civil society has been developing in recent months. The release of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience; the end of political repression; the ratification of the United Nations covenants on Civil, Political, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the consequent adjustment of domestic laws; and the recognition of Cuban civil society within and outside the island. Extracting these commitments would begin the dismantling of totalitarianism. As long as steps of this magnitude are not taken, many of us will continue to think that the day we have longed for is not close. So, we will keep the flags tucked away, keep the corks in the bottles and continue to press for the final coming of D-Day. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alan-gross-the-hook-that_b_6402786","12/31/2014","yoani sanchez","Alan Gross, the Hook That Ended Up Being Swallowed","Demonstrations demanding the release of Alan Gross 14ymedio, Yoani Sanchez, Havana, 17 December 2014 - With the pessimism that has now become chronic in our society, many Cubans thought that Alan Gross would only leave Cuba, ""in a box,"" in an image allusive of a fatal outcome. The stubbornness shown by the Cuban government in its relations with the United States didn't presage a short-term solution for the contractor. This Wednesday, however, he has been exchanged for three Cuban spies imprisoned in the United States, bringing to a close a long and complicated political chapter for both parties. Gross was only useful alive and his health was rapidly deteriorating. And Raul Castro knew this very well. Hence, in recent months he raised the decibels around the proposed exchange for the agent Antonio Guerrero and the officials Ramón Labañino and Gerardo Hernández, all serving long sentences in the prisons of our neighbor to the north. To the extent that the 65-year-old contractor grew thin and lost his vision, official campaigns grew increasingly insistent about the exchange. When Gross threatened to kill himself, the alarms if the island's government went off and the negotiating schedule accelerated. Barack Obama, for his part, made clear that any change in policy toward Havana would come up against the insurmountable obstacle of an American imprisoned for ""threats against the security of the State."" Even the New York Times had suggested an exchange in one of its editorials on Cuba, and the publication of that text in such a prestigious newspaper was read as a preview of what would happen. As in every political game, we see only one part, while in the intricacies of power the threads of the agreement made public just today were being woven. For those of us who know the mechanism of pressure used by the Plaza of the Revolution toward its opponents, the capture of Gross itself was a move aimed at recovering the Interior Ministry's agents. The contractor wasn't arrested for what he did, but rather for what they could do with him. It was a simple hook and he was aware of this from the beginning. His crime was not in having brought satellite equipment to connect the Cuban Jewish community to the Internet, but rather in carrying in his pocket a passport that immediately converted him into a medium of exchange on the board of tense bilateral relations between Washington and Havana. If we review the five years of captivity endured by Gross, we see a well-designed information script that the Cuban government used to put pressure on the Obama administration. Each image that came to light publicly, each visitor allowed to see him, was authorized with the sole condition of reinforcing the exchange proposal. In this way, the Castro regime has managed to get its way. It has managed to exchange a peaceful man, embarked on the humanitarian adventure of providing connectivity to a group of Cubans, for intelligence agents that caused significant damage and sorrow with their actions. In the game of politics, totalitarian regimes manage to win over democracies because the former control the public opinion inside their countries, determine all legal results to suit their purposes, and can continue to waste their nation's resources trying to free the moles they sent to their adversary's camp. Democracies, however, end up conceding because they must answer to their own people, they must live with an incisive press that criticizes them for making or not making certain decisions, and because they are forced to do everything possible bring their dead and alive back home. The Castro regime has won, although the positive result is that Alan Gross has emerged alive from a prison that promised to turn into his grave. Now, we can expect long weeks of cheering and slogans in which the Cuban government will proclaim itself a victor in its latest battle. But, there is no space in the national pantheon for so many still-breathing heroes, and little by little, the recently returned agents will lose importance and visibility. The myth created for them from a distance will begin to fade. With the main obstacle for the re-establishment of diplomatic relations eliminated, the only unknown is the next step. Is the Cuban government planning another move to return to a position of force vis-a-vis the US government? Or are all the cards on the table this time, before the weary eyes of a population that anticipates that the Castro regime will also win the next move.

I was shocked when I saw that voters in largely Hispanic and African-American areas were forced to wait hours and hours to vote by design. The state had cut early voting from 14 to 6 days and added 11 constitutional amendments to the ballot (some written out in full) to make it more time consuming to vote such that one legislator compared the ballot to the Book of Leviticus. I also was told authorities did not deploy all available ballot boxes. Tasked with encouraging voters to wait for over 3 hours until 10:30 p.m. on a Saturday, I was struck with how little needed to be done. They knew why they were waiting and that only made them more determined to vote. I was reminded of the song ""Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Round"" and the voting rights marches in Selma during the Civil Rights era and thought how sad it is that here we stand nearly 50 years after Selma and African-Americans still had to fight for their right to vote. The next year, the Supreme Court gutted the enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act that enabled the Justice Department to block discriminatory voting restrictions in Shelby County v Holder. The Act had been reauthorized in 2006 without a single vote of opposition in the Senate, but in the Obama-era a bill to revive the provisions got nowhere last year despite bipartisan support. The struggle in Selma is now on movie screens across America for viewers to relive the brutality of Bloody Sunday and the ultimate triumphant march that drew Americans from all races and faiths from across the nation to take a stand for freedom and against bigotry and hate. In March, however, the world's attention will once again return to the Edmond Pettus Bridge for the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. It will be a tempered celebration because it has been a difficult two years for race relations in America. Obama's reelection victory unleashed a torrent of racist hate across social media, then came the killings of Treyvon Martin in Florida, Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York and the divisions their cases brought. More importantly, throughout the period we have steadily moved backwards on voting rights as states across the south and elsewhere took advantage of the Shelby County decision to enact a number of restrictive voting measures that are designed to suppress the African-American vote. I have one resolution for 2015 -- I'm going to Selma. As a child of Generation Jones, we always looked up to our Baby Boomer brethren who marched for civil rights when we had no need to for the victory had been won. That victory is in jeopardy.  I'm going to Selma. James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Mickey Schwerner among others were killed for this most fundamental right -- the right to vote. They cannot cry for justice, instead it is the duty of the living to do so for them. I'm going to Selma. I do not expect a House of Representatives that has no shame over having a white supremacist in its leadership to listen to our pleas for action on voting rights legislation. I'm going to Selma. Martin Luther King once said, ""[h]istory will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people."" Similarly, Benjamin Franklin said that ""[j]ustice will not be served until those who are as unaffected are as outraged as those who are.""  I'm outraged and I'm going to Selma. We are a generous nation that has come together to help those in need as we did after Katrina or to take a stand that we are one as we did after 9/11. The story of civil rights in America is not relegated to our history books or a movie but is still being written today. It is time to write the next chapter for civil rights in America. Once again we are called to take a stand for freedom and against bigotry and hate. I'm going to Selma. The next four years will change America forever.

Kafka skillfully navigates the line between blame and responsibility, between chance and conscious decision making, which are all so fundamentally different in the case of an adult and in the case of a child. Kafka never mailed the letter to his father, continuing a lifetime pattern of repressed emotions and lack of communication. We will never know how Kafka's father would have reacted to that letter, but one thing is clear: Connection and communication are essential if a relationship is to exist. The tremendous negative results of broken or unskillful communication are even more obvious in the light of Ferguson and Staten Island incidents. We live in one of the most prosperous nations in the world, one that even contains the word ""united"" in its name. Still, no fewer than 458 Americans died at the hands of police in 2013, compared with just eight in Germany and zero in both Japan and the UK. Deaths from police shootings: USA 458Germany 8Britain 0Japan 0http://t.co/7hHhuWiuNd pic.twitter.com/boleSgPvZx Also, the United States has the highest rate of incarceration in the developed world: 2.3 million men and women, or one in every 104 of the nation's adults, are behind bars. The incarceration rate is higher in the U.S. than it is in Russia, China or Iran -- company the U.S. should not want to be in. Although incarceration seems to be very popular in the U.S., research is ambiguous about its corrective value, specifically when it's about small offenses. But studies have consistently found that prisoners who maintain close contact with their family members while incarcerated have better post-release outcomes and lower recidivism rates. A 2011 report by the Vera Institute of Justice states: Research shows that incarcerated people who maintain supportive relationships with family members have better outcomes -- such as stable housing and employment -- when they return to the community. We can go a step further and argue that what needs to happen in offenders' lives is the exact opposite of incarceration: an increase in quality social relationships, not a complete cutoff from society and a concomitant increase in close relationships with other perpetrators. Like many children, Blair Sandlain went her entire childhood with her father behind bars, and this experience gave her the idea to create an app that helps families bridge the communication gap that incarceration so often entails. Connect Inmate, which is free to download, aims to make it easy for families to communicate in a meaningful way with incarcerated loved ones. She explains, ""Often times what keeps inmates out of trouble and gives them hope is the awareness that someone outside cares for them."" Meanwhile, however, the U.S.'s habit of incarcerating people has created a profitable private prison industry. As David Shapiro, a staff attorney with the ACLU National Prison Project, writes on CNBC.com: As incarceration rates skyrocket, the private prison industry expands at exponential rates. The number of inmates in private prisons increased by roughly 1600 percent between 1990 and 2009. In 2010, the two largest private prison companies alone took in nearly $3 billion in revenue, and their top executives each received annual compensation packages worth well over $3 million. According to the Vera Institute, in 2010 we spent $39 billion in public money on incarceration, a portion of which is generating large profits for private prisons. The questions is: What is the impact on American cultural and social relationships when we, as a nation, allow corporations to profit from incarcerating more and more of our very own citizens? Our knowledge of social and family relationships has changed significantly since 1919, when Kafka wrote -- but never sent -- that letter to his father. We now know so much more about the importance of meaningful human connection. And still it seems that, to a great extent, we prefer circulating money over creating social meaning.

My Favorite Americana Discoveries of 2014","One of the reasons I attend Americana music festivals is for the opportunity to be exposed to new music and musicians I might never have sampled on my own. Following is a list of some my favorite Americana musical discoveries of 2014 in no particular order and where I first heard them. I hope that you will share your own discoveries. Sunliner -- Rooster Walk 6 and Reynolda House Backyard Barbecue and Brews Sunliner is a song-driven roots rock band that fuses the artistry of The Infamous Stringduster's lead singer and bass player Travis Book and his singer/songwriter wife Sarah Siskind, whose songs have been featured on ABC's hit show Nashville and Pretty Little Liars, among others. At SXSW 2013, Time Magazine called her ""one of the 5 best voices."" According to their website, Sunliner's sound is unique, encompassing rock, folk, country, jazz fusion and blues, but the music remains firmly rooted in the Virginia soil where they now make their home. Both amazing artists in their own right, I hope to hear more from this husband and wife team in 2015. Balsam Range -- MerleFest Balsam Range is made up of five outstanding acoustic musicians and singers from Western North Carolina. According to their website, for their band name they thoughtfully and respectfully adopted the name of a majestic range of mountains that surround part of their home county of Haywood, where the Smokies meet the Blue Ridge, the Balsam Range. The band received numerous top honors in the 2014 IBMA Awards, including Entertainer of the Year. Balsam Range was also honored as Vocal Group of the Year. Buddy Melton was named Male Vocalist of the Year, and Tim Surrett received a Mentor Award. The band's fifth album, Five, made its Billboard Chart debut at No. 4 and remained on the Billboard chart for an impressive six weeks. I heard them playing one afternoon at MerleFest and they had me at their single, ""Trains I've Missed."" I believe they will have your attention if you give them a listen.  Sturgill Simpson -- Prairie Home Companion (My backyard) So this one you may say doesn't count because I didn't hear him perform in person, but I did hear Sturgill Simpson perform on Prairie Home Companion ""live"" on my radio in my backyard and he is too good a find to leave off my list (and hey, it's MY list, after all, so who's to say who does and doesn't count?). If you haven't heard him, it's only a matter of time. He and his new album, Metamodern Sounds In Country Music, made a number of best of 2014 lists, including NPR's 10 Breakout Artists of 2014. He's been compared to Waylon and an early Hank Williams Jr., But don't take our word for it, judge for yourself here. The Deadly Gentlemen -- MerleFest The Deadly Gentlemen were the last act I caught at MerleFest 2014 before listening to Merle Haggard, who closed out this year's festival with an impressive performance. The only reason I happened to hear The Deadly Gentlemen was because they hit the Hillside Stage after Jerry Douglas, whom I will stand in the pouring rain to hear make sweet music with his dobro. Based out of NYC (yes I know, it seems unlikely that a band from THE city would be playing in the hills of Wilkesboro, N.C.), they had me wishing for more. I think you will, too, after you give them a listen here. After Jack - Rooster Walk 6 After Jack caught my attention at Rooster Walk with their amazing harmonies and foot-stomping, old-timey string band tunes. The Franklin County, Va., trio merged in 2011 after meeting while working as performers in a professional theater company, according to their website. Their first album, Echo, was produced by Aaron Ramsey of Mountain Heart. After Jack couples a modern sensibility with distinctly old-time energy to blend bluegrass, gospel and folk elements. The band won the Local Roots Band Competition at the Red Wing Roots Music Festival in July 2014. After Jack, which is scheduled to perform at Rooster Walk 7 over Memorial Day weekend, was named the 2014 Americana Vocal Band of the Year by the Appalachian Cultural Music Association and competed in the 2014 Telluride Bluegrass Festival Band Competition. Hackensaw Boys -- FloydFest The Hackensaw Boys caught my attention at FloydFest 2014 when someone mentioned they were tied to Old Crow Medicine Sbow, one of my all-time favorite groups. Turns out, according to Wikipedia, Phillip ""Jigsaw"" St. Ours played washboard in both Hackensaw and Old Crow early on (1999-2001), and then for Hackensaw in (2008). Like OCMS, The Hackensaw Boys are a lot of fun to watch, and I dare you not to dance when you hear them play. Sanctum Sully - MerleFest and Rooster Walk 6 I am slipping Sanctum Sully on this list because they had a new album in 2014, Southern Trees. To be honest, however, I actually discovered them last year for the first time at Rooster Walk 5. This rockin' bluegrass band is so good, and were so amazing at their MerleFest 2014 debut, I had to add them to this list so that I could share their music with an even wider audience. The hit TV show Moonshiners should use Sanctum Sully's Lost Cove as its theme song. Based out of Asheville, N.C., the band describes their music as coming from beer-stained bar stools where blues, rock and bluegrass swap stories and trade tall-tale tunes. The polished five-piece acoustic group has been voted one of Western North Carolina's top three bluegrass bands for four years running. As their website states, three-part harmonies, mandolin, guitar, banjo and bass, Sanctum Sully can certainly pull off a traditional bluegrass tune in style. They are also a lot of fun. Mountain Xpress describes Sanctum Sully as, ""Like Steep Canyon Rangers or Chatham County Line, the band's melodic pathways are paved mostly with pop, harnessing tangled acoustic instrumentation to make hooks as unavoidably catchy as mountain bramble."" Give them a listen. You won't be disappointed. Mandolin Orange --- MerleFest I caught a few strains of Mandolin Orange performing on the Americana stage and knew immediately I wanted to hear more. What I didn't realize at the time was the duo hails from Kernersville, N.C., just down the road from me. Over the past few years, according to their website, Mandolin Orange has shared bills with Rosanne Cash, Chatham County Line, the Steep Canyon Rangers and Abigail Washburn, and traveled as far as the UK to perform at festivals, including Ulster's 21st Annual Bluegrass Festival, Shakori Hills Grassroots and Hopscotch Music Festival. TAUK -- FloydFest TAUK is a bit of a divergence from the rest of my list, but after interviewing these guys from Oyster Bay, N.Y., at FloydFest and discovering how genuine they are and hearing everyone else's reaction to their music, I felt compelled to include them. The quartet keeps popping up on my Sirius radio as a reminder of what I heard from them last summer and their newest album, Collisions. Their website describes their music as heavy instrumental rock fusion created by Matt Jalbert (guitar), Charlie Dolan (bass), Alric ""A.C."" Carter (keyboard-organ) and Isaac Teel (drums). The Washington Post says: ""TAUK's instrumental music melds genres and styles, creating a hard-charging, often melodic fusion that -- thanks to a penchant for improv -- offers limitless possibilities"" and The Deli Magazine singles out the band's compelling melodic sense through explaining: ""the quartet has a rare ability to channel emotional melodic leads, and all without a lead singer.""

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-year-2014-for-organiz_b_6402624","12/31/2014","david macaray","The Year 2014 for Organized Labor","It's something of a disgrace to have to admit that things have been so bad for organized labor for such a long time, that unless something truly horrendous or headline-grabbing happens during a particular year (e.g., an industry fails, a union membership is decimated), we tend not even to pay attention. So tepid and uninspiring is the labor landscape, even the occasional strike or boycott is met with a collective ""ho-hum."" Meanwhile, private sector membership continues to dwindle, workers' power continues to be eroded and corporations continue to find new ways of out-maneuvering the unions. While 2014 was one of those ""ho-hum"" years, there were some notable exceptions. By engaging in a collective protest of their abysmally low wages, fast-food workers at national restaurant chains and were able to attract some prime-time media attention. Granted, their time in the limelight was short-lived and ephemeral, but these orchestrated protests were not only a step in the right direction, they were way overdue. And Thomas Perez, who replaced Hilda Solis (and the interim Seth Harris), finished his first full year as Secretary of Labor in the Obama administration. Among the groups to endorse Perez's nomination were the AFL-CIO, UFW (United Farm Workers) and NAACP, so at the very least, Perez looked good on paper. The woman he's replacing, Ms. Solis, did an adequate job as Labor Secretary (she resigned to run for Congress), particularly in regard to assisting low-level restaurant, hotel and carwash employees (""carwasheros""), most of whom are Latinos, and many of whom are systematically victimized by unscrupulous bosses. In fact, the Department of Labor was able to get criminal charges to stick against a couple of corrupt Southern California carwash owners, guilty of cheating workers out of their pay. In the two years Perez has left on the job, he will have ample opportunity to show whether he's the real deal -- a labor reformer and crusader -- or just another ambitious, over-achieving Ivy Leaguer (Brown, Harvard Law) looking to pad his resume while sucking on the government teat (a la former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, another Harvard Law School product). The last really impressive Secretary of Labor we had -- arguably, second only to the legendary FDR appointee, Frances Perkins, the first woman Labor Secretary in history -- was Robert Reich, who served in Clinton's first term before resigning in exasperation. He now teaches at UC Berkeley. Anyone interested in a fascinating insider's look at the Department of Labor would be advised to read Reich's memoir, ""Locked in the Cabinet."" There was also a changing of the guard at the UAW (United Auto Workers), with Dennis Williams replacing outgoing president Bob King. Given its illustrious history and immeasurable influence on the American labor movement, focusing on the UAW's current state of affairs is almost too gruesome to contemplate. Once boasting of 1.8 million members, the UAW is now down to a mere 390,000. By all accounts, Williams is a gamer, a fighter, ready to push for the reinstatement of boiler-plate contract language (including elimination of two-tier wages and benefits). The only question is: At this late stage, does he have the muscle to do it? Because he'll need every resource he can scrounge up to pull it off. The year 2014 was a terrible one for public school teachers, as the greedy proponents of for-profit education attempted to demonize and vilify them, pretending that low test scores (themselves very misleading) were the direct result of substandard teachers -- not only a specious argument but one calculated specifically to destroy America's teachers' unions. Arguably, the only union that continues to behave like the proud unions of the 1950s and 1960s is the ILWU (International Longshore and Warehouse Union), and that's due solely to the fact that they have a firm grip on job security. As much as they would love to do so, the shipping companies can't relocate the West Coast ports to a Third World country, and pay cheap wages. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/minimum-wage-increases-the-justice-of-redistribution_b_6399030","12/31/2014","john r burbank","Minimum-Wage Increases: The Justice of Redistribution","As we enter the new year, 3 million low-wage workers in 21 states will gain a small increase in their wages, thanks to increases in state minimum wages. People you know will see a wage increase -- your neighbor, your teenage kid, the person who serves you coffee and donuts. The minimum-wage increase is a good thing because it increases income in a small way to the workers on the low rungs of our economy. A stagnant minimum wage redistributes income from workers to owners and managers and, ultimately, shareholders and customers. As the minimum wage has failed to keep up with inflation and productivity increases, our political economy has redistributed significant income from low-wage workers to owners over the past 40 years. One reason this happened is that workers have no leverage vis-à-vis corporations. They are price takers for their labor. Minimum-wage increases reverse this redistribution so that workers win back a little bit of what they have lost. Minimum wages should be associated with value added instead of the powerlessness of workers to demand higher wages. But minimum-wage workers are not compensated for the value of their work for their employers. Raising the wage begins to remedy that undercompensation. If the wage goes too high, then employers will not hire workers, because their compensation exceeds the value of their work. But as we have seen, this is not the case with minimum-wage increases, which simply means that for the past decades workers have been paid less than the value of their work for employers. How does increasing the minimum wage redistribute income? An increase in the wage results in a decrease in the payments to managers and profits for the establishment. That's redistribution. We can argue that this might not happen because of productivity increases by the worker, but that merely means that the productivity increases (or a portion thereof) that might have gone to the employer instead go to the employee -- hence redistribution from owners to workers. Redistribution also can occur between worker and customer. If a restaurant increases prices due to an increase in the minimum wage, in an attempt to avoid a decrease in profits, then the customers pay more. These customers have the disposable income to patronize restaurants. We can make the assumption that the customers have greater incomes than the people who wait on them. Thus, an increase is again redistributive, with the increase coming from increased prices paid by customers. Imagine: In Seattle an Amazon IT person goes out to lunch. (It feels like they all do.) Instead of paying $15 at the Skillet truck, they pay $17. They have lost $2, and the Skillet truck workers will have seen an increase in their wages. Redistribution to minimum-wage workers is good for them and pushes up the floor for the bottom half of all wages. We too often equate increasing the minimum wage with living standards and poverty levels. This is dangerous for several reasons, including the fact that it sets a precedent for slicing and dicing the minimum wage: Do you have dependents? Do you pay for your own health insurance? How old are you? Are you paying for tuition yourself? All these are important questions, but taken to their logical conclusion, they move the minimum wage into welfare policy, so that an 18-year-old student could get paid less than a 25-year-old who is on her parents' health insurance, and she might get paid less than a single mom with one kid, who could get paid less than a spouse in a household with three kids, etc. These are life situations best handled by social policy, social insurance and the appropriate provisions of public goods and services. But a focus on the minimum wage as welfare policy debases the fact that we should be raising the minimum wage because we should be insuring that workers are paid the value of their work. That is, such a focus disrespects workers as workers. A lot of liberals don't want to call increases in the minimum wage ""redistributive."" It brings the reality of class conflict too close to the surface, apparently, and portrays workers as workers, not as victims. But in order for workers to not be victims, they must be compensated for the value of their work. That is not happening now, not in these United States. These state minimum-wage increases begin to reverse the damage, precisely because they are redistributive, from the owners of capital to the workers they employ. That is a good thing -- and an excellent beginning for the new year! The next four years will change America forever.

It was the year my second child was born. In terms of pop culture, it was a mixed bag. On a positive tip (I want to try using that phrase to see if I can bring it back), Michael Keaton made a comeback, U2 released one of their best albums in decades (don't hate), and Chris Pratt became a movie star. On a downside, we lost way too many talented people this year from Robin Williams to Joan Rivers to Philip Seymour Hoffman. In a word, it sucks. It will always suck. Williams' death in particular will always hurt because of all the good he brought to us all. Anyway, as we close another year, here are my personal favorite moments in pop - music, TV, and film.

""De Blasio: Apologize to the NYPD!!"" the sign, which flew up and down the Hudson River for about an hour and a half, read. NEW YORK: Banner reading “De Blasio: Apologize to the NYPD!!” flew over Hudson River for thousands to see. PHOTO - pic.twitter.com/Pnnb0Zk0WQ According to the New York Daily News, Michael Sheehan, a retired correction officer from Westchester County and son of an NYPD detective, was behind the stunt. ""The reason my father came home everyday was because none of his bosses placed him in such peril as you are doing with your mouth, Mayor de Blasio,"" he said in a statement. On Friday, a coalition of current and retired NYPD officers flew a banner above the Hudson that read, ""De Blasio, Our Backs Have Turned To You."" Tensions have been high between de Blasio and the police department following weeks of demonstrations protesting a grand jury's decision not to indict an NYPD officer in the choking death of Eric Garner, who was unarmed when he died in Staten Island in July. On December 20, two on-duty NYPD officers were killed ""execution style"" by a man who suggested he wanted revenge for Garner's death on social media. Following the officers' deaths, a number of NYPD officers and officials have publicly displayed their disdain for the mayor, who has shown support for protesters engaging in non-violent demonstrations. The day of the shooting, Pat Lynch, the head of the city's largest police union, said the mayor had ""blood on his hands."" During one of the slain officer's funerals, hundreds of cops turned their backs on de Blasio during his speech. A few days later, he was booed at an NYPD graduation ceremony.

The paper also found that arrests have dropped 66 percent in the past week alone. The New York Times condemned the NYPD's anti-de Blasio actions in a pair of editorials this week. ""With these acts of passive-aggressive contempt and self-pity, many New York police officers, led by their union, are squandering the department’s credibility, defacing its reputation, shredding its hard-earned respect,"" the first, published on Tuesday, read. ""The failures of some cops, the misguided policing tactics that feed a sense of oppression in parts of the city, the offensive provocations of some in the police-reform protest movement, and the horrific killings of two officers, have led the city to a dangerous point.""

At the end of the day, bullying -- whether in school or online -- is still bullying so strategies to combat cyberbullying have to be integrated into the entire school climate. There are a lot of programs that seek to accomplish this and what the good ones have in common is the understanding that young people themselves are an essential part of the solution. One such program, Community Matters, has been around since 1996. The Northern-California based non-profit reports that it has worked with more than 1,000 schools, agencies and organizations across 30 states, Puerto Rico, Guam and Canada. And, as its CEO and founder Rick Phillips said in an interview (scroll down to listen to 14 minute podcast) the organization's strategy is to ""see the young people in our schools (including those who may have engaged in bullying) not just as the perpetrator but as the solution."" He added that ""young people are in the best position to intervene because they see, hear and know about these things before an adult ever knows about them.""

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-years-reflections-on-race-relations_b_6391130","12/31/2014","deborah l. plummer","New Year's Reflections on Race Relations","To quote Pharrell Williams' hit song ""Happy,"" ""it might seem crazy, what I'm about to say."" In regard to race relations, there wasn't much to be happy about in 2014. Still, I'm happy and optimistic about race relations in 2015. Despite the celebration of 50 years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans remain as segregated as ever, particularly in our social patterns and in our attitudes about the progress we have made toward that more perfect union. Although standard segregation measures show that American cities are more integrated now than they have been since 1910, spatial racism as a pattern of housing development still exists. We connect globally through numerous devices with just a finger tap, yet we remain ethnocentric in our thinking. National polls reveal that the majority of Americans do not have friends that cross racial lines, and that our social networks only comprise those of our own race; thus we suffer from cultural encapsulation. The lessons to be learned from the racially charged comments of sports-team owners and the policing practices that result in the killing of unarmed black men and deep mistrust between law enforcement and black and brown communities remain on our segregated tables. Although I am not quite feeling the happiness of a room without a roof, I do believe that there are reasons to clap along and be encouraged that race relations can and will improve in 2015. I am not looking for another Martin Luther King Jr., or even for President Obama, to lead the way. A single person as leader cannot make the kind of changes necessary to improve today's race relations. We are beyond legislating race in America. The leadership that is required to mend current race relations has to come from a collective force so powerful that it can only result in forward movement. In my happy world, I envision a critical mass of everyday people who make these practices the norm: 1. Listening for understanding and not rebuttal. You know that you have achieved this if you ask probing or clarifying questions about what was just said in lieu of tapping your foot, waiting to pounce with an ingenious comeback. This practice is especially hard when you believe that (and sometimes even know that) you are right. Which brings me to my next point. 2. Releasing the need to be right. Support dialogues that hold multiple realities, work to understand what the other perspective might be, and continually ask, ""What would help me understand that perspective?"" In conversations about race, instead of trying to be right, ask yourself, ""How does this change the narrative on race relations? Does this comment elevate the conversation to something that will lead to progress?"" 3. Challenging assumptions. Question anecdotal generalizations that broadly paint any race (that includes white people) with broad strokes. Hold multiple realities and seek new ways of knowing. 4. Marrying intention and impact. Understand that a negative impact does not always come as a result of bad intentions. Understand that good intentions do not necessarily lessen a negative impact. 5. Being racially resilient. Racially resilient individuals are folks who stay engaged during racial clashes and don't give up until they are familiar with the script of multicultural living. Racial tensions become creative tensions that lead to new ways of knowing and trusting each other. 6. Fighting racial bias. The bad news is that neuroscience research indicates that parts of the brain, particularly the amygdala, are active in initial racial bias. The good news is that although racial bias may be neurologically based, racial biases are not inevitable. Mahzarin Banaji, a Harvard professor and a thought leader in studying unconscious bias, notes that we can actually train our brains to work against stereotypes and reduce biases by exposing ourselves to counterstereotypical messages and images as a way to limit unconscious bias. This is the image that I will hold as a promise of improved race relations in 2015. Of course, these practices are easier to write than to do. The doing part is very hard, and it takes a lot of collective doing to make any progress. Improving race relations requires cultural humility, knowing that ridding oneself of bias and becoming diversity-proficient is a lifelong journey. The next four years will change America forever.

So I invite all ""wordies"" (oh, I'm a-gonna get some grief for that) to join in the fun! Here is the full list of banished words for 2015: Bae Polar vortex Hack Skill Set Swag Foodie Curate / Curated Friend-raising Cra-cra (cray-cray) Enhanced interrogation Takeaway [...] -Nation (sports) I have to admit, this year's list made me feel my age a bit, since there were several terms on the list that I either just flat-out didn't recognize or that I had to read the definitions for, in order to understand what they were talking about. Take ""bae"" for instance. I'd seen it hovering around online, but never bothered to figure out that it means ""before anyone else."" Or ""swag,"" which now is apparently a catchall word for what folks used to call ""cool."" To which, I can only say: ""Groovy, man."" To put it a different way: ""Dang these kids today."" Anyway, as usual the comments from people proposing words for the banished list were pretty amusing at times: [Bae] -- ""It's overused. I heard someone refer to their ramen noodles as 'bae'! If I was putting someone 'before anything else,' I would respect them enough to use their name."" ""The most annoying term of affection to show up in years. Also, the concept 'before anybody else,' developed AFTER the word became popular. Reason enough for it to be banned."" [Polar vortex] -- ""Wasn't it called 'winter' just a few years ago?"" ""What happened to 'cold snap'? Not descriptive enough?"" [Hack] -- ""I just received an e-mail for a book called 'Marriage Hacks.' I have seen articles about life hacks, home improvement hacks, car hacks, furniture hacks, painting hacks, work hacks and pretty much any other hack you can think of. There are probably even hacking hacks."" [Skill set] -- ""A skill is a skill -- that is it. Phrases such as 'I have the skill set to do that properly' or anything resembling that phrase, shows the speaker is seriously lacking skills in the art of conversation. Please try this, 'I have the skill... do you have the skills... this requires certain skills... he is very skilled... that was a skillful maneuver... See? No need for a skill set."" [Swag] -- ""The word 'swag' has become a shapeless, meaningless word used in various forms (such as 'swaggy') but with no real depth."" ""Whether it's a 'free gift' (banished in 1988) or droopy clothing, this word is neither useful nor fancy."" [Foodie] -- ""It's ridiculous. Do we call people who like wine 'winies' or beer lovers 'beeries'?"" ""Someone who enjoys food' applies to everyone on Earth. What's next? 'Oh, I'm an airie; I just love to breathe.' 'Could we do it at 11, instead? I'm kind of a sleepie.'"" [Curate / Curated] -- ""It used to have a special significance reserved mainly for fine art and museums. Now everything is curated. Monthly food and clothing subscription boxes claim to be finely 'curated.' Instead of abusing curated, why don't they say what they really mean: 'We did an online search and posted the first 25 items we found' or the 'curated selection of items in your box this month are a mix of paid placements and products that have failed to sell elsewhere.'"" [Takeaway] -- ""It's used all too frequently on news programs, as in, 'What is your 'takeaway' on a given situation.' 'What is our 'takeaway' on Congress' vote?' 'Is there any 'takeaway' on the recent riots?' I have heard Jon Stewart use it. I've heard Charlie Rose use it, as well as countless numbers of news talking heads, usually for all the wrong reasons. For me, a takeaway is a sports term, where one team is controlling the ball (or puck) and the other steals it, or took it away - a 'takeaway.' In the U.K., 'takeaway' food is known as 'to go' here in the Colonies."" [-Nation] -- ""Although a devout Wisconsin sports fan, I do not belong to Packer-Nation, Badger-Nation, Phoenix-Nation, or Brewer-Nation. Further, I am not aware of any team or mascot that has the carrying capacity to be a nation."" To which I'd like to add a few personal observations. ""Polar vortex"" is really the continuation of two trends. The first is the rediscovery by the national news organizations of ""weather."" Used to be, national news would ignore most weather events that were purely local in nature, even big events where a few people died. This is no longer the case, and every single weather disruption gets top billing nowadays (mostly because they all have dramatic videos to show the folks at home). The secondary trend -- and this is my own theory -- was when the East Coast got jealous, about 15 or 20 years ago, with the ""El Niño"" and ""La Niña"" weather patterns in California and the Pacific Ocean. The East Coast had blizzards, floods, storms, and other outdoor calamities, but the Left Coast was so hip they had cool names for weather trends. Obviously, they've been trying to catch up ever since. But maybe that's just me.... One footnote on ""swag,"" in its original banished meaning (free stuff): being of Germanic ancestry, I've always used either the pronunciation ""shwag"" (or even ""schwag"") because it sounds better to my ears. This has nothing to do with anything, I fully admit, but I thought I'd toss it out there for discussion. Also up for pedantic pondering: I've always seen ""cray-cray"" written with trailing Y's. It just looks better that way, at least to me. But then again, I am not a hip young user of social media, so what do I know? ""Foodie"" has long irritated me, just because it sounds so downright silly. Haven't noticed the rise of ""curated"" or ""friend-raising"" (shudder), which seems to be the practice of hitting up your pals for dough. ""Takeaway"" never really bugged me, but I can see how it could be considered annoying. On a more serious note, I think we can all agree that 2014 was the year that ""enhanced interrogation"" was fully de-euphemized back into the easier-to-understand ""torture."" And lastly, before I cram these all into a final paragraph, I lay the blame for ""-nation"" at the feet of New England fans. The first time I ever heard the term was in reference to the Boston Red Sox, and it is indicative of a peculiar delusion of this region's fans -- many of whom are confidently convinced that their team is equally beloved by everyone across this great land. Kind of like the delusion the Dallas Cowboys fans went through back in the 1970s, when they all wanted everyone to use ""America's Team"" to describe their local favorites. This is nothing more than thinly-disguised sports arrogance, folks. It now seems to be spreading beyond New England (to be fair, some Californians have used ""Raiders Nation"" for a long time, too), and I agree it should be banished. You love your team. We get it. But not everyone does -- and you cannot claim nationhood, unless you want to look silly. Get over it. In fact, since I'm on a roll, I think I'll just end with the sports theme for our big finish. I, of course, expect everyone in America to now consider themselves part of Giants Nation, after their stunning World Series win this year. Our bae Madison Bumgarner certainly showed everyone what a swag pitcher is capable of, with a skill set no other pitcher can match. I mean, was his nine-inning performance cray-cray, or what? The takeaway was, of course, that everyone else in America got the chance to become a San Francisco baseball fan this year. All of whom are invited to come to the city by the Bay (even if they have to friend-raise the money for the trip) to see a game and check out the Giants ballpark -- the best in the league as well, with concessions even foodies rave about! OK, I fully admit that, football-wise, San Francisco is in dire need of some life hacks, or perhaps a curated list of 25 available head coaches to fill Jim Harbaugh's departing shoes. But it's not like Harbaugh is going to face any enhanced interrogation techniques to divulge his coaching secrets in his new gig at the University of Michigan or anything -- although he might have to get used to a polar vortex or two. And no matter how much you use and abuse language (and no matter which sports teams your hearts and passports belong to), we'd like to wish everyone a very happy new year!

Time, which becomes such a precious commodity with each passing year, has a way of surprising me with its swiftness. Wasn't it just July? Didn't I just turn 50? But alas, it is the end of December and I just turned 60, and both facts startle me equally into a frenzied state of near-disbelief. I feel the need to do a double-take but know that my eyes will return to the same place...so why bother? I'd say that professionally, this was a good year. I was happy to have two articles published in Family Circle MagazineI also continued to expand my freelance client roster into other new health markets, both online and in print. One particularly fascinating story was a patient success story I wrote for a New York hospital about a three-way kidney transplant; I got to speak with the mother-son patient/donor team, as well as both physicians who performed the operations. The story details made me feel like I was reading a script from Gray's Anatomy! I love what I do. It gives me an opportunity to learn and uncover many interesting facts and stories. And the older I get, the more I realize that it is impossible to ever run out of new things to learn. Speaking of getting older, it bears repeating that in October, I celebrated my 60th birthday. Although I find it hard to comprehend that I am ""that old,"" I am grateful for the gift of growing older. But, really... Sixty? Me? I feel so much younger; I refuse to believe it, act it or look it! Old keeps getting younger, that's my motto. As it turns out, that's a good thing, medically speaking. A new paper published online by JAMA Internal Medicine says so. Researchers found that older people who felt three or more years younger than their chronological age had a lower death rate compared with those who felt their age or even older than their actual age. Here's an excerpt: "" Possibilities include a broader set of health behaviors than we measured (such as maintaining a healthy weight and adherence to medical advice), and greater resilience, sense of mastery and will to live among those who feel younger than their age."" It's a funny thing, this so-called aging. Ask most people around my age if they'd like to go back to being in their 20s, and you get a resounding, ""no way!"" We find value in our hard-won fight to gain wisdom, happiness and emotional balance. With each passing year, we uncover more about how to overcome challenges and navigate the world. Perspectives come sharply into focus, as do priorities. I watch as so many 20-somethings struggle to define themselves; impatient to get it right while afraid to make mistakes and often getting caught up in what we can now confidently call ""nonsense"" but what we once called ""disaster."" Which is precisely why other studies show that happiness levels shoot up after the age of about 50. Makes perfect sense, don't you think? And while I arm myself with healthy habits and some other things that are hailed as ""anti-aging,"" I'd much prefer to think of them as being part of an arsenal to help me age better and feel younger while doing it, rather than trying to fool the clock (or the eye!). I'm not anti-aging, I'm all for aging. I'm just hell-bent on doing it the best way I know how. After all, time passes way too quickly and if we don't jump on the bandwagon soon, we're gonna be left standing with nowhere to go. May 2015 usher in a steady supply of health, joy and heartwarming times spent with loved ones.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/state-of-denial_b_6391140","12/31/2014","dori hartley","Happy New Year! Is It 2016 Yet?","Another year means only one thing to me -- I have to somehow get used to typing a 5 instead of a 4 when I write the year down. That's basically all of it in a nutshell. The real hurdle to bolt over is in remembering that the beginning of the year starts with a 20, and not a 19. As for future resolutions, or takeaway lessons that I received in this past year -- I suppose I have a few, though as I get older my requirements for a happy life tend to be less ambitious and more about what it takes for me to live in peace. I would have to say that the desire to live in peace is probably the barometer by which I measure all that either disturbed or supported me in this past year. The year 2014 really exposed for me the concept of jealousy versus generosity of spirit. Thanks to 2014, I know now that there are people who are completely unselfish in the way they show support for those who are fortunate enough to experience positive moments or situations. Adversely, there are those who are utterly threatened by the good fortune of others. Because jealousy is so hard to admit, rarely does it identify as threatened; in fact, in order for jealousy to fulfill its ultimately ugly destiny, it must be channeled into self-righteousness. Jealousy cannot stand happiness and will hopelessly attempt to rid it by dominating the atmosphere with malicious words and actions. It's a bit of human ugliness that is much like the pungent odor of a trash bin filled with rotting food. The stench of it can permeate even the happiest of events. Jealousy is a dramatic addition to a scenario that is both unnecessary and stingy. Jealousy expressed has but one goal: to syphon the joy out of a situation -- not for the purpose of experiencing the joy itself, but to relish and thrive in the pain caused by it. Jealousy produces a thoroughly joyless waste of time for all parties concerned. To be jealous of another's good fortune is to indulge in the oily residue of negativity. To be the object of someone else's jealousy is to endure the sickness of another's ego as it rampages through all the flimsy excuses it needs in order to fool itself into thinking it's justified. And no amount of, ""They're just jealous,"" can ever be a comfort, though some folks tend to think this is a good way to explain why people are so quick to want to destroy a person's euphoria over some nice moment. Personally, I don't take comfort in knowing someone is neurotic, or suffering from an inferiority complex, or just plain negative in how they deal with me, or the good fortune I've received this year. We're all neurotic to some degree. Watching a person transform their jealousy into hate so that they can deal with their own sense of inadequacy is a drama I've learned has no positive side -- it's exactly the kind of drama I will be happy to walk away from in 2015. Another of the things I won't be entertaining in the coming year is the idea of caring about what goes assumed as opposed to what is known as fact. On a personal level, I have come to a place where what 'you' think of me, what you assume I do or what you fantasize I'm feeling (for you, for the world, for art, for whatever) is irrelevant. We live lives surrounded by people who think they know us because of our status updates on Facebook. I can tell you this: until we've looked each other in the eye and had a moment of warm recognition that silently affirms, ""Oh my god, I can totally be friends with you!"" -- You don't know me, and I don't know you. Assume one thing only about me: I will walk away from anything and anyone if it takes away from my peaceful life. How it gets to that place -- the how's, why's and who's -- is the drama I avoid trying to decipher. This year also brought with it more worldly hate, violence and intolerance -- in fact, it was more than I could take, so I found a personal solution. If I am to not be affected by the inordinate amounts of poison that makes up so much of the news today, I have found that the number one way to combat everything that brings me down is by ignoring it. Yes, I practice the bliss of ignorance when it comes to world events. Am I aware of what's going on in this world? Yes. Do I wish to remain aware? No. And as the days turn into months, without the evening news and the perpetual reminders of war, hate crimes, sexual inequality, hate, hate and more hate in my life -- I find that without knowledge of every single heinous event that happens, I'm happier, stronger and generally filled with peace and creativity. So, how do I fight for peace of mind? I ignore war. And how do I deal with those who can't handle my willful ignorance, my need for detachment and my conscious choice to say no to a world of problems I want nothing to do with? I ignore them, too. Imagine a life without having to worry about health insurance, or being poor, or school shootings, or having a secure job, or being attacked, or being sick -- imagine that? That is how I live. I have chosen to live in a complete state of denial, and guess what? It works. As long as I don't make all the thousand things that can destroy me piece by piece into my religion, I can live the rest of my life in peace. It's a conscious decision, one that can be stated succinctly as: ""It's not that you don't exist, it's that you don't exist in my headspace."" I have a purpose -- to create art and move along. It's very simple. I'm lucky -- I actually know my purpose. Knowing what I'm 'here' for makes me cut to the chase much more easily. I follow what I love and I allow myself to become completely absorbed in what I love. This brings me happiness. As for the rest, it's all noise to me. To accept one's lot in life may not sound like a glamorous conquest, but in my world, I'm the only one calling the shots, so what I decide to feel with my emotions and what I decide to put my heart into should only ever be up to me. This is how I live. So, here's to 2015, or 2016, or whatever you want to call it. Cheers to the best in you.

You're worn out, beaten down and just plain tuckered out. The way to get back to fightin' form, is to begin to see yourself as empowered and capable.Plus, Rocky is hot ... and fun.So queue the music ( ... getting stronger....GETTING STRONGER....)Okay, love, for the next few minutes, I'm Burgess Meredith, and YOU? You, are the Italian Stallion. My job is help you train for the match. I'm gonna follow you around with a towel and a spit bucket and give you all my best tips. So, put your gloves on, drop down and give me five, and let's kick some mid-life crisis ass!1. Look for the Punch -- Keep Your Eyes Open. When the hard stuff is coming at you, it's tempting to tuck and run. Sometimes it makes sense to do this. But there is a difference between being strategic and being myopic.You need to look your opponent (adversity) in the eye. If you don't, that sucker is going to hunt you down and eat you for breakfast.So, the next time you are tempted to avoid, deny or, minimize when you are sad, mad, worried or afraid, turn around and look your pain dead in the eyes.Grab your suffering by its ears, bring it in close and kiss that bad boy right on the lips. (I realize Rocky didn't do a lot of kissing in the ring, but you get my drift.)Keep your eyes open about what is happening in your life. Become a merciless truth-teller (remember Ronna Detrick's advice about that?). Quit pretending. Stop saying ""it's okay"" if it's not. Stop excusing the chronic abusers in your life.Destructive people and situations will suck you dry. If they do, it's because you allowed it.2. Keep Moving -- and Modify Your Game Plan A common mistake when you're dealt a setback is to spend too much time in the misery. While it's certainly understandable to take a moment to catch your breath and regroup, you can't heal if you stay there too long.Get up and start moving forward, even if you just take one teeny tiny baby step at a time.Also, combine this tactic with our first strategy: keeping your eyes open.As you get back up off the mat, modify your game plan accordingly. This means that we if we have a situation or relationship that continually dogs us, we take ourselves out of harm's way.Stop giving energy to people, places and things that hurt you. Learn to set ground rules (boundaries) and say ""no"" to those things. That way, you'll have more space to say ""yes"" to the things that rock.3. When You're Backed into a Corner, Create an Opening.It's one thing to take one hit, but what if your life situation feels like an ongoing beating? This is a common experience at midlife because many of our relationships are naturally in transition at this time.The kids are growing up and moving on, we may be taking care of older relatives, we may be nearing retirement, etc.In addition to the micro-changes to our personal lives, we are each dealing with global changes as well. We have external pressures brought on by the economy, global unrest, etc.If you're feeling overwhelmed and blue, you gotta admit -- it makes sense!It's very difficult to deal with setbacks when they come in rapid succession like this. The way out of chronic suffering is to learn to create openings.One way to create an opening when you're taking a beating, is to answer this question: What about this situation is good?Find that thing, and capitalize on it.*****For example, say you are dealing with a health crisis. What can be good about that?Well, is your illness giving you permission to slow down and take care of yourself at last?Many people have been dealing with financial problems these last few years. Well, what can possibly be ""good"" about that?Perhaps your economic setback is giving you the opportunity to get ""right sized"" with life. Can you learn the important skill of matching your obligations with your resources? Maybe you are going to truly learn that you can be happy - truly happy - with less than you thought.Other common gifts that people overlook are these:Hardships teach us simplicity. They point us to our strengths and also to the places where we need to ask for healing.Hardships and setbacks illuminate our true circle of friends. When the dust settles around you, it is clear who is still standing by your side.These resources - the simplicity, clarity, and friendships - are going to be the firm bedrock upon which you build the next phase of your life.If you're wise, you will learn how to harness the tremendous transformational power of loss and suffering. If you do, adversity becomes the cornerstone of a your Mid-Life Temple -- your Legacy.What about you, love?

Nelson Moses Lassiter was excited about coming to terms with his sexuality. He imagined that, upon venturing out into the gay scene, he'd encounter a world more accepting than the one he was used to. What he discovered was not unlike the one he came from, though. He recalls what happened after hitting it off with a guy at a bar: I was like, ""Oh, would you want to grab a drink sometime?"" And he's like, ""You're really, really sweet, you're really nice, but I don't date black guys."" And he's just like, ""Well, you know, they're just not my type."" And I'm like, ""Well, what does that mean? You just don't like me because I'm black? That's weird."" It wasn't long after that experience that Nelson encountered more racism, this time from a black friend: He was actually rather upset at the fact that I was dating a white guy. We were hanging out, and I was telling him about this guy, and he was just like, ""Why are you dating white people? You know that they don't like us."" And I was like, ""What do you mean 'They don't like us'? Because I'm dating someone who likes me a lot. So what are you getting at?"" And he goes, ""What?

Faithful Catholics had the chance to see Pope Francis at his Wednesday general audiences, liturgical celebrations, Sunday Angelus prayers, and at special audiences. And they came in droves. The popular pontiff drew about 5.9 million people to the Vatican in 2014 -- slightly less than the 6.6 million he drew in his inaugural year, but still far ahead of predecessor Pope Benedict XVI. In 2011, Benedict attracted a total of 2.5 million, Crux reports. Francis beat those numbers with just his Angelus addresses, which attracted about 3 million. Easter was prime time for the pope, with more than 200,000 crowding into St. Peter’s Square for his Wednesday general audiences in April. In total, 1.2 million attended this year’s general audiences. Saint John Paul II drew 1.6 million in 1979 and 1.5 million in 2000. The statistics were calculated by adding up the number of invitations distributed and attendance requests received by the Prefecture for the Pontifical Household, according to News.Va. The Vatican doesn’t make adjustments for repeat visitors, so there may be some double counting. The numbers also don’t include audiences present at Francis’ trips outside of the Vatican -- like his visits to Israel, Turkey, and South Korea. The next four years will change America forever.

That's not a loss. That's a win. Natalie Cole, daughter of the late Nat King Cole (above), died Dec. 31 after suffering congestive heart failure. She was 65 and despite the cushion provided by her father's success, she didn't have an easy life. She was just nine days past her 15th birthday when her father died of lung cancer in 1965. She had a difficult relationship with her mother in her late teenage years. She was married and divorced three times and her autobiography recounts long struggles with addiction to drugs that included heroin and crack cocaine. In the midst of all that she also accomplished one of the toughest feats in the music biz for the child of a star. She not only became famous -- which isn't that hard when you have the name -- but she became respected, winning Grammys and selling tens of millions of records in popular, jazz and R&B styles. Singing almost from the time she could speak, she made her recording debut at the age of 6, a voice on Nat King Cole's iconic Christmas album. But she didn't plunge into show business. At the University of Massachusetts, where she graduated in 1972, she majored in child psychology and minored in German. When she did launch her professional career, she resisted everyone who suggested the easy door would be her father's style. ""I always loved his music,"" she said in a 1991 interview. ""But if I had started with that, I might never have been allowed to make my own music, the rhythm and blues or the pop. I would have been stigmatized as someone who does only this kind of music."" Recording in her father's style, she explained was really the easy path not for her, but for the music industry, which would have an instant marketing hook. ""Let's face it,"" she said. ""The music business is not a school of thought. It's not about quality or integrity. It's about making money. People's careers are compromised all the time to sell records."" Only her father's old label, Capitol, was willing to take a flyer on young Natalie, and it paid off. Recording in a style reminiscent more of Aretha Franklin, she scored top-10 R&B hits in the mid-1970s with her first eight singles. Five went to No. 1: ""This Will Be,"" ""Inseparable,"" ""Sophisticated Lady,"" ""I've Got Love On My Mind"" and ""Our Love."" She didn't hold that peak, as life intervened, but she kept singing and a decade later she was back in the top five with songs in a more pop style, including a famous seductive remake of Bruce Springsteen's ""Pink Cadillac."" Only after that did she take a deep breath and tackle her father's music and style. That led to the 1991 ""Unforgettable"" album, whose title track had her new vocal woven into a duet with her father's old one. ""Unforgettable"" became a radio hit that went way beyond radio, generating massive buzz and snagging her a Grammy for record of the year. Oh yeah, she also won album of the year. She was comfortable with the project, she said upon its release, because she felt she had now done enough other material so it wouldn't pigeonhole her. ""Someone who only has one of my albums only sees a small part of what I do,"" she said. ""If you just hear 'Pink Cadillac,' that's not the whole picture."" She also made a point of noting that she didn't simply go to the studio and put her voice on her father's songs. ""My father's music was very different from mine,"" she said. ""His arrangements were very tough and masculine, and since I was obviously singing with a female voice, that made the music a little lighter right away. ""Also, his approach to songs was much more straightforward. So I sing very differently than I sing my own material. The great long wailing notes, for instance -- they're out."" She said she also tried to walk the line between her father's original arrangements and styles that appealed to 1991 ears. ""Some had to be made more contemporary,"" she said, ""because they were so clearly dated. But we tried to do it subtly, like by adding more harmonics. On 'Nature Boy,' we put in a muted trumpet that gave it a Miles Davis kind of vibe. I loved that."" Natalie Cole would return to her father's kind of music several more times in a career that continued pretty much until the end. She also kept recording in other styles, becoming one of a handful of artists to win Grammys in pop, jazz and R&B categories.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lessons-from----surprise----burma_b_8903296","1/1/2016","rena pederson","Lessons From -- Surprise -- Burma","Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi As the holiday lull ends and American presidential campaigns ramp up, it's a good time to look at the example of a leader in another part of the world: Burma. Why Burma? Burma (renamed Myanmar by military rulers), is where Aung San Suu Kyi is preparing for her party to assume leadership in Parliament in March. Her National League for Democracy swept an astonishing 78 percent of the seats in fall elections. One can only imagine the joy, relief and exhaustion the Nobel laureate must have felt, having led the struggle against military rule since 1989. She spent 15 of those years under house arrest.It's instructive to note some of the first things the democracy leader did after the election victory: First, she spent time meditating. She took time to calm her thoughts and restore her energy after months of expending herself on the campaign trail. Leaders who are pulled a hundred different directions by advisers, supplicants and commentators need time to think deeply and ""fill the well."" They seldom get the time. They should insist on it. Secondly, when Suu Kyi resumed public events, she led a national cleanup day. The 70-year-old put on a pair of plastic gloves and urged everyone to join her in picking up plastic bags and rubbish. Don't just stand there, she chided photographers, come help. The symbolism was Gandhi-esque. Our problems are many, Suu Kyi implied, everyone must pitch in to rebuild their broken country. She's right. She's the public face of reform, but she can't do it alone. Third, Suu Kyi extended a hand to the military leaders she had just unseated. She sought out current President Thein Sein, a former general who had been part of the military junta that kept her locked up. They discussed a smooth transition. She also met with the Commander in Chief of the Army, Min Aung Hlaing, because the army still controls key cabinet positions and 25 percent of the Parliament. They discussed cooperation. She even met with former Senior General Than Shwe, who had presided over the ruin of the country for two decades and amassed a vast personal fortune. It was Than Shwe who used the military to destroy ethic villages. It was Than Shwe who callously denied aid to cyclone victims and ordered attacks on unarmed monks. The aging and ailing general no doubt wanted to test if Suu Kyi would seek vengeance on him and his family. Apparently not. Instead, she has invited the military to help rebuild the country. She carefully studied the reconciliation process in places like South Africa and Czechoslovakia during her years of house arrest. She understands that violence and recrimination usually beget more violence. With power now within her grasp, she has pledged to be merciful to the people who were not. Fourth, she met with ethnic leaders and assured them they would have a voice in the government. The offer of a seat at the table was a message that needed to be heard. Much still needs to be done to resolve the bloody ethnic conflicts that have gone on for more than 60 years. But inclusiveness signals respect. It opens to door to dialogue. And dialogue opens the way to change. The process is sure to be messy. But the alternative is worse. Yes, there continue to be complaints about what Suu Kyi has or has not done. There are concerns she doesn't have enough bench strength to run the country, that her inner circle's too small, her temperament difficult. It's still uncertain whether constitutional barriers can be overcome so Suu Kyi can serve as President herself someday. But she is already demonstrating leadership in direct and indirect ways that are worth noting: •Take time to take stock and seek wisdom. •Rally more people to help solve problems. •Build bridges with your rivals, as Abraham Lincoln did. •Open the tent wider to people of differing backgrounds. Those goals are easier to say than do. Burma is no exception. But saying them is certainly a welcome contrast to an American election year dominated by negative personal attacks and catering to special interests. They are also a needed example for parts of the world where democracy and rule of law are in jeopardy. How many developing countries around the world can be named where power has been handed over peacefully by authoritarian governments -- and where the presumptive leader has called for forgiveness, inclusiveness and rule of law? That's precisely why Burma remains one of the rare success stories of 2015 and its transition deserves continued attention in 2016. Rena Pederson, a former speechwriter at the U.S. Department of State, is the author of ""The Burma Spring."""

If it was a statement made by a democratic figure, it would be treated as a gaffe or bad joke in poor taste. But for the authoritarian Erdogan, it's a rare instance of his honesty, showing how the strongman really feels. Business Insider reported on the links Erdogan made between his vision of the new Turkish government that he is pushing for, and Hitler's regime. ""Asked on his return from a visit to Saudi Arabia late on Thursday whether an executive presidential system was possible while maintaining the unitary structure of the state, he said: ""There are already examples in the world. You can see it when you look at Hitler's Germany. There are later examples in various other countries,"" he told reporters, according to a recording broadcast by the Dogan news agency."" According to Reuters, Erdogan's government insisted that it's remarks were misconstrued, after domestic and international condemnation. ""'If the system is abused it may lead to bad management resulting in disasters as in Hitler's Germany ... The important thing is to pursue fair management that serves the nation,' [Erdogan's] statement said, adding it was unacceptable to suggest Erdogan was casting Hitler's Germany in a positive light."" Of course, in Erdogan's Hitleresque state, it would be a crime to suggest that Erdogan admired Hitler. Ironically, you could even be marched off to prison, for suggesting that Erdogan is authoritarian. In fact, Erdogan's government has arrested many people, including journalists and law enforcement officials of uncovering evidence of corruption or accusing him of authoritarian actions. He even targeted people living in the USA who are critical of him. Erdogan's excuse for such actions is that he claims his enemies are ""terrorists."" Turkey's social media, one of the few unregulated sources of news in Erdogan's government, immediately went into high gear, according to the New York Times: ""Let's do a close comparison between Hitler and Erdogan,"" one person wrote on Twitter. ""The only difference is that Hitler was a bit shorter."" People also shared a Photoshopped picture of Hitler with Mr. Erdogan's face superimposed on it. On a visit to Turkey during their June election, I found that the overwhelming majority of people I met really like their democratic system. Many didn't like Erdogan, but were afraid to say anything. Of those who did, half asked me to keep it anonymous, while the other half said they would be arrested anyway, and it didn't matter if I used their names. Here's a picture of an election poster for the ""ceremonial"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan from June of 2015. Despite his party's win in the November election, Erdogan's ruling AKP does not have the votes to give their leader the Hitleresque power that he wants. But he is seeking a referendum to get those powers, which would likely ensure that Erdogan and his family will rule this NATO ally of the USA indefinitely, in a most undemocratic manner. Should the United States break diplomatic relations with Erdogan's regime, help Turkey's civil society, review possible cuts to U.S. military aid to Turkey's government, or consider ""smart sanctions"" against Erdogan and his family? Erdogan's admission of admiration for Hitler demonstrates that doing nothing will not help the problem, any more than it did in the 1930s. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-end-of-the-desistance_b_8903690","1/1/2016","brynn tannehill","The End of the Desistance Myth","Over the past few years, an endless parade of ""concerned"" people (trolls) have trotted out the same statistic over and over again: 84 percent of transgender kids stop being transgender on their own. They have used this to justify everything from reparative therapy, to denying medical care to transgender teens, to suggesting that reparative therapy on adults will work. The problem is that the desistance narrative is built upon bad statistics, bad science, homophobia and transphobia. For starters, the most cited study (Steensma) which alleges a 84 percent desistance rate, did not actually differentiate between children with consistent, persistent and insistent gender dysphoria, kids who socially transitioned, and kids who just acted more masculine or feminine than their birth sex and culture allowed for. In other words, it treated gender non-conformance the same as gender dysphoria. Worse, the study could not locate 45.3 percent of the children for follow up, and made the assumption that all of them were desisters. Indeed, other studies used to support this also suffered from similar methodological flaws. As a result, the 84 percent desistance figure is meaningless, since both the numerator and denominator are unknown, because you have no idea how many of the kids ended up transitioning (numerator), and no idea how many of them were actually gender dysphoric to begin with (denominator). When Dr. Steensma went back in 2013 and looked at the intensity of dysphoria these children felt as a factor in persistence, it turned out that it was actually a very good predictor of which children would transition. In other words, the children who actually met the clinical guidelines for gender dysphoria as children generally ended up as transgender adults. Further research has shown that children who meet the clinical guidelines for gender dysphoria are as consistent in their gender identity as the general population. For the past decade, the biggest promoter of the desistance myth was Dr. Kenneth Zucker at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto. He never missed an opportunity to speak to anti-LGBT organizations and news outlets, or to tout himself as the world's top expert in transgender children. He denied practicing reparative therapy, despite a 2003 report in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry which called his techniques ""something disturbingly close to reparative therapy for homosexuals."" Twenty years ago, though, Zucker was also pushing hard for reparative therapy of potentially gay children who were too effeminate, in order to prevent them from growing up to be gay. In 1990, Zucker wrote: Two short term goals have been discussed in the literature: the reduction or elimination of social ostracism and conflict, and the alleviation of underlying or associated psychopathology. Longer term goals have focused on the prevention of transsexualism and/or homosexuality. He felt that this was for the best, because, ""a homosexual lifestyle in a basically unaccepting culture simply creates unnecessary social difficulties."" In other words, force children to change, rather than working to change a homophobic culture. Along the way, Dr. Zucker became the darling of hate groups and their media outlets, such as Focus on the Family, NARTH, CourageC, Alliance Defending Freedom, Life Site News, American Family Association, Liberty Counsel, Family Research Council, Americans for Truth About Homosexuality (AFTAH), and Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays (PFOX). In effect, because of his position, Dr. Kenneth Zucker was the last ""respectable"" patron of reparative therapy. He took the model for ""fixing"" gay kids, slapped a new label on it, and sold it as a way to fix gender non-conforming children. When the transgender activists tried to bring attention to these abuses, Dr. Zucker attempted to silence them with threats of lawsuits. That is, until December 2015, when an independent investigation led to Dr. Zucker's firing and his clinic being closed. The investigation results were highly damning, finding: • The methods being used were 30 years out of date • The clinic assumed that all gender variant children need to be clinically ""fixed"" (i.e. they used coercive behavior modification on queer kids to make them act straight) • Children were pressured into being photographed without clothing • The clinic emphasized tests, treatment, methods with no scientific basis in evidence based medicine • CAMH staff asked pre-pubescent children questions that were highly sexual in nature • Former patients, parents, and therapists of former patients described the treatment as ""disturbing"" and ""harmful"" • CAMH hid affirming community and medical resources from patients • Dr. Zucker regarded being cisgender, heterosexual, and gender conforming as the ""best"" outcome • Dr. Zucker and his team could not conclusively demonstrate that what they were doing was not reparative therapy In a 2014 German study, 13 experts in treatment for gender identity were asked if CAMH's methods were ethical. 11 said no. The two who said yes were Dr. Zucker and another CAMH staffer. But, the most outrageous piece of information coming out of CAMH was Dr. Zucker's claims that gender dysphoria desisted in 80 percent of cases. However, when investigators reviewed the files of children admitted to CAHM, 42 percent of them never met the clinical criteria for juvenile gender dysphoria in the first place. In short, half of the kids Dr. Zucker claimed to ""cure"" were never transgender in the first place. He built his reputation convincing homophobic and transphobic parents that he could fix their kids. When someone actually got around to listening to the transgender community and pulled back the curtain, they found that the 80 percent desistance narrative was a fabrication of an attention seeking, creepy, reparative therapy promoting, snake-oil salesman. Despite this, anti-transgender concern trolls came out in force defending Dr. Zucker. They couldn't actually refute any of the findings of the investigation, so instead they played the concern troll card and falsely claimed that non-transgender children will be coerced into medically transitioning if therapists allow children to explore their gender expression and identity. This is a complete misrepresentation of what affirming therapy actually is. Dr. Colt Keo-Meier, the lead author of Division 44 (LGBT issues) of the American Psychological Association's guidance for treating transgender children, refutes this fear-mongering claim: The gender affirmative model supports identity exploration and development without an a priori goal of any particular gender identity or expression. Practitioners of the gender affirmative model do not push children in any direction, rather, they listen to children and, with the help of parents, translate what the child is communicating about their gender identity and expression. They work toward improving gender health, where a child is able to live in the gender that feels most authentic to the child and can express gender without fear of rejection. Dr. Keo-Meier is supported by a wave of new research showing that affirming therapy does not result in the parade of horribles alleged by the concern trolls. Gender variant youth know who they are just as much as the general population. Transgender youth who are receive affirming care have better health outcomes. Transgender youth on puberty delaying medication showed no health effects, and mental health outcomes as good as their cisgender peers. The desistance myth was promoted by reparative therapists, concern trolls and charlatans, while being no better than a percentage pulled out of a hat to begin with. It's time for the 80 percent desistance figure to be relegated to the same junk science bin as the utterly discredited link between vaccines and autism.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/love-after-death_b_8507836","1/1/2016","debra campbell","Love After Death","Strangely, I still felt loved. My former partner stopped breathing, holding my hand; just as intimately as in life. For the previous two years we'd faced everything together. I could still feel his presence long after he died and it frustrated me, gutted me and buoyed me in equal measure. I felt the love but I couldn't get to it. I wrote this in the depths of grief; dark waters you've got to cross, to get to a better shore. On the morning he died, I watched his final breaths, saw them replaced by a palpable peace, where seconds before there had been only bone-agony. He wanted his life so passionately, until it was reduced to a wordless, twilight fever of hurt. Pain, chemo and hormones had laid waste to the life of his choosing. Now, after months of unrelenting suffering he was free; and I was freed from one gut-wrenching kind of helplessness only to be plummeted into a new one. The release from aching anticipation was obliterated by storm surges of grief that came in waves: Brace. Hit. Out of control. Ride. Drowning. Surface, gasping. You don't know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice. I wondered everyday if there was a way to get to him, to see him again, one more time, to feel him physically again? Was it possible? How could I get there?  The bereavement counsellor tried to comfort me with a story: Swimming in the water the dragonfly larvae dream of the air above the water because they can't see it or understand it from their world. The only way to see is to die as a 'swimmer' and become a 'flyer' instead, but once you become a 'flyer' you can't enter the water ever again. There are different realms but we can only experience each in turn, in the natural time. You can't leave the water 'til it's time and you can't return to visit once you're gone, but you're still out there, just changed. It was beautiful, but it was no help at all. Is that him, in that crowd? My brain would suddenly interject as I walked down the street. He's dead I would tell myself. But I'd look anyway. After a few weeks of grieving I'm so tired of my head, riding the roller-coaster of loss again and again. I crash, then come up to refocus my attention on living again; read a book with my son, do some coloring, punch the bag at the gym, work out dinner... get through the days on a micro-level, nerve by nerve. I can do this, I would tell myself...I can do this. But everything is a reminder, on a raw sensory level. Sometimes I give up and crumple onto the kitchen floor, back against the hard, cold silver oven where every night I had cooked our food, before I was broken. I go to our regular Sunday morning café. I know its going to hurt but I can't keep away from it any longer. I like the place and I want to invite the memory, call in the ghosts so I can commune, see what happens. The waitress greets me and I say ""Just me"". I want to ask her You remember him don't you, you know the man I was here with every week, you remember, right? He's gone, he's died. What can we do? Hey, by the way, how can the chairs still be there unchanged, when he's dead? That window there... it might have been there a hundred years, but where is he? You remember him don't you? Tell me you remember him! But I say none of that. I sit, order the same food and cry quietly to the table, watching my tears hit the newspaper until they stop and I begin to read between them. *** For months I wandered, I wrote, I punched the bag, I grief-journalled, I focused on my other loves. I asked the universe for guidance and help because I didn't know what else to do. Just keep holding on to myself and my loved ones, I would tell myself; Keep holding on until this moment is memory.I knew that feelings ebbed and flowed. I knew that no matter how bad I felt, if I gave grief my awareness and acknowledged it fully, it couldn't stay exactly the same forever. Nothing ever does. If you have grief, fasten yourself to your supports. Tie yourself to love wherever it still lives for you, then sink deep. Know somehow you will rise. Let love pull you up until you can swim freely again. Understand that death happens too easily to be the end. This post is part of Common Grief, a Healthy Living editorial initiative. Grief is an inevitable part of life, but that doesn't make navigating it any easier. The deep sorrow that accompanies the death of a loved one, the end of a marriage or even moving far away from home, is real. But while grief is universal, we all grieve differently. So we started Common Grief to help learn from each other. Let's talk about living with loss. If you have a story you'd like to share, email us at strongertogether@huffingtonpost.com.

Perhaps my distaste for such terms can be traced back to elementary school, where the teacher would write the word ""objective"" on the blackboard in giant letters. Then, we had to talk about why we were doing what we were going to do that day. Why didn't we just do the activity and then talk about it? I wondered. It seemed like such a waste of time. I feel the same way when it comes to setting a goal weight. All too often I hear clients say, ""I need to lose 20 pounds by my wedding"" or ""I'd better knock off 50 pounds before my high school reunion."" But focusing on a weight goal without appreciating every step of the process can leave you with a goal that's attainable but not sustainable. It's the ups and downs during the process itself that teaches you how to get to a place where you feel proud of your achievement. This enlightening journey often gets short shrift – especially when you set an unrealistic weight goal or an unreasonable time frame to achieve it. When work toward a goal (say, to lose a few pounds), you may start off feeling motivated, optimistic and prepared for any obstacles that may get in the way.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kids-with-allergies-are-more-likely-to-have-anxiety-and-depression_l_6110c88be4b0ed63e6574be6","1/1/2016","kathryn doyle","Kids With Allergies Are More Likely To Have Anxiety And Depression","By Kathryn Doyle (Reuters Health) - Kids who have allergies at an early age are more likely than others to also have problems with anxiety and depression, according to a new study. As the number of allergies increase, so do internalizing behavior scores, the researchers found. Internalizing behaviors include disorders, like anxiety or depression, that develop when people keep their problems to themselves, or ""internalize"" them. “I think the surprising finding for us was that allergic rhinitis has the strongest association with abnormal anxiety/depression/internalizing scores compared to other allergic diseases,” said lead author Dr. Maya K. Nanda of the division of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology, at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. Rhinitis includes the “hay fever” symptoms of runny nose, sneezing and itchy, watery eyes. The researchers studied 546 children who had skin tests and exams at age one, two, three, four and seven and whose parents completed behavioral assessments at age seven. They looked for signs of sneezing and itchy eyes, wheezing or skin inflammation related to allergies. Parents answered 160 questions about their child’s behaviors and emotions, including how often they seemed worried, nervous, fearful, or sad. Kids who had allergic sneezing and itchy or watery eyes or persistent wheezing at age four tended to have higher depressive or anxiety scores than others at age seven, the researchers reported in Pediatrics. Anxiety and depression scores increased as the number of allergies increased. “This study can't prove causation. It only describes a significant association between these disorders, however we have hypotheses on why these diseases are associated,” Nanda told Reuters Health by email. Children with allergic diseases may be at increased risk for abnormal internalizing scores due to an underlying biological mechanism, or because they modify their behavior in response to the allergies, she said. Like other chronic diseases, allergic diseases may trigger maladaptive behaviors or emotions, she said, but some prior studies support a biologic mechanism that involves allergy antibodies triggering production of other substances that affect parts of the brain that control emotions. Earlier studies have found links between allergies and anxiety disorders such as panic attacks or generalized anxiety disorders, Nanda said.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kids-with-allergies-are-more-likely-to-have-anxiety-and-depression_n_5684039be4b0b958f65aec88","1/1/2016","kathryn doyle","Kids With Allergies Are More Likely To Have Anxiety And Depression","By Kathryn Doyle (Reuters Health) - Kids who have allergies at an early age are more likely than others to also have problems with anxiety and depression, according to a new study. As the number of allergies increase, so do internalizing behavior scores, the researchers found. Internalizing behaviors include disorders, like anxiety or depression, that develop when people keep their problems to themselves, or ""internalize"" them. “I think the surprising finding for us was that allergic rhinitis has the strongest association with abnormal anxiety/depression/internalizing scores compared to other allergic diseases,” said lead author Dr. Maya K. Nanda of the division of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology, at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. Rhinitis includes the “hay fever” symptoms of runny nose, sneezing and itchy, watery eyes. The researchers studied 546 children who had skin tests and exams at age one, two, three, four and seven and whose parents completed behavioral assessments at age seven. They looked for signs of sneezing and itchy eyes, wheezing or skin inflammation related to allergies. Parents answered 160 questions about their child’s behaviors and emotions, including how often they seemed worried, nervous, fearful, or sad. Kids who had allergic sneezing and itchy or watery eyes or persistent wheezing at age four tended to have higher depressive or anxiety scores than others at age seven, the researchers reported in Pediatrics. Anxiety and depression scores increased as the number of allergies increased. “This study can't prove causation. It only describes a significant association between these disorders, however we have hypotheses on why these diseases are associated,” Nanda told Reuters Health by email. Children with allergic diseases may be at increased risk for abnormal internalizing scores due to an underlying biological mechanism, or because they modify their behavior in response to the allergies, she said. Like other chronic diseases, allergic diseases may trigger maladaptive behaviors or emotions, she said, but some prior studies support a biologic mechanism that involves allergy antibodies triggering production of other substances that affect parts of the brain that control emotions. Earlier studies have found links between allergies and anxiety disorders such as panic attacks or generalized anxiety disorders, Nanda said. The new study took race, gender and other factors into account, “so the strong association between allergic disease and internalizing disorder we found is definitely present,” she said. The severity of mental health symptoms varied in this study. Some children had anxiety and depression that needs treatment, while others were at risk and required monitoring, she said. “We think this study calls for better screening by pediatricians, allergists, and parents of children with allergic disease,” she said. “Too often in my clinic I see allergic children with clinical anxiety (or) depressive symptoms; however, they are receiving no care for these conditions.” “We don't know how treatment for allergic diseases may effect or change the risk for internalizing disorders and we hope to study this in the future,” Nanda said.

So find a noise-free room, clear a space near your bed and turn down your thermostat, because better sleep leads to better health. Here are tips to reduce noise, help you unwind and make your bedroom a serene oasis for sleep. Having a super-cluttered bedroom may affect how well you sleep, suggests a recent study led by clinical psychologist Pamela Thacher. While the research, presented at the 2015 SLEEP conference held in Seattle in June, focused on people who consider themselves hoarders, the findings may apply to anyone who sleeps in cramped, chaotic surroundings. ""It seemed like even people without hoarding disorder had what we call a dose response – meaning that the more clutter you had, the more likely you were to have a sleep disorder,"" says Thacher, an associate professor of psychology at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. Because the bedroom is a private space, it's easier to let disorder grow. Bedrooms are often the biggest problem for hoarders, Thacher says, although living rooms and kitchens can hold ""wicked"" clutter as well. It's not ideal for anyone to sleep where they don't even have a clear path to the bedroom door. For people with hoarding and sleep issues in the study, sleepwalking was unexpectedly low on the list of nighttime problems. The reason is functional, Thacher believes: ""It's because their bedroom is very difficult to walk in. My guess is they are literally pinned into the bedroom in the way that most of us are not."" When Thacher treated insomnia patients in her practice, she'd encourage good sleep hygiene. That means ""taking care of the context and circumstances in which you sleep,"" she explains. Getting to bed at a reasonable hour, developing bedtime routines that don't include electronics and doing calm, peaceful things like writing in a journal instead of watching a scary or violent movie on TV are all ways to safeguard your sleep. ""A cool bedroom but also a clean bedroom might set your mind at rest,"" Thacher says. ""This might be something we could add to sleep hygiene."" She's conducting a new study, this time with non-hoarders – looking at whether people still have sleep problems after they declutter their homes. Light clothing, no blankets and a thermostat set at 66 degrees combine to create a cool, healthy sleep atmosphere. Mild cold prompts your body to make more ""good"" brown fat by transforming stored white fat and sugars into energy to keep you warm, says Dr. Francesco Celi, who led a 2014 National Institutes of Health study on the effects of overnight room temperatures. This nighttime activity boost, known as ""non-shivering thermogenesis,"" helps rid the body of excess blood glucose, says Celi, a clinical endocrinologist who is now chairman of the endocrinology and metabolism division at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. Cranking up your bedroom thermostat and sporting flannel pajamas has just the opposite effect. ""Prolonged exposures to warm temperature at 80 degrees resulted in an almost complete inhibition of brown [fat] tissue activity"" in study participants, Celi says. Small, persistent changes in the temperature of your environment make a difference, Celi says: ""The effects are very small in terms of body weight, but can be potentially important with respect of the glucose metabolism."" It's possible, his results suggest, that cooler sleep could have health implications for people at risk for diabetes. Reading a boring book to put yourself to sleep may backfire with an e-reader, according to a small studyappearing last January in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Participants who read an electronic book with a light-emitting device before bed took longer to fall asleep, produced less of the sleep-hormone melatonin and were less alert the next morning than those who read a printed book. It's not rocket science that noise hampers sleep – or that traffic sounds can keep you awake. Dr. Mathias Basner, an associate professor of sleep and chronobiology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, took a look at the effects of living near airport, rail and road traffic – alone or combined. ""It can be very disruptive,"" he says. A simple fix can ease rail or roadside noise. ""If you have the option to move your bedroom to the side of the house that is not exposed to traffic, that can be very effective,"" Basner says. ""If your window's facing the backyard, your noise levels may be much, much lower in rooms that are not facing the roadway."" That's less helpful if you live near an airport, like Philadelphia International Airport, the site of the study. Earplugs help some people more than others, Basner says. People who don't tolerate earplugs may get too distracted from internal noise, such as the sound of their heart beating or stomach growling. ""Usually [earplugs] are very good for blocking out the higher frequencies in the sound spectrum,"" he says. But they're not as effective for blocking low-frequency, rumbling noise, like the kind you get near a railway. Basner is concerned about health effects of unwanted noise that go beyond your hearing – like the way noxious noise increases the release of stress hormones in the body. And there's the impact on sleep. ""What I always find puzzling, in terms of sleep hygiene, is that we really spend a third of our lives in bed,"" Basner says. ""We are willing to spend a lot for a house or car … but not for our mattress."" Sleep may seem passive, but it's actually an active process, Basner says. ""A lot of things are happening. Memory is consolidated. Specific hormones are created exclusively during the night. We know that if you're not getting enough sleep on a chronic basis, there are all these negative health consequences that are linked to the sleep loss,"" he says. ""So getting enough and good-quality sleep is extremely important."" To Sleep Better, Stay Cool And Cut Clutter was originally published on U.S. News & World Report.

How It Works A Shelter. This 3-year-old dog came into Montgomery County Animal Shelter as a stray today. A Rescue. Lone Star Boxer Rescue was contacted by the shelter and they agreed to take him into their program immediately. A Volunteer. He was transported to their vet for further tests. There is a tumor on the inside of his cranial cavity under the bone. A Foster. It is inoperable and his life expectancy is 2 days. He is now in hospice care. A Decision-maker. I asked Leisha Stinchcombe, the director of the rescue group, ""Why did they pull this dog from the shelter today?"" Her response was, ""Just to make sure he knows love for a few days."" A Donation. Groups like this can only exist and do this badass work with our financial help. This dog is 1 of 3 terminally ill boxers that Lone Star took into their program today. Leisha commented: Adalard is his name. The day may not be easy but we are fierce with determination. This entire network of helpers in the world, who are far greater than me. I am deeply saddened yet humbled by the beauty I see in the unity of many teams. We alone, do not create this, and we cannot always repair. But we LOVE just as fiercely as we fight. Know that. For certain. Adalard. Noble strength. Wednesday (12/30/15)  What It Looks Like A Family. Lori Anderson, her husband James, and their daughters Bella and Ellie. It should be noted that Leisha initially declined Lori's offer for hospice foster care based on the fact she has small children and this was going to get ugly quickly. Lori insisted that Addy come to their home. Lori said: I thought a lot about Bella and Ellie and how it will effect them. I think it's extremely important that the girls learn about giving, loving and helping others in need, especially when they can't care for themselves.  ""The girls (5 and 7 years old) were with me when I picked him up from the vet. I told them about how special Addy is and how we are going to take care of him because he's very sick.""   ""I wasn't sure what to expect from this poor boy and was preparing myself for a very lethargic and slow moving pup. Well, to my utter surprise, in walks Adalard, nub wagging, bounce in his step, and ready to receive and give love.""  ""I spent some time talking to Dr. Gordon about Addy's condition, medications and how to help him the most. 'Spoil him rotten' was his advice.""  ""On our way to the store to load up on toys and treats, Ellie turns around to look at Addy who's in the back and says to me: ""Mom, he's smiling, look he's smiling at me!""  ""Adalard aka ""Addy"" has already made himself at home.""  ""He is amazing, sweet, gentle, kind, well socialized with fur friends and humans. LOVES his toys."" Ellie, 5, is featured here playing with Addy. She has Asperger's Syndrome (higher end of Autism spectrum) and a particularly special connection with animals.   ""It is evident that at some point he was part of a human family. We are so fortunate to be able to be part of his life. He may not have long, but his life will be full for as long as he does have.""   ""We want his life to have meaning.""   ""Yes, there will be sadness and tears, but it's important they learn that this is okay."" Let's see how far LOVE takes him.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-3-most-crucial-lesson_b_8895252","1/1/2016","jo davidson","The 3 Most Crucial Lessons I Learned in 2015 as an Online Coach","Building an online business is easy. I just wish someone had told me that sooner... These last 12 months have proved to be a magnificent period of change, flex, and eventually growth, in my coaching business. But, before I tell you about those 3 most crucial lessons I've learned, I'd like to share a little bit of background with you. It's only two short years since I decided to pursue entrepreneurship and build a coaching business, although in reality it feels like ten times as long. Of course, I'd been coaching for years in my management career, but going it alone is a completely different ballgame.  Since launching my business, I invested heavily, to the tune of more than £12,000 and thousands of hours, learning what it takes to build a successful, international business in the online world. I learned from many of the most respected and successful entrepreneurial minds out there. And yet, I didn't build a successful business. In fact, I barely even made a dent, as I watched my £40k/year management salary and savings dwindle away to next to nothing. And, it wasn't because I wasn't applying my knowledge; because I was. And, it wasn't because I didn't know enough; because I did. And, it wasn't even because building a successful career as an online coach is difficult; because, surprisingly, it really isn't. But there was a problem. A big fat problem. That problem led me to end up more than £35,000 in debt and unable to pay my mortgage and credit card bills for months on end. As a single mother with no outside financial support and no more credit available, it put me in very real danger of losing our home. It had me desperately panicking about how I would even put food on the table, let alone pay for school uniforms, outings and other unexpected expenses. It even brought me to the verge of folding my business and going back to a ""proper job"". So, what was that problem? Fear! It seems silly really. You always hear people say that successful people feel the fear and do it anyway. And I was sure that was what I was doing. I was completely convinced of it, in fact. After all, I had pushed out of my comfort zone tonnes of times, and conquered so many of the things I used to be afraid of. But, at a much deeper level, I was still hanging onto fear, without even realising it, because I was confusing my fear with being realistic. I was refusing to set massively ambitious goals, and get really focused and committed in my business, because I believed I simply wasn't capable of create that level of success. I was refusing to charge my worth, because I believed people wouldn't see my value and that they wouldn't be able to afford me anyway. I was refusing to get really visible and consistent with my message, because I was believed that no one was listening, that I was wasting my time, and that I was setting myself up for more disappointment. And so on. But, once I finally realised what was going on, and got really fricking serious about my success, that's when I began to learn these incredibly valuable lessons.  Lesson #1: Fear will kill your business dreamsI honestly believed that if I knew all of the online technical wizadry, and built my mailing list, and produced great content, and effectively used social media, then clients would simply find their way to me. But that simply isn't the way that it works, and constantly trying to learn more and more ""stuff"" from others, was actually just the manifestation of my fear of taking responsibility for my own success. For far too long, all that learning kept me from the important, value-adding activities that would ultimately transform my business. Because, it doesn't matter how much you know, if you are not applying it loudly and proudly in your business, every single day. If you're targeting less than £5k a month in your business, then don't be surprised about never making it to five or six figures. If you're afraid of talking money, or of charging your worth, then don't be surprised when every prospect you speak to thinks you're too expensive. If you're afraid to invest in yourself, and your success, then don't be surprised when clients find themselves afraid to invest in their success, with you. And, if you find yourself procrastinating (fear), struggling to create and innovate (fear), and afraid of getting out there online, on camera, on Periscope, on stage, and so on, then don't be surprised when you can't drive enough new people to your business, to seriously up-level and push your business into the major league. Lesson #2: Failure is not the worst possible outcomeI remember thinking that failing was the worst case scenario of launching my own business. I remember worrying about what people would think if I didn't succeed. My family. My friends. My enemies. The neighbours. Even strangers.  But, it was this year that I really came to appreciate that none of those things mattered. That actually, the only really important opinion, was my opinion of myself. And that, for me, the worst possible outcome would be to give up on my business and return to the rat-race hell that I had escaped from. In the end, the fear of having to go back to that was far more terrifying than people laughing at me for screwing up, and that's when I learned to own my story, and to admit the mistakes and near catastrophes in my journey, so that I could use it to help other women struggling along their own entrepreneurial path, to realise that they are not alone, and that they can make it work if only they are prepared to push past their own fears. Lesson #3: It is possible to create miraclesI should say from the get-go that I don't believe in the law of attraction. Nor am I of any religious faith. Although, if you do, then that's great and I'm genuinely happy for you. What I'm saying though, is that I use the term ""miracles"" loosely. In that, I now believe that it is entirely possible to take yourself from struggling to make anything at all, to earning 5 figures in just a month. And that seems pretty miraculous to me. You see, for me, I resisted believing in my ability to create what I didn't already have, for so long, that I wound up screwing up my ability to create what I wanted.  Because, beliefs inform choices. And choices guide actions. And I knew it. I knew it so well. But I didn't see what I was doing, and I'm willing to bet that, very often, you don't see it either. In other words, if you don't believe you can create massive success, on an absolute gut level, then you never will. Because you won't take the right actions, you won't invest in your success, and you will chase bright shiny objects instead of developing yourself as an entrepreneur. Even if, by some fluke, you do manage to luck your way into success, you will quickly sabotage it as your same old beliefs inform your choices, your choices guide your actions, and your actions destroy the progress you've made. So, what am I saying exactly? Well, by finally getting a grip of the fearful crap that was going around my head, and cultivating a mindset of mind-blowing success, I was finally able to stop struggling, get the support I needed, and explode my business results. And, if you're ready to make your success a non-negotiable priority, then I'm going to help you to do exactly the same. 2016 is my ""Year of Living Fearlessly"", and that starts with my Exclusive Group Coaching Programme for Women Entrepreneurs: ""From Struggling-2-Sensational"".

Whether you believe in miracles, have faith in the power of coincidence or simply agree that life is just a series of open doors for us to explore, the story of WOVEN  and the film makers is one that will inspire you to believe in the power of dreams. I personally met Salome Mulugeta and Nagwa Ibrahim the two female directors and producers by coincidence and since hearing their stories, backgrounds, dreams and passions to bring the story of WOVEN to life, I have been inspired to share it with the world through my eyes. I am not just surprised by their dedication to this movie and its story but also what the movie WOVEN stands for. It's exactly what I believe in and more! In the following listing, I will humbly share why I think the story of the filmmakers is incredible and why I can't wait to watch WOVEN.1.The film makers are WOMEN. In a time where Hollywood's Women Problem is at its peak, these two brave women assumed the roles of both the directors and producers of the independent feature film Woven. They are both very proud to see key roles filled by women in an industry where women are underrepresented. They are both empowered women leaders. In fact, they will soon be featured at the @sheisaleader campaign that features aspiring women from the Middle East and the North Africa region for their work and leadership. 2.They are committed to Diversity. In my recent Tedx talk in Munich, Germany, I was inviting people across the globe to celebrate, embrace and appreciate the diversity of our global world. Salome and Nagwa are already ahead of the game! Woven, a film driven by women, celebrates diversity with a cast and crew of all different backgrounds from around the world. The film's story takes the viewer through the journey of seven individuals from seemingly different backgrounds, whose paths converge after a tragic accident in NYC, depicting just how connected we are. In addition, Woven has a diverse crew including Ethiopians, Egyptians, Indians, Dominican Republicans, Iranians, Mexicans, Chinese, Jamaicans, African Americans and Caucasians. Way to go! 3.They believe in the power of dreams. Woven's story has been twelve years in the making. It started with a dream and an idea. Salome Mulugeta who originally studied broadcasting and journalism in Kansas city was an intern reporter at the local TV station which quickly turned permanent. She later moved to Los Angeles with an idea in mind to write a screenplay. Reporting encouraged her growing passion for a new medium, was drawn to the vibrant cinematic culture and found the challenge exhilarating. While in Los Angeles she met Ryan Spahn an actor and a screenplay writer. The two began to write ""Woven."" The movie and the two underwent through many challenges as any new filmmaker would have to face. Then over three years ago, Salome and Nagwa randomly met at a dinner party both initially were not going to attend but fate made both of them show up, connect and together bring Woven to fruition. And despite the many challenges along the way from script to screen, as experienced by most independent filmmakers, Salome and Nagwa refused to give up. According to my friend Amandeep Kaur the blogger of Simple Ways to Love Life Blogspot ""It took determination, tenacity, the amazingly diverse, collaborative effort of a team of people who worked behind the camera, the love and support of friends and family, and a Dream to complete the film."" ""There is no such thing as accident; it is fate misnamed."" ― Napoleon Bonaparte 4.They are multi-talented people. Salome Mulugeta (who originally studied Broadcasting and journalism) is the co/director, co/writer, producer and plays the leading role in the film. Post Woven, she has kept herself busy directing and producing commercials and several independent short stories. Her Ethiopian Airlines commercial went viral not very long after it was released. She also currently contributes content for the US based African channel a TV channel that showcases outstanding travel, lifestyle & cultural series, specials, bio's and documentaries into the modern lives of all people of African descent and developing nations who live in the western culture. She has produced and directed shows like The African Restaurant week, Muziki Ni, and is currently directing and hosting a debut show called A Day in the Life Of (2016). Meanwhile, Nagwa Ibrahim is an attorney by training specializing in immigration law and criminal defense, Nagwa additionally worked as a civil and human rights attorney, handling Guantanamo cases and other prisoner rights cases. Through her travels and work as an attorney, she learned about how extraordinary and inspiring the human experience is through the stories of real people, which inspired Nagwa to become a filmmaker where such stories can be heard felt and experienced in one space that transcends borders. Whether as a lawyer or filmmaker, she genuinely loves people and the ways in which we are all intricately connected as human beings. In addition, she is currently co-hosting the Sunday national radio show titled Middle East in Focus on KPFK that discusses news and views on the Middle East and relevant U.S. foreign policy. How I love these empowered women! 5.Collaboration and Labor of Love. . It's a movement in filmmaking to use a collaborative art form to convey the connectedness of humanity as symbolized both in front of the camera and behind the camera. We see Salome Mulugeta (one of the co-directors and co-producers) as one of the lead characters. In addition, (According to the movie makers) Woven definitely could not have happened without all the cast and crew who worked tirelessly to make the film come alive. Furthermore, the team points out that their own individual communities believed in both of them and helped with funds to get the film of the ground.6.With different Backgrounds and Experiences, they came together to tell the universal story of Woven. While all what comes to mind when we hear about Egypt and Ethiopia is the longstanding dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the construction of Ethiopia's Renaissance Dam along the Nile River or when we hear Coptic-Christian and Muslim is the possible tension that some media outlets try to sell to the world. Both Nagwa (Egyptian-Muslim) and Salome (Ethiopian-Coptic Orthodox Christian) went beyond these differences. In fact, when I asked them about it, they seemed surprised that I am even bringing it up. They even told me that it is something that they never even thought about. Simply a perfect example of an interfaith and diversity movement in action! 7.They are committed to storytelling. In the digital age we are living in, nothing is more powerful than storytelling. Both Salome and Nagwa are committed to telling diverse stories from around the world through film. Thus, connecting us to one another across borders. 8.Woven Already Has Audiences Awaiting Its Arrival. The interest and public response in WOVEN has been overwhelming. The trailer received more than 27K views in just one day (On EthioTube, the Woven trailer is one of the most watched videos) and the Woven Facebook page has over 6000 followers eagerly waiting for the movie's release. Please continue to follow the movie's Facebook page for more details. ########### ""As female filmmakers and the children of immigrants, Salome being Ethiopian American and Nagwa being Egyptian American, voices and stories like ours are all too often excluded from American cinema, which is why we both became filmmakers and came together to make Woven. With a female led cast and a female led producing and directing team, Woven has been an important passion project which we worked hard to financially, logistically and politically make possible, particularly in an industry where female directors and directors of color are severely underrepresented. Woven is a film intended to capture the visual beauty of Ethiopian culture and traditions, rarely depicted in American cinema while also highlighting the importance of the immigrant experience in the fabric of American culture, which we feel is particularly relevant at a time when xenophobia is on the rise. With a diverse cast and crew from around the world including Ethiopians, Egyptians, Indians, Dominican Republicans, Iranians, Mexicans, Nigerians, Chinese, Jamaicans, African Americans and Caucasians, we wanted to send a powerful message with Woven both in front and behind the camera about the importance of celebrating diversity. Although we had many challenges, we were able to make the dream of Woven into a reality, through the incredible support of our communities here in the U.S. and the community of filmmakers like Hala Lotfy committed to diverse storytelling across borders. With over 6,000 likes on facebook and 1,000,000 views of the Woven trailer on Ethiotube, we are so humbled by the support and excitement for the film's release."" --Salome Mulugeta and Nagwa Ibrahim Please watch a full Interview with the Film makers at the Independent Sources CUNY TV, Channel 75.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-entrepreneurial-gener_b_8893916","1/1/2016","chris herd","The Entrepreneurial Generation, Millennials and Alternative Modes of Earning"," The Post-Industrial EconomyI read an incredibly interesting article yesterday: The Freelancer Generation: Why Startups And Enterprises Need To Pay Attention which set my mind racing towards the trends, developments and possibilities which will shape the new year. Although I don't agree with some of what is written, for the most part it is very insightful towards current employment trends. What i didn't agree with so much is that this is the freelance generation. Instead I believe that the uncertainty relating to global commodity markets married to an eroding belief from millennials that full-time employment brings security has bred very specific circumstances. This has led to a growing number of individuals with a propensity towards backing themselves to make a success utilising their skills in an entrepreneurial way. Simply they see greater reward and greater perks. I would argue then that this is the entrepreneurial generation, freelancer is too simplistic and does not convey the multitude of requisite skills necessary for success. You now need to embrace every facet of the entrepreneurial mindset to succeed; whether that is in the way you market your skills and services or in the way you exploit negligible niche opportunities transforming them into massive chances for success. There are several unarguable facts relating to the direction in which employment is moving. 2015 was unquestionably the year of the startup, whether you look at the number of unicorns blasting through the $1b valuation or the amount of companies birthed, at no time in history has it been easier, more fashionable or accessible to start up a startup or work for someone who is/has. Instead of falling into a long term career millennials are trusting themselves to carve their own paths through the cultivation of a professional network that they can rely on for support and employment. Converse to the linear careers their parents have taken, driven by serendipitous fortune, they are embracing the diversity and opportunity that an entrepreneurial approach to employment can bring and flourishing due to the acquirement of relevant skills and the ascertainment of opportunity they have found but which would never find them. They are the masters of their own destiny. Regardless of whether you're a full-time employee, a contractor or a freelancer it's in your best interest to pay attention to the developments of the entrepreneurial generation. The developments here will have far ranging implication to the general workforce moving forward. Whether multi-nationals embrace the startup approach to employment, by way of increasing productivity on a project to project basis or not, the entrepreneurial approach to employment is here to stay and here is why: An enabler of participationThe opportunity for entrepreneurialism has never been so great due to the rise of technology, enabling a truly global workforce, and connectivity, allowing anyone to be connected to anyone anywhere. Looking at it from an alternative angle the post-industrial economy is also an enabler. It provides cultures, genders and social classes historically discriminated against, forbidden or unable to contribute a route to participation and thereafter progression. Advances in technology have allowed for increased remote work which enables anyone, anywhere to work from everywhere. Not only can you work from home but you can also enjoy increased flexibility leading to a favourable work life balance prevented by a 9 to 5 way of life. The post-industrial economy has not only shrunk the world through connectivity it has brought a whole new workforce to the fore who had never previously been a consideration. The Past -- Post Internet ExplosionsETSY and eBay are an example of two platforms which have birthed a generation of micro-businesses and presided over the unprecedented growth of 'homtrepreneurs'. Mothers who historically had to stay at home were for the first time able to conduct their business during times that suited them. This has provided a disposable income to women, teenagers and men around the world who were able to sell their possessions or products to an almost unlimited market. The explosion of the internet set the ball rolling towards the developments we are currently seeing and what will follow. The Present -- Mobile PlatformsThe next logical step in development from eBay and ETSY is the utilisation of the mobile platform for financial gain, which has begun to flourish post the introduction of the first iPhone. It enables earning without any commitments or requirements. Where the industrial revolution enabled the employment of unprecedented numbers of women and children in production lines mobile platforms enable the exact opposite. They provide a safe and secure opportunity for a huge number of people to pursue the things that interest them and reward them with capital for their participation. For too long mobile platforms have exploited the network of users they have cultivated without giving back, but now we are beginning to see the emergence of companies which redress the balance. You're information, data and general commitment to Facebook values your contribution at around $128 per user but why don't you see a penny? It's obviously a simplistic question to pose which ignores the fact the company has shareholders, staff to pay and new products to develop but ultimately why should your personal life line the pockets of others? The next revolution in mobile, social media and technology will see the emergence of compensation for your compliance and contribution. The Future -- Full Global ParticipationAs we have progressed further into a globally connected world we have seen the permeation of opportunity with ever decreasing discrimination. This has taken some time to proliferate down to poorer nations due to the absence of technological infrastructure but even this is beginning to change as tech giants like google look to connect even the most remote tribes in africa to the internet. What I believe, and what i truly hope, is that the post-industrial economy enables independence on a scale not seen since the abolishment of slavery. There is an unprecedented opportunity to tap into an almost unlimited pool of expertise and I hope that 2016 sees the beginning of a revolution of enablement. Whether this enables a route to employment for the repressed in the Middle East, education to those in the most rural parts of Africa or provides true impartial information to those who's news is censured the post-industrial economies target should be far deeper than lining the pockets of CEO's like the owners of factories in the industrial revolution. 2016 should be complicit in the erosion of boundaries and the establishment of a global force: The Global Entrepreneurial Generation.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/question-for-bernie-donde_b_8903446","1/1/2016","nikolas kozloff","Question for Bernie: ¿Dónde Está Mi Revolución?","Ever since he launched his long-shot bid for the presidency, Bernie Sanders has urged his followers to carry out a veritable ""political revolution."" Bernie has been far too cautious, however, when it comes to defining the contours of such a revolution. When pressed, he declares that his followers should come together for the purpose of voter drives, phone banking and the like. If he were ever elected to the White House, Bernie might even make use of his political revolution to help organize protests in advance of key votes in Washington. But here Bernie seems to be placing the cart before the horse. If the self-described democratic socialist doesn't win the Iowa Caucus, which is the first voting contest, there may not be a political revolution in the first place or a tangible role for Bernie's dedicated cadre of activists. It is baffling, and that is putting it mildly, that Bernie and his advisers have been so obtuse when it comes to crafting a viable media strategy designed to showcase the notion of political revolution front and center. In an earlier article, I sought to spell out some ways that Sanders might expand upon the concept of political revolution and thereby gain some traction in advance of key voting contests. If he were audacious, Bernie could call for mass protest during the actual presidential campaign. Just what type of protest, and to what end? Currently, Sanders is still a virtual unknown to many segments of the electorate including the crucial Latino bloc. Perhaps, Bernie should strike right at the core of Republican xenophobic ideology by calling for protests which highlight injustices within the U.S. immigration system. Deplorable Conditions The need for such pressure is long overdue. Indeed, members of Congress recently protested dire conditions at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers. In one case, a Mexican immigrant died of pneumonia after receiving substandard medical care. In another instance, a Salvadoran immigrant who had been detained for a whopping four years died of intestinal cancer even after he had lodged complaints about his worsening medical condition. In one privately-owned California detention center, hundreds of migrants carried out a hunger strike after being subjected to medical neglect. However, detainees who dare to protest such backward treatment have been subject to repression. Reportedly, Latin American migrants who went on hunger strike against the authorities have been placed in solitary confinement. And when Central American women went on hunger strike at a detention facility in Texas, detainees were rounded up for transfer. The plight of migrants, not all of whom hail strictly from Latin America, has even spurred the growth of a new movement called #FreedomgivingHungerStrikes. Immigration on the Campaign Trail It goes without saying that the debate over appalling conditions within immigration facilities will not receive top-tier billing on the Republican campaign trail, which is more prone to race baiting and xenophobia. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders has issued statements in support of hunger strikers. To his credit, the Vermont Senator has called for the closure of private prisons while opposing solitary confinement and indefinite detentions. Bernie has also said that non-violent immigrant detainees should be allowed to reunite with their families as they await their day in court. Such moves must be applauded, and to be sure Sanders has improved in recent days when it comes to the overall issue of immigration [as I've written previously, however, the Vermont Senator has been a little quirky on the issue of borders and Bernie is reluctant to break with a certain strand of the ossified old guard nationalist labor establishment]. In a frontal assault on the likes of Trump, Sanders remarked that border security could be improved by investing in novel technologies in contrast to ""boondoggle walls"" which would set the stage for further militarization. Rather impressively, he also called for ending contracts with private detention centers and said he would do his utmost to eliminate ethnic profiling and discrimination at the border. Meanwhile, the Vermont Senator declares that if he is elected he will map out a ""swift legislative path"" for 11 million undocumented migrants. What is Bernie Waiting For? Fair enough, though one wonders how many Latinos are even aware of Bernie's policy proscriptions and the Vermont Senator seems very unwilling to craft a viable media strategy. Like it or not, presidential elections tend to revolve around personalities and the media cycle rather than policy, and by boycotting or criticizing the mainstream media Bernie seems to have consigned himself to obscurity within the Latino community. This is particularly jarring and self-defeating in light of the growing power of the Latino electorate in early voting states like Iowa and Nevada. Latinos are looking for a champion and a man of action, yet unfortunately Bernie seems unwilling to deliver. When asked if he'd visit facilities where immigrants have gone on hunger strikes, Sanders said he would try but sounded vague when it came to providing specifics. ""Given my schedule between Congress and the campaign, I can't promise you when and where it would be, but it is something that I am interested in doing,"" he said. What is Bernie waiting for? While it would be a stretch for the presidential candidate to go on a hunger strike himself, there are certainly ways that Bernie could marshal his followers and thereby recast the media narrative in the run-up to Iowa. As I wrote in a previous article, the Sanders campaign has embraced new technologies with a vengeance while recruiting talented young millennial coders. Bernie's own media company is called Revolution Messaging no less, and the firm has helped to build Sanders' presence on such platforms as Reddit. #FreedomgivingHungerStrikes At the flick of one button, Bernie could deploy his followers to support the burgeoning #FreedomgivingHungerStrikes movement. It is not a stretch to imagine millions of volunteers conducting phone banking on behalf of immigration protest and detainees, which might succeed in taking the air away from Trump. Such a campaign strategy would raise the moral bar and might also gain Bernie coveted visibility within the Latino community. To be sure, there's no assurance that such a strategy would be successful or even rouse the media from its perpetual torpor. What is more, in the aftermath of the San Bernardino terrorist attack immigration reform may not be such a popular topic among certain Americans. There's no guarantee, moreover, that calling for protest wouldn't wind up alienating mainstream segments of the electorate. These are all considerations, but as we begin the countdown to Iowa, Sanders may not have much to lose.

If you need some convincing, the cast and creator stopped by AOL.BUILD to give viewers the inside scoop on season two.  After the most intense opening night for the orchestra, season one ended with a playful and flirty stare between Hailey and Rodrigo which left fans wondering if and how their relationship will progress in the second season. ""It progresses in the way that I think that, while Hailey feels just happy to be there in the first season, in this season I think that she really wants to aggressively pursue her passion,"" said Lola Kirke. ""And there's an understanding that going for the person that she feels passionate about might be a major distraction and actually get in the way.""  That's not the only relationship progressing in season two. At the end of season one Bradford, played by executive producer Jason Schwartzman, finally asks Lizzie, Hannah Dunne's character, to dinner. ""At the risk of spoilers, yeah. And I think he's really like a ticket for Lizzie. [She] really kind of finds herself and a little more direction as to what she wants to do, than we've seen her previously,"" Hannah Dunne said. ""In the first season when she is really picking up a lot of different ideas of 'Oh I'll be a tattoo artist, or travel the world. I don't know what I'm gonna do'. With him she really develops.""  Paul Weitz, who co-produces the show with Roman Coppola and Jason Schwartzman, Alex Timbers had this to say about season two, ""We've gotten to know the actors better and that's really exciting. I feel like the female characters this year got stronger and stronger. Also, we're learning about the classical music world, its not like we're these aficionados who are sort of wanting to clue people in on what we know about classical music, we're actually learning about it as we do it.""

Garrie and David N. Lawrence. The Internet has delivered on its promise of social and economic progress. Unfortunately, it has also delivered unprecedented opportunities for scaling global conflict, terrorism, criminal activity, state and industrial espionage and vandalism. These risks continue to expand. Cybersecurity is a multidimensional problem that transcends the risk management and response capabilities of any single enterprise, industry, or sector. No enterprise, industry or sector has an answer or even a claim to superiority regarding cybersecurity threats. There is a simple operational premise that informs expert thinking about our exposure to the risks of cyber-attacks. ""If you can imagine it, they can do it. And even if you can't imagine it, they have -- and are working on it."" The costs of cyber attacks--financial, legal and reputational-- for organizations, businesses, and government agencies are growing at an alarming rate. The consensus annual cost of cyber-attacks to the global economy is around $445 billion. Even the most sophisticated enterprises know that it is not a matter of ""if"" they will be hit, but when and how bad. This means our money, intellectual property, private communications, market sensitive data, and identities remain at constant risk. To paraphrase FBI Director, James Comey: ""There are only 2 kinds of companies left in the world--those that have been hacked and those that don't yet know they've been hacked. No one is safe. Unfortunately, there is no simple fix --no app for that--not even adequate insurance."" The fact of the matter is that the solution to the problem of growing cyber threats is not simply a technology ""patch"". Cybersecurity has never really been a technology question to begin with. Technology and its digital portals are simply the newest conduits for a widening range of individual, group and state-sponsored actors seeking the familiar criminal and geopolitical ends of theft, fraud, espionage, extortion and destruction. Playing only defense against the sources of cyber threats has proven to be an expensive zero-sum game of Whack-a-Mole. In today's highly competitive global economy, it is not realistic to expect companies to stand idly by while their business interests are attacked and their resources are drained. Corporations may legally take defensive protective measures provided they are strictly defensive--and, hence, do not violate existing international or domestic law. These measures may also include remediation tools such as disinformation and so called ""honeypots"" Explain honeypots. It must be reiterated, however, that a corporation has to take great care in conducting cyber operations as the law clearly does not allow a company to initiate cyber hostilities. As most corporate lawyers lack the technical aptitude to properly attribute a cyber incident or to understand the appropriate response, their advice in the face of hostilities should err on the side of caution. Given the legal restraints, the best and default response to cyber hostilities is for a corporation is to contact the government to respond on its behalf. Of course this requires a strong partnership between the government and the private sector. Unfortunately, in the United States this partnership is in its infancy and is complicated by a host of problems including: distrust between the private and public sector, corporate reputational concerns, potential liability caused by a cyber incident, and sensitivity of operating in a global economy. This set of difficulties incentivizes both public and private actors to look only after their own interests, withhold critical information, and make decisions without consultation. As a result, the response to any cyber hostilities typically leaves the victimized corporation damaged, unsatisfied, and frustrated. See, e.g.,  Devlin Barrett & Danny Yadron, Sony, U.S. Agencies Fumbled After Hacking, WALL ST. J., Feb. 23, 2015, at B1. The government is aware of this problem and has taken steps to better coordinate a response to hostile cyber activities, while simultaneously promoting information sharing between the public and private sectors. Already, we have witnessed the beginnings of a potential ""game-change"". Although exact details have yet to be revealed, the U.S. government has signaled a willingness to consider offensive counter-measures against a state or state-sponsored actor (as was the case with Sony), terrorist group, or other threat to industry and infrastructure. On February 25, 2015 the Director of National Intelligence, as ordered by the President, established the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC). See Fact Sheet: Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, whitehouse.gov .(Feb. 25, 2015). The CTIIC, intended to be ""a national intelligence center focused on 'connecting the dots' regarding malicious foreign cyber threats to the nation and cyber incidents affecting U.S. national interests,"" has the mission of assisting ""relevant departments and agencies in their efforts to identify, investigate, and mitigate those threats."" Id. Additionally, on February 13, 2015 the President issued an Executive Order to promote private sector cybersecurity cooperation by authorizing greater intelligence sharing while protecting business confidentiality. See Executive Order--Promoting Private Sector Cybersecurity Information Sharing, Feb. 13, 2015 While these efforts are a significant step in the right direction, there is far more that needs to be done in responding to the ever-growing cyber threat to corporations. Cybercrime remains a ""virtually"" perfect crime and act of war. It is low risk and high reward. It is agile, cheap and remotely scalable. It constantly evolves as technology evolves such that law enforcement officials wind up responding to outdated threats. Victims have little or no recourse. Cybercrime in many ways does not fit within our current legal and law enforcement framework for domestic and international crime. Laws, courts, treaties and international boundaries have little efficacy in limiting cyber tactics, weapons and the targeting of civilians. Easily disguised and launched from safe havens, cybercrime carries little risk of detection, prevention, apprehension or punishment. With so much to gain and so little to lose, why stop? A robust public-private cyber partnership is needed--one that will consider more radical ideas. For example, a corporation that is the victim of a cyber incident must feel comfortable disclosing information with the government. On the other hand, a corporation that shares information with the government may face irreparable damage to their reputation and immense present or future customer claims through their disclosure. Only by creating a confidential reporting mechanism coupled with limiting financial liability will corporations be willing to openly report a cyber incident. One possibility is to adopt a regulatory regime similar to that imposed on financial institutions following the passage of the Patriot Act. Currently, a financial institution must notify the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) of any transactions suggestive of criminal behavior, money laundering, or terrorist financing by filing a suspicious activity report (SAR). See The SAR Activity Review, By the Numbers, 8 FINCEN (June 2007) . To encourage this reporting the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) was instituted to prohibit ""financial institutions from disclosing the contents of a SAR or even its existence."" See 31 U.S.C. §5318(g)(2)(A)(i)). Other banking regulations provide a ""safe harbor"" and ""expand this confidentiality privilege and shield financial institutions from liability for reporting such activity."" 12 C.F.R. §21.11(k) and 31 U.S.C. §5318(g)(3) By shielding SAR reporting activity from ""discovery in civil litigation"" and limiting the financial liability of a corporation that reports suspicious activity, information sharing dramatically increased between financial institutions and regulators. This regulatory model is useful for those interested in increasing public-private information sharing involving cyber incidents as corporations have the same concerns as financial institutions when they file a SAR. Another possibility is to expand the powers of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court (or FISC) to allow companies to petition for a government response to cyber offenses committed against their interests. Presently in the United States the FISC is responsible for issuing warrants for domestic surveillance of suspected foreign operatives in the United States. See Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, , ALLGOV.com. But imagine a scenario whereby an American corporation in the aerospace industry is hacked and all investigations point to the responsible party being an agent of a sovereign nation. While the corporation may be able to recover fiscally through insurance policies, the damage caused by the hack to the company may be of permanent significance. Currently, there are few options for the victimized corporation. But with an expansion of the FISC, the aggrieved corporation would be able to petition a government body for redress. The government body, acting on behalf of the corporation, would make a special appeal for emergency action. If the expanded FISC agreed that action was necessary, the government actor would be permitted to take action against the sovereign nation with impunity. One possible variant of this idea would be to create a stand-alone cyber court to provide judicial oversight of the response rather than adding cyber jurisdiction to the FISC. These two relatively unexplored recommendations are not intended to be a panacea for the corporate cyber problem but rather illuminate the need for creativity in developing a response strategy. It will take unorthodox solutions to remove the disincentives currently inhibiting the public-private partnership. Yet, the importance of enhancing this public-private partnership cannot be overstated and is of utmost importance for both corporations and the national security of the United States. Neither corporations nor the government can afford to remain static as the speed and ferocity of cyber hostilities, in particular those launched by state actors against private companies, are the new normal.  Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta  succinctly summarized both the opportunities and threats created by the increased dependence on cyber operations when he stated in New York City on October 12, 2012 to the Business Executive for National Security: Cyberspace is the new frontier, full of possibilities to advance security and prosperity in the 21st century. And yet, with these possibilities, also come new perils and new dangers. The Internet is open. It's highly accessible, as it should be. But that also presents a new terrain for warfare. It is a battlefield of the future where adversaries can seek to do harm to our country, to our economy, and to our citizens. But the even greater danger -- the greater danger facing us in cyberspace goes beyond crime and it goes beyond harassment. A cyber attack perpetrated by nation states [or] violent extremists groups could be as destructive as the terrorist attack on 9/11. Such a destructive cyber-terrorist attack could virtually paralyze the nation. While the importance of cyberspace is obvious, the sobering truth is that cyber hostilities discussed by Mr. Panetta are now a reality. This could not be more clearly demonstrated than by the actions of North Koreans against Sony or the attack upon the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). It is time to stop reacting to these attacks and instead proactively develop a comprehensive response strategy built upon a corporate-government partnership. David N.

The latest haul for Clinton, 68, brings her 2015 fundraising total to $112 million, and gives her one of the best-funded campaign treasuries in the race for the November 2016 U.S. presidential elections. ""At the beginning of this campaign, Hillary Clinton set a goal of $100 million in primary contributions for 2015 and blew past that goal, raising more than $112 million in primary money for the year,"" her campaign said in a statement. It said she had raised $37 million for the primary campaign, the most for any non-incumbent in a non-election year, and $18 million for the Democratic Party in the fourth quarter. Clinton has prided herself on raising funds from women and donors of small amounts. In the most recent quarter, 94 percent of the money raised was in donations of $100 or less, her campaign said. The most recent filing comes just weeks before the first-in-the-nation ballots will be cast in the Democratic nominating contest, and Clinton's latest grab provides a much-needed cushion of support as she battles for support in key early voter states. Clinton's deep-pocketed repository reflects a heightened confidence in the Democratic front-runner's electability, having spent the summer months dogged by controversy surrounding her use of a private email server during her time as U.S. secretary of state under President Barack Obama. Clinton, who has led the Democratic pack with little interruption since her announcement of candidacy in April, spent the summer months battling accusations of inappropriate use of a personal email server during her time as secretary of state, throwing an unexpected wrench in what was initially seen as a clear path to the nomination. But following a marathon, 11-hour hearing on the national security ramifications of her personal server use, Clinton emerged from the scandal relatively unscathed, and her campaign reported their most lucrative fundraising hour in the hour after the hearing. According to a Reuters/Ipsos survey that ended on Dec. 24, Clinton leads the Democratic pack with 60 percent of possible support in the nominating contest. Sanders received 28 percent support and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley finished third with less than 4 percent possible support. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/agnes-martin_b_8893336","1/1/2016","catherine corman","Agnes Martin","Agnes Martin, This Rain In the monograph Agnes Martin (D.A.P./Tate), the work is described variously as ascetic, immensely fragile, calm, direct, hypnotic, quiet and inward. Martin says her subjects are lightness and formlessness. Her work is so interior it does not invite more concrete description. After abandoning painting for years to drive across the country alone seeking ""silence and solitude,"" Martin moved from New York City to Taos, where she spent the rest of her life creating grids or parallel lines in muted palettes, devoted to what has been called ""the quiet drama of painting continuously for almost three decades."" She often drew her grids by hand, in graphite pencil, imparting a tremolo, her ""autographic trace,"" allowing her humanity to enter geometric forms. These flawed lines may also have been a nod to wabi sabi, the Japanese aesthetic tradition of finding beauty in imperfection, implying the quiet melancholy and ethereal longing accompanying acceptance of the impermanence of the world. In her essay, The Untroubled Mind, she writes: We say this rose is beautifuland when this rose is destroyed then we have lost somethingso that beauty has been lostWhen the rose is destroyed we grievebut really beauty is unattached Martin has been compared to Paul Klee and Kandinsky, but she resisted modern movements. Initially seen as an Abstract Expressionist, she later appeared to be a Minimalist. When asked which group she belonged to, she replied, ""I would like my work to be recognized as being in the classical tradition (Coptic, Egyptian, Greek, Chinese), as representing the Ideal in the mind."" She was inspired by William Blake, whose watercolor illustrations for Pilgrim's Progress she saw at the Frick Collection while living in New York. A gift from her beloved grandfather, Pilgrim's Progress remained meaningful throughout her life. The book may begin to explain her mysterious departure for the desert. One of the last paintings she made in the city was called Trumpet, and may have referred to a section of Pilgrim's Progress called The Man in the Iron Cage. After hearing a trumpet call in a dream, a man wakes shaking with fear. He says, ""I thought that the day of judgement was come, and that I was not ready for it."" Martin's painting, Trumpet, is a grid hand drawn in graphite, covered in soft strokes of luminous paint in a palette ranging from dove grey to pearl white. The grid may refer to the iron cage in which the man is held. Blake painted his version of The Man in the Iron Cage in watercolor, with the grid of the cage partly obscuring the man's body. Bunyan writes that the man in the iron cage is a former professor now jailed by his own despair at succumbing to ""the lusts, pleasures, and profit of this world; in the enjoyment of which I did then promise myself much delight: but now everyone of those things also bite me, and gnaw me like a burning worm."" William Blake, The Man in the Iron Cage Blake's illustration of the iron cage may have inspired Martin's later work, as her delicate paintings are illuminated like watercolors, and his palette in this work, pale blues, pinks and greys, are reflected in Martin's own. The iron cage, or all it represented in Pilgrim's Progress, is what she devoted her life to escaping. Agnes Martin, Untitled Agnes Martin, Untitled Her writings record this pursuit, resembling Blake's collection of metaphysical aphorisms, ""All Religions Are One / The Voice of One Crying the Wilderness"" in which he sought the origins of philosophy and religion. When Martin retreated to the desert, she read deeply in Eastern and Western spiritual traditions, including Calvinism, visionary Christianity, Platonism, Transcendentalism, Zen Buddhism and Taoism, noting significant quotes and impressions. She was especially drawn to Plato's Allegory of the Cave, in which the world is revealed to consist of shadows cast by ideal forms. The highest goal is to turn away from the shadows and see what is real.

Good thing is that they are both the same so they won't be hard to forget - @byingridvasquez Now ... 12.30.15 #SongBlogIV (my song of the day): ""Roses and Violets"" by Alexander Jean If you don't think you've ever heard of Alexander Jean, YOU ARE WRONG. Whether it's through dance, music or TV, the artistry of Alexander Jean, made up of Mark Ballas and BC Jean, has already been introduced to you. | @_AlexanderJean_BC Jean is singer, songwriter who has been around music from an early age. Her grandparents were in television variety shows fron the 50s and her parents did music as a hobby and her mother worked as a talent manager. Having released solo music on her own: BC has proven that she is both a talented vocalist and performer. I'd categorize her somewhere in between Pink and Alanis Morissette. She has the looks of your next Top 40 diva but she has the spunk and vocal capability to be much more than that. That's what makes me excited about this new duo. Just like a comment for the above video says ""no need to waste the voice on boring, sappy pop songs,"" it seems like BC has finally found her sound in Alexander Jean. It's important to note that she can give you music for Top 40 charts, though. Ever heard this song? Yea, she wrote it. Although both Mark and BC have both said that they wouldn't really classify their music as a certain genere (considering they take influence from everything like Gwen Stefani to Bohemian Rapsody), there's something different to their music when they're creating (and performing) it together. That performance was from Dancing With the Stars after show. If you may have not guessed it by now, Mark Ballas is a pro dancer on the show and has won two of its mirror ball trophies. Mark, the son of renowned ballroom dancers Shirley and Corky Ballas, attended Rosemead Preparatory School in London with coworkers (co-dancers?) and siblings Derek and Julianne Hough in their early teen years. While Julianne moved back to the United States before Mark and Dereck, they all were brought together in American when they booked Dancing With the Stars. While he's one of the most recognized and best dancers from Dancing With the Stars (E! Ranked him #2), his passion for the arts was first found in music. As a band member: And solo artist: (Fun fact: ""Get My Name""features fellow DWTS dancer Whitney Carson and was directed by Derek Hough). I think his magic number is two though - a duo. While the name ALEXANDER JEAN has managed to get more attention after a performance of their single on Dancing With the Stars, that quickly vanished. So it leads me to ask, if America's DWTS sweethearts can't get them more recognition, who (or what) can? I invite you to purchase their song (while we wait for their EP) on ITunes and help make their single the ""All of Me"" of 2016. In my book it already is. Now its your turn.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sally-mann-hold-still_b_8892766","1/1/2016","catherine corman","Sally Mann: Hold Still","Sally Mann, Untitled (#49 Woven Branches 2, Frontispiece) Sally Mann opens her memoir, Hold Still (Little, Brown), by invoking the muese. An outdated word, the meuse is a mark left in the ground after a small animal leaves; the grass or dust bears an imprint of its departed body. The meuse is a natural parallel of photography, a trace left in the world by a person-a photographer's subject, or perhaps the photographer herself. The meuse is not the actual animal, but a mirror of presence, and this difference is important to Mann. She writes of her art, ""I needed the truth, or, as a friend once said, 'something close to it.'"" Another distinction important to Mann is that between art made by unexceptional people and that born of unknowable genius. She was moved by the book Art and Fear, which separates 'ordinary art,' made by hard working, everyday people, from that made by masters such as Proust or Mozart. The book says genius is rare, and yet good art continues to be made, as most art is ordinary art. Mann proudly identifies with this ethos, writing, ""Ordinary art is what I am making. I am a regular person doggedly making ordinary art."" She does not effortlessly call upon inspiration to provide her with masterpieces, but works tirelessly, with a devoted passion, detailed in her chronicles of the arduous work required for each image, spontaneous and accidental as it may seem. She shoots variations on a single composition for days with a heavy, time consuming view camera, and prints countless versions of the final image in a darkroom, often using antique developing and printing processes requiring a great deal of patience. Mann is fascinated by the ordinary, and feels that ""part of the artist's job is to make the commonplace singular."" Her photographs focus on the South, where she lives. ""I began looking for what I had to say where I usually find it,"" she writes, ""in what William Carlos Williams called 'the local.'"" After a series of notorious portraits of her children, she turned to the South for inspiration, photographing landscapes, Civil War battlefields, and her own farm in Lexington, Virginia. She feels a kinship with Southern writers like Faulkner, Welty and O'Connor, and with the music of the South: early jazz and the blues. ""We southerners,"" she writes, ""like Proust, have come to believe that the only true perfection is a lost perfection."" The Southern artist she feels closest to is Cy Twombly, who was a neighbor and family friend. Her father collected Twombly's early work, which decorated bookshelves and tabletops in her childhood home. Twombly, too, felt rooted in the South, despite moving to Rome in his late twenties. ""It all came from here. All those columns..."" he said, ""there are many, many things I never would have done if I'd been born somewhere else."" Mann recognizes the influence of Southern culture on Twombly's aesthetic and interests, the ""chivalric code and the lore of doomed military culture,"" whose strains can be seen in her own work: photographs of old battlefields, forests and landscapes that look nearly medieval-almost like settings of Arthurian legend. Mann quotes Shelby Foote echoing this sentiment. ""We were sick from an old malady, he said: incurable romanticism and misplaced chivalry...We were in love with the past."" She finds another lost word, ""hiraeth,"" helps explain her work. A Welsh term, it means ""distance pain,"" a yearning, a lamentation for a lost place. It also entails a near physical attachment to that place. The Southern landscape is where Sally Mann resides, in daily life, aesthetically, in her work, and in a deeper, spiritual sense. It is not just an artistic subject to her, or a metaphor, or a historically resonant locale. She writes, ""the landscape might in fact hold the key to the secrets of the human heart."" Ultimately this hiraeth, this deep longing, the sadness at loss coupled with the knowledge that it is sadness provoked by beauty, is at the root of an artistic legacy to which she feels intimately related. She senses it in Flaubert, who wrote, ""The antithesis of everything is always before my eyes. I have never seen a child without thinking that it would grow old, a cradle without thinking of a grave."" She quotes Beckett's Endgame, in which Hamm, trying to console a friend who has gone mad, points out the window to corn growing and ships arriving, saying, ""All that loveliness!"" But the madman sees it as ruin, and turns from the window. Flaubert and Beckett strike a chord with Mann; she, too, simultaneously sees loveliness and darkness. Reaching back further than Beckett and Flaubert, she calls upon the aesthetics of Edo era Japan, when the phrase mono no aware was used to describe the intertwining of beauty and melancholy, one depending on the other, neither able to exist alone. Literally translated, mono no aware means ""a sensitivity to ephemera."" This closely describes Mann's work. Like the meuse, each image derives from an impression that implies the absence of its subject, the beauty of the photograph suggesting sorrow at the loss of the moment it portrays. The children in her pictures are no longer children, their vulnerable, unbridled bodies now changed into self-aware adults.

Her captivating Civil War battlefields, with their lonely trees, delicate as lace on dim horizons, and gracefully curved dusty roads, are graveyards of men who gave their lives defending slavery. She presents them to us like mesmerizing jewels somehow both stunning and terrible to behold. ""For me,"" she writes, ""living is the same thing as dying, and loving is the same thing as losing, and this does not make me a madwoman; I believe it can make me better at living, and better at loving, and, just possibly, better at seeing.""

We figure they need a little help in deciding which darlings should make the shortlist when nominations are announced on Jan. 14. With studios' campaigns entering the homestretch, The Huffington Post's movie gurus, Matthew Jacobs and Joe Satran, have some suggestions to help the Academy make the tough choices. In an Oscar derby as open-ended as this one, anything could happen. Here are two perspectives on what should. Joe: ""Bridge of Spies""""Goodnight Mommy""""Ex Machina""""The Hateful Eight""""Joy""""Mad Max: Fury Road""""The Martian""""Room""""Spotlight""""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" You wouldn't want to be the protagonist of many of these movies. Most of them suffered tremendously. (And I didn't even include ""The Revenant,"" perhaps the most brutal of them all!) But the skillful filmmaking that went into them -- and it really was very skillful -- transformed their misery into my delight. Matt: ""The Big Short""""Brooklyn""""Carol""""Inside Out""""Mad Max: Fury Road""""The Martian""""Room""""Spotlight""""Tangerine"" It's hard to know where to stop when this category can include anywhere from five to 10 titles. My list of nine just barely misses ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" but I won't be mad if the Academy is as taken with BB-8 as the rest of the galaxy. Joe: Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Todd Haynes, ""Carol""George Miller, ""Mad Max: Fury Road""David O. Russell, ""Joy""Ridley Scott, ""The Martian"" I didn't like ""Carol"" quite as much as everyone else did -- I found it frosty, even, at times, inert -- but I have to admit that it was one of most beautiful, well-acted movies of the year. Still, I hope the award goes to Miller. Matt: Lenny Abrahamson, ""Room""Sean Baker, ""Tangerine""Todd Haynes, ""Carol""George Miller, ""Mad Max: Fury Road""Ridley Scott, ""The Martian"" It's hard to weigh the subtlety of ""Carol"" against the grandeur of, say, ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" but each of these five directors gave us the same thing: intimate character studies wrapped in flashy but effortless cinema. As much as I'd love to include a woman on this list (Marielle Heller would be my first pick, for ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""), it's Hollywood's fault that the pickings were so slim. See our full coverage of the Best Director race. Joe: Cate Blanchett, ""Carol""Brie Larson, ""Room""Jennifer Lawrence, ""Joy""Daisy Ridley, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""Charlize Theron, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" I'm obsessed, in this category, with Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron and Daisy Ridley: They brought a strength and ferocity to their roles that made them into true icons. But Lawrence and Theron have both won before and Ridley hasn't even been in the conversation. Brie Larson, meanwhile, was amazing, so I have no issue with her as the frontrunner. Matt: Cate Blanchett, ""Truth""Brie Larson, ""Room""Saoirse Ronan, ""Brooklyn""Charlotte Rampling, ""45 Years""Lily Tomlin, ""Grandma"" ""Carol"" will be rightfully seen as the defining Cate Blanchett film of 2015, but I thought she submitted stronger work in the unfairly maligned ""Truth."" (She was also great in ""Cinderella,"" by the way.) Still, this is Brie Larson's prize, and the rest of us are just Imperator Furiosa rounding up a bushel of ladies who defined the year in film. Others include Teyonah Paris (""Chi-Raq""), Bel Powley (""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""), Melissa McCarthy (""Spy"") and, of course, Charlize Theron (""Mad Max: Fury Road""). See our full coverage of the Best Actress race. Joe: Matt Damon, ""The Martian""Paul Dano, ""Love & Mercy""Leonardo DiCaprio, ""The Revenant""Tom Hanks, ""Bridge of Spies""Samuel L. Jackson, ""The Hateful Eight"" I'm not wild about any of these performances -- except Paul Dano's. His take on the young Brian Wilson was so uncanny that watching the 1960s parts of ""Love and Mercy"" felt like time travel. He's being campaigned as a supporting actor, while his co-star John Cusack is in contention for lead, but I think that's a mistake. I hope the Academy agrees. Matt: Christopher Abbott, ""James White""Matt Damon, ""The Martian""Paul Dano, ""Love & Mercy""Andrew Garfield, ""99 Homes""Michael B. Jordan, ""Creed"" Imagine a calendar where male leads couldn't hold a candle to the year's female stars. That was 2015. Most of the A-list Oscar players -- Leonardo DiCaprio (""The Revenant""), Johnny Depp (""Black Mass""), Eddie Redmayne (""The Danish Girl""), Will Smith (""Concussion"") -- turned in work that felt removed and performative. I'll echo Joe by saying that Paul Dano, in one of the year's best screen achievements, should be the lead contender to beat. See our full coverage of the Best Actor race. Joe: Joan Allen, ""Room""Jennifer Jason Leigh, ""The Hateful Eight""Rooney Mara, ""Carol""Kristen Stewart, ""Clouds of Sils Maria""Alicia Vikander, ""Ex Machina"" I guess it's a foregone conclusion that Vogue cover girl Alicia Vikander will be nominated for ""The Danish Girl,"" but I still prefer her in ""Ex Machina."" She captured the uncanny and seductive power of artificial intelligence as well as any actor ever has. Matt: Jennifer Jason Leigh, ""The Hateful Eight""Rooney Mara, ""Carol""Cynthia Nixon, ""James White""Kristen Stewart, ""Clouds of Sils Maria""Kristen Wiig, ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" This category is loaded, and it's a shame to omit Alicia Vikander (""The Danish Girl""), Elizabeth Banks (""Love & Mercy""), Tessa Thompson (""Creed""), Mya Taylor (""Tangerine"") and a host of others. But the supporting-actress hardware begins and ends with Rooney Mara, even if she's arguably a co-lead in ""Carol."" See our full coverage of the Best Supporting Actress race. Joe: Walton Goggins, ""The Hateful Eight""Oscar Isaac, ""Ex Machina""Michael Keaton, ""Spotlight""Mark Rylance, ""Bridge of Spies""Jacob Tremblay, ""Room"" Walton Goggins completely blew me away in ""The Hateful Eight."" There was something unhinged and committed about his performance as a Confederate sympathizer that made him seem alive in a way that few Quentin Tarantino characters do. Matt: Joel Edgerton, ""Black Mass""Idris Elba, ""Beasts of No Nation""Jason Mitchell, ""Straight Outta Compton""Mark Rylance, ""Bridge of Spies""Jason Segel, ""The End of the Tour"" If Johnny Depp and Tom Hanks were forgettable in ""Black Mass"" and ""Bridge of Spies,"" respectively, their supporting counterparts certainly were not. Hats off to Joel Edgerton and Mark Rylance for besting their upperclass screen partners. Really, any of these five men deserve this accolade. See our full coverage of the Best Supporting Actor race. Joe: Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, ""Inside Out""Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, ""Spotlight""David O. Russell, ""Joy""Quentin Tarantino, ""The Hateful Eight"" I think everyone is wrong about ""Joy."" People say that its plot was confused, bizarre and implausible -- but my take is that David O. Russell was intentionally playing with our expectations about how a plot should work. Indeed, I think the whole movie was a brilliant commentary on the art of screenwriting. There's not enough room to explain why here, but I might revisit the topic in an essay soon. Matt: Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch, ""Tangerine""Patrick Brice, ""The Overnight""Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, ""Inside Out""Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, ""Spotlight"" ""Spotlight"" accomplished so much with so few flourishes, but I maintain that ""The Overnight"" is the year's most under-appreciated comedic script. Regardless, this victory belongs to the ""Inside Out"" scribes. Imagine conceptualizing something half as eye-opening and original as that Pixar gem. Joe: J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""Emma Donoghue, ""Room""Drew Goddard, ""The Martian""Nick Hornby, ""Brooklyn""Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, ""The Big Short"" It initially seemed strange to me that ""The Force Awakens"" was competing in this category, but then I saw the genius of it: If you think about it as an adaptation of ""A New Hope,"" it's a near-perfect script. Matt: Drew Goddard, ""The Martian""Marielle Heller, ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""Nick Hornby, ""Brooklyn""Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, ""The Big Short""Phyllis Nagy, ""Carol"" We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oscar-ballots-2016_n_568461cae4b0b958f65b3adc","1/1/2016","matthew jacobs","Listen Up, Academy Members: Here's What The Oscar Nominations Should Look Like","Oscar voting began Wednesday, giving members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences until Jan. 8 to submit their ballots for this year's prizes. We figure they need a little help in deciding which darlings should make the shortlist when nominations are announced on Jan. 14. With studios' campaigns entering the homestretch, The Huffington Post's movie gurus, Matthew Jacobs and Joe Satran, have some suggestions to help the Academy make the tough choices. In an Oscar derby as open-ended as this one, anything could happen. Here are two perspectives on what should. Joe: ""Bridge of Spies""""Goodnight Mommy""""Ex Machina""""The Hateful Eight""""Joy""""Mad Max: Fury Road""""The Martian""""Room""""Spotlight""""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" You wouldn't want to be the protagonist of many of these movies. Most of them suffered tremendously. (And I didn't even include ""The Revenant,"" perhaps the most brutal of them all!) But the skillful filmmaking that went into them -- and it really was very skillful -- transformed their misery into my delight. Matt: ""The Big Short""""Brooklyn""""Carol""""Inside Out""""Mad Max: Fury Road""""The Martian""""Room""""Spotlight""""Tangerine"" It's hard to know where to stop when this category can include anywhere from five to 10 titles. My list of nine just barely misses ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" but I won't be mad if the Academy is as taken with BB-8 as the rest of the galaxy. Joe: Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Todd Haynes, ""Carol""George Miller, ""Mad Max: Fury Road""David O. Russell, ""Joy""Ridley Scott, ""The Martian"" I didn't like ""Carol"" quite as much as everyone else did -- I found it frosty, even, at times, inert -- but I have to admit that it was one of most beautiful, well-acted movies of the year. Still, I hope the award goes to Miller. Matt: Lenny Abrahamson, ""Room""Sean Baker, ""Tangerine""Todd Haynes, ""Carol""George Miller, ""Mad Max: Fury Road""Ridley Scott, ""The Martian"" It's hard to weigh the subtlety of ""Carol"" against the grandeur of, say, ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" but each of these five directors gave us the same thing: intimate character studies wrapped in flashy but effortless cinema. As much as I'd love to include a woman on this list (Marielle Heller would be my first pick, for ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""), it's Hollywood's fault that the pickings were so slim. See our full coverage of the Best Director race. Joe: Cate Blanchett, ""Carol""Brie Larson, ""Room""Jennifer Lawrence, ""Joy""Daisy Ridley, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""Charlize Theron, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" I'm obsessed, in this category, with Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron and Daisy Ridley: They brought a strength and ferocity to their roles that made them into true icons. But Lawrence and Theron have both won before and Ridley hasn't even been in the conversation. Brie Larson, meanwhile, was amazing, so I have no issue with her as the frontrunner. Matt: Cate Blanchett, ""Truth""Brie Larson, ""Room""Saoirse Ronan, ""Brooklyn""Charlotte Rampling, ""45 Years""Lily Tomlin, ""Grandma"" ""Carol"" will be rightfully seen as the defining Cate Blanchett film of 2015, but I thought she submitted stronger work in the unfairly maligned ""Truth."" (She was also great in ""Cinderella,"" by the way.) Still, this is Brie Larson's prize, and the rest of us are just Imperator Furiosa rounding up a bushel of ladies who defined the year in film. Others include Teyonah Paris (""Chi-Raq""), Bel Powley (""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""), Melissa McCarthy (""Spy"") and, of course, Charlize Theron (""Mad Max: Fury Road""). See our full coverage of the Best Actress race. Joe: Matt Damon, ""The Martian""Paul Dano, ""Love & Mercy""Leonardo DiCaprio, ""The Revenant""Tom Hanks, ""Bridge of Spies""Samuel L. Jackson, ""The Hateful Eight"" I'm not wild about any of these performances -- except Paul Dano's. His take on the young Brian Wilson was so uncanny that watching the 1960s parts of ""Love and Mercy"" felt like time travel. He's being campaigned as a supporting actor, while his co-star John Cusack is in contention for lead, but I think that's a mistake. I hope the Academy agrees. Matt: Christopher Abbott, ""James White""Matt Damon, ""The Martian""Paul Dano, ""Love & Mercy""Andrew Garfield, ""99 Homes""Michael B. Jordan, ""Creed"" Imagine a calendar where male leads couldn't hold a candle to the year's female stars. That was 2015. Most of the A-list Oscar players -- Leonardo DiCaprio (""The Revenant""), Johnny Depp (""Black Mass""), Eddie Redmayne (""The Danish Girl""), Will Smith (""Concussion"") -- turned in work that felt removed and performative. I'll echo Joe by saying that Paul Dano, in one of the year's best screen achievements, should be the lead contender to beat. See our full coverage of the Best Actor race. Joe: Joan Allen, ""Room""Jennifer Jason Leigh, ""The Hateful Eight""Rooney Mara, ""Carol""Kristen Stewart, ""Clouds of Sils Maria""Alicia Vikander, ""Ex Machina"" I guess it's a foregone conclusion that Vogue cover girl Alicia Vikander will be nominated for ""The Danish Girl,"" but I still prefer her in ""Ex Machina."" She captured the uncanny and seductive power of artificial intelligence as well as any actor ever has. Matt: Jennifer Jason Leigh, ""The Hateful Eight""Rooney Mara, ""Carol""Cynthia Nixon, ""James White""Kristen Stewart, ""Clouds of Sils Maria""Kristen Wiig, ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl"" This category is loaded, and it's a shame to omit Alicia Vikander (""The Danish Girl""), Elizabeth Banks (""Love & Mercy""), Tessa Thompson (""Creed""), Mya Taylor (""Tangerine"") and a host of others. But the supporting-actress hardware begins and ends with Rooney Mara, even if she's arguably a co-lead in ""Carol."" See our full coverage of the Best Supporting Actress race. Joe: Walton Goggins, ""The Hateful Eight""Oscar Isaac, ""Ex Machina""Michael Keaton, ""Spotlight""Mark Rylance, ""Bridge of Spies""Jacob Tremblay, ""Room"" Walton Goggins completely blew me away in ""The Hateful Eight."" There was something unhinged and committed about his performance as a Confederate sympathizer that made him seem alive in a way that few Quentin Tarantino characters do. Matt: Joel Edgerton, ""Black Mass""Idris Elba, ""Beasts of No Nation""Jason Mitchell, ""Straight Outta Compton""Mark Rylance, ""Bridge of Spies""Jason Segel, ""The End of the Tour"" If Johnny Depp and Tom Hanks were forgettable in ""Black Mass"" and ""Bridge of Spies,"" respectively, their supporting counterparts certainly were not. Hats off to Joel Edgerton and Mark Rylance for besting their upperclass screen partners. Really, any of these five men deserve this accolade. See our full coverage of the Best Supporting Actor race. Joe: Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, ""Inside Out""Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, ""Spotlight""David O. Russell, ""Joy""Quentin Tarantino, ""The Hateful Eight"" I think everyone is wrong about ""Joy."" People say that its plot was confused, bizarre and implausible -- but my take is that David O. Russell was intentionally playing with our expectations about how a plot should work. Indeed, I think the whole movie was a brilliant commentary on the art of screenwriting. There's not enough room to explain why here, but I might revisit the topic in an essay soon. Matt: Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch, ""Tangerine""Patrick Brice, ""The Overnight""Pete Docter, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley, ""Inside Out""Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina""Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, ""Spotlight"" ""Spotlight"" accomplished so much with so few flourishes, but I maintain that ""The Overnight"" is the year's most under-appreciated comedic script. Regardless, this victory belongs to the ""Inside Out"" scribes. Imagine conceptualizing something half as eye-opening and original as that Pixar gem. Joe: J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""Emma Donoghue, ""Room""Drew Goddard, ""The Martian""Nick Hornby, ""Brooklyn""Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, ""The Big Short"" It initially seemed strange to me that ""The Force Awakens"" was competing in this category, but then I saw the genius of it: If you think about it as an adaptation of ""A New Hope,"" it's a near-perfect script. Matt: Drew Goddard, ""The Martian""Marielle Heller, ""The Diary of a Teenage Girl""Nick Hornby, ""Brooklyn""Adam McKay and Charles Randolph, ""The Big Short""Phyllis Nagy, ""Carol"" We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/keeping-church-and-state_b_8903266","1/1/2016","john w. traphagan","Keeping Church and State Separate","On January 1, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut, who had requested clarification about the meaning of the First Amendment to the Constitution. Jefferson described the Establishment Clause of First Amendment by writing, ""I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibit the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between church and state."" A wall of separation between church and state.  This is a very strong statement, very clear in meaning. First of all, it means that the government cannot make laws that favor one religion over any other, because it cannot make laws related to the establishment of a religion or the free expression of religious beliefs. Therefore, individuals can pray in school, but public schools cannot require people to pray. The government cannot endorse any particular religion -- meaning there can be no copies of the Ten Commandments in front of schools, nor nativity scenes in government buildings, nor Buddha statues in front of government offices. Religious leaders and their followers should relish in this wall of separation, rather than trying to knock it down. Why? Because it is there not only to keep religion out of government, but to keep government out of religion. The wall of separation goes both ways; the Establishment Clause protects not only the government from meddling by religious organizations, but protects religious organizations from interference with the practice of their beliefs by government as long as those beliefs do not require actions, like human sacrifice, that break laws not related to religious practice. Clearly from the perspective of Jefferson, as was the case with many of his peers, the fledgling U.S. was not intended to be a country with any particular religion -- and certainly not a Christian country. The objective was to create an environment in which people were free to believe what they want without the government getting in the way; the best way to do that is to keep church and state apart. Jefferson was committed to this separation because he had little faith in the capacity of a government run or even influenced by religious leaders to protect individual rights and ensure liberty for all. In a letter to Horatio Spafford in March of 1814, Jefferson wrote, ""In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own."" Nothing has changed as far as the truth of Jefferson's sentiments and the need to preserve the wall of separation between church and state as of 2016. Religious symbols, icons and phrases -- not just Christian, but any religion -- should be kept out of government buildings and organized prayer should be kept out of schools. This protects our freedoms, including the freedom of those who believe in ideas presented in documents like the Ten Commandments or the Lotus Sutra. Those on the Christian right who would break down this wall of separation are doing a disservice to themselves, because the loss of the separation between church and state weakens the capacity of the government to protect the rights of anyone to practice their religious beliefs freely. Of course, it is possible that many on the Christian right do not believe in freedom of religion and instead want America to be a Christian nation (by which they mean their particular brand of Christianity) that is intolerant of the beliefs of others, whether Buddhist, Jewish, Unitarian Universalist, atheist or anything else. If that is the case, then they do not support freedom of religion and, thus, do not support the Constitution and the principles upon which the United States was founded. That is their right as citizens of a free country. And the First Amendment, including the Establishment Clause, is the basis upon which that right is protected by the government. Such protection is the primary job of the government in a free society; it is not to support any particular religion. The next four years will change America forever.

Officials in Louisiana are checking levees daily, and Exxon Mobil Corp has decided to shut its 340,571 barrel-per-day refined products terminal in Memphis, Tennessee, as floodwaters threatened to inundate the facility just south of the city's downtown. ""All that water's coming south and we have to be ready for it,"" Louisiana Lieutenant Governor-Elect Billy Nungesser told CNN. ""It's a serious concern. It's early in the season. We usually don't see this until much later."" Workers in southwestern Tennessee were preparing sandbags on Friday in hopes of limiting damage from the Mississippi when it crests at Memphis next week, state emergency management officials said. Officials were also examining levees, to make sure they would hold. ""We're moving things up high and we've got our generators out and got some extra water,"" said Dotty Kirkendoll, a clerk at Riverside Park Marina on McKellar Lake, which feeds off the Mississippi. Flooding in the U.S. Midwest typically occurs in the spring as snowmelt swells rivers. Freezing temperatures that have followed the rare winter flooding have added to regional woes. Very unbelievable, had to share. Most of the deaths in Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas have been caused by people driving into flooded areas after days of downpours. The dead included a central Illinois teenager whose body was recovered on Friday near where a truck in which he was riding was found the day before. Another teen from the truck was still missing. Authorities also continued searching on Friday for country singer Craig Strickland, who had gone duck hunting on an Oklahoma lake during stormy conditions. His friend, Chase Morland, was found dead on Monday. Twelve Illinois counties have been declared disaster areas, and Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday ordered Illinois National Guard troops into flooded areas in the southern part of the state to mitigate flood damage and help with evacuation efforts. The Mississippi is expected to crest at Thebes, in southern Illinois, at 47.5 feet (14 meters) on Sunday, more than 1.5 feet above the 1995 record, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. Flood warnings were also in effect on Friday for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, the Carolinas, Alabama and Kentucky, the NWS said, while major flooding was occurring on the Arkansas River and its tributaries in that state. Dozens have died in U.S. storms, which also brought unusual winter tornadoes and were part of a wild worldwide weather system over the Christmas holiday period that also saw severe flooding in Britain. More than 100,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes in areas bordering Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina after floods due to heavy summer rains caused by El Niño, authorities have said. Global weather dominated conversation on social media over the holiday season after the international climate deal in Paris. Particularly hard hit in the United States in recent days has been Missouri, which has suffered historic flooding. Close to St. Louis on Friday, the Mississippi, the second-longest river in the United States, was falling after reaching near-record heights, the NWS said. The Meramec River, which meanders near St. Louis and empties into the Mississippi, broke height records on Thursday, sending a deluge of water over its banks and forcing the closure of two major highways.

The lawsuit accuses the comedian of portraying the women as liars in the press after they publicly shared allegations that Cosby engaged in sexual misconduct. The suit, which was first filed in December 2014 by Linda Traitz, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese, gained four more plaintiffs -- Louisa Moritz, Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis and Angela Leslie -- in November. Bill Cosby has countersued, arguing the women's allegations hurt his career. The judge, U.S. Magistrate Judge David H.

It is ""at least plausible that Mrs. Cosby is in possession of information"" relevant to the case, the 12-page ruling read. Camille Cosby had argued that conversations between herself and her husband were private. In the past year, more than 50 women have come forward to accuse Bill Cosby of incidents of sexual assault or misconduct. He has steadfastly denied all of them. The judge's ruling came just one day after Cosby turned himself in to authorities on an aggravated indecent assault charge based on the accusations of Andrea Constand -- the first criminal charges against the 78-year-old comedian despite years of hushed accusations. Constand described taking an ""herbal pill"" at the comedian's home that made her feel ""paralyzed"" before Cosby guided her to his couch, where he forcibly placed her hand on his penis and sexually assaulted her in 2004. She had been invited to visit under the pretense of discussing her career. If convicted on the assault charge, Cosby could be sentenced to five to 10 years in prison.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/if-you-like-cards-against_b_8895458","1/1/2016","k.n. granger","If You Like Cards Against Humanity, Check Out These 8 Games"," The phenomenon that is Cards Against Humanity (CAH) seems to have reached a critical point where it's effectively in the mainstream. At least on the east coast, it's a game that many young people have on their shelves, next to the old Hasbro and Milton Bradley staples. The game was first published in May 2011, and has undergone many editions and expansions since; the creators are currently working on a sixth expansion. This game took off like wildfire, and thus this game is no longer confined to indie-loving circles who backed the original Kickstarter. However, maybe you're finding that you and your friends have over-played the game. ""Pretend You're Xyzzy"" makes it too easy to play pick-up games of CAH, leading to burn-out over the game. Also, the year 2014 wasn't a good year for CAH in the media; a trans teen named Jonah publicly burned a transphobic card, causing many who had enjoyed the game to examine it critically - some people removing over a hundred cards from the original decks. Even though the creators of CAH ultimately reject many of the original cards, persuasive articles like ""Why I Quit Playing Cards Against Humanity,""  (2014) and ""The Case Against Cards Against Humanity"" (2014) have accompanied the trend of people falling out of love with the game. One of the most great things about the rise of this game is the way it has revived gaming in person amongst friends (especially those who don't game regularly, and are otherwise stuck with the classics of Monopoly and Scrabble). The hard copies of CAH have become wildly popular among diverse folks of all ages and identities. In short, this game has helped people bond and connect in ways that ordinarily they wouldn't. This is a net positive. Other positives of the game include: the flexibility of integrating new players and letting bored players drop out, the ease of teaching the game, and the dirty elements of the game that create bonding experiences. Still, after playing a couple hundred times, you might be tired of CAH. Maybe you wish you had something to take its place and diversify your board game collection. If you're looking for games functionally similar to CAH, but that have a more inclusive flavor, check out the following games!  1. Slash: Romance Without Boundaries This game merits considerable attention because of its unique flavor. It's an independently published game that had a very successful Kickstarter in 2015. Functionally it's very similar to CAH. However, this is probably the nerdiest game on this list because of the content matter: in this game, you're pairing up potential love-matches between fictional characters, and justifying why you think they go well together. Basically, it's a game where you make fanfiction. It's amazing. So who do you think is a better romantic partner for Elsa from Frozen? Maybe Snow White, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves - Elsa just needs someone to take care of her, and Snow White's name has the word 'snow' in it, so that could work. Or perhaps a better pairing might be Mr. Freeze from Batman - Elsa is pretty much the only person he could ever mate with given his cryogenic suit situation. Final and winning option? Frosty the Snow Man - because once Elsa came out and built a snowman, she fell in love with it. Or something. The goal is to convince the judge to choose your pairing as the best. Given how subjective judges can be, 'playing to the judge' is critical to success in this game, same as in CAH. Watch a video about this game here.  2. Mad Scientist University This game is a delightful romp through silliness, and is kid-friendly (aside from the vaguely ableist name). The premise of the game is simple. Similar to CAH, each player is justifying their card choices to the judge. The judge is the 'instructor' and the other players are the 'students' in a zany science class. The instructor chooses an 'assignment' for the students to fulfill, and each student chooses a card to use as their method of fulfilling their assignment. For example, one of the assignments might be ""Get Something to Eat!"" and the project cards might include ""A Rubber Band,"" ""A Baseball Bat"" and ""Lemonade."" The goal of the game is to come up with as convoluted and silly a plot as possible to fulfill the assignment. For example, you might justify using ""Lemonade"" to ""Get Something to Eat!"" by saying something like this: So I get some lemonade from the cafeteria. Then I go to the lab and I get some zombiefying fluid and add it to the lemonade. Then I go outside and I convince all the students in the courtyard to drink from this pitcher of lemonade. Then all the other students turn into zombies, and I'll corrall them into the Arby's until the Arby's employees are so overwhelmed that they start giving all the zombies free roast beef sandwiches. And since zombies don't eat roast beef sandwiches, the zombies will give them all to me, and I'll have Gotten Something to Eat! BWAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!! Sounds fun, right? The flavor is meant to evoke themes similar to the film, Despicable Me. This game is probably the best game on this list to entertain younger folks, but it's still worth keeping around for adult board game nights.  3. Bad Medicine This is an indie game just published this year! It's designed by Gil Hova, an independent game designer who lives in New Jersey. The game is very similar to CAH in terms of the gameplay, with the goal to satisfy a choosy judge. The flavor reminds one of the television series, Better Off Ted, where big pharmaceutical companies try to cure 'maladies' through developing new drugs, and simultaneously dismissing the side effects of the drugs. A cheeky and sweetly cynical game, the net result is that you build up a portfolio of drugs to treat each malady, and a list of side effects that are 'not that bad.' Check out a description of play direct from the designer here.  4. Dixit This game, published by European company Libellud, involves the same flexibility of CAH, but also is unique in gameplay format. This game's primary merit is that draws upon a completely different area of the brain than CAH, and unlike CAH which is a good game to wind down with, Dixit is a good game to warm up the brain in preparation for a strategy game or other activity requiring active executive function. It requires careful attention to symbols and metaphor, and has a creative element that is absent from CAH. Gameplay involves choosing one card from your hand, just like in CAH, but all the cards are beautiful modernist paintings instead of words. Then you give a clue based on what you see in the picture, and then everyone submits cards based on that clue. You shuffle the cards, and then everyone votes on all the cards (face-up) to try and guess which one is the one that the clue-giver submitted. Successful clues frequently are phrases of poetry or quotes; for example, if a picture is an oil pump, you might clue ""I drink your milkshake"" (the quote being a reference to an iconic scene in the movie There Will Be Blood, which is about treacherous oil deals). Or maybe you have a picture prominently featuring a nose, and you might choose the clue ""A rose by any other name,"" and anyone who remembers that the next line is ""would smell just as sweet"" would probably vote correctly. Point is, you want to choose a clue that's obscure enough that not everyone at the game table will get it, but at least some people will. That's how you earn points and eventually win the game. Watch Wil Wheaton playing this game here.  5. Snake Oil This game is similar in concept to Bad Medicine, but the execution is quite different. This game is published by Out of the Box, and is great for all ages. The goal of this game is to sell silly items based on combinations of random words to the judge, who is playing a particular character. For example, the judge's character might be a surfer, and the cards drawn by person #1 might be ""wonder"" and ""bag,"" and they'd attempt to sell the surfer a bag of wonders, and justify how this is applicable to the surfer's character. Then person #2 might have drawn ""flower"" and ""bonanza,"" and they'd also attempt to sell this item to the surfer. The person who impresses the judge the most wins the round, and then the judge role rotates to the next player. This game sounds basic, but it can result in a lot of fun; it won a MENSA Select Award for 2012. Watch an entertaining example of playing this game here.  6. Love 2 Hate This game best captures the spirit of CAH. It's funny, it's inappropriate, and it's fresh - but it also very specifically avoids the offensive pitfalls of CAH. The game, published by Green Ronin this year, is functionally similar to CAH in that you are trying to please a judge - but unlike CAH, you're trying to complete the judge's sentence. The judge draws a card with words like ""hipsters,"" ""politicians,"" or ""monsters,"" and they decide if they love or hate the identity featured on the card. Then everyone submits phrases that might be applicable to the judge's perspective, ranging from the absurd to the cynical. You can watch how the game is played here.  7. Say Anything This game warrants special attention because of how original it is in terms of gameplay, but how it also manages to really capture the same (or better) level of bonding between players compared to CAH. The game also manages to remain fresh in spite of repeated playings because so much of it is player-generated content, and the players don't remain trapped with a set of limited choices. The game is published by North Star Games, (makers of another good game that didn't make it to this list, Wits and Wagers) and has reportedly earned over 30 awards, including the 2008 BoardGameGeek Best Party Game award. The game is slightly more complicated than CAH, but in a good way. The judge selects a card with a topic question, such as ""What's the best movie of all time?"" or ""What's the worst restaurant of all time?"" Each player writes down privately what they think the judge would answer. Then they all reveal their answers, and the judge privately chooses their favorite answer. All the players vote on what they think the judge has picked. Then the judge reveals their actual answer, and points are given accordingly. Watch Wil Wheaton demonstrate the gameplay of this game here.  8. This listicle was originally supposed to include seven games; this game was so great I had to change the title to make sure I included it. This superbly well-designed game was published in 2010 in Brooklyn, NY, and it therefore predates CAH while also surpassing it in quality and excellence. Designed by Colleen Macklin, John Sharp, and Eric Zimmerman, this game is published independently by an organization dedicated to the purpose, Local No. 12. This game takes conversation and makes it into a game, guiding players into interesting discussions that they might not ordinarily have. Moreover, there are six different ways of playing the game, which means that the deck has a lot more functionality than CAH. Watch an example of gameplay here. They have two expansions out currently, one about films and one about science fiction. Like CAH, you can buy it on Amazon or print and play it for free.  8.5. Apples to Apples Of course, I'd be remiss not to mention that CAH is originally based on the modern classic game, Apples to Apples. Published by Mattel, the game is just like CAH, but it's (almost) completely clean. They have a variety of versions including Sour Apples to Apples, which is a bit more competitive. The base game, which has become a ubiquitous addition to every mom's gaming shelf, was originally developed by Out of the Box, the same people who came up with the aforementioned game, Snake Oil! But Apples to Apples was sold to Mattel, which is how it got distributed so widely. In case you've never played it before, you can watch how the game is played here. Overall, there are tons of alternatives to Cards Against Humanity. Undoubtedly I missed some games that merit attention, so if you want to share, please add to the comments.

But it's important to remember the good moments - and 2015 did have some big ones. Our look back at the most inspiring videos and trends of 2015 documents everyday people showing strength and compassion, like 8-year-old Alex McKelvey performing 600 acts of kindness for strangers, or 86-year-old Ann Dilley continuing to take college classes for 36 years. There was teen mother Trameka Pope, who went from being homeless to becoming her high school valedictorian, and churches around the country who demonstrated the Christian virtue of generosity by giving huge tips to pizza delivery drivers. When it comes to happy tears, nothing beats videos of soldiers coming home to surprise their children - unless it's videos of crowds cheering with joy following the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage across the country. Other inspiring moments came in the wake of grief, like Robin Williams' daughter Zelda writing a powerful Instagram post about depression after her father's suicide, or the French father who comforted his young son after the Paris attacks, saying ""They may have guns, but we have flowers."" More recently, arson victim Safyre Terry received more than 700,000 Christmas cards from strangers around the world after her story went viral on Facebook. Here's to 2016 bringing us even more progress and faith in humanity. Happy New Year!

In a world where digital, physical and human converge, Collins helps their clients solve the puzzles of relevancy to build brands people can't live without. Collins works with notable brands such as Spotify, Target, Coca-Cola, Foursquare, ACE Group and Babyganics with the belief that the only way Collins can help their clients create meaningful experiences for their customers, is if Collins' own creative culture reflects the diversity of the world we live in today. One of few women of color to become President of a top-flight agency, Amber has made it her mission to reimagine what creative culture looks like for the industry - one that is inclusive of talent from all backgrounds. Amber comes from an accomplished career in account management where she's worked closely with clients to build their brands (and their businesses). While she spent the majority of her career in brand-building, including in key roles at Ogilvy & Mather, Saatchi & Saatchi and TBWA\Chiat\ Day. In 2009, Amber turned her focus to digital marketing when she joined agency T3. Amber was Managing Director of its New York office and grew it into a remarkable player, leading clients including Chase, Allstate and Pfizer. While Amber's experience across many industries and channels has honed her gifts in leading big, meaningful experiences for people, it's her daily experience as a wife, mom, daughter, sister and friend that reminds her why it matters. She graduated cum laude from Boston University with a degree in Psychology and Women's Studies. She lives with her husband and two young children in New Jersey. How has your life experience made you the leader you are today?I grew up in two very politically active households (my mother's in New York and my father's in New Jersey). Each had radically different forms of activism (one through education, the other through more tangible acts of protest). I found myself from an early age attending demonstrations and rallies. By the time I was in middle school I was organizing walk-outs and holding political fundraisers (well, an 11 year-olds version of a fundraiser). Being surrounded by people from very different backgrounds working together for an idea they believed in had a profound influence on me. Not to mention, learning at a young age that I had a voice and an ability - if not a responsibility - to affect change was powerful and motivating.As a business leader, these tenets still guide me. We work to build, evolve and create ideas that push our clients' businesses forward and we can't do that unless we have highly skilled, talented and diverse people working together to imagine, innovate and create. As a leader, I have to help create an environment where different people can come together, but feel united by a shared vision. I have to nurture a place where everyone knows they have a voice, and most importantly, has the ability to affect change - whether it be for our clients' brands or to our own internal culture. How has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at Collins?The most beautiful thing we can make for our clients are sales charts that curve up. I've worked for some phenomenal organizations. They've taught me what it really takes to deliver results. Our success lies purely in the people who work with us. And as many great organizations I have been with, I have also been in organizations where the culture was not conducive to collaboration, diversity, or debate. Leaders at these organizations say our industry has a ""talent problem"". But the problem is not with the talent. It's with an archaic, Mad-men-esque culture that doesn't allow the diverse thinkers of today's generation to thrive. And it's those businesses that are struggling, and will continue to struggle, as other more progressive companies learn how to evolve, adapt and create new creative cultures that will allow talent from all different backgrounds to thrive. What have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at Collins?We've made some pretty massive strides in the last 8 months that could have only been made possible by working with a talented group of people. By the end of this year, we will have doubled in size, created a new framework for how we work internally and with our clients, won 10 new clients, opened a thriving San Francisco office and launched an internal ""Culture Club"" that sponsors outside events for our people to stay engaged within the design community. We've also just started to concept a new paid internship program that will identify high school students from economically disadvantaged school districts to spend the summer learning (and playing) with us. Last but not least, we've also worked hard to improve our employee benefits so we can make sure our people are taken care of. As with any company that is undergoing tremendous growth, we have some growing pains. Change, even for the better, is always a challenge to navigate. But we put our people first. If we can do that, the rest will follow. How can companies retain female millennials? Over the last couple of years I've felt a personal and professional mission to answer that very question. A year ago I would have said that we have to stop telling women they are the ones that have to change, and rather look at the culture of our professional organizations and see how they have to change. We need to start by raising awareness on institutional gender and racial biases in the workplace that impact employee retention and progress. We need to look at new models of how we allow both men and women to work so they have the flexibility and ability to be caregivers as well as employees. And we need to start paying women equal wages to men doing the same job. The big question that companies have to answer is ""What happens to our businesses if we don't?""What is the most important lesson you've learned in your career to date?It can be easy to confuse who you are with what you do for a living. Make sure that what you do for a living only represents a part of you. Leave room for all the other roles you can (and should) play in your life - ideally they should all influence each other. How do you maintain a work/life balance?I wish I could give you my five point plan but I'm not sure it's currently possible given our overarching culture of work in this country. When I started at Collins, the owners of the company (Brian Collins & Leland Maschmeyer) agreed that this was an important issue and that we needed to figure out what that looks like for our company. Currently, I have a work schedule that allows me to come in very early to the office and leave by 4:30pm so I can pick up the kids and then I work from home on Fridays. I remind myself on a daily basis that I can't be all things at one time, which allows me to focus and prioritize, and ultimately to be present and engaged whether it's at work or at home with my kids. What do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace?That we think women need to change (Lean in ladies!) instead of the change happening within the companies that hire them. That we think things like equal pay, institutional sexism, flexibility, and a culture of overwork are ""women's issues"" versus issues that impact and harm everyone, and most significantly, our families. How has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life?I don't know how you can move through your professional or your personal life without a mentor and/or a personal board of directors. It's made all the difference in the world for me. The more senior you become, the more isolated you can become. My mentors are both men and women who have been able to provide me perspective, insight and guidance. Oh, and a good laugh. Early in my career the head of our department had taken me under his wing and created some career changing opportunities for me. Year's later over coffee, I thanked him. And he said to me - ""Amber, all I did was provide you a stage and a spotlight, you did the rest."" Now that I'm a leader, it's what I try to do for others thanks to his influence and mentorship. Which other female leaders do you admire and why?Gay Gaddis - Founder and CEO of T3. Almost 20 years ago she did something revolutionary - she didn't want to lose some of her top talent (which happened to be women) and so when two women became pregnant at the same time she told them that after their maternity leave they could bring their babies back to work with them. This started the T3 and under program that allows mothers, fathers and their children to more easily transition back in to work and in to their new lives. It was a company realizing it needed to adapt to its talent, not the other way around. Mellody Hobson - President of Ariel investments. Not only does she lead an incredibly successful investment firm but she also talks openly about the things you're not supposed to talk about in business when you're a woman of color - that fact that you're a woman of color! Her TED talk ""Color Blind or Color Brave"" should be mandatory viewing for everyone.Anne-Marie Slaughter - President of The New America Foundation. Her provocative essay ""Why women still can't have it all"" has had me tossing and turning at night since I first read it two years ago. It prompted me and some other women to start a think tank - we know our current culture of overwork isn't working - for anybody - so we're looking to ideate solutions to change it. I don't want my daughter or my son to have to choose between being great at their job and being great at their lives. What do you want Collins to accomplish in the next year?We want to re-imagine what a creative culture looks like for our industry. That means creating a place where our people are sincerely valued, heard and supported. Where our people come in and feel inspired to inspire others. A culture where truly diverse creative talent comes together to solve the challenges our clients face, and where we help them create more meaningful experiences for their customers. That means creating an environment where women, people of color, gay, lesbian, straight, transgender, parents, caregivers, white dudes, introverts, extroverts, data seekers and intuitive feelers can all thrive. The way we see it, companies need to work for people. And we can only do that by having the most talented, spirited, and passionate people working with us every day. It's that tough. But it's that simple."

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mining-the-states-of-city_1_b_8894690","1/1/2016","john o'kane","Mining the States of City Minds: 2","In ""Mining the States of City Minds,"" a recent blog, I introduced my approach to experiencing the texture of city life in Venice, California and writing up the resulting stories with a type of literary journalism. This kind of writing, with roots in the New Journalism of the 1960s, captures these stories as they happen in the streets and other sites of everyday life through scenes that are faithful to the action and events they emerged from. It lets characters speak for themselves, which gives the writing the feel of a fictional short story but also a more truthful approximation of the surfacing event through their differing perspectives or points of view. Like a Surrealist flaneur I amble through the city trolling for stories and find their potential elements in various clusters of activity, sometimes homeless camps, where these voices dramatize their challenging existences. They present the evidence that might lead to a larger story waiting to be told. This is the second in my series. In the first I captured the chaos ensuing from a crime in the streets, and especially the actions and impressions of one person suspected of committing it as he escapes into the bowels of the city. Here I capture another scene in a park at night where a few residents from the previous one are present along with others, including the suspect. ***** The Dog Park The Dog Park at night is devoid of canines. No Italian Greyhounds, Great Danes, Labradors, Airedales, Pekingeses, Pomeranians or French Poodles escorted by well-bred couples or their bronzed shadows; no pitbulls, mutts, mongrels or prairie dogs husbanded by the unemployed or Frisbee-levitating freaks. No echoes of the discordant barking symphonies that overspill the park during the day, or the blood-curdling howls, growls and yelps that erupt when the sublimation wears off and pet begets the wolf it momentarily supersedes, even sometimes giving way to a full-blown breeding struggle. Wyatt often found himself in the middle of these outbreaks, forced from his fitful slumber to play peacemaker to lords and serfs. The night was primitive communism. The degrees of victimization were more or less the same, the telltale scars and frayed threads were equal sartorial justice, the plots of land were squattable by all, no matter what the racial or gender preference. But the dog-eat-dog of the jungle gnaws away at the fabric. ""We gotta get otta here pretty soon, somethin's goin on out there...what we gonna do,"" says a male curled around a tree on the north end of the park, speaking to no one in particular. He could be anywhere between thirty and sixty, depending on the results from sifting through the street fallout in the light of day. Several others who are scattered down the mound from him look around, curious about who might be the object of his words. No one takes credit. ""Can't go back over there fer a while, that's fer sure!"" he continues. He's new to the area and hasn't been initiated. So most keep their distance, especially since he refuses to give his name. There's always the fear of outsiders spying on them, especially those with accents that are unfamiliar or apparently not true. And many on the street have minor warrants, failure to appear violations from when their lives above ground were starting to slide and they ignored too many petty citations, or more serious, ready-to-cuff ones. Life on the street can weaken moral restraints; even catapult some in directions they never intended. So as a result many assume cop until proven otherwise. The gossip is still rife about how a couple of the LAPD's finest actors could keep at it long enough to get Arnie who hung with the ""art"" crowd in the alley behind Beyond Baroque. He'd violated parole for hangin with Alf who was finishing his parole from a stint in the County for refusing to pay his bill for the breakfast special at the Café 50s. A few begin to move away from him. Some continue chatting about who the person might be who killed the guy in the alley the previous day. Others go on about their business. ""Doubt if he coulda had anything at all to do with it...it just doesn't make any sense!"" says a fifties-something male dressed in frayed and soiled military fatigues, referring to Wyatt, the main suspect. ""Yeah, but there was somethin funny about the way he was always leavin when we just got...member when we was havin that meetin over near the Free Clinic and he just stared at everyone and ran off?"" a young woman responds. A squad car dopplers past, briefly illuminating the Main Street side of the park, quashing the interchange. Angela and an unnamed male with a gray-streaked afro are making dinner plans. He'd just visited the dumpster behind Westminster, exhibiting his discoveries along the edge of the grass: a still-wrapped Big Mac, an unopened mini-bag of Chili Cheese Fritos, a clump of what appears to be chocolate cheese cake, a mound of crushed munchies on a large dinner plate, and several yet-to-be-clarified items he's in the process of preparing. ""Hey Angela,"" he blurts, ""ready for a real goormay dinner? Found a dead possum down the alley. If we can get us a fire goin...Mal over at Mao's scored me some sauce, though not sure what kind...could make us a mess a possum grinder sandwiches if we get everything together. Was a chef back in Tupelo for a few weeks and usta make some kickass grinders...possum's a delicacy in the south!"" ""I got it,"" he screeches, flailing his arms like he's gesturing with amens at a revival meeting. ""These folks round here gots more than they need have...gonna grab me a fire maker!"" He hustles to Pacific and crosses a couple hundred feet or so in front of a black and white speeding north, continuing to Clubhouse and then past to the alley and left toward the beach. He begins to scout the backyards. Angela caresses her companion's items and places them next to an adjacent tree, while seeing a male figure enter the park from the south. She notices that several park residents begin stirring in their roosts. Some start crawling toward the street. Lionel recognizes Wyatt coming toward him. ""Hey, you guys seen Willow?"" Wyatt's question gets no response. He watches as most everyone scampers out of the park, all except Lionel and the unnamed stranger, who's now nervously staring at Wyatt. ""Anyone seen Willow?"" Wyatt repeats, wondering why no one responds. ""Where's everyone going?"" ""Where ya been?"" Lionel fires back. ""Seems like just about everyone's looking for you since..."" ""...why, what you mean? Who?"" ""When's the last time ya saw Medic? Why ya wanna see Willow anyway?"" ""Don't remember anything...Why isn't she round? Something happen to her?"" ""You gotta get yerself together!"" The black and white returns and slips into the alley behind Clubhouse, its multi-colored light show illuminating the west side of the park and causing lights in several adjacent buildings to be turned on. The officers exit their car and proceed toward the beach, their flashlights exposing every nook and cranny en route. As they near the middle of the block Clara hails the officers from the top floor of her condo on the south side of the alley. ""There he is, over in that yard in the bushes!"" ""Close your window and stay inside,"" one of the officers spouts, while the other removes his weapon and moves slowly in the direction of the sighting.

He inches toward the officer with both hands in the air clasped around a small hibachi. Wyatt dashes from the park in the opposite direction from the activity up Main to Brooks, hiding in the shadows behind the Church of Scientology for several minutes before heading to Pacific and sprinting all the way to Rhiannon's place...

I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word[.]"" --Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Nobel Peace Prize Acceptance Speech, December 10, 1964 The start of this New Year finds America at an inflection point as wars and terrorism abroad are echoed in violence, suspicion, and fear at home. How will we meet the moment? Hundreds of organizations and individuals have signed on to the urgent message of the campaign We Are Better Than This: “We grieve the many lives that have been lost or painfully transformed in recent weeks through extreme acts of violence. And we are appalled by the surge of divisive rhetoric that sows the seeds of more violence to come. A dangerous tide of hatred, violence, and suspicion is rising in America—whether aimed at Arab and Muslim Americans, women and the places we seek health care, Black people, immigrants and refugees, or people just going about their daily lives. This tide is made more dangerous by easy access to guns. When has hate ever led to progress? Is this really what we want America to be? We are better than this.” We are better than this. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great German Protestant theologian who died opposing Hitler’s holocaust, believed that the test of the morality of a society is how it treats its children. We flunk Bonhoeffer’s test every hour of every day in America as we let the violence of guns and the violence of poverty relentlessly stalk and sap countless child lives. A child or teen is killed by a gun every three and a half hours, nearly 7 a day, 48 a week. More than 15.5 million children are poor and children are the poorest age group in America—the world’s largest economy. And the younger children are the poorer they are. Children of color, already the majority of our youngest children, soon will be the majority of our children in 2020. Millions of them lack their basic needs for enough food, decent housing, health care and quality early childhood supports during their years of greatest brain development. And over six decades after Brown v. Board of Education, a majority of children of color are still waiting for a fair and equal chance to learn. A majority of all fourth and eighth grade public school students and more than 80 percent of Black and 73 percent of Hispanic students in these grades cannot read or compute at grade level and face dim futures as a jobless landscape looms. They also lack assurance that their lives matter and are at great risk of being sucked into a prison pipeline. Those of us who remember McCarthyism see familiar signs in the hateful rhetoric and hatred aimed at Muslims, refugees, and immigrants. Even children report being bullied and attacked and hearing hateful words. And the pervasive and relentless threat of violence and terror continues to attack and frighten children and adults from Syria to Paris to California and in our cities and rural areas. There is another way. Once again, Dr. King’s words lead us there—through a world that often can feel suffocated by “starless midnight” to belief in a new day. He warned us that excessive materialism, militarism, racism, and poverty could be America’s undoing but that it was up to us to act and combat these evils. The great Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, introducing Dr. King to a Rabbinical Assembly shortly before he was assassinated, said: “Where in America today do we hear a voice like the voice of the prophets of Israel? Martin Luther King is a sign that God has not forsaken the United States. God has sent him to us.” Heschel continued, “His mission is sacred…The situation of the poor in America is our plight, our sickness. To be deaf to their cry is to condemn ourselves.” Heschel believed, “Martin Luther King, Jr., is a voice, a vision, and a way. I call upon every Jew,” and I would add, every person of faith, “to harken to his voice, to share his vision, to follow his way. The whole future of America will depend on the impact and influence of Dr. King.” I would add the world. The next four years will change America forever.

In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech Dr. King also told us he had “the audacity to believe that peoples everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.” And he said: “Civilization and violence are antithetical concepts... Sooner or later all the people of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace, and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. If this is to be achieved, man must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.” Let’s hear and decide that this is the voice we will follow into this New Year. And let us pray and act for an end to preventable poverty and violence in our nation beginning with our children.

You should be clear about who the interviewer is and where he or she is coming from. Google the interviewer's past materials and figure out what his likes and dislikes are. What's her political bent? What's his take on business, especially yours? Has she ever voiced an opinion about your area of expertise? Are the questions confrontational or informational? Does he interrupt the interviewee or let the guest complete the answer? For example, Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business News often asks questions that are laced with her opinions while Charlie Rose is more neutral. Chris Mathews of MSNBC and Bill O'Reilly of Fox News Channel come from different ends of the political spectrum but they have at least one thing in common: it is rare for either to allow their guest to answer a question without interruption. And they are not shy about telling you what they think about your opinion. What's the background of the host or reporter? Do you have anything in common like growing up in the same city or attending the same college? Commonality can help create rapport. If you've read or seen one of their stories and found something genuinely interesting, mention it to them. Everyone likes praise. The next four years will change America forever.

She was abandoned in a cardboard box and left to fend for herself on a busy San Francisco street. She was born without functional legs, and when people would stop to peer into the box, they would walk away after noticing her birth defect. But Daffodil has since embarked on a happy new chapter. Thanks to the kindness of a passerby and the dedication of rescue workers, the little pooch has found a zippy new way to get around -- and a loving home to call her own. According to a blog post by the San Francisco SPCA, Daffodil was rescued by a Good Samaritan named Jene who had spotted the puppy on the street. “Even though many noticed the tiny dog, nobody stopped to help,” the organization wrote. “[Jene] told us that someone reached for the helpless little creature, and upon noticing her birth defect, decided to put her right back into that soggy cardboard box she was left in.” Jene decided to take the pooch home, but soon realized the animal needed more help and care than he could provide. That’s what prompted him to bring Daffodil to the SPCA, where rescue workers immediately got to work trying to find a way to improve the dog's mobility. “Despite her challenges, Daffodil was a typical puppy at heart: curious, playful, and so very adorable,” the SPCA wrote. “She had already learned to get around well enough, but couldn’t channel her puppy energy into playful romping, or chasing toys, or running in circles like the other dogs. In order to give her the life she deserves, one full of puppy playdates and trips to the beach, we decided to get Daffodil her very own set of wheels.” With the help of OrthoPets, a company that specializies in animal prosthetics, together with generous donations from strangers, Daffodil was soon fitted with a four-wheeled prosthetic that allowed her to move around with greater speed and efficiency. “[T]his resilient little puppy [ran] for the first time in her life. Just like that: she was given the chance, and she just went for it,” wrote the SPCA. In a happy twist to the story, Daffodil was later adopted by an employee of OrthoPets. According to the SPCA’s blog post, the employee, named Olivia, had fallen in love with the pooch after seeing photos and was determined to adopt the dog even though she lived in Colorado. “[Olivia] flew in from Colorado to take her home and provide her with a lifetime of love and specialized care. Because some people see value and love and potential and best friends -- even in a broken little dog,” the post said. The next four years will change America forever.

A dashcam video shows the chunk soaring through the air. The incident occurred along Interstate 495 in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on Wednesday morning, reports Boston.com. It slams into the windshield, which fractures on impact. Jeffrey Cote posted the terrifying clip to YouTube, and it's going viral. In addition to destroying the Saab 9-5 Aero Wagon's front window, it also bent the wiper arm and smashed the side mirror, according to Cote. ""If I had braked harder, I could have avoided impact,"" he wrote in the video's description, ""but it initially appeared the piece was going to fall in front of me."" He told CBS Boston that the SUV driver was probably ""unaware"" of what had happened, and issued a warning to other motorists to clear snow and ice from their cars before setting off on their journeys.

A dashcam video shows the chunk soaring through the air. The incident occurred along Interstate 495 in Haverhill, Massachusetts, on Wednesday morning, reports Boston.com. It slams into the windshield, which fractures on impact. Jeffrey Cote posted the terrifying clip to YouTube, and it's going viral. In addition to destroying the Saab 9-5 Aero Wagon's front window, it also bent the wiper arm and smashed the side mirror, according to Cote. ""If I had braked harder, I could have avoided impact,"" he wrote in the video's description, ""but it initially appeared the piece was going to fall in front of me."" He told CBS Boston that the SUV driver was probably ""unaware"" of what had happened, and issued a warning to other motorists to clear snow and ice from their cars before setting off on their journeys.

Flood warnings were also in effect on Friday for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, the Carolinas, Alabama and Kentucky, the NWS said, while major flooding was occurring on the Arkansas River and its tributaries in that state. Dozens have died in U.S. storms, which also brought unusual winter tornadoes and were part of a wild worldwide weather system over the Christmas holiday period that also saw severe flooding in Britain. More than 100,000 people were forced to evacuate their homes in areas bordering Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina after floods due to heavy summer rains caused by El Niño, authorities have said. Global weather dominated conversation on social media over the holiday season after the international climate deal in Paris. Particularly hard hit in the United States in recent days has been Missouri, which has suffered historic flooding. Close to St. Louis on Friday, the Mississippi, the second-longest river in the United States, was falling after reaching near-record heights, the NWS said.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/changing-and-unchanging-cycles_b_8903002","1/1/2016","lisa r,all","Changing and Unchanging Cycles","On New Year's Eve, as we hum ""Auld Lang Syne"" and drink a cup of kindness, we celebrate the end of one year and the beginning of another. It might feel like a big deal to us here on earth, but from an astronomical perspective, it's just a day like any other -- as one planet circles one star, the sun, out of the galaxy's billions. But since we arbitrarily impose a beginning and an end on our equitable distribution of days, let's reflect on some of the cycles that dominate our existence: the big ones over which we have no control, the smaller ones we might hope to influence, and those about which we don't yet know. This way, we can make some resolutions that will outlast the echoes of our song. Patterns and repetition are comforting because they help us remember and understand events. Phenomena that occur on a regular basis generally have an underlying reason. The cosmos provides us with numerous examples. Isaac Newton deduced the law of gravity that allows us to predict elliptical orbits around a central object's gravitational pull. This is how the Milky Way attracts the sun, which takes roughly 240 million years to orbit the galaxy's center. And as we all know, the earth, along with all the other planets in our solar system, orbits the sun. The earth's cycle takes a year -- hence the holiday and festivities before us. The planets in the solar system are joined by objects with lesser celebrity status, such as asteroids and comets. Dwarf planets orbit too. ""Dwarf planet'' is a new category that includes the demoted Pluto, but also other objects of similar size that have been discovered since the 1990s -- objects that are big enough to take notice of (and are spherical) but not quite big enough to orbit alone. Like John Mayer, who formerly headlined on his own but now tours with the Grateful Dead, Pluto is no longer a solo act. The earth's rotation on its axis, creating the 24-hour cycle we know so well, is why Annie who gets her gun (back when that could be considered amusing) has the sun in the morning and the moon at night. It's also why orphan Annie knows the sun will come out tomorrow. (The moon rotates too -- but at a rate commensurate with that of its orbit. This results in a side of the moon we never see, sometimes colloquially, and inaccurately, called ""the dark side of the moon."" Being invisible to us does not make it dark -- the sun still shines on this hidden hemisphere.) Seasons result from the tilt of the earth's axis of rotation, which makes regions subject to differing amounts of the sun's radiation as the earth orbits around it. Long-term climate trends depend on other cyclical patterns too, such as the various Milankovitch cycles of thousands of years, named for the Serbian astronomer-mathematician Milutin Milankovitch, who realized that the periodic changes in the earth's ellipticity -- how far from circular the orbit is -- as well as changes in the earth's tilt, can result in climate changes that lead, about every 100,000 years, to ice ages and to shorter periodic weather patterns, too. However, these many-thousand-year cycles don't explain what is happening on time scales determined by human activity in the last few hundred years. Within the earth, too, patterns repeat themselves. Over a few hundred million years of geological activity, the plates of the earth are regenerated, and, over a shorter time scale, the ocean floor is reconfigured too. Movements of the continental plates are one of the drivers of another important cycle, the carbon cycle, so essential to life on our planet. The cycle of carbon in the atmosphere -- critical to our climate, and to life itself -- results in part from carbon that is released into the atmosphere through volcanoes and hotspots and is absorbed back into the earth. There is weak evidence that large-impact craters on earth -- those that arose from a kilometer-wide asteroid or comet hitting the earth -- also happen periodically. Research by my collaborators and me suggests that it could be the gravitational pull of dark matter in the midplane of the Milky Way that dislodges weakly bound comets at the edge of the solar system so that they are more likely to hit the earth in a 32-million-year cycle. Measurements being done currently will show whether such a dark matter disc exists. Though we are safe from any such hypothesized cataclysmic impact for another 30 million years, there are other cycles, ones over which we can exercise some control, that present much more immediate threats. We are repeatedly alerted to melting glaciers and increasingly dangerous storms. News about the Middle East changes in detail, but the general patterns remain the same. Gun shootings in America happen so regularly that the cycles of outrage and pushback are barely noticeable. Yet despite the recurring carousel of time, we enter each new year with optimism. It will be easier to maintain that belief in a better future if we think a little harder about how and when we can eject ourselves from undesirable patterns. The Paris climate agreement and its ancillary benefits can help us begin to make real progress in slowing down changes to the earth's climate, a cycle we have only a limited time to affect. Maybe we can curb, or at least slow down, other seeming inevitabilities, too. In the universe, cycles won't last forever as the solar system and the galaxy undergo changes. If we can keep in mind that humanity has the potential to change the cycles that we impose on ourselves, then maybe this new year we'll break that most reliable cycle of all -- making resolutions we don't have the fortitude to keep.

Very few people have communicated with me,” the 22-year-old told Colombia's W Radio on Wednesday, explaining why she’s been mostly silent about the incident. “That's because I had to grieve for what happened.” Gutiérrez had already started celebrating what she believed to be her victory at the Dec. 20 Miss Universe pageant when host Steve Harvey interrupted her revelry to announce that he'd read out the wrong name for the winner. In a mortifying on-air moment, the crown was then taken from a visibly stunned Gutiérrez -- and given to an equally flabbergasted Miss Philippines, Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach. Photos of the aftermath show an emotional Gutiérrez being comforted by her fellow contestants. After the on-air flub, Gutiérrez, who was named the first runner-up, was widely praised for responding to Harvey’s mistake with grace. “Everything happens for a reason,” she said backstage immediately after the mortifying incident. She later took to Instagram to congratulate Miss Philippines for her win. “Life continues and in the future we will find out why things happen the way they happen,” she wrote in her post.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/something-wicked-white-su_b_8902982","1/1/2016","rev. dr. susan brooks thistlethwaite","Something Wicked: White Supremacy as 2016's Urgent Faith Challenge"," Something Wicked This Way Comes is not only a sinister 1962 fantasy novel by Ray Bradbury, it is also descriptive of the malevolent and growing power of white supremacy in the United States. This accelerating menace is an urgent faith challenge in 2016. Here's where we are today: African American children and adults are killed with impunity, callously injured and incarcerated at rates that make the United States a world pariah. Conservative presidential candidates are getting explicit support from white supremacist organizations that have crawled out of the woodwork, drawn by hateful rhetoric against African Americans, immigrants and Muslims. While white supremacy is by no means new, this is a new moment of accelerated marketing of fear and hate packaged as a promise that if you are a white person you can get a sense of control over your life. Never mind the real reason why you feel out of control is because your job went to China and your company executives spent your retirement. White supremacists, like the carnival barker in Bradbury's novel, know the secret desire for power in the human heart, and the buried fears that give rise to those desires, and they exploit them. Across a vast and diverse faith community, we have to recognize this desire and its powerful emotional lure: feeling superior as a white person over those of other races, especially over African Americans, is formative for many, taken in sometimes with mother's milk and continuously fed through culture, law, politics, economics and religion. Yes, religion. I know as a white Christian pastor and activist, I need to step it up, and confront this menace both within Christianity, as well as in society. A white God, a white Jesus, and a white church will never be allies in the struggle against white supremacy; they will, at best, be unconscious enablers. As sociologist of religion Dr. Cheryl Townsend Gilkes notes in her chapter ""Still the Most Segregated Hour, """"Religion is a motive force in the construction of the United States as a racialized society."" If a white person would be a faith ally in the struggle against white supremacy, it is crucial to look inward at religion and, frankly, change that, while at the same time attending carefully to those who are being crushed. Don't blithely assume you can help. This is where liberation theology can be helpful. Liberation theology always starts with contextual analysis, as Mary Potter Engel and I write in Lift Every Voice: Constructing Christian Theologies from the Underside. Let's start from the realization that white supremacy IS the context of the U.S., that it is a long-standing system of vast exploitation and immorality as Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote so powerfully in The Atlantic as ""The Case for Reparations."" ""Two hundred fifty years of slavery. Ninety years of Jin Crow. Sixty years of separate but equal. Thirty-five years of racist housing policy."" This, this is why white supremacy is wicked. Wickedness is more than sin and evil. It is, in fact, the malignancy of sin and evil combining and reinforcing each other, as Mary Potter Engel put it so well in our book: Evil and sin together may be called ""wickedness,"" the complex condition of the lack of right relation in the world in which we live naturally, socially, and individually. Evil is the systems created by centuries of oppression, sin is the ""free and discrete acts...that create or reinforce these structures of oppression."" Structures. Systems. White Christian complicity. Take those as a given. Then, move outside theology to get more help. Liberation theologies often use social science as a lever in rooting out dominance in traditional theologies and finding ways to make practical common cause in liberation struggles. Sociologists have described what they call wicked problems. These are problems that are driven by a vast number of interconnected forces that sustain and grow them. Wicked problems are characteristically difficult either to recognize or to solve. Horst Rittel, one of the first to formalize a theory of wicked problems, cites ten characteristics of these complicated social issues, some of which stand out as particularly applicable to white supremacy. Wicked problems ""have no definitive formulation"" as they have different patterns in different locations. White supremacy in Chicago, IL, for example, has important differences in terms of historical roots, as well as economic and political structures than the white supremacy of let's say, Charleston, South Carolina. Effective activists know this. They use this. White supremacy is a ""wicked problem"" because it ""bleeds."" That means there are no boundaries to its causes or its effects. Instead, white supremacy permeates education, law, law enforcement, economics, politics, religion and, broadly speaking, culture. Sexism, racism, homophobia, trans-phobia, Islamophobia and classism all need examination and action. One telling example: a ""celebration"" of an African American woman athlete such as Serena Williams devolves into a discussion of her arms or her general body shape, engaging in body shaming and reinforcing racist attitudes toward African American women. The model of Wicked Problems holds that those who would engage them must ""take responsibility"" for the consequences of their interventions. This is a big one for faith activists. Your good intentions don't, and I intend this in a theological sense, mean a damn. Don't just muck in. Study, care, consultation and coordination are a big part of being effective in dealing with even a part of wicked problems. It is also important to realize there is no ""solving"" wicked problems, there is only creativity that can tackle its many manifestations, subvert and mitigate their most destructive effects and engage creative alternatives. #BlackLivesMatter has rightly garnered respect and support from white faith organizers because of its specificity, creativity, analytical wisdom and strong actions. But it is crucial that white people of faith engage our fellow white citizens, Christian and non-Christian and do a lot of work. If you have read this far into this post, you already likely believe that. Here are some examples: Showing Up for Racial Justice is a ""national network of groups and individuals organizing white people for racial justice. Through community organizing, mobilizing and education, SURJ moves white people to act as part of a multi-racial majority for justice with passion and accountability."" SURJ was founded in 2009. It is telling that in January of 2015, there were only 12 chapters. Today there are 140, and 14 working groups such as SURJ Faith and SURJ Families. There are others, of course, such as GroundWork. This group, out of Wisconsin, organizes white people ""against racism and white privilege and for racial justice and equity in our daily lives from the heart, with dignity, and integrity."" It is collaborative and practical. Chicago Theological Seminary where I work, has been intensely focusing on racism and white privilege for several years. Many other seminaries have as well. Individual churches are making such commitments, such as All Saints Church in Pasadena. There are many others. This is all good, but like in Bradbury's novel, I see the wickedness of white supremacy as a storm rising in 2016, threatening and coming towards us. White supremacy is dangerously growing. There are crackles and flashes of astonishingly virulent hate and fear. We will need all the faith confidence we can muster against the ""principalities and powers"" (Romans 8:38-39). There is good news. I believe no matter how powerful wicked systems can be, they are no match for grace shared in community and the love of God and neighbor.

During a Dec. 31 episode of the BBC's ""The Graham Norton Show,"" featuring the actress and fellow Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne, the host brought out some old modeling photos of a sweater-clad Redmayne -- much to his embarrassment. Lawrence could relate, kind of. As a younger woman, she explained, she'd scored a modeling gig for risqué teen clothier Abercrombie and Fitch.

""The fire in the hotel has been contained. We would like to express our gratitude to the authorities for their immediate and professional support. An investigation is ongoing,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email. Dubai police said on Thursday that the building was evacuated and 14 people were lightly injured. A medic at the scene said more than 60 people were treated for mild smoke inhalation and problems caused by crowding as they fled. Witnesses described seeing flaming debris wafting down from The Address as occupants left, some running. The New Year's fireworks display at the nearby Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, is one of Dubai's most celebrated annual rites and attracted thousands of spectators - most of whom were evacuated before the spectacle went on as scheduled.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/of-female-action-figures_b_8902946","1/1/2016","rabbi jonah c. steinberg, ph.d.","Of Female Action Figures"," ""For I brought you out of the land of Egypt, and from the house of slavery I redeemed you, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam."" (Micah 6:4) Parts of the Internet erupted in a furor this holiday season when it transpired that a boxed set of action figures depicting characters from Star Wars: The Force Awakens omitted a figurine of Rey, the female lead of the film, the series' new hero. And no, not diminutive 'heroine,' à la Princess Leia - and à la Miriam in our Torah, who never quite emerges from the shadow of the brother she saves in our reading this week - but 'hero,' the character whose journey and development constitute the essential arc of the story. Rey gets more screen time than the new swashbuckling pilot, Poe Dameron, more than the old swashbuckling pilot, Han Solo (in fact, she gives Harrison Ford's character a good run for his swashbuckling, and his piloting), and on Rey's account the new Star Wars movie even arguably passes the Bechdel Test: she and another female character with a name have at least parts of a conversation with one another that are not about a man. (And yes, Star Wars is featuring in my message of Torah for a second week running. What can I say? I am a child of the original, 1976 film.) Toward the end of the biblical book of Genesis, which we finished reading last week, we find a list of ""all those of Jacob's household who came into Egypt, seventy persons."" Notably, if not improbably, the count consists entirely of men, with one exception, in the family of Asher, where we find ""...and Serach, their sister."" So, if the toy company judged that a female action figure would keep its play set from flying off the shelves, it was granting present-day children one seventieth less credit in that regard than our Bible gave ancient Israelites. Serach appears once more in the Torah, much later on, in the book of Numbers, when Moses conducts a census of the Israelites in the wilderness, and again, in a sole mention of a female name, we read, ""...and the name of the daughter of Asher was Serach."" On that basis, our ancient sages proposed that Serach, the daughter of Asher, lived all the way through all the generations of Israel's captivity, through the Exodus and the generation of desert wandering, and even - why not? - into the time of King David, some four hundred and fifty years later. ""I completed the minyan of Israel in Egypt,"" Serach declares, in a refreshing use of the traditional term for a stipulated number, when she calls out to David's military chief of staff, Yoav, according to the rabbinic elaboration of a story in the Second book of Samuel, taking Yoav by surprise as the peace-making ""wise woman"" of a city in the hill country of Ephraim that he has somewhat wantonly besieged. How did Moses know where Joseph's bones were buried, so as to fulfill the promise of carrying his remains out of Egypt? Serach told him. She had been there when Joseph died. On what basis did the Israelites finally accept Moses in the story we read this week? According to our rabbis, Serach kept a ""secret of redemption"" passed through her family from the time of God's promise to Abraham, and she waited for generations for someone to appear and pronounce the secret words. In fact, just about every time a helpful and mysterious female figure appears in scripture or is required by legend, one can count on our ancient rabbis to consider Serach the daughter of Asher a likely suspect. For more than two decades now, I have kept a file-folder titled ""The S Files,"" and I suspect I have not finished adding Serach-tales from traditional sources to it. The Talmud and the mystical Zohar say that Serach, like the Prophet Elijah, ""entered the Garden of Eden without tasting death"" - which I consider should make Serach a more ready candidate than Miriam for having a special cup in her name on the Passover Seder table along with Elijah's. I get a bit uneasy when a new Miriam-song is added to the traditional Elijah-one - after all, we know where Miriam is buried, as far as scripture is concerned, so while Miriam may ""dance with us"" again when the dead are resurrected, Serach, according to the most venerable sources, is still very much around and available to join Elijah at Seders, and in times of need. Now there's an unsung secret of redemption. I have even added my own exegetical conjecture to the file, over time. When Joshua, Moses' student and successor, passes away, he is buried in the city of his elder years, a place he requests as an old man, after his valedictory speech to the people, a town called Timnat-Serach in the hill country of Ephraim. (Joshua 19:50, 24:30) I have not yet found any ancient source that makes a point of this, but if you were Joshua - one of two men to have lived all the way through the Exodus and into the Promised Land - would you not wish to hang out, in your retirement, with someone who had seen it all as well? I picture Joshua and the even older Serach sitting on a hillside in Ephraim, musing together about young people and what's becoming of the land. The next four years will change America forever.

On the other hand, there is actually something discouraging in so much getting heaped on one rare female personage. An unnamed ""wise woman?"" Oh, that must be Serach - as though there could be no other. Now, what to make, exegetically, of the fact that the figurine of BB-8, the Star Wars franchise's adorable new robot, comes packaged under the plastic of Rey's container, rather than with Poe Dameron, the male character who actually brings the droid into the story? It seems all to be about whom we consider capable of standing in her or his own right as an action figure - a timeless and worthy spiritual goal.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/in-2016-bernie-sanders-defeat-clinton-trump_b_8902400","1/1/2016","h. a. goodman","In 2016, Bernie Sanders Will Defeat Clinton and Dominate Trump to Become President","On November 8, 2016 Bernie Sanders will achieve a dominant victory over Donald Trump. Already, Sanders defeats Trump in the polls by a wider margin than Hillary Clinton, as illustrated in a December 22, 2015 Hill article titled ""In blockbuster poll, Sanders destroys Trump by 13 points"": Stop the presses! According to a new poll by Quinnipiac University on Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) destroys Republican candidate Donald Trump in a general election by 13 percentage points. In this new poll, Sanders has 51 percent to Trump's 38 percent. If this margin held in a general election, Democrats would almost certainly regain control of the United States Senate and very possibly the House of Representatives. It is noteworthy that in this Quinnipiac poll, Sanders runs so much stronger than Clinton against Trump... In the December 22 poll, Bernie Sanders defeats Trump by 13 points, while Clinton beats Trump by 7 points. There are numerous reasons Bernie Sanders will achieve this dominant victory over a billionaire xenophobe who panders to the fears and base passions of conservatives. First, Bernie Sanders warns against the influence of money and power in politics, and ""welcomes the hatred"" of the billionaire class that Trump personifies. Sanders won the Congressional Award from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, while Trump insulted Vietnam Veteran and former POW John McCain. There are a great many other reasons that I'll highlight in the future, when Sanders becomes the Democratic nominee. Overall, Bernie Sanders genuinely cares about ending wealth inequality and perpetual wars, while Trump is a buffoon who's spent most of his time making headlines for outrageous statements. Most importantly, Sanders is the antithesis of Trump and gives voters a stark contrast in choice; not so with Hillary. POLITICO writes that Clinton ""received donations from both him and son Donald Trump Jr. on separate occasions in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2007, according to state and federal disclosure records."" You'll never get a Clinton supporter to address these donations, or why Trump once felt it would be advantageous to become one of Clinton's donors. Trump also gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, in either a moment of pure altruism, or another campaign donation akin to Clinton's foreign donor scandal. While the recent Quinnipiac poll shows Clinton defeating Trump, the underlying data shows that generally, Americans don't trust the former Secretary of State. 59 percent of American voters believe Clinton is ""not honest and trustworthy."" 55 percent of American voters say ""she does not share their values."" 50 percent of American voters feel Clinton ""does not care about their needs and problems."" Like every other poll in 2008 and 2015 illustrating Clinton's wide lead over a challenger, voters say they'll vote for a candidate they don't trust, or feel doesn't care about their problems. If you view polls as gospel and place a premium on recent polls, then Quinnipiac also states 72 percent of Independents don't believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy. This is a dangerous number for Democrats since 43 percent of Americans according to Gallup are independent. Also, 49 percent (compared to 44 percent) of American women don't view Clinton as honest or trustworthy, while over 62% of voters ages 35-64 don't find Clinton honest or trustworthy. From ages 18 to over 65, there was no age group that found Clinton honest or trustworthy, and 59 percent of Americans age 18-34 don't find Clinton to be honest or trustworthy. 51 percent of registered voters have an unfavorable view of Clinton (compared to 43 percent), while Bernie Sanders has a positive net favorability of 9 points. Again, this Quinnipiac poll is from December 22, 2015. Most polls, like this one, contradict their findings; Americans will never vote for a candidate they don't like and don't trust, linked to an FBI investigation. On December 18, 2007 Gallup stated that Clinton Maintains Large Lead Over Obama Nationally. It never lasted, and I explain why Clinton is unelectable due to negative favorability ratings in this YouTube segment. Bernie Sanders will win the Democratic nomination because if Clinton was ever going to win, it would have been in 2008, not during an investigation of her emails by the FBI. On December 11, POLITICO explained why the FBI's investigation is just getting started in a piece titled ""State Department can't find emails of top Clinton IT staffer"": The FBI has taken possession of Bryan Pagliano's computer system... Clinton had personally paid Pagliano to maintain her home-made server, which is also currently in the FBI's possession. The agency has been investigating whether classified material was ever put at risk because she used her own server instead of the standard State email system. The State Department has designated about 1,000 of her emails as classified documents, which would never have been allowed on such a private system. Considering that hackers from various countries already tried to access Clinton's server, Pagliano pleaded the Fifth, and two computer systems are in the FBI's custody, this story won't end before Election Day. As for the belief that African American voters and other non-white Democrats will overwhelmingly vote for Clinton in South Carolina and throughout the South, people aren't poll numbers. A Daily Beast article on December 29, 2015 titled ""Hillary Clinton's Tone-Deaf Racial Pandering"" explains why poll numbers might not equate to votes: Hillary Clinton's minority outreach over the last week has rekindled the idea that she is a candidate who is out of touch, particularly when it comes to minorities. To many of us, her campaign's insistence that she is an abuela for Latinos and the changing of her Twitter logo to represent Kwanzaa came across as pandering at its worst... If more of Clinton's outreach attempts seem tone deaf or overly reliant on her previous successes than her present rapport with today's voters, it will be difficult for her to shake the image of being out of touch. It's important to also note that Clinton's attempt at pandering comes months after progressive groups pressured her to stop taking money from prison lobbyists. The Intercept writes ""As immigration and incarceration issues become central to the 2016 presidential campaign, lobbyists for two major prison companies are serving as top fundraisers for Hillary Clinton."" Finally, I find it bizarre that certain people still brand me as a Paul supporter, even though I'm a lifelong Democrat against perpetual war (I only wrote the piece because Obama had sent more Americans back to the Middle East and I'm vehemently opposed to more Americans dying in quagmires), and I now view the Paul article last year as a mistake. I'm also only voting for Bernie Sanders. Conversely, Hillary Clinton views Iraq as a ""mistake,"" yet her supporters have no problem seeing the former New York Senator as president. The Iraq war destabilized the Middle East, I simply angered fellow progressives. If you hear any wild conspiracy theories about me, or ridiculous accusations, simply send my detractors this YouTube segment. As for why I'm writing non-stop about Bernie Sanders, nothing epitomizes my desire to see Sanders as the Democratic nominee and president than this POLITIFACT article titled ""Yes, Clinton used the Bush administration line"": ""President Bush and Dick Cheney insisted there was a connection. Senator Clinton on the floor of the Senate suggested that there was such a connection,"" Obama said in an interview on MSNBC's Hardball on March 11, 2008. In that speech, Clinton explained her reasoning... ""He [Saddam] has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including al-Qaida members..."" Sanders opposed Iraq and foreshadowed its tragic consequences, going against establishment Democrats and neoconservative Republicans; both would become even more intertwined with a Clinton presidency. In contrast, Clinton echoed Bush and Cheney talking points about al Qaeda in Saddam's Iraq. If you vote for anyone other than Bernie Sanders in 2016, you're simply not a progressive, especially knowing that Trump is a racist xenophobe and Clinton utilized the same tactics against Obama in 2008. You're also voting for endless wars with Trump or Clinton, while Bernie Sanders says ""I'll be dammed"" to more quagmires. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/minimum-wage-increase_n_6110c888e4b0ed63e6574bb2","1/1/2016","reuters","New Year Brings Minimum Wage Hikes For Americans In 14 States","CHICAGO, Jan 1 (Reuters) - As the United States marks more than six years without an increase in the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, 14 states and several cities are moving forward with their own increases, with most set to start taking effect on Friday. California and Massachusetts are highest among the states, both increasing from $9 to $10 an hour, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures. At the low end is Arkansas, where the minimum wage is increasing from $7.50 to $8. The smallest increase, a nickel, comes in South Dakota, where the hourly minimum is now $8.55. The increases come in the wake of a series of ""living wage"" protests across the country, including a November campaign in which thousands of protesters in 270 cities marched in support of a $15-an-hour minimum wage and union rights for fast food workers. Food service workers make up the largest group of minimum-wage earners, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With Friday's increases, the new average minimum wage across the 14 affected states rises from $8.50 an hour to just over $9. Several cities are going even higher. Seattle is setting a sliding hourly minimum between $10.50 and $13 on Jan. 1, and Los Angeles and San Francisco are enacting similar increases in July, en route to $15 an hour phased in over six years. Backers say a higher minimum wage helps combat poverty, but opponents worry about the potential impact on employment and company profits. In 2014, a Democratic-backed congressional proposal to increase the federal minimum wage for the first time since 2009 to $10.10 stalled, as have subsequent efforts by President Barack Obama. More recent proposals by some lawmakers call for a federal minimum wage of up to $15 an hour. Alan Krueger, an economics professor at Princeton University and former chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said a federal minimum wage of up to $12 an hour, phased in over five years or so, ""would not have a noticeable effect on employment."" Some employers may cut jobs in response to a minimum-wage increase, Krueger said, while others may find hikes allow them to fill job vacancies and reduce turnover, lifting employment but lowering profits. In recent years, an increasing number of states and municipalities have enacted their own wage floor policies. Currently, 29 states plus the District of Columbia and about two dozen cities and counties have their minimum wage at levels higher than the federal minimum. Many are now in the midst of multi-year phase-in plans that will ultimately take them to between $10 and $15 an hour. The 14 states where increases take effect on Friday are: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimated 2014 federal proposal would have raised the wages of 16.5 million Americans and lifted 900,000 of them out of poverty but would have cost as many as 1 million jobs.

California and Massachusetts are highest among the states, both increasing from $9 to $10 an hour, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/virginia-highly-successful-anti-tax-lobby_b_8902804","1/1/2016","jared bernstein","Yes, Virginia... There Is an Aggressive and Highly Successful Anti-Tax Lobby","The Wall Street Journal ran an interesting piece yesterday morning showing how the effective tax rate -- taxes as a share of income -- spiked up significantly in 2013 for the wealthiest taxpayers due to an increase in the tax rate on capital gains. This is important information and the piece appropriately highlights how the higher rate sharply increased the tax liability of the richest 400 taxpayers, whose effective rate went from 16.7 percent in 2012 to 22.9 percent in 2013. That's the highest effective rate paid by this top group since 2002, though it's still a 7 percentage point decline from the 29.9 percent rate that prevailed in 1995. Had these wealthy taxpayers faced that rate, their liability would have been $7.5 billion higher. For readers who also read the recent New York Times piece on the ""income defense industry"" of the wealthy-the extensive anti-tax infrastructure they've built up over the years to reduce their tax liabilities-this WSJ piece may have sown some confusion. For example, the Journal quotes a conservative commentator complaining about ""the mistaken narrative... that... high income Americans have used a combination of aggressive tax planning, loopholes and political influence to lower their tax burdens to unconscionably low levels."" So who's right? Does there really exist an industry of deeply funded anti-tax lobbyists whose sole purpose is to protect the holdings of their clients? Absolutely -- far from ""mistaken,"" that narrative is exactly right. Do they win every fight? Nope, and they lost the one that led the capital gains rate to go up in 2013. But to suggest that this one change alters the fundamental landscape of our tax avoidance problem would be an egregious overstatement. First off, as both the NYT and WSJ pieces stress, pushing for lower rates is but one part of the tax avoidance agenda. It's far more effective to get your income out of the tax base. As Gabriel Zucman, whose recent work on tax havens provides essential data for this debate, puts it in the WSJ piece, ""For billionaires, a lot of income never shows up on tax returns."" -- Zucman finds that the share of U.S. foreign profits booked in tax havens has grown from about 20 percent in the 1980s to 50 percent now. -- As I point out here, a group of tax analysts show in a forthcoming paper that the share of corporate stock held in taxable household accounts has fallen from around 80 percent in the mid-1960s to about 25 percent now, meaning most such stock is now untaxed or held in tax-favored vehicles, like individual retirement accounts. -- Business income ""passed through"" to the individual level is the single largest source of the ""tax gap"" (the difference between what people owe and what they pay; it amounts to over $300 billion/year). Sole proprietors, e.g., have been found to report less than half of their income to the IRS. One reason people pass through business income to the personal side of the code is to take advantage of the differential in top income tax rates, about 40 percent, and capital gains, which are now about 24 percent. That's still a very important form of tax avoidance, but the WSJ is certainly right to point out that the current cap gains rate is a lot higher than the 15 percent rate that previously prevailed. Finally, it should be lost on no one that if the tax suppression lobby can't get everything they want in lower rates or wider loopholes, they've got a new strategy that's proving to be alarmingly effective: defunding the IRS. Since 2010, the agency's budget is down 18 percent in real dollars; enforcement staffing is down by 20 percent. These cuts support the tax gap: Treasury estimates that each additional $1 spent on IRS enforcement yields $6 of additional revenue. The next four years will change America forever.

But that doesn't make them any less real and, unfortunately, they win a lot more of these fights than they lose.

Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports that the shooter fled the scene. Authorities apprehended a suspect on a nearby street shortly after the shooting, but are continuing a manhunt. Haaretz says that Israeli police have identified the suspect as a 29-year-old Palestinian citizen of Israel from the Northern Israeli town of Arara. He stole the gun used in the shooting from his father, who works in security. The suspect’s father contacted authorities after noticing the weapon was missing. There is a “growing consensus among security officials,” according to Haaretz, that the shooting, which took place on Dizengoff Street, a café-filled main street, was a terror attack. Nati Shakked, owner of Simta bar, which was attacked, told Reuters that the assailant had waited on a bench outside before taking a machine gun out of a bag and ""shooting in every direction."" A video captured the graphic moment the attacker opened fire.

Erdogan wants to change the Turkish constitution to turn the ceremonial role of president into that of a chief executive, a Turkish version of the system in the United States, France or Russia. Asked on his return from a visit to Saudi Arabia late on Thursday whether an executive presidential system was possible while maintaining the unitary structure of the state, he said: ""There are already examples in the world. You can see it when you look at Hitler's Germany. ""There are later examples in various other countries,"" he told reporters, according to a recording broadcast by the Dogan news agency. The ruling AK Party, founded by Erdogan, has put a new constitution at the heart of its agenda after winning back a majority in a November parliamentary election. It agreed with the main opposition CHP on Wednesday to revive efforts to forge a new constitution. Opposition parties agree on the need to change the constitution, drawn up after a 1980 coup and still bearing the stamp of its military authors, but do not back the presidential system envisaged by Erdogan, fearing it will consolidate too much power in the hands of an authoritarian leader.

As a result, RaiseAChild Founder and CEO, Rich Valenza, takes us behind the scenes of a facility that has served thousands of foster children, but seen by few adults. Tucked away, at an address that you won’t likely find on your GPS, is a facility that functions as the last resort for foster children in Los Angeles County. Each night, starting at about 6:30 p.m., the place begins to buzz. Social workers pull up in reserved parking spots right in front of the building. I watch as they unload their cars of children of all sizes, shapes and colors. Some workers enter the automated doors carrying babies, or holding the hands of young sibling groups. Others walk behind teenagers who don’t need help with the routine they know all too well. Regardless of the age of these children, they all have unfortunate similarities. Each child is likely to have experienced serious episodes of neglect or abuse. Fear, bewilderment, and anxiety are easy to read on each of their faces. Everyone of these children have been delivered to this facility because there are not enough foster parents in Los Angeles County to take them. Not even for one night. Upon arrival, all foster children are ushered down a long sterile hallway and processed through a medical clinic for an initial screening. From there, their social workers separate the children according to their age. Babies to 11-year-olds are delivered behind a secured blue metal door with a large sign that reads “Children’s Welcome Center.” It’s a large room that echoes from linoleum floors and sparse furnishing. By 9:30 each night, it is “lights out” as cribs and folded cots have been rolled out from the storage closet and lined up across the floor. Because sound carries across this room, one restless baby can easily wake all of the other children. But usually these children sleep soundly as this safe space likely provides the first sense of security in their lives for some time. Foster teens are walked to a different end of the facility and check in at a security guard’s station near an overhead sign that reads “Youth Welcome Center.” But this hardly seems like a welcoming place when each teen is then screened more carefully to insure that drugs, alcohol and weapons don’t find their way in. On the cold December night that I visited the Children’s Welcome Center, there were five children between the ages of one and nine expected to spend the night. The months of November and December, I am told, turn out smaller numbers of younger children to this Welcome Center because the holiday season generally generates more compassion for younger foster children. But starting in January, the nightly numbers of children begin to climb again. Typically, March and October are peak months with the number of children 11 and under rising to 20 or more. Teens in the foster system are not as lucky. It is exponentially more difficult to find foster homes willing to take in a teen. Each night up to 25 foster teens enter in the Youth Welcome Center for a hot meal, a fresh change of clothes, a clean shower and safe place to sleep. There are about fifteen “regulars” at various ages between 18 and 20 that show up at the door most every night. During the day these “regulars” fend for themselves on the streets of downtown Los Angeles but return at night to the one staple thing in their lives. “We have an unlocked policy here at the Youth Welcome Center,” said Valerie Coleman-Brown, a seasoned Youth Supervisor with a gentle manner. “At any time during the night, these teens are free to leave and return. We do our best to counsel them to stay safe and inside with us. We share stories of the streets that are so truthfully bad that we hope it changes their minds about walking out the doors. Sometimes it works. Recently, we developed a detailed form and ask them to complete and sign it. The form even asks them to describe their clothing and identifying marks all in an effort to really make the teens stop and think about risk and the decisions they make.” The main room of the Youth Welcome Center is cavernous and noisy from a television that is turned up too high. Three overstuffed naugahyde couches are pushed to the side to make room for the night’s roll out of cots. I am introduced to Bryana, a foster youth with a pure innocence about her. She agrees to sit with me for an interview. I start nervously by saying that she doesn’t have to answer any of my questions that she doesn’t want to. She acknowledges softly. “How long have you been in foster care,” I ask. “Since I was 13,” Bryana answers. “And how old are you now?” “I’m 15,” she said shyly. “My son is 15 and I have a daughter that is 14,” I offer in hopes of breaking the ice. “I adopted them from the county.” Suddenly, she spoke up. “It would be a big help if more parents would come in, not just for me, but for a lot of other kids that don’t have anywhere else to go. There are kids that have been here for like five weeks."" “And how long have you been here,” I ask. “Five weeks. No school. No nothing. I’m just here waiting.” “Let me ask you,” I said. “What would be your ideal home? Who would you hope to go with?"" She paused and looked straight in my eyes and answered, “My mom.” I flush with embarrassment for asking the question. “But really,” she covers my awkwardness. “I would like any house. Any parents with brothers or sisters. It doesn’t matter to me.” “May I ask about your mom,” I ask. “How is she?” “She’s fine,” Bryanna answered and offered nothing more. “Do you have brothers or sisters?"" “I have two brothers,” she said. “They were in the foster care system when they were babies. Me too. Eventually, we all got out of foster care. But then I got put back in when I was 13.” I was at a loss of words. “Is there anything else you want to add?” “Well, DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) is really good. I’ve been here so long that now they are like my family.” As I thanked Bryanna, I was struck by her last statement. This 15 year-old taught me a lesson. She opened my eyes. For in that moment, I realized that while I was judging the facility by its cold linoleum floors and institutional florescent lighting, I was totally missing what the foster children recognize and value as the true heart of the facility. It’s not the building structure, but it is the people who work there. That heart is all of the staff that show up night after night to help and care for these kids. I pass through another doorway. I met four women whose sole job is to work the phones throughout their entire eight hour shift. They are members of the Accelerated Placement Team and each of them log thousands of calls a week. Their shared purpose is to find available foster homes and beds for the 35,000 children in the foster system of Los Angeles County. “Wow, I am impressed how dressed up everybody is here,” I say. “Does this happen all the time?” “Actually, tonight is a casual day,” says Princess Rojas with a laugh and big smile. “Whatever movie you saw with frumpy social workers,” comments Rhonda Towles, “that is definitely not our group!” “So you are here to interview for a gay newspaper,” asked Michelle Fenison. I’m surprised by the directness of the question and stumble a bit on my reply. “Um, yes. I’m writing an article for the Huffington Post Gay Voices section.” “Well good,” Marocka Covington said. “Cause we have some things we would like to say to the LGBT community.” “Ok,” I say, unsure of where this is going. Marocka starts. “We understand that many foster youth who may self-identify as LGBT or questioning, feel that they aren’t accepted in some foster families and foster homes. That’s why we want to make sure we have a good representation from every community. Even if we have a good home for a foster youth, some of these teens are asking for a match with a parent or parents that mirrors their own demographic. We have more transgender children coming forward because society is changing. That is the next challenge for us, even though we have made in-roads in the gay community, we are not yet seeing that we have yet made that progress in the transgender community.” “We need a lot of help, especially from the transgender community,” Rhonda says. “It would be nice to have more resources for our transgender youth. We want more accepting foster homes. We find that the LGBT community is more accepting of children of all kinds.” “Some people think that teens in foster care are trouble,” said Marocka. “Truth is that many times, the foster kids are not really angry at their foster parents -- they are angry at the world for their predicament. But the biggest benefit to adopting from foster care is that you have these wonderful children to will love you for the rest of your life.” “You know,” I say, “several transgender people have expressed their concerns that they fear they won’t be permitted to foster and adopt.” “Well, they need to be reminded that there is a California law that they be accepted,” Marocka says forcefully. “So please let the transgender community know that they are welcomed and we are here to bring children to them, if they want them. Because transgender and gay people can love and care for children like anyone else."" “In my experience,” Marocka continues, “over 40 years now, I’ve seen successes in all kinds of family structures. On the flip side, we have many different kinds of children that really need to know that there are parents and homes out there that will that them and care for them. I tell you, these LGBT children are not aware that there are good foster parents out there that want them. Even when these children arrive here, many aren’t sure if we are going to accept them. They are very subtle about how they want to come out to us.” “I can understand that,” I answer. “Plus, I’ve heard of many instances when foster children who are questioning their own sexuality do come out to some foster parents, it creates a lot of havoc for themselves. As a result, 40% of homeless youth in Los Angeles identify as LGBT.” The next four years will change America forever.

We feel exposed, totally flawed, and hopeless to do anything about it. Shame can be so devastating that all we want to do is hide.  And watching a friend suffer a shame experience or listening to a friend share how ashamed they feel about a failure, a broken relationship, or a terrible mistake they've made can trigger shame in us, too. That's one of the paradoxes of shame: it's contagious. The immense power of shame can make us try to ward it off by saying the wrong things.  If a friend tells you she feels ugly, don't say, ""But you're so beautiful!"" If a friend says they feel like a failure, don't tally their successes for them. If a friend shares a humiliating mistake, don't counter with all the right choices they've made. When your friends are suffering, contradicting them isn't helpful, even if you mean well. What may seem to you like being helpful can have feel like emotional bullying or obtuseness. That sort of response can come across as denying what your friends are feeling, not understanding the depth of their misery, and perhaps even not caring enough. Be warm, be sympathetic, listen, empathize, ask how you can help. Don't rush to deny what they're feeling, or turn into a mindless cheerleader. That's never the most helpful move. It's harder to experience someone's shame along with them than it is to rush to try and ""fix it"" -- but the first option is the best one. Maybe they'll want a hug, maybe not. Listening and understanding without judgment or trying to make it go away is enough.

This has struck me as odd and incongruous from the very beginning -- it would be like people who are starving and scrounging for their next meal backing Chris Christie, or Marlon Brando (in his later years). Donald Trump has nothing in common with the overwhelmed, alienated, angry and forgotten. He may have the skill to speak to them as though he is sympatico, but he isn't. He has his every need -- and whim -- attended to immediately. He is the antithesis of alienated -- he is connected to power in every aspect of his life. Forgotten? He gets attention that makes Beyonce and Caitlyn Jenner positively scream with envy. And angry? That's pure performance art. Donald Trump isn't angry. He just knows how to play into that vein of real anger many people have.  So I have been baffled from Day One why Trump has the loyalty of so many people with whom he shares nothing more than (possibly) human DNA. They love a guy who has looked down on their ilk his entire life, and will continue to once this street fair ends in either his demise or his election. The raving, unfiltered yet practiced, almost joy-filled hatred of Donald Trump is regarded as political genius and evidently in 2016, as a requirement for national leadership. The pundits who laughed him off in June and took him seriously in September and now speak of the very possible reality of nominee Trump or president Trump, keep going back to the ""touch the chord"" chorus. Well, punditry, I am white. I am older. I am overwhelmed. I feel forgotten often, and alienated even more often. And there are times I allow myself to be overcome by anger at the injustice and unfairness and despair I see in the world, and sometimes in my life. I see the millions of unemployed and underemployed older people struggling to be heard and to feel relevant. Their government may have abandoned them, but more so, the corporate world, the tech world that gives new meaning to the old 1960s phrase ""Don't trust anyone over 30"" has abandoned them, made them feel that their voices, energy, talents and wisdom don't matter. But I have never fallen prey to Trumpism. I can't understand why a multibillionaire with a 1980s backroom Wall Street vocabulary and attitude towards women and minorities is the savior of the angry and the alienated. No one can explain to me how this guy will rid his hapless and deluded followers from their alienation and anger. By marginalizing those already on the margins? That won't create jobs for the 55-year-old who had been unemployed for three years. That won't make Google or Yahoo or Amazon want to retrain tens of thousands of older people they ""sort of"" want to help but regard as something out of a museum.  Vilifying the weak and hopeless has never made society better, and has at best, only momentarily made the disaffected and alienated feel better. So what's the end game? When I am feeling overwhelmed, alienated, forgotten and angry -- and I do as an older white man who doesn't feel I am listened to or valued for the considerable talents I have -- I don't turn to an arrogant, obscene rich guy for solace. I try to improve my situation as best I can by using what skills I have, and take my solace in knowing that blaming everyone darker, less fluent in English and more estrogen-endowed than I is a pathetic way to live.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-spin-instructor-taught-me-about-my-body_b_8870738","1/1/2016","rachel brehm","5 Things My Substitute Spin Instructor Taught Me About My Body","Don't judge a blog by its title -- it's not what you think. My Wednesday morning spin class was taught by a substitute instructor today. In the place of my usual wonderful teacher was one of those drill sergeant-y types that thinks the louder the music is (and the louder he yells) the harder you will work. While it's true that the right music can evoke feeling, motivation, and inspiration -- music that loud just became noise. And the nonsense that spilled out of his mouth became even louder noise. Although his style and technique might work for many people, it did not work for me. These are the things that he said during the 50-minute class, and this is what it taught me about my body.1. What my instructor said: ""I will make you the best looking person at your holiday table,"" he bragged. (What I heard) Remember those sad days where your life goal was to be the smallest, best looking person at the holiday table? Yeah, I do. It sucked. Life was boring, rigid, and unadventurous. Be thankful that you have morphed into a more authentic person with other interests besides your body.2. What my instructor said: ""You've never met an instructor as effective at weight loss as me,"" he assured. (What I heard) You didn't show up here for me, you're here for yourself. You're here to feel strong, healthy, and because you like the way exercising makes you feel. The goal is not weight loss, and it never will be. 3. What my instructor said: ""I've lost 47 pounds from working out just like this,"" he informed. (What I heard) Don't let weight loss be a guide for your exercise, or for your life. Show up here because you want to, and move your body because it feels good. Challenge yourself with exercises that you enjoy, but remember to listen to your body. Oh and one more thing, sorry I've stolen your zen spinning experience and filled it with nonsense talk about how I can help you lose weight.4. What my instructor said: ""I'm teaching another spin class tonight at 7:30, I challenge everyone to take both classes,"" he urged. (What I heard) You're working out really hard right now. I challenge you to listen to your body, and do what makes you feel good. If you have the energy and desire to work out again later, go for it. If you feel that you need the time to rest and recover, go for it. If you have other interests or commitments like spending time with your family or doing some last minute holiday shopping, go for it. It's all about listening to your body and doing what's best for you. You do you.5. What my instructor said: ""I challenge you to think outside of the box,"" he barked. (What I heard) I know that this holiday season creates the opportunity for family gatherings, get-togethers with friends, office parties, and celebrations. Take this time to savor the traditions, memories, friendships, festivities, and delicious food. The holiday season also creates a lot of chatter about how much food we've consumed, New Year's resolutions, and dieting plans. Try to ignore the conventional aspirations that are pushed upon us by the media, by friends, and by family. Talking about weight loss resolutions and dieting is tired and passé. I challenge you to think outside of the box about what the New Year means to you. I challenge you to move the focus away from your body, and onto the things that make you happy. Although the spin instructor's intentions were to push me beyond my limit and give me a ""great"" workout that ultimately leads to weight loss, his words had the opposite effect on me. He reminded me of all the work I have done to move away from mainstream ideas about exercise, food, and weight loss. He reminded me of all the reasons why I love working out, and he reminded me that none of those reasons include weight loss. He made the absence of my regular instructor (the one who focuses on safe warmups, individual challenges, listening to your body, and preventing injuries) sorely missed -- and he taught me to drown out the noise of weight loss talk, let the blurry music take me to my zen place, and listen to my body's needs despite the loud commands.

I don't bother because they usually fall off my radar by mid January. Starting the year with failure is not my goal. Here are 25 simple things I will incorporate into my days in 2016. I don't need to do each one, everyday, to be moving toward my goal. Here's how I intend to improve myself, my life and my happiness in 2016. 1~ Not check into my email or social media before 9 a.m. 2~ Use my 5 Minute Gratitude Journal to remember the blessings in my life. Gratitude creates happiness and happiness is my goal. 3~ Focus on today. Reliving the past and anticipating the future wastes my present. 4~ Let go of my need to convince others of my opinion. 5~ Pay closer attention to my body's signals. If I feel a knot in my stomach, it means I'm making a bad choice. 6~ Stop overcommitting my time and simplify my life. 7~ Get out in nature everyday to connect with the majesty around me. 8~ Become more aware of the negative messages that creep into my self-talk, and change them. 9~ Treat myself to some pampering, self-care every day. 10~ Meditate for 20 minutes every morning to quiet the chatter in my brain. 11~ Be aware of the quality of food I put into my body. Quality is as important as quantity. 12~ Remember to thank people for their kindness. 13~ Spend less time at my computer and more time talking to loved ones. 14~ Focus on the positive things in my life. Focusing on the negative is like praying for more of it. 15~ Spend time stretching each day. The older I get the more important it is to be flexible, in both mind and body. 16~ Don't compare myself to others. 17~ Practice kindness. What goes around, comes around, and I want good karma knocking at my door. 18~ Embrace forgiveness. Remember the lessons learned, but forgiving releases negative energy I'm hanging on to. 19~ Schedule time to be silent each day. No music, TV, books or talking. Simply being quiet to hear my own thoughts. 20~ Be open to new experiences and let my life unfold without a white knuckled grasp on how I want it to be. 21~ Continue my Morning Pages, which helps empty the clutter that clogs my thoughts. 22~ Drink more water and less wine. 23~ Continue to organize and clear clutter from my life. 24~ Remember that I am enough and dump my need for approval from others. 25~ Practice non-judgement. Accept people and things as they are. How are you planning to be happier in 2016?

It's also a great time to hit ""refresh"" on the way you look at your life and the things you prioritize. This year, instead of vowing to hit the gym every day, we thought we'd make some un-resolutions and tally some of the things that we're going to cross off our list of stressors for the next year. Because, sometimes, you just need to give fewer f**ks about the things that are weighing you down. Below are 20 things we've vowed to stop giving a sh*t about in 2016. What would you add? 1. Having plans on a Friday night. After a long week, sometimes all you want to do is watch Netflix and order takeout. Own that instead of feeling guilty about it. 2. The sexual connotations of Netflix and chill. Maybe you just literally want to Netflix and chill! Watching Netflix and chilling while doing so sounds delightful! (See above.) 3. ""Putting yourself out there."" Yes, it's great to make new friends and open yourself up to new romantic connections if you're looking for them. But often the people who tell you to ""just put yourself out there!"" ignore the immense amount of effort and mental energy it takes to do that. Also, oftentimes finding new love is more about dumb luck than individual effort. 4. Watching every new TV show and listening to every hit song. There is way too much great television and music to keep up with it all. Just stick to the things that truly excite you. 5. Doing trendy workouts you don't enjoy. Hard pass on paying $45 a class to feel like death. 6. Making plans you have no interest in to catch up with people out of obligation. Ain't nobody got time for that. Instead, dedicate time and energy to nurturing the relationships you truly care about. 7. The perfect winged eyeliner. We officially give up. 8. Twitter trolls. This one is easier said than done, but often it's best to dedicate as little energy as possible to garbage humans on the Internet. 9. Getting tons of likes on Instagram. If you want to Instagram your brunch/weekend trip/view/funny sign/visiting BFF, do it because you want to, likes be damned. 10. Whether or not Hillary Clinton is ""likeable"" enough. Nope nope nope, moving along. 11. Making a big deal out of Valentine's Day. Whether you're in a relationship or not, putting too much importance on an arbitrary day as a marker of ""real"" love is more stressful than it's worth. 12. Wearing cute workout clothing. This is not meant to shame people who have and love said workout clothing. More power to you! But no one needs to feel obligated to look loungewear runway ready when heading off to gym. 13. Wearing 3-inch heels every day. If that's your style, again, you do you and rock it. But if you're putting your poor legs and feet through hell for a few extra inches, maybe don't. You'll still be just as gorgeous without the heels. 14. Finishing every book you start even when you aren't into it. Next time we get halfway through a novel and feel zero investment in the main characters, we're just gonna close it and give up. 15. Having the ""perfect"" body. You are enough, just as you are. Too much mental anguish goes into seeking an impossible standard. 16. Fake ""pasta"" made out of vegetables. Just eat the damn noodles if you want them. 17. Selfie shaming. Take and post as many fierce selfies as you want to. No one has the right to determine the images you put out there but you. 18. How your life compares to the lives of your former classmates/friends/siblings. Forget comparisons and arbitrary timelines. You do you. 19. Avoiding adding cheese in your salad. Life is short, put a little cheese on your lettuce. 20. People who don't give a sh*t about you. #BYE The next four years will change America forever.

Iowa is the first of the 'trinity' events that start the actual campaign, along with New Hampshire and South Carolina….[O]f the last six open GOP nominations, Iowa correctly picked two winners, New Hampshire four and South Carolina five. [T]he Trinity matters because it creates an early opportunity to seize momentum, demonstrate viability and garner media attention.” [HuffPost] ‘Great uncertainty’ about how the primaries will play out - More from Gaddie and Goidel: “The invisible primary has been unusually visible this election, with multiple televised debate-events feeding the public a steady stream of content….The campaign is particularly abrasive due to the combination of style and strategy. The result is a campaign environment where we are still sorting out contenders and therefore the events of the early primaries are uncertain. This is both fun from a gamesmanship standpoint, but also creates great uncertainty about how momentum and viability will be captured by the remaining contenders.” That uncertainty means primary polls still aren’t predictive - Nate Cohn: “You have undoubtedly heard that primary polls aren’t necessarily very predictive far from an election. With just a month to go until the Iowa caucuses, I’m writing to tell you that it’s still true….This phase of the race — the final stretch before Iowa and New Hampshire — can be the most volatile of the entire campaign….In recent primary campaigns, going back to the 2004 Democratic primary, those candidates who have led in Iowa or New Hampshire polls with just one month to go have lost as often as they have won. On average, candidates’ share of the vote at this stage differed from their final share of the vote by around seven percentage points. With many candidates running, it was not at all uncommon for a candidate to move by more.” [NYT] TRUMP LEADING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA, CLOSE RACE IN IOWA - Donald Trump is enjoying a lead of over 20 points in both New Hampshire and South Carolina polls. In New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Gov. Chris Christie (N.J.) are the nearest competitors, while in South Carolina Cruz, Rubio and neurosurgeon Ben Carson are in the second tier. In Iowa, Cruz holds a slight lead over Donald Trump in the HuffPost Pollster Iowa chart, averaging 30.8 percent to Trump’s 28.4 percent. Rubio is in a distant third, more than 15 points behind Trump. The close averages reflect inconsistency in the polls -- the last five polls have ranged a Cruz advantage of up to 9 points to Trump leading by 3 points.

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime). POLLSTERS SAY PUBLIC IMAGE OF POLLING HAS DECLINED - Carl Bialik: ""No votes have been cast yet in the 2016 election, but there may already be one set of losers in the campaign: pollsters’ reputations. And that’s according to the pollsters themselves. We asked people working at some of the nation’s most prominent polling outfits whether pollsters’ public image has improved or declined since the 2012 election. Of the 21 who answered, none said their public image had improved, and two-thirds said it had declined….Using a classic tactic in politics, many pollsters blamed the media….Pollsters said they shouldn’t be blamed if the media overstate the certainty of a poll’s finding about what the majority wants, or if policy makers put undue emphasis on what polls find. ‘Polls are not meant to be a blueprint for policy,’ said J. Ann Selzer of Selzer & Company, a Des Moines, Iowa, polling firm. ‘But, it is helpful to know where a majority stand — imagine a world where you did not know that.’” [538] HUFFPOST POLLSTER TWEAKS CRITERIA FOR INCLUDING POLLS IN CHARTS -- HuffPollster: “At HuffPost Pollster, we aim to be inclusive. We want to include every poll that makes an honest attempt to measure opinion in the relevant population, and we don’t discount polls solely because of the methods they use….At the same time, we agree that many pollsters are too lax in providing important details to help poll consumers assess their work. In 2010, Blumenthal wrote that Pollster would only include polls in its charts if their publicly accessible reports meet the National Council on Public Polls' ‘level 1’ disclosure requirements. For the last few years, we have accepted information via email, even when it’s not part of the pollsters’ public materials. However, we are now returning to the requirement that all of the NCPP’s minimal disclosure items must be available publicly before we will include that pollster’s polls in our charts….We will not make any changes to our procedures for the 2016 Republican and Democratic primary races at the national or state level….For the national 2016 general election, starting Jan. 1 we will only include polls from pollsters who have all of the NCPP level 1 disclosure information publicly available either on their poll releases or on their websites. Pollsters who are members of the American Association for Public Opinion Research's Transparency Initiative will be accepted without question.” [HuffPollster] MORE OF THIS WEEK'S POLLS -Most Americans think 2015 was a good year for them personally but not for the rest of the world. [YouGov] -A HuffPost/YouGov poll shows that 2015 didn’t bring an end to Americans’ economic worries. [HuffPost] -Support for religious protection varies depending on the religion in question. [AP] -A majority of Americans are okay with sacrificing civil liberties in exchange for safety. [ABC] -Partisanship deeply affects views on president Obama and terrorism. [WashPost] -Pope Francis and Donald Trump tie in second place for most admired man of 2015 behind Barack Obama. [Gallup] THIS WEEK'S 'OUTLIERS' - Links to the best of news at the intersection of polling, politics and political data: -Donald Trump's support is strongest among those who are less likely to vote in the primaries. [NYT] -Campaign lawn signs won't increase turnout, but they can potentially shift votes in a close race. [Politico] -Polls show a strong racial divide on the issue of whether college athletes should be paid. [WashPost] The next four years will change America forever.

Iowa is the first of the 'trinity' events that start the actual campaign, along with New Hampshire and South Carolina….[O]f the last six open GOP nominations, Iowa correctly picked two winners, New Hampshire four and South Carolina five. [T]he Trinity matters because it creates an early opportunity to seize momentum, demonstrate viability and garner media attention.” [HuffPost] ‘Great uncertainty’ about how the primaries will play out - More from Gaddie and Goidel: “The invisible primary has been unusually visible this election, with multiple televised debate-events feeding the public a steady stream of content….The campaign is particularly abrasive due to the combination of style and strategy. The result is a campaign environment where we are still sorting out contenders and therefore the events of the early primaries are uncertain. This is both fun from a gamesmanship standpoint, but also creates great uncertainty about how momentum and viability will be captured by the remaining contenders.” That uncertainty means primary polls still aren’t predictive - Nate Cohn: “You have undoubtedly heard that primary polls aren’t necessarily very predictive far from an election. With just a month to go until the Iowa caucuses, I’m writing to tell you that it’s still true….This phase of the race — the final stretch before Iowa and New Hampshire — can be the most volatile of the entire campaign….In recent primary campaigns, going back to the 2004 Democratic primary, those candidates who have led in Iowa or New Hampshire polls with just one month to go have lost as often as they have won. On average, candidates’ share of the vote at this stage differed from their final share of the vote by around seven percentage points. With many candidates running, it was not at all uncommon for a candidate to move by more.” [NYT] TRUMP LEADING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA, CLOSE RACE IN IOWA - Donald Trump is enjoying a lead of over 20 points in both New Hampshire and South Carolina polls. In New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Gov. Chris Christie (N.J.) are the nearest competitors, while in South Carolina Cruz, Rubio and neurosurgeon Ben Carson are in the second tier. In Iowa, Cruz holds a slight lead over Donald Trump in the HuffPost Pollster Iowa chart, averaging 30.8 percent to Trump’s 28.4 percent. Rubio is in a distant third, more than 15 points behind Trump. The close averages reflect inconsistency in the polls -- the last five polls have ranged a Cruz advantage of up to 9 points to Trump leading by 3 points.

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime). POLLSTERS SAY PUBLIC IMAGE OF POLLING HAS DECLINED - Carl Bialik: ""No votes have been cast yet in the 2016 election, but there may already be one set of losers in the campaign: pollsters’ reputations. And that’s according to the pollsters themselves. We asked people working at some of the nation’s most prominent polling outfits whether pollsters’ public image has improved or declined since the 2012 election. Of the 21 who answered, none said their public image had improved, and two-thirds said it had declined….Using a classic tactic in politics, many pollsters blamed the media….Pollsters said they shouldn’t be blamed if the media overstate the certainty of a poll’s finding about what the majority wants, or if policy makers put undue emphasis on what polls find. ‘Polls are not meant to be a blueprint for policy,’ said J. Ann Selzer of Selzer & Company, a Des Moines, Iowa, polling firm. ‘But, it is helpful to know where a majority stand — imagine a world where you did not know that.’” [538] HUFFPOST POLLSTER TWEAKS CRITERIA FOR INCLUDING POLLS IN CHARTS -- HuffPollster: “At HuffPost Pollster, we aim to be inclusive. We want to include every poll that makes an honest attempt to measure opinion in the relevant population, and we don’t discount polls solely because of the methods they use….At the same time, we agree that many pollsters are too lax in providing important details to help poll consumers assess their work. In 2010, Blumenthal wrote that Pollster would only include polls in its charts if their publicly accessible reports meet the National Council on Public Polls' ‘level 1’ disclosure requirements. For the last few years, we have accepted information via email, even when it’s not part of the pollsters’ public materials. However, we are now returning to the requirement that all of the NCPP’s minimal disclosure items must be available publicly before we will include that pollster’s polls in our charts….We will not make any changes to our procedures for the 2016 Republican and Democratic primary races at the national or state level….For the national 2016 general election, starting Jan. 1 we will only include polls from pollsters who have all of the NCPP level 1 disclosure information publicly available either on their poll releases or on their websites. Pollsters who are members of the American Association for Public Opinion Research's Transparency Initiative will be accepted without question.” [HuffPollster] MORE OF THIS WEEK'S POLLS -Most Americans think 2015 was a good year for them personally but not for the rest of the world.

[NYT] -Campaign lawn signs won't increase turnout, but they can potentially shift votes in a close race.

Not for bartenders cleaning up the sprays of joviality. Lying at the bottom of the stairs, a young woman, robbed of decency. Her bum is half-exposed. Why don't her friends help her up?What's going on here? I ask, bending down to check on her. She's awake, she gives me a look of disgust, some old guy with a grey beard is in my face. I look around for someone younger. Who is she with? I ask.A woman who looks like she must be in possession of a fake ID steps forwards. Her makeup can't hide her acne and it has a quality to it -- too many drugs with bad stuff cut into the mix. No one knows her, she says. It's 3 minutes to midnight. The DJ is playing, Don't You Want Me Baby, by the Human League. No one wants her. Is she Cinderella? F***. She won't budge, blocking the stairs. Drunks are tumbling around her. The frenzy is reaching a climax. Poppers are shooting upwards, roars cascade across the room, the DJ is counting down. I look at my exit gift for 2015. And my welcoming gift for 2016. She's crying now as the stampede to the future quickens. She's being left behind to perish on a filthy bar floor, friendless, hostile, people are saying goodbye to another year, most want to see the back of it. All I see is the back of a collapsed human sack. I have no choice. I grab her from behind and raise her like Christ raising Lazarus. Someone snaps a selfie with the drunk girl. F*** off, I yell. I won't be getting followers on Instagram. I settle her into a booth, bringing water, an ice pack for her bruised head, and the herd charges on. I go back to check on her. She's gone - like the year. The ice has melted."

And there's an unlikely source behind the spike in rapes: People the victims do not know. The researchers found that rapes reported by victims ages 17-24 increase by 28 percent on days when there are football games at Football Bowl Subdivision schools. FBS schools, previously known as D I-A schools, typically field the best teams in college football. Rape reports at FBS schools increase even more on days of home games, rising by 41 percent. The study used FBI crime data collected between 1991-2012 from 138 local and campus law enforcement agencies to compare the number of rape reports on game days to the number on non-game days. The research accounted for the number of reported rapes that usually occur on a particular day of the week or at a time of the year, which would seem to correct for much of the football season taking place during what is known as ""The Red Zone"" between the start of school and Thanksgiving, when freshman women are particularly susceptible to assault. In total, researchers were able to analyze 96 Division I football schools -- 55 of which were FBS schools and 41 of which were FCS or Football Championship Subdivision Schools, previously known as D-1AA schools. “What we really wanted to do in this study is to quantify the degree to which partying and alcohol consumption actually cause increases in reports of rape, and that’s why we decide to investigate the effects of Division I football games,"" said Jason Lindo, an associate professor of economics at Texas A&M University and one of the study's co-authors. The researchers estimate that football games could lead to as many as 770 rapes at the 128 schools that make up the FBS every year, and no fewer than 253. How far the estimate swings in either direction depends on how much you attribute the rise in reported rapes to the influx of people to the area on game day -- more people might just mean a higher chance of rape -- or to a change in behavior associated with alcohol consumption and party culture. The increase is most apparent among college-aged adults between the ages of 17 and 24. The researchers estimated that reports of college-aged offenders raping college-aged victims rose by 58 percent on the day of home games. And while there was some evidence of an increase in rape victims between the ages of 25 and 28, almost none of the victims were between the ages of 13 and 16. Lisa Maatz, vice president of government relations for the American Association Of University Women, was not as surprised by the report's top-line finding as she was by something else: The people said to be largely responsible for the rise in game-day rapes were offenders the victims did not know. Researchers found that reported rapes involving an offender the victim didn’t know increased by 61 percent on home game days and by 29 percent during away games. By contrast, reported rapes involving an offender the victim did know rose by 28 percent during home games and by a statistically insignificant amount during away games. Those numbers represent a startling spike in rapes by unknown offenders, since previous studies have shown that as many as 9 in 10 college-aged women victims know the person who assaulted them. This less-common type of rape seems much more prevalent on game days. Researchers pointed to other signs that the increased rapes are tied directly to college football culture. Games against school rivals or prominent football programs seemed to lead to a steep rise in reported rapes, as did upset victories (notably, schools did not experience a significant rise in reported rapes when the opponent won in an upset). And while away games that were televised appeared to lead to a much smaller but still notable rise in reported rapes, this was not true of games that were not televised. The effects were also felt much less at FCS schools, where football is a less prominent aspect of university life. There, home games appeared to lead to a 31 percent increase in reported rapes and away games had no effect. Division II and Division III games appeared to have no effect whatsoever on the number of reported rapes. The next four years will change America forever.

The metallic eyeshadow that brightened up your orbs has crept down to your cheeks, and the shimmering nail art you painted on at the last minute is still holding on for dear life. (Signs of a rockin' good time, right?) But how will you get the glitter off when you have to be at work (or meet up with family and friends)? Don't stress: We have simple tricks to wipe away all that shimmer from Make Up For Ever Pro Artist Lijha Stewart and celebrity manicurist Kimmie Kyees. EYES, LIPS & BODYUse a gentle eye makeup remover like Sens'Eyes to remove waterproof and highly-pigmented products without ending up with greasy residue. Be careful not to rub your eyes or lips aggressively -- it will cause more redness and can actually push glitter into the eyes and mouth. Start by saturating a cotton pad with your makeup remover, place on top of the eye area and lips, then gently wipe off product in small circular motions. To remove any remaining glitter, wash your face using a foaming face wash and a warm wash cloth. Instead of scrubbing with a face wipe, which can increase redness and irritation, try an oil-based makeup remover. This will emulsify all makeup and leave your skin soft. NAILSThe best way to get glitter nail polish off is to use a cotton pad wet with pure acetone. Wipe the nail until the polish loosens, then dab the nail with the cotton and leave to soak. Continue on to the rest of the nails, changing cotton pads when necessary. When you return to the first nail you left ""wet"" with polish remover, the product would have broken down the glitter so that it is easy to wipe off. To care for nails after the glitter is removed, use a soft buffer file to smooth and always apply cuticle oil to replenish the skin and nails from the acetone (as the formula can weaken and dehydrate nails over time).

The metallic eyeshadow that brightened up your orbs has crept down to your cheeks, and the shimmering nail art you painted on at the last minute is still holding on for dear life. (Signs of a rockin' good time, right?) But how will you get the glitter off when you have to be at work (or meet up with family and friends)? Don't stress: We have simple tricks to wipe away all that shimmer from Make Up For Ever Pro Artist Lijha Stewart and celebrity manicurist Kimmie Kyees. EYES, LIPS & BODYUse a gentle eye makeup remover like Sens'Eyes to remove waterproof and highly-pigmented products without ending up with greasy residue. Be careful not to rub your eyes or lips aggressively -- it will cause more redness and can actually push glitter into the eyes and mouth. Start by saturating a cotton pad with your makeup remover, place on top of the eye area and lips, then gently wipe off product in small circular motions.

Our hope is that by telling their stories, we'll bring you closer to blended family bliss in your own life! Want to share your story? Email us at divorce@huffingtonpost.com. Katie Nemer and her son's stepmom, Julie Cox, blog about raising their blended family at Adventures In Co-Parenting. Besides being writing partners, they're very close friends, though both admit that forging that friendship didn't happen overnight. Below, the two moms share how they grew to be parenting partners for the sake of Katie's son (and Julie's stepson) Jackson. Hi Katie and Julie. Please introduce us to your family. Katie: I have a family of five: there's me, my husband Josh, Jackson (13), Zoe (5) and Preston (3). Julie: There are five of us in the Cox family: me, my husband JT and our three busy boys: Jackson (13), Declan (5) and Beckett (3). Julie, when did you come into JT and Jackson’s life? JT and I have been together for eight years, married for six. When we were introduced by mutual friends, I was very impressed with his dedication to Jackson -- his cute-single-dad status was definitely part of the initial attraction. Tell us a little bit about your co-parenting relationship and how it evolved. Katie: Not too long after JT and Julie first started dating, she called me up a week before school started and announced that she had gone school supply shopping with Jackson and gotten everything on his class list: the backpack, crayons, all of it. It’s a moment in time I will likely never forget; I couldn’t tell if I was totally pissed off that she had stepped on my toes by doing this with him and not asking me if I wanted to take him, or completely relieved that the school supply shopping was done and off my to-do list. I realized this was my opportunity to define our relationship: Either she would be ‘that woman’ who just stepped in and bought my son a backpack or she could be my new best friend, hand-delivered by the mom fairies to help me manage my complicated life. It was a very instinctive choice and I’ve never looked back. Julie: I don’t know the exact statistics, but I’m pretty sure there aren’t many people who are friends with someone who procreated with their spouse. And we’re not talking just smile-and-wave kind of friends here. We’re talking first-call-when-in-labor and dance-at-each-other’s-weddings kind of friends. To be honest, though, it wasn’t always this way. Initially, I was extremely intimidated by Katie. She had had a baby with my husband and it took a lot for me to not think about that every time we saw each other. Eventually though, after confronting my insecurities and realizing that this had the potential to be a very real and positive friendship, we have grown it into something we are very proud of and have come to count on. What are some of the biggest challenges of blended family life?Katie: A huge challenge that comes with co-parenting is accepting that sometimes your child is not with you. We have literally bartered out holidays at times (""You can have him for Easter because we had him for Christmas""). And even though I have been doing this for years, there are times I forget what weekend Jackson is with his Dad and Julie, and inadvertently attend a family event without him. It’s difficult knowing I am disappointing people who want to see him. I contemplated bringing a Jackson blow up doll to Thanksgiving once, but I figured Great Grandma H. would see through it. Julie: Co-parenting is a tough lesson in sharing for all of us, but especially for Jackson’s adoring little brothers. They have a hard time accepting when it’s not our “turn” to have Jackson for the week. Sometimes they just cry for their “big brudder” and my heart breaks for them. That being said, I’m pretty sure they are catching on that this is a soft spot of mine, because one of my 3-year-old’s recent crying fits was immediately followed up by a request for ice cream to help him not be sad any more. What's the best thing about being part of a blended family? What makes you proudest of your family?Katie: I always have the “Jackson board of directors” to run issues and big decisions by. And JT and Julie are super nerdy and make spreadsheets for everything, which is actually really helpful. I’m extremely proud of the fact that we have never once needed an attorney or mediator. We have always worked it out ourselves. Julie: I’m not going to lie, I love the shock value that comes along with telling people how well the four of us co-parents get along. Co-parents are so often painted as natural enemies, whereas really the opposite can be and should be true. What advice do you have for other bio-parents and stepparents who just can't seem to get along? Katie: Co-parenting is challenging but extremely rewarding, and anyone can do it. It has to be a conscious decision made by the adults to put the wants and needs of the kids before their own and let go of the past. Also do simple things like buy each other birthday cards or just say a kind word to show you still respect each other as people. Small but meaningful gestures like these truly can add peace to the chaos. Julie: Bad things may have happened to drive you apart, and those bad things may have led to bad blood. No matter what, though, you will always have one thing in common: love for your shared child(ren). If you are committed to being an active part of your child’s life, then you have to commit to being a part of the co-parent’s life. There is no way around this. As we’ve found, co-parenting isn’t always easy, but loving your kids is. What's your divorce or co-parenting-related New Year's resolution? Katie: I am notoriously a bit territorial. In 2016, I would like to promise my extremely intelligent, amazing son Jackson that I will be better about not making a huge fuss about him keeping his new fleece (or whatever) at our house. If he can’t take it with him, it won’t feel like his and I respect that. (In my defense, their house eats snow boots. But it’s OK because of the year our house ""swallowed"" all of Jackson’s pants.) Julie: Communicating with a teenager can sometimes be difficult. One-word answers, often coupled with an eye roll, seem to be Jackson's go-to responses to, well, everything. My co-parenting New Year’s resolution is to continue to work on my relationship with my stepson, even if it involves patiently dealing with his teenage communication walls. As a high school teacher, I cringe internally every time a student says negative things about a stepparent. I can't help but worry: Jackson will never say these things about me, right? Jackson and I share a lot of interests so there's a lot we can talk about. He is so important to me and I want to make sure he knows that, even if I get a couple of eye rolls in the process.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wall-street-lobbying-washington_n_6110c886e4b0ed63e6574b8e","1/1/2016","zachary d. carter","Wall Street Got Burned In Washington This Year, For Once","So, that happened. It was a tough year to be a bank lobbyist in the nation's capital. Wall Street's biggest banks worked both houses of Congress, the Obama administration and five independent regulatory agencies, all to come away at year's end with approximately … nothing. An interest group accustomed to playing on offense was, at times, forced into defensive mode, protecting its turf with only modest success. Listen to HuffPost's analysis of the yearlong struggle over economic policy in this week's ""So, That Happened"" podcast. The fun starts at 21:54. Banks started the year with a long Washington wish list. They wanted to tie up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with reams of red tape. They wanted to charge high hidden fees on auto loans -- a practice that disproportionately hits the pocketbooks of people of color. They wanted to poke a big hole in the Volcker Rule, which bans banks from placing speculative securities bets with taxpayer-backed money. They wanted to let banks with assets measured in 12 figures operate with thinner capital cushions and larger amounts of risky borrowed money. They wanted to kill a new rule that would require financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients (amazingly, this is not already the law). The banks lost every one of these fights. Wall Street usually wins in Washington. The bank lobby closed out 2014 by securing subsidies for risky derivatives trading and a long delay in the implementation of the Volcker Rule. And indeed, this year's setbacks may be the inevitable result of too much winning the year before. But part of the larger problem for bank advocates is the new style of governance imposed by the Republican Congress: Lawmakers just don't pass many bills anymore. The bank lobby -- which had a history of generous campaign contributions to Democrats prior to the 2010 passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law -- can no longer rely on simply getting legislation passed and seeing it signed into law. And even if Congress did pass a straightforward bill curbing Dodd-Frank, President Barack Obama would almost certainly veto it. Instead, banks now have to hope that their pet projects get included in the year-end funding bill for the federal government. Obama has repeatedly warned lawmakers against approving spending bills that include major regulatory rollbacks. For bank lobbyists to succeed, they have to convince Republican leaders that their pet projects are worth risking a government shutdown, which the public would almost certainly blame on the GOP. As a result, lobbyists have to pursue bizarre, multi-stage strategies designed to give Republican leaders the ability to promise that bank handouts are, in fact, uncontroversial, bipartisan measures. These schemes begin with the introduction of the bill -- will any finance-friendly Democrats sign on as co-sponsors? -- and proceed to the committee level. House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has blocked most efforts to defang Dodd-Frank. But if a dozen bills are moving at the same time, each with a token Democrat or two in support, then Waters has to pick her battles. Something almost inevitably slips through. The bill then hits the House floor, where Republicans attempt to churn up Democratic votes. If enough Democrats flip, then GOP leaders can point to those votes as evidence that the measure belongs in a bipartisan year-end funding bill. That's exactly what happened in 2014 with subsidies for derivatives trades. When Waters and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) led the charge against the policy, then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) noted that over 90 Democrats had previously supported the measure on the House floor. Surely it couldn't be that bad. Most members of Congress -- Republican and Democrat alike -- don't have a strong grasp of financial policy. It's hard to know whether a favor requested by a bank lobbyist is a genuine technical correction or a cold-blooded attempt to swindle consumers. If a few otherwise progressive Democrats approve of a bill and Warren doesn't cry foul, then plenty of Democrats will be willing to get the lobbyists off their backs by voting in favor. And there are a few dozen House Democrats who will back bank lobbyists even when Warren draws a line in the sand. In November, 88 Democrats, including DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), voted in favor of a bill that would help auto dealers charge higher loan rates to black, Latino and Asian customers. It was the sort of thing that lobbyists had hoped might make it into the year-end spending package, but the passage of the bill prompted an uproar among activists online, and the provision never made it into the broader legislation. But while it's rare for bank lobbyists to lose all the battles they pick on Capitol Hill, it's still more unheard of for the industry to take fire the way it did this year. When lawmakers were examining a long-term highway bill, trying to figure out how to get it passed, they noticed a proposal from the Congressional Progressive Caucus to nix $17 billion in payments that the Federal Reserve makes to banks. The practice is a holdover from the early days of the central banking system, but now essentially functions as a thank-you to banks just being banks. Suddenly, bank lobbyists weren't trying to get deregulatory favors; they were trying to preserve a straightforward subsidy that was on the chopping block. This was a product of the bank lobby's partisan drift toward the GOP. Republicans are anti-regulation and anti-tax. Banks are into that stuff. But when the broader business lobby really wants the government to pay for something -- like, say, decent highways to ship goods over -- Republicans steadfastly refuse to pay for the maneuvers with tax increases of any kind. As a result, silly items like billions of dollars in free money for banks start to look like appealing targets. Banks didn't take the full $17 billion hit. Through aggressive lobbying, they were able to nudge it down to $7 billion. It could have been worse, but bank lobbyists didn't see it as a win. In retaliation, lobbyists for one bank scaled back a traditionally high-end holiday party they throw for members of Congress and key staffers, downgrading the culinary offerings to mini hot dogs and hamburgers.

Somewhere, in an alternate universe's version of 2015, Jeb Bush probably really is dominating the race for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. In our 2015, however, the long shadow over the pre-primary period has been cast by reality television mogul and sun-stained Velveeta loaf Donald Trump. Now with a few precious weeks remaining before the first caucus votes are cast, the GOP establishment is unsure where it was that they went wrong. To listen to the old guard try to cope with Trump, you'd think that everyone was suffering from hallucinations. But what if what Trump's actually done is revealed the true face of the GOP base to the party that had always imagined they could keep it tamed? And is this a dark cloud or a silver lining in disguise? Writer and podcast host Ana Marie Cox joins us in a special two-part podcast recording that continues at her show, ""The Brouhaha."" Meanwhile, at the end of the year, we take stock in how well Congress did in finishing all their work for the year, and in news that will surprise nobody, it turns out that the Senate has once again left a large number of judicial vacancies unfilled.

Somewhere, in an alternate universe's version of 2015, Jeb Bush probably really is dominating the race for the Republican Party's presidential nomination. In our 2015, however, the long shadow over the pre-primary period has been cast by reality television mogul and sun-stained Velveeta loaf Donald Trump. Now with a few precious weeks remaining before the first caucus votes are cast, the GOP establishment is unsure where it was that they went wrong. To listen to the old guard try to cope with Trump, you'd think that everyone was suffering from hallucinations. But what if what Trump's actually done is revealed the true face of the GOP base to the party that had always imagined they could keep it tamed? And is this a dark cloud or a silver lining in disguise? Writer and podcast host Ana Marie Cox joins us in a special two-part podcast recording that continues at her show, ""The Brouhaha."" Meanwhile, at the end of the year, we take stock in how well Congress did in finishing all their work for the year, and in news that will surprise nobody, it turns out that the Senate has once again left a large number of judicial vacancies unfilled. But this year, it's the lack of a congressional authorization to make war on ISIS that reveals the true depths of your congresscritters' cowardice. Finally, was there really any good news this year?

It was a tough year to be a bank lobbyist in the nation's capital. Wall Street's biggest banks worked both houses of Congress, the Obama administration and five independent regulatory agencies, all to come away at year's end with approximately … nothing. An interest group accustomed to playing on offense was, at times, forced into defensive mode, protecting its turf with only modest success. Listen to HuffPost's analysis of the yearlong struggle over economic policy in this week's ""So, That Happened"" podcast. The fun starts at 21:54. Banks started the year with a long Washington wish list. They wanted to tie up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with reams of red tape. They wanted to charge high hidden fees on auto loans -- a practice that disproportionately hits the pocketbooks of people of color. They wanted to poke a big hole in the Volcker Rule, which bans banks from placing speculative securities bets with taxpayer-backed money. They wanted to let banks with assets measured in 12 figures operate with thinner capital cushions and larger amounts of risky borrowed money. They wanted to kill a new rule that would require financial advisers to act in the best interests of their clients (amazingly, this is not already the law). The banks lost every one of these fights. Wall Street usually wins in Washington. The bank lobby closed out 2014 by securing subsidies for risky derivatives trading and a long delay in the implementation of the Volcker Rule. And indeed, this year's setbacks may be the inevitable result of too much winning the year before. But part of the larger problem for bank advocates is the new style of governance imposed by the Republican Congress: Lawmakers just don't pass many bills anymore. The bank lobby -- which had a history of generous campaign contributions to Democrats prior to the 2010 passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law -- can no longer rely on simply getting legislation passed and seeing it signed into law. And even if Congress did pass a straightforward bill curbing Dodd-Frank, President Barack Obama would almost certainly veto it. Instead, banks now have to hope that their pet projects get included in the year-end funding bill for the federal government. Obama has repeatedly warned lawmakers against approving spending bills that include major regulatory rollbacks. For bank lobbyists to succeed, they have to convince Republican leaders that their pet projects are worth risking a government shutdown, which the public would almost certainly blame on the GOP. As a result, lobbyists have to pursue bizarre, multi-stage strategies designed to give Republican leaders the ability to promise that bank handouts are, in fact, uncontroversial, bipartisan measures. These schemes begin with the introduction of the bill -- will any finance-friendly Democrats sign on as co-sponsors? -- and proceed to the committee level. House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) has blocked most efforts to defang Dodd-Frank. But if a dozen bills are moving at the same time, each with a token Democrat or two in support, then Waters has to pick her battles. Something almost inevitably slips through. The bill then hits the House floor, where Republicans attempt to churn up Democratic votes. If enough Democrats flip, then GOP leaders can point to those votes as evidence that the measure belongs in a bipartisan year-end funding bill. That's exactly what happened in 2014 with subsidies for derivatives trades. When Waters and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) led the charge against the policy, then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) noted that over 90 Democrats had previously supported the measure on the House floor. Surely it couldn't be that bad. Most members of Congress -- Republican and Democrat alike -- don't have a strong grasp of financial policy. It's hard to know whether a favor requested by a bank lobbyist is a genuine technical correction or a cold-blooded attempt to swindle consumers. If a few otherwise progressive Democrats approve of a bill and Warren doesn't cry foul, then plenty of Democrats will be willing to get the lobbyists off their backs by voting in favor. And there are a few dozen House Democrats who will back bank lobbyists even when Warren draws a line in the sand. In November, 88 Democrats, including DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), voted in favor of a bill that would help auto dealers charge higher loan rates to black, Latino and Asian customers. It was the sort of thing that lobbyists had hoped might make it into the year-end spending package, but the passage of the bill prompted an uproar among activists online, and the provision never made it into the broader legislation. But while it's rare for bank lobbyists to lose all the battles they pick on Capitol Hill, it's still more unheard of for the industry to take fire the way it did this year. When lawmakers were examining a long-term highway bill, trying to figure out how to get it passed, they noticed a proposal from the Congressional Progressive Caucus to nix $17 billion in payments that the Federal Reserve makes to banks. The practice is a holdover from the early days of the central banking system, but now essentially functions as a thank-you to banks just being banks. Suddenly, bank lobbyists weren't trying to get deregulatory favors; they were trying to preserve a straightforward subsidy that was on the chopping block. This was a product of the bank lobby's partisan drift toward the GOP. Republicans are anti-regulation and anti-tax. Banks are into that stuff. But when the broader business lobby really wants the government to pay for something -- like, say, decent highways to ship goods over -- Republicans steadfastly refuse to pay for the maneuvers with tax increases of any kind. As a result, silly items like billions of dollars in free money for banks start to look like appealing targets. Banks didn't take the full $17 billion hit. Through aggressive lobbying, they were able to nudge it down to $7 billion. It could have been worse, but bank lobbyists didn't see it as a win. In retaliation, lobbyists for one bank scaled back a traditionally high-end holiday party they throw for members of Congress and key staffers, downgrading the culinary offerings to mini hot dogs and hamburgers.

There was a main road in this town, and off to one side of it, a fenced-off bare lot. Walking past, one would notice slow changes in the lot: the digging of a foundation, laying in of beams, the start of a building. But only one person was ever there, a sunburned guy in muddy clothes who was always lugging supplies, or operating a heavy machine, or pushing a full wheelbarrow. This went on for a couple years, until one day there appeared, as if from nowhere, a complete, fairly large building, in glass, steel, and brick, adorned with beautiful carved wooden details. On the day it opened, we filed in, gawping at this apparition of a building. Inside were an atrium, and a balcony, and a second floor divided into studios. It turned out it was a new arts center, and that one guy we'd been seeing all that time had built it single-handed. Every day we'd seen him out there, he had patiently been building his building. He'd even carved the wooden details, and sanded and varnished them, and fitted them into place. It was both a gift to the local arts scene, and a solitary work of passion. Naturally, I wanted to talk with him about his project. So I made my way over and started chatting. He told me about it alright - and told me and told me. He couldn't stop running his mouth. He spoke in a tone both demanding and whiny, without a single space for a listener to reply. His gaze was intense but wandering, like a frightened and angry bird. Now it would fix on you, now on something else, now on nothing at all. He stood slightly too close to you, and leaned forward at the waist. It was a stressful and exhausting experience, spending even ten or fifteen minutes talking with this lone builder. I don't know his name. I don't know the name of his building, or its address. If I went back to the town, I would remember how to walk you there, and we could go in, and maybe still find him around the place. My encounter with this man made a lasting impression on me. In hindsight, I had the feeling that what I had encountered was greatness. I felt I had gotten a first-hand impression of the nature and price of greatness. I learned that greatness, at least this form of it, consisted in some way in going out, stubbornly and alone, every single day, for years and years, and continuing with a project plotted out in the misty past, and simply doing the work until the work was done. That this single-minded intensity of purpose, animating every part of a life, carries with it a terrible cost: that you lose, to some extent, your ability to be at ease with your fellow man, or even to communicate with him. That it makes you wild, and not wild in some romantic, feathered-hair sense, but wild in its harshest aspect: hard-bitten, terrified, cruel, ravenous. I have encountered this bare human voltage only a few times in my life. Having come near to it once, it is not hard to recognize when it comes by again. In 2005, I was preparing to move to New York. I made one of my periodic visits to the city, and I was drawing at the Met, as one will. Another artist was drawing nearby, so I went over to him and explained I would soon be moving to New York, and wondered where one goes for life drawing in the city. He said, ""Oh, Spring Studio of course."" Spring Studio between workshops So when I got to New York in the summer of 2006, I went to Spring Studio. It was a life-drawing workshop in the basement of a Soho building, its low arched ceiling oozing and rotten, walls lined with bookshelves, charcoal-smudged chairs and tables ringed around a raised model stand, and tucked in back among a heap of papers and desk lamps and electronic odds and ends, the appropriately-named mistress of the place: Minerva. Minerva at her desk Life drawing is the practice, often done in uninstructed workshops open to anyone who wishes to pay for the session, of drawing from a nude model. I have done this about twice a week since 1998. I have been to life drawing workshops in Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, and any number of lesser cities. I have spoken with models and artists about the workshops in England, France, Italy, and points east. So far as I can tell, there is no institution anywhere quite like Spring Studio. Spring Studio runs three times a day, so that one might draw from morning to night every day of the week, if one were so disposed. It has a varied and professional cast of models, a quiet and studious atmosphere, no music, no drinks, good lighting, and a clockwork system of pose lengths and protocols. The attitude toward models is respectful and appreciative, and the attitude between artists is, by and large, amicable. Anyone who has experience with life drawing will understand that to have all these elements in the same place at the same time is virtually unheard of, let alone for 11 hours a day, every day, for years on end. Spring Studio does not make economic, logistical, or cultural sense. It earns almost no money. It is hair-raisingly difficult to schedule and to maintain in Manhattan. It is devoted to a practice disfavored in the general art world, and against the grain of a fast gratification culture. It only exists, and can only exist, because it is the life work of one passionate human being - Minerva Durham. As I began attending Spring Studio regularly, I got to know Minerva. She is, as one might expect, an unusual individual. At that time, she had a volatile personality: warm and welcoming, with a flipside of fury. I enjoyed being in her good graces, but lived in constant fear of somehow crossing her. She is in her late seventies now, and perhaps less volatile - more resigned to the inevitability of disappointment, more universal in her goodwill. It is impossible to complete a conversation with Minerva. Her conversation is like the meandering and deadly story which Hermes tells to Argus: you ask her one simple thing, and half an hour later find yourself still standing there, listening to random and only vaguely connected anecdotes, having forgotten the question, or whether it has been answered. Minerva Durham Many artists do not understand or appreciate models. Minerva sets a tone which has percolated outward amongst New York's figurative community: that models are to be respected, their safety assured, their rights honored, their work appreciated - that it is a privilege, easily revoked, to work with them. She has no illusions about models, understanding that modeling attracts a disproportionate share of flakes and neurotics. They are, however, her flakes and neurotics, and she is fiercely protective of them. Her concept of art and its making includes artist, model, knowledge, practice, and medium; she sees them as components of a complete system leading to the creation of the work, and she does not privilege any one part in her interaction with the system overall. Her dedication is to art, and she is ruthless about quality in the materials that go into its making. I have had occasion recently to speak about those lonely titans who carried figurative art on their backs across the long winter of the Contemporary years. Minerva Durham is one of those titans. She began close to the mainstream of the art world, and soon diverged from it, ruefully but permanently. She makes beautiful charcoal and pastel drawings, which are not shown, and she is temperamentally disinclined to give a damn about showing her work. Her calling, she has discovered over time, is as an educator and a Johnny Appleseed. This she does with unfailing vigor and good cheer. She has run Spring Studio since founding it in 1992. Minerva Durham, Banana Still Life 1, pastel and/or charcoal on paper, dimensions and date unknown She comes from a middle-class background, and her dealings with artists are predominantly with people of similar background. But she has forsaken comfort, and those closest to her have often been the poor and the desperate. This is no easy way to live. Her life is rigorously self-defined, and she prefers making her own choices and living with the consequences, over reaping the benefits of following society at large. She is cantankerous, eccentric, and impossible. If there is a more difficult way to do something, she'll find it. There is no physical thing she is capable of taking care of: not her body, her workplace, her artwork, or her possessions. She has a distracted smile which just barely conceals the steely truth, which is that she is consumed by an idea. She has been the happy servant of her idea these many decades, and the idea still possesses and consumes her, so that the idea is close to her, and everything outside its radius is dim for her, and seen uncertainly at best. Minerva, like my anonymous builder, is great. She has done one thing, consistently and energetically, a tiny bit of it every day, until she has created a mighty work. She has paid a high price for it: she lives with little safety net, and though she is far from alone, she depends on the ongoing affinity of the passionate for one another, a taxing and unstable way to live. Greatness makes life much harder than it needs to be, and it is no guarantor of happiness. In fact, it offers only itself: greatness. And this nearly inhuman quality is more precious, in my estimation, than almost anything. Therefore I think we ought to celebrate great people - if they combine goodness with their greatness - when we have the luck to cross paths with them. So much for Minerva. Minerva Durham, Amy Chaitlin, pastel on paper, dimensions and date unknown Now, to explain the title of this piece. After many years in the seeping (and, in summertime, fairly stinky) basement of whatever restaurant happens to occupy the ground floor of 64 Spring Street at any given time, the landlords have finally bowed to the financial temptations of Soho square footage and given Minerva and her little circus the boot. This has been not unlike the ending of ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" with much nostalgia and sorrow and tears and shuffling off of the fresh-made exiles. Kuan Ling Tsai, one of the many great models who has graced Spring over the years, flew back from Taiwan to model for the last session ever in the old space. Also, there was the hideous chore of sorting, giving away, throwing out, or boxing up a seemingly bottomless mess of books, sketchpads, pencils, file cabinets, wood horses, plaster casts, wax fruits, human bones, and so forth. I may have happened to miss most of this bit. part of the problem Old Spring Studio lived its time, and came to the end, and died. Not long after Minerva got the news, she was fixed up with a new space nearby, at 293 Broome Street. The great work continues with the first drawing session on January 3rd, and an opening reception today, the first day of the new year, from 2 to 8 p.m. It's not called Spring Studio anymore. It's called Minerva's Interim Drawing Studio. But that wouldn't have made as good a title for the piece. I have spent many happy hours at Spring Studio. The drawings I drew there progressed from highly variable to reliably pretty good. I made my transition there from an advanced student to a professional artist. I met many friends and several muses in the confines of 64 Spring St., and formed many thoughts, on art, on people, and on life, as my verbal brain wandered while my eye spoke to my hand. When one is very young, no specific thing seems like the thing which will form the substance of one's life. And yet specific things keep happening, and one looks back and finds that they were indeed the things one lived. Spring Studio was one of the things I lived, in all the grime of its surfaces, and dazzlement of its soul. I do not regret a minute of it. It has been an invisible institution of New York City, one of the hidden gems which makes the city great, and I have been lucky to live here in the time of its existence. I wish it many more years of creation.

The transition to the new year was marked by the descent of the traditional lighted crystal ball from atop a skyscraper amid fireworks and showers of confetti at the center of the famed Manhattan crossroads, the climax of an annual rite of winter dating back to 1904. With memories of the deadly attacks in Paris and California still fresh, police took extraordinary measures to ensure security at a gathering that has come to define the New York experience for many visitors to the largest U.S. city. But the event, broadcast live on national television, went off without a hint of trouble, as a festive mood prevailed despite - or perhaps because of - the heavy police presence. ""This is the center of the world on New Year's Eve,"" said Rick Milley, 60, who traveled from Boston with his wife, Debbie, 59, to ring in the new year in Times Square. ""This was on our bucket list,"" Debbie Milley said as the couple took pictures of themselves using a selfie stick. The pair have spent the holiday in New York before but never before in Times Square, a year-round tourist draw, filled with chain stores, family restaurants and flashy advertising displays. About 6,000 uniformed and undercover police officers, 500 more than last year, patrolled the area, with the force bolstered by mounted patrols, bomb-sniffing dogs, radiation detectors and hundreds of surveillance cameras. For the first time on a New Year's Eve, the city deployed its new Critical Response Command, which includes more heavily armed officers. The unit is trained to detect and respond to attacks, such those in Paris that killed 130 people on Nov. 13, or the rampage in San Bernardino, California, in which 14 were slain. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security ranked the Times Square celebration as a level-2 concern on its five-point scale of security risks for major public events, a designation one step below the top-rated level-1 classification given Friday's upcoming Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California. About 700,000 people are expected to turn out for the 127th Rose Parade. PENNED IN FOR THE PARTY The famous New Year's Eve ball, which is 12 feet (3.6 meters) in diameter and weighs nearly 6 tons, descended on a pole mounted on top of One Times Square, a narrow wedge of a building along 42nd Street at the southern end of the square. Mayor Bill de Blasio pushed the button that began the descent, leading to the 60-second countdown to midnight, when a giant illuminated ""2016"" sign flashed on, signaling the beginning of the new year. Crowds began assembling in Times Square hours before the official start of the festivities at 6 p.m. Thursday (2300 GMT), organized into neat pens formed by police barricades stretched for many blocks up Seventh Avenue and Broadway north of One Times Square. From a vantage point about 20 floors above, the revelers appeared to be tucked neatly into block-long honeycombs encircled by uniformed officers and support workers dressed in bright red coveralls. Cheers reverberated through the area as images from the entertainment stages played on a giant screen mounted on the building just below the pole supporting the crystal ball. On occasion, fireworks exploded above, sending flashes of light and wafts of smoke through the square. ""I always wanted to come here, but never took the chance,"" said James Gomez, 39, of New Haven, Connecticut, as he surveyed the area with friends looking for a prime viewing spot. Gomez came to Times Square even though he said he was concerned about the area being targeted in an attack. ""I'm scared,"" he said. In the hours before midnight, musical artists such as Carrie Underwood and Jessie J performed on stages set up in the area. More than 100 million Americans and 1 billion people worldwide were expected to watch the festivities on television. In Rochester, New York, a 25-year-old man accused of planning to attack a restaurant on New Year's Eve was arrested on Wednesday and charged with attempting to provide support to Islamic State, the U.S. Justice Department said. Afterwards, Rochester, about 330 miles (530 km) northwest of New York City, canceled its New Year's Eve fireworks display.

Before entering Times Square, visitors were required to pass through tight security checkpoints, with police stopping anyone from carrying backpacks and large bags while searching smaller bags and scanning people with metal detectors. The tradition of gathering in Times Square to celebrate the new year began in 1904, according to the Times Square Alliance, the area's business-development association. That was the year that the New York Times opened a new headquarters building at One Times Square and the city officially renamed the square after the newspaper.

The pair have spent the holiday in New York before but never before in Times Square, a year-round tourist draw, filled with chain stores, family restaurants and flashy advertising displays. About 6,000 uniformed and undercover police officers, 500 more than last year, patrolled the area, with the force bolstered by mounted patrols, bomb-sniffing dogs, radiation detectors and hundreds of surveillance cameras. For the first time on a New Year's Eve, the city deployed its new Critical Response Command, which includes more heavily armed officers. The unit is trained to detect and respond to attacks, such those in Paris that killed 130 people on Nov. 13, or the rampage in San Bernardino, California, in which 14 were slain. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security ranked the Times Square celebration as a level-2 concern on its five-point scale of security risks for major public events, a designation one step below the top-rated level-1 classification given Friday's upcoming Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California. About 700,000 people are expected to turn out for the 127th Rose Parade. PENNED IN FOR THE PARTY The famous New Year's Eve ball, which is 12 feet (3.6 meters) in diameter and weighs nearly 6 tons, descended on a pole mounted on top of One Times Square, a narrow wedge of a building along 42nd Street at the southern end of the square. Mayor Bill de Blasio pushed the button that began the descent, leading to the 60-second countdown to midnight, when a giant illuminated ""2016"" sign flashed on, signaling the beginning of the new year. Crowds began assembling in Times Square hours before the official start of the festivities at 6 p.m. Thursday (2300 GMT), organized into neat pens formed by police barricades stretched for many blocks up Seventh Avenue and Broadway north of One Times Square. From a vantage point about 20 floors above, the revelers appeared to be tucked neatly into block-long honeycombs encircled by uniformed officers and support workers dressed in bright red coveralls. Cheers reverberated through the area as images from the entertainment stages played on a giant screen mounted on the building just below the pole supporting the crystal ball. On occasion, fireworks exploded above, sending flashes of light and wafts of smoke through the square. ""I always wanted to come here, but never took the chance,"" said James Gomez, 39, of New Haven, Connecticut, as he surveyed the area with friends looking for a prime viewing spot. Gomez came to Times Square even though he said he was concerned about the area being targeted in an attack. ""I'm scared,"" he said. In the hours before midnight, musical artists such as Carrie Underwood and Jessie J performed on stages set up in the area. More than 100 million Americans and 1 billion people worldwide were expected to watch the festivities on television. In Rochester, New York, a 25-year-old man accused of planning to attack a restaurant on New Year's Eve was arrested on Wednesday and charged with attempting to provide support to Islamic State, the U.S. Justice Department said. Afterwards, Rochester, about 330 miles (530 km) northwest of New York City, canceled its New Year's Eve fireworks display.

Before entering Times Square, visitors were required to pass through tight security checkpoints, with police stopping anyone from carrying backpacks and large bags while searching smaller bags and scanning people with metal detectors. The tradition of gathering in Times Square to celebrate the new year began in 1904, according to the Times Square Alliance, the area's business-development association. That was the year that the New York Times opened a new headquarters building at One Times Square and the city officially renamed the square after the newspaper.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sport-and-society-for-are_b_8901790","12/31/2015","richard crepeau","Sport and Society for Arete-'Concussion' Movie Review","Several months ago there was a minor flap over the fact that the National Football League was given the right to delete parts of the film ""Concussion"" before its general release to the public. At the time many, including myself, feared that the NFL would defang the bite of the film. It did not. In fact it's hard to imagine what the NFL censored in ""Concussion"" given the devastating nature of the final product which is now in release. Will Smith has the lead role as Dr. Bennet Omalu, the Nigerian doctor, who made the initial discovery of the existence of CTE in the brains of former NFL players whose lives had collapsed and ended at a relatively young age. The other major character in the film is Mike Webster whose life spiraled out of control. His eighteen year career as a center for the Pittsburgh Steelers endeared him to the football fans of that city, but his post-football life led to a major personality change, alcoholism, drugs, and lesser addictions, and destroyed his family life. His death was officially termed a heart attack but as the New York Times reported the psychological turmoil and physical problems were the result of repeated blows to the head. Dr. Omalu worked as a forensic pathologist in the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, coroner's office where he first encountered Mike Webster when he conducted the postmortem on Webster. In an examination of Webster's brain Omalu found ""tau,"" a substance that strangles the brain and often personality changes as those experienced by Mike Webster. Omalu linked Webster's tragic end to the head trauma endured by Webster during his football career. ""Concussion"" opens with a painful depiction of Webster's descent into his personal hell. Dr. Omalu is introduced at work where he will first encounter Mike Webster. From here the story opens out from Omalu's discoveries and into the world of science and the world of the National Football League. Omalu's life and work are the major focus of the film as he comes into conflict with the power of the NFL, the cult of football in America, and the corruption within the scientific community. It is a potent mix. What is revealed is the fact that for close to two decades the NFL did its best to prevent any connection between the concussions, the collapse of the lives of former players, and football. The NFL was aggressive in its effort to discredit any research making that connection. Repeatedly the film pounds away in subtle and not so subtle scenes of head-to-head hits on football practice fields, in game highlights from the NFL, and within the lives and deaths of former players. As Omalu's analysis gains traction the push back by the NFL grows. Omalu's boss is threatened by the FBI and IRS. Omalu's life in Pittsburgh is battered by threats to his employment that could lead to his deportation. He is subjected to threatening phone calls and his wife is harassed. Essentially what the NFL tried to do to Omalu was to dismantle his life in ways the lives of former NFL players were dismantled by brain diseases. The story moves forward at a good pace, there is tension aplenty, and above all what comes roaring off the screen is both the power and the corruption of the NFL. If you think that it is unlikely that the NFL had the ability to get the IRS, FBI and immigration authorities to act on their behest you are an innocent. The NFL has strong connections with the political establishment and a very close relationship with the FBI through its security division which is populated by ex-FBI agents and administrators who maintain their connections to the Bureau. In the end ""Concussion"" succeeds in telling the story of Bennet Omalu, warns of the dangers of concussions and football, and displays the power of the NFL and its willingness to sacrifice people's lives in the maintenance of their cultural dominance. ""Concussion"" will not destroy football in America; it should damage the credibility of the NFL, and lead everyone to understand the dangers inherent in this American sport and entertainment in which violence is an essential element.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/art-seen-through-the-lens_b_8900380","12/31/2015","anna agoston","Art Seen Through the Lens of its Architect"," I am an architect who makes art. My education and practice as an architect have informed what I see, the way I think, and what, why, and how I make art. This is a look at my art through my architect's lens. I aim to expose facets of meaning according to the Vitruvian triad of structural integrity, beauty, and utility. Structure Architects think in terms of space and form, and structure is at the core of the architectural artifact. My Untitled project is a series of photographs of living plant elements photographed in parks and gardens. The series' parameters--defined and treated as structural elements--include print color, format, size, and borders. These shared parameters preserve the series' coherence and integrity and serve as a sculptural basis for my art by holding and framing each image. I obscure backgrounds to isolate subjects from their contexts. I strategically position my subjects within white frames to evoke feelings like withdrawal, sensuality, and love or sensations like gravity or levitation. The vertical spine of a Gingko Biloba leaf stretches sensually along the frame. The circular form of an Opium Poppy crown hovers in the upper part of the frame. I seek out and use symmetry to highlight imperfections or particularities of pattern and shape. Angling a subject's core axis up-down or right-left shows up natural asymmetries and imperfections along it, such as the minuscule irregularity on the rim of a Paphiopedilum Orchid's lower lip. Photographs shown together are arranged in a horizontal line sometimes broken into vertically-juxtaposed equal sequences. The series is to be read from left to right and top to bottom, as is Western text on a page. This arrangement brings out similarities and progressions in form--usually from the circular to the linear--and feeling. The images' positioning guides viewers from and allows them to compare one to the next. Beauty As an architect and artist, I strive to design dwellings and make art that are moving as well as aesthetically appealing. The Untitled series is an attempt to reveal the beauty intrinsic to each subject. Subjects are mostly tiny, simple plant elements found in ordinary, natural settings that I exalt by turning them into art that celebrates them. Plant elements are either shiny, fresh, newly-germinated stems, buds, and blossoms or weathered, withered boles, twigs, and leaves. The latter are reminiscent of Wabi-sabi, the traditional Japanese aesthetic that honors transience and imperfection in nature. Art results from the act of making an image beautiful and moving. To make my subject beautiful to the viewer, I polish and emphasize form with light and draw from a palette that ranges from the pure white of a wet surface catching the light to the rich black of deep depth of field. I print digitally on thick matte Hahnemühle paper because its fine, smooth surface creates high-quality prints that emphasize fine tonal graduations. Carefully-placed planes of focus form a tonal spectrum whose span expresses sharp foreground detail as well as soft background. The end result is an image that is compellingly beautiful. My interest in architectural structure followed naturally from an earlier fascination with organic structure. I had studied the organic unit, the cell, because I was curious about how singular characteristics could account for such diverse structures as hair and bone. Now, when I look at a black-and-white print of a Gingko Biloba leaf magnified six times, what I see is architecture: structure, form, and texture that remind me of Oscar Niemeyer's magnificent reinforced-concrete edifices. It is clearly the leaf's organic structure that determines the gracious--whether sophisticated or immature--way in which it hangs from the stem. Beauty also resides in the metaphor that an image may evoke. I do not give my photographs titles, preferring to allow viewers' minds to drift and form visual associations. My photographs do, however, have private nicknames referring to the personal metaphors that they evoke in me. Discerning symbols and identifying visual metaphors is part of my creative process. While I am taking a photograph, I may identify, seek to embed a discerned symbol or metaphor. For example, when I saw and felt a Madonna and Child in a minute germinating sprout, I worked on the image until it conveyed that metaphor to me. I am nevertheless conscious that, like Rorschach inkblots, visual metaphors are infinite in number, uncontrollable, and can only be suggested to others. Utility Whereas an artifact's utility or function is set in its programming, its function, when designed by an architect, can go beyond programming to encompass human experience of both exterior object and inner space. When presenting an architecture project, I first lay down facts about it. I lead the client around the outside of the edifice, highlighting its features and surroundings, and then move inside and through the plan from the entrance to any upper rooms, all the while pointing out how one experiences the inner spaces in concert with those visible through openings. ""La promenade architecturale,"" this movement through the building, and the resulting sequence of images unfolding before the observer, was central to Le Corbusier's architectural design. That concept shaped his buildings interiors and exteriors. Our physical experience of any architecture and art engenders emotions that in turn affect our emotional response to our environment. Le Corbusier collected natural objects and used them to draw up the natural laws that formally influenced his design of architecture objects, whether elements like stairways or entire buildings. He wrote: ""Around 1928 I felt a desire to expand my pictorial vocabulary and became interested in what I called objects of poetic reaction (objets à réaction poétique), any number of ordinary items that contain, summarize, and express the laws of nature, events understood as symbolically significant, etc. After that I began to work on the human figure."" (Le Corbusier, L'Architecture d'Aujourd'hui, Special Issue, April 1948, p. 45). The purpose of my Untitled series is not to inform my architecture but to draw attention to and elevate the small but not insignificant plant elements encountered in daily life. A walk through the series is intended to provide an inner experience that will bring about a renewed sensitivity to the natural world. Magnifying little details of life that would otherwise go unnoticed exposes monumental beauty, triggers amazement, and revives from within. By inviting contemplation, my art transcends its subjects. Architects strive to design works that are internally and externally meaningful. We are concerned with an edifice's essence and also with its cultural and historic context. Similarly, my Untitled series, by focusing on subjects' structure and beauty, is an ode to natural forms that seeks to compel the viewer to see the world with new eyes, to feel it from within. What makes my Untitled series distinct is my use of digital technology to photograph living plants in their natural environments. Freed from the studio, I observe how the fall of natural light on subjects defines their form, and faced with the elements, like wind and sun, I take multiple photographs of a single subject until I get it right. In exploring the visual metaphor in living plants, I am building on the legacy of Edward Weston's still lifes; and my use of contemporary digital tools furthers the macro photography tradition of Karl Blossfeldt by making high-resolution photographs of plant forms in nature. Unlike Hilla and Bernd Becher, I am developing a romantic typology of forms in which feeling is perceptible. In my ongoing Untitled series, I am constructing a progressive sequencing of form and feeling. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-mothers-resumebecause-i_b_8901326","12/31/2015","kiri westby","A Mother's Résumé... Because it's 2016!","I am one of roughly ten million American moms who've left the workforce to raise young kids, a percentage of the population that is steadily rising, not falling. Although I had a career in human rights advocacy and an expensive education under my belt, the decision came down to simple math. I could leave my kids with paid childcare, costing nearly all of my earning potential while away, or I could do the unpaid childcare myself. In the United States, which fails to provide affordable early childhood education, unlike many other developed countries, most mothers must make a similar choice. Some women are fortunate to have maternity leave or family caretakers to depend on, for a short while anyway, and a handful of women will net a few bucks after paying for coverage, taxes and commuting. With more than eleven million single moms in the US, 76% of which are gainfully employed, there are usually no affordable childcare options, trapping women in a cyclone of poverty. You either work and parent, barely making frayed ends meet, or you stay home with government assistance and withstand the shame of being ""unemployed"", even as you work your tail off. Recently, a mother in New York wrote about losing her child on his first day of daycare after she was forced to either return to work or quit her job, her difficult decision echoed in the hearts of millions of moms today. Republican lawmakers often label stay-at-home moms ""welfare queens"", claiming they drain the federal budget. In reality, government assistance makes up only 24% of federal spending, two-thirds of which goes to Medicare for people over sixty-five; Not to mention families who receive government assistance while working and paying taxes, a population that now makes up 56% of federal aid recipients. To add insult to injury, moms who stay home for a few years are often penalized when they return to the job market. Rather than being lauded for their newly attained skills, stay-at-home moms are treated as if they've taken a long vacation or lost touch with the modern world. The other night, I watched a scene in the popular TV show, Married. Actress Judy Greer plays a mother attempting to return to work after raising three kids, hoping for an office management job. Once she finds her old resume (on a floppy disk), she and a friend try to cleverly craft her mothering skills into resume appropriate terms. ""I once flew by myself with all three kids... while I was breastfeeding!"" She boasts. ""Ha! That is a baller move. But not something I would consider résumé material,"" her friend sighs, a look of pity. ""What!"" My sleep-deprived hackles suddenly up. Having recently endured the experience of raising small humans myself, I know for certain that there is no one more qualified to manage an office than a stay-at-home mother of three. I feel like I've been through some form of Navy SEAL training with just two. When I compare the me-of-today to the twenty-something-employee that I was before raising kids, it's no contest. Motherhood has turned me into a straight-up badass. There's got to be a way to reframe this because, frankly, the American job force needs highly trained, tough-as-nails moms in its ranks and, apparently, it doesn't know it yet. So I tried it. Instead of camouflaging the mom in my résumé, I put her right in there, front and center alongside my other applicable skills. Only I didn't get the job. Nor the one after that. A friend of mine tried it and she didn't get the job either. I started to think this was a bad idea. The business world obviously isn't ready to view motherhood as a ""real job"". Instead of being taken seriously, it appeared I was making a mockery of my ""work"", which only worked against me. I gave in and made a résumé without the mama-me, beefing up the small consulting work I was barely able to do on the side to, you know, pay for preschool. I made sure to hide all the 3:00 am bouncy struggles, the all-night-fever watches, the stunning achievement of teaching a child to walk...and then to run...and then to fly. But once I'd polished all the spit-up and tears from the page, it was utterly devoid of me. The most important on-the-job training I had ever received; the levels of multitasking mastered; the psychological torture of being on one's feet for twelve hours after only three hours of sleep; the diplomacy required to bring families together over holidays and clashing customs; and the sheer humility gained in volunteering to be covered with bodily fluids for years on end...none of it was in there. How could I interview for a job and pretend like I hadn't risen to superhuman status over the past six years? Resumegenius.com, Monster.com, Forbes.com each provide tips for hiding the parenting years when re-entering the job market. The Forbes article even recognizes that raising kids is skill building, stating, ""You've got a gazillion amazing new skills--this is indisputable. The problem? Many of your talents have been refined over the past few years through your most recent job as a stay-at-home parent...not a ""real job"". Each piece cautions against overtly mentioning one's kids, unless it comes up directly in an interview, asserting that employers will only hear ""sick days"" and ""family priorities."" From where I stand, employers should be reveling in the fact that they may have landed a dedicated, home-trained, Superhero. What are a few sick days compared to an employee that works every other day like her kids depend on it? Not to brag, but I can change a diaper, cook dinner, pay bills and order Christmas presents at the same time, and so can most of the moms I know. And let's just take a moment to recognize moms with multiples! Employers out there, if an applicant bravely mentions that they've had twins or more, hire them on the spot; their level of training has been a notch above the rest, their skills masterful. In order to flip-the-script on this whole fallacy, to define motherhood as the hardcore job training that it is, and to merge the two conflicting hats working moms struggle to wear every day, I created ""A Mother's Résumé"", because it's 2016. Here is my list of job-applicable skills that I gained while staying home with small children, available as its own downloadable image. Feel free to weave this info into your résumé, share it with other moms looking for work or print out a copy to remind yourself of ALL that you are. The more of us who own our maternal powers and proudly claim our at-home achievements, the more likely the business world will begin to recognize motherhood as an asset, rather than a liability. As 2016 dawns and we look to our next big ventures, let's collectively change the conversation to stop pretending like our metamorphosis into motherhood isn't relevant to our professional life. Heck, this is the year we might finally see a mom leading from the White House! If you are bold enough to try it, apply for a job using ""motherhood"" in your previous job experience, or as part of your relevant skills, and let me know how it pans out in the comments below. Or add some unique skills you've gained through parenting, I'm sure I've overlooked many. At the very least, let's agree to talk more about motherhood as the badge of bravery and growth that it is, rather than something to hide or isolate from our work. I can imagine a world where stay-at-home moms return to the job market proud of their hard earned, newly minted, human survival skills and confident that any prospective employer will feel the same...But it turns out, along with everything else we do, it's going to be up to us moms to create it.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reasons-to-hate-the-h8tef_b_8901684","12/31/2015","jackie k cooper","Reasons to Hate 'The H8teful Eight'","The H8teful Eight(The Weinstein Company) There are numerous reasons you should hate Quentin Tarantino's The H8teful Eight. The first is it is full of racist characters who use the N-word excessively. The second is it portrays brutality to women. The third is its excessive violence in general, and its blood-drenched scenes. Fourth, there are crude stories that roll off the lips of the characters. Yes, Tarantino pretty much says and does it all and wallows in the lack of political correctness. But then Tarantino is the Donald Trump of moviemakers. Political correctness does not attach itself to him. If other people had made this movie, they would have been drummed out of the Hollywood community. Quentin just gets stronger and stronger. He loves to shock and he loves the truth. If his story calls for nudity then the movie is going to have nudity. If it calls for blatant racism in its characters then those characters are going to be as racist as they can be. Whatever it takes to satisfy his cinematic goals, Quentin Tarantino does. H8teful Eight is a movie full of strong characters caught up in an ingenious plot. We meet the first four during a stagecoach ride. Originally on board are John Ruth (Kurt Russell), a bounty hunter with his prize Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). She is being taken to the Hangman in Red Rock, and Ruth is set to get ten thousand dollars for her delivery - dead or alive. A blizzard is moving in so the stagecoach is racing to get to Minnie's Haberdashery to wait out the storm. Slowing them down is Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), another bounty hunter who begs for a ride. Later they are flagged down by Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who also needs a ride. Finally, they reach Minnie's place where they find four men already there. There is the acting owner Bob (Damien Bichir), a hangman named Oswaldo (Tim Roth), a cowboy named Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), and a rebel colonel named Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern). Over the next twenty-four hours, this group will tell each other stories about their pasts and various other lies. They will also eye each other warily and plot how best to accomplish their goals and make a clean getaway. With Ruth, it is all about keeping Daisy alive until they can get to Red Rock. Some members of the group do not want that to happen. The acting in this movie is solid because the roles are all perfectly cast. Even so the two standouts are Goggins, who just gets better and better with each role he undertakes, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who knows how to be rawly observant as well as smart mouthed and sassy. These two are also the funniest characters in the movie. The movie is rated R for violence, profanity, and nudity. The nudity is provided by actor Craig Stark who gets to spend his entire time on screen naked in a snow-laden landscape. Brrrrr! As said, there are many reasons to hate The H8teful Eight but even more reasons to love it. The main reason being that everything in the film is unique. Nobody makes movies like Quentin Tarantino's movies. He has an eye for how the movie should look and an ear for what it should say. He comes out shooting and he stands his ground. When the film is over, the audience is in shock but they can't say they were not entertained. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-cosby-a-christmas-gift_b_8901554","12/31/2015","arnold steinberg","Is Cosby a Christmas Gift for Trump?","On July 1, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez fired a gun in San Francisco. The bullet killed 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle. Just ten weeks earlier San Francisco had released Sanchez, who had been repeatedly convicted on drug and felony charges in Washington, Arizona, Oregon and Texas. The ""progressive"" sanctuary city had refused to honor a detainer from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to keep Sanchez in custody, so he could be deported, for the sixth time. The death of this vibrant and beautiful young woman was a tragedy, especially for her family. But ""Kate"" quickly became Exhibit A for Donald Trump, coming so soon after he started his presidential campaign with its focus on illegal immigration. More recently, in November, Trump began to oppose the influx of Syrian refugees. ""This could be one of the great Trojan horses,"" he opined in many interviews. Then, the San Bernardino terrorist attack occurred on December 2, further validation of The Donald as The Cassandra. Timing is working in Trump's favor again. Consider the following context that will now allow Trump to pivot on the ""women's issue,"" put Hillary Clinton on the defensive, and perhaps affect the general election, no matter who is the Republican nominee. Hillary has said that alleged victims of sexual assault ""have the right to be believed,"" - in effect prompting the then inevitable inquiry about Bill Clinton's alleged sexual assaults. Sure enough, earlier this month a woman in New Hampshire asked Hillary whether his accusers -- Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones -- should be believed. They should, Hillary replied tersely, be ""disbelieved based on evidence."" Last week Hillary provided a second opening when she criticized Trump's ""penchant for sexism"" and yet a third opening when she announced that Bill would soon campaign for her. Trump strategically lets the ""other guy"" throw the first punch (""they hit me first""), especially to put an issue in play (""they started this""). Hillary fell into the compound trap. And: ""If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong!"" Trump twittered on Monday. Now a few days after Christmas, the Montgomery County District Attorney in Pennsylvania has given Trump an unintended gift. The charges of ""aggravated indecent assault"" against Bill Cosby, once revered as ""America's favorite father"" raise the issue of a powerful man sexually assaulting a trusting and vulnerable woman. Just as Cosby previously settled a civil suit, so too did Clinton pay money in settlement to Paula Jones. The public and different accusers over decades against Governor Clinton and then President Clinton are graphic and specific and part of a pattern of predatory sex. Clinton's accusers suggested more than improper advances in a hostile work climate, also sexual assault. Meanwhile, the Cosby story will not go away. The preliminary hearing January 14 for the criminal case will be part of a drawn out process complicated by more civil suits that will keep the issue alive. At least a fifth of next year's electorate, and a quarter of Democrats, were children at the time of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Some of the reporters are too young to remember. These voters and journalists are, regarding the possible Bill Clinton fallout for Hillary, political virgins. And the times have changed with more awareness of sex without consent. America still suffers under the delusion that Clinton was responsible for ""peace and prosperity."" Incompetent Beltway Republicans never let the electorate realize that Clinton inherited a peaceful world, with the fall of the Soviet Union and victorious Persian Gulf War, and inherited an upswing business cycle, plus the Internet boom. The false Clinton legacy may not be enough to save Hillary. A new consciousness holds powerful men like Clinton and his morally challenged spouse accountable. Trump initially has framed the issue as marital infidelity, even saying his own indiscretions are fair game. At first this seems a blunder, since the Clintons spun the impeachment as an attempt to criminalize an extramarital affair, rather than perjury. Further, most Americans think a politician cheating on his or her spouse is a private matter. Actually, Trump shrewdly lures Hillary and the media to dignify a dialogue he fully intends to escalate. As I write this, he just called Bill ""one of the great abusers of the world."" Within weeks, his discussion will turn to Hilary as an expedient and hypocritical enabler for Bill who therefore lacks moral standing to judge Trump's ""male chauvinism"" or even to speak on women's issues, and then as her husband's enforcer to put down ""bimbo eruptions"" - masterminding the intimidation and defamation of the victims. With the Cosby story on the ascendancy, Trump can uniquely raise the bar to define a ruthless Hillary. Trump doesn't hold back, never retracts and doubles-down and triples-down. This stuff will no longer be the province of right-wing websites. Unlike other candidates, only Trump commands massive real-time coverage for his bold attacks. Mainstream media will confront Hillary over repeated news cycles to respond each time Trump escalates. Even if Trump is not the Republican nominee, Hillary may become damaged goods for November.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-giant-leap-in-2016-africa_b_8901556","12/31/2015","david tereshchuk","A Giant Leap in 2016? Africa Is Narrowing its Techno-Gap","Though for many of us the year ahead may look pretty dismal, 2016 promises one great breakthrough - a major step toward ending Africa's particular and hobbling form of the great Digital Divide. Poor connectivity has bedeviled much of the continent's internet access (or often sheer lack of access) but now a huge improvement is in the offing. It's a new subsea cable, to be laid off Africa's eastern coastline, enabling a reliable and affordable international connectivity service to both coastal and landlocked countries in Eastern, Central and Southern Africa. The project is being developed by Liquid Sea, a literally offshore subsidiary of Liquid Telecom, which already runs a pan-African network based on terrestrial fiber-optic cable supplemented by satellite links for rural and remote areas. Altogether, with offices from South Africa and Botswana in the south to Kenya in the East, taking in Democratic Republic of Congo in the center, it makes up the continent's largest single contiguous network crossing multiple national borders. Africa has benefited in many ways from the digital revolution - most notably in taking advantage of wireless technology - to leap-frog the conventional stumbling-block that having to lay cables had always presented. But internet coverage still remains uneven, to say the least. Les Cottrell (pictured below), who is based at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in Silicon Valley-land and runs the world's first global internet monitoring system (with the perhaps overly cute name PingER), will have the job of assessing how big a difference the new Liquid Sea connection finally gets to make. Cottrell, something of a legendary research scientist who was on the Nobel Prize-winning team that discovered the quark, is in no doubt of the daunting nature of Africa's need for net improvement, given so many countries' obdurate mix of poor connectivity overlaid across the sheer paucity of technical resources. He cites a visit he made to the biggest university in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He recalls: ""The University of Kinshasa has nearly 30,000 students, faculty, and research staff--but only 800 computers. And although its internal data network is fast enough to support on-campus e-mail, virtual library access, and online coursework, its link to the outside world is no better than that of a typical household in the United States or Europe."" And the unpalatable truth is that, despite some great advance in African development over the last decade and more, its effects are patchy, and taken as a whole, fewer than 16 percent of Africans have access to the Internet. That compares that with 63 percent of Europeans and 79 percent of North Americans. Cottrell has seen all too clearly what a disadvantage is placed upon Africans by such digital inequality. The economics of the entire process, he maintains, are skewed by poor network performance in Africa, with the total bandwidth available to shuttle data back and forth between African countries and the rest of the world amounting to less than 1 terabit per second. That's about one-seventieth of Europe's international bandwidth capacity. ""Making matters worse,"" Cottrell points out, ""the price for bandwidth in Africa is cripplingly high. While a university in Germany might pay about US $4,000 per month for 1 gigabit per second of bandwidth, a school in Kenya can expect to pay $200, 000 for the same service."" Things had started to improve when the soccer World Cup of 2011 was held in South Africa, and the ginormous demand of international communicators, not least the bandwidth-heavy TV networks, led to new western-coast undersea cables being laid. But these didn't afterward benefit many ordinary Africans, any more than they did the students and faculty of Kinshasa's university. Now Liquid Sea's underwater cable stretching from eastern South Africa to the Middle East, with onward connections to Europe, aims to contribute much more in building Africa's better connected digital future as whole. Liquid's CEO, Nic Rudnick, claims: ""The impact of Liquid Sea will be a far more reliable and ultra-fast connection for governments, businesses, schools and homes - in both coastal and land-locked countries across all of Africa."" And if it's not, the ever-vigilant Les Cottrell of PingER will be there to test and evaluate the network down to its fine gradations. He'll do that mainly through his basic measuring tool of the ""ping"" (like the sonar echo it is named after) as it travels from one computer to another far remote one - recording to the millisecond exactly how long that journey takes. All in all, though, Cottrell seems hopeful: ""As the continent continues to attract big investors and cutting-edge science research projects,"" he says, ""its internet performance will advance further still"".

These were the biggest Obamacare stories of the year about to end. Obamacare haters got another chance to deal a devastating blow to the law before the Supreme Court, and came up short, just as they had three years before. Chief Justice John Roberts again sided with the high court's four liberals, along with Justice Anthony Kennedy, to reject a lawsuit that was conceived and underwritten by libertarian and conservative activists. King v. Burwell was based on a fictitious history of the Affordable Care Act that attempted to gut the law by singling out a handful of words and claiming Obamacare only permitted health insurance subsidies in states that created their own health insurance exchanges, not in those with federally run marketplaces. The case threatened to rob millions of their health coverage, but in the end, all it did was rob a lot of people of time, attention and effort. There's a whole mess of stuff in the Affordable Care Act, but the chief and most measurable aim of the law is to get more people covered, and it's doing that. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates 17.6 million more people have health coverage than before Obamacare benefits kicked in on Jan. 1, 2014. Survey after survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Gallup and others show the percentage of Americans without health insurance is the lowest ever measured. Thanks, Obamacare. When the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in 2012, justices also ruled that states could opt out of the law's expansion of Medicaid coverage to low-income adults. Republican-led states like Florida and Texas continue to refuse these benefits to their poorest residents, but 2015 saw the list of states not expanding Medicaid shrink. Alaska, Indiana and Montana signed on, and now 30 states plus the District of Columbia are participating. Republican governors in South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming and elsewhere are still struggling to persuade state legislators to set aside their vehemence over Obamacare and adopt the expansion, but to no avail so far. One of the favorite pastimes of House Republicans is voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but 2015 brought a GOP majority to the Senate, too, enabling the upper chamber to get in on the fun and pass a budget bill that cuts out big chunks from the law. Next week, the House is slated to vote for it, too, and Obama will get a chance to veto a repeal bill for the first time. And then congressional Republicans can high-five each other and get back to not having a replacement for Obamacare. The dozens of repeal votes from 2011 to 2015 didn't actually ding the Affordable Care Act, and the changes Obama actually signed into law were pretty minor -- until this year. First, they undid part of the law that would have classified a lot of small businesses as big companies when it came to health benefits. But the biggest change -- and a significant loss for Obamacare and for the White House -- came with the enthusiastic support of congressional Democrats. Legislation Obama enacted this month delays the ""Cadillac tax"" on high-cost health insurance plans (a major source of revenue and a key tool in containing health care costs) along with taxes on medical device companies and health insurers. Bipartisanship! The health insurance exchanges closed out the 2015 sign-up period with nearly 12 million enrolled, surpassing federal officials' projections (but falling short of the Congressional Budget Office's expectations). The growth was a positive indicator of the viability of these new marketplaces, and contributed to the declining uninsured rate. During the course of 2015, the exchanges shed almost 2 million customers. Hundreds of thousands lost coverage because they didn't prove they were legal U.S. residents, and about a million saw their subsidies adjusted because their real income didn't match what they reported when they applied. And others cycled off the exchanges either to become uninsured or to obtain coverage from another source, like a job or Medicare. The market for individual health insurance has always been volatile, but this shrinkage raised worries about the future of the exchanges. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell sought to manage expectations before 2016 enrollment began by predicting meager growth on the health insurance exchanges. But preliminary enrollment figures appear promising. More than 8 million people have signed up with a month to go in the enrollment period. And it looks like a lot of them are new customers and, crucially, younger and less costly than those already covered by exchange plans. So the marketplaces are either on track to beat projections, or Burwell did a nice job spinning everyone beforehand. Obamacare premiums came in lower than Congressional Budget Office projections in 2014, and average increases in 2015 were in the mid-single digits. But ahead of the 2016 enrollment period that started last month, it became clear that pattern wouldn't repeat itself. Average premium increases were higher, and individual plans hiked prices by a whole lot more. Health insurance companies complained that Obamacare customers were sicker and more expensive than they expected, prompting fears that enrollment would stagnate as prices rose and drove out those who needed the coverage less, provoking even higher rate increases in the future. This led to a bunch of snide comments on Twitter about the name ""Affordable Care Act."" The jury is still out on whether historically low year-over-year growth in national health care spending in recent years was all (or mostly) the result of the recession and slow recovery, or whether Obamacare and private sector innovation are making the health care system more efficient. But what we do know now is that spending sped up in 2014, primarily driven by expanded health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Turns out spending a ton of money giving people health care spends a ton of money. Several parts of the Affordable Care Act have been described as ""death panels"" to scare people into thinking their medical care would be rationed by bureaucrats. But the most infamous example was when former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin used the moniker in a feverish Facebook rant to describe a provision of the legislation that became Obamacare that would allow Medicare to pay doctors who discuss end-of-life options with patients. Scaredy-cat Democrats pulled the policy from the bill, but the Obama administration did it through a regulation this year. Polls show the public supports it -- sorry, Gov. Palin! UnitedHealth Group is a minor player in the exchanges, but it's also the largest health insurance company in America. So when the company told investors it was losing money on Obamacare and might pull out, it raised eyebrows. Although other big insurers quickly said they had no intention of bailing on the exchanges, the UnitedHealth news was a reminder that Obamacare is still new -- and vulnerable. As a consolation prize of sorts to liberals who wanted the exchanges to include a government-run ""public option"" health care plan to compete with private insurers, Congress included seed money in the Affordable Care Act to found new, nonprofit health insurance cooperatives that were supposed to increase competition and keep prices down. It sort of looked like it might work at first, but then Congress cut their funding, these new companies started bleeding money, and half of them shut down, leaving hundreds of thousands of consumers scrambling to find replacements. You can't spell ""co-ops"" without ""oops."" There was no bigger champion of the Affordable Care Act than Steve Beshear, the Democrat who was governor of Kentucky until this month. Under Beshear, Kentucky expanded Medicaid; erected Kynect, a state-run health insurance exchange that stood as a model for other states; and slashed the uninsured rate. But Beshear couldn't run again because of term limits, and Republican tea party favorite Matt Bevin bested his Democratic opponent and now is in charge. While Bevin has backed off his vows to repeal the Medicaid expansion, he still wants to radically change the program and to scrap Kynect. Kentuckians may not agree with those aims, but they voted for him anyway. The next four years will change America forever.

One of the lesser-known goals of the Affordable Care Act is to enhance patient safety, especially in hospitals, where preventable errors kill tens of thousands of people every year. In a promising sign, the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported this year that these fatal episodes have been on the decline since Obamacare became law in 2010, and brought with it new policies including Medicare payment penalties for hospitals that don't improve patient safety.

And then congressional Republicans can high-five each other and get back to not having a replacement for Obamacare. The dozens of repeal votes from 2011 to 2015 didn't actually ding the Affordable Care Act, and the changes Obama actually signed into law were pretty minor -- until this year. First, they undid part of the law that would have classified a lot of small businesses as big companies when it came to health benefits. But the biggest change -- and a significant loss for Obamacare and for the White House -- came with the enthusiastic support of congressional Democrats. Legislation Obama enacted this month delays the ""Cadillac tax"" on high-cost health insurance plans (a major source of revenue and a key tool in containing health care costs) along with taxes on medical device companies and health insurers. Bipartisanship! The health insurance exchanges closed out the 2015 sign-up period with nearly 12 million enrolled, surpassing federal officials' projections (but falling short of the Congressional Budget Office's expectations). The growth was a positive indicator of the viability of these new marketplaces, and contributed to the declining uninsured rate. During the course of 2015, the exchanges shed almost 2 million customers. Hundreds of thousands lost coverage because they didn't prove they were legal U.S. residents, and about a million saw their subsidies adjusted because their real income didn't match what they reported when they applied. And others cycled off the exchanges either to become uninsured or to obtain coverage from another source, like a job or Medicare. The market for individual health insurance has always been volatile, but this shrinkage raised worries about the future of the exchanges. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell sought to manage expectations before 2016 enrollment began by predicting meager growth on the health insurance exchanges. But preliminary enrollment figures appear promising. More than 8 million people have signed up with a month to go in the enrollment period. And it looks like a lot of them are new customers and, crucially, younger and less costly than those already covered by exchange plans. So the marketplaces are either on track to beat projections, or Burwell did a nice job spinning everyone beforehand. Obamacare premiums came in lower than Congressional Budget Office projections in 2014, and average increases in 2015 were in the mid-single digits. But ahead of the 2016 enrollment period that started last month, it became clear that pattern wouldn't repeat itself. Average premium increases were higher, and individual plans hiked prices by a whole lot more. Health insurance companies complained that Obamacare customers were sicker and more expensive than they expected, prompting fears that enrollment would stagnate as prices rose and drove out those who needed the coverage less, provoking even higher rate increases in the future. This led to a bunch of snide comments on Twitter about the name ""Affordable Care Act."" The jury is still out on whether historically low year-over-year growth in national health care spending in recent years was all (or mostly) the result of the recession and slow recovery, or whether Obamacare and private sector innovation are making the health care system more efficient. But what we do know now is that spending sped up in 2014, primarily driven by expanded health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Turns out spending a ton of money giving people health care spends a ton of money. Several parts of the Affordable Care Act have been described as ""death panels"" to scare people into thinking their medical care would be rationed by bureaucrats. But the most infamous example was when former Alaska governor and GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin used the moniker in a feverish Facebook rant to describe a provision of the legislation that became Obamacare that would allow Medicare to pay doctors who discuss end-of-life options with patients. Scaredy-cat Democrats pulled the policy from the bill, but the Obama administration did it through a regulation this year. Polls show the public supports it -- sorry, Gov. Palin! UnitedHealth Group is a minor player in the exchanges, but it's also the largest health insurance company in America. So when the company told investors it was losing money on Obamacare and might pull out, it raised eyebrows. Although other big insurers quickly said they had no intention of bailing on the exchanges, the UnitedHealth news was a reminder that Obamacare is still new -- and vulnerable. As a consolation prize of sorts to liberals who wanted the exchanges to include a government-run ""public option"" health care plan to compete with private insurers, Congress included seed money in the Affordable Care Act to found new, nonprofit health insurance cooperatives that were supposed to increase competition and keep prices down. It sort of looked like it might work at first, but then Congress cut their funding, these new companies started bleeding money, and half of them shut down, leaving hundreds of thousands of consumers scrambling to find replacements. You can't spell ""co-ops"" without ""oops."" There was no bigger champion of the Affordable Care Act than Steve Beshear, the Democrat who was governor of Kentucky until this month. Under Beshear, Kentucky expanded Medicaid; erected Kynect, a state-run health insurance exchange that stood as a model for other states; and slashed the uninsured rate. But Beshear couldn't run again because of term limits, and Republican tea party favorite Matt Bevin bested his Democratic opponent and now is in charge. While Bevin has backed off his vows to repeal the Medicaid expansion, he still wants to radically change the program and to scrap Kynect. Kentuckians may not agree with those aims, but they voted for him anyway. The next four years will change America forever.

One of the lesser-known goals of the Affordable Care Act is to enhance patient safety, especially in hospitals, where preventable errors kill tens of thousands of people every year. In a promising sign, the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported this year that these fatal episodes have been on the decline since Obamacare became law in 2010, and brought with it new policies including Medicare payment penalties for hospitals that don't improve patient safety. Good news for people who prefer not to die in the hospital for no good reason.

After all, you're in advertising and are largely responsible for keeping the old ideas alive. I say ""advertising"" only because that's the modern term for it, but back in the good old days when we called things by their right names, there was an entire division of government devoted to this purpose: ""The Ministry of Propaganda."" Now we call it ""advertising"" for obvious reasons, but call it what you will: advertising, propaganda, public relations, indoctrination, lobbying, disinformation, brainwashing, spin, mind control, or manufacturing consent, they all have the same function -- getting people to think what you want them to think. Today, however, I want to talk about your persuading audiences to embrace old ideas that predate the FDR era over 80 years ago. Many are in awe of your uncanny ability at getting millions of working-class, middle-aged Americans on board with ideas that would clearly be against their self-interest. You've succeeded in having them want to return to an America when there was no social security, no health benefits, no Medicare, no minimum wage, no strong labor unions, no attempts at tax and bank reform -- the ""bad old days"" when there were no protections whatever for the average worker and they were at the mercy of the factory owners. This is how America was before the New Deal of the 1930's, and yet you've been able to repackage and sell this shredding of the social safety net to millions of today's Americans without their even realizing that this would cause them unparalleled misery! Now, that's salesmanship! You have experts scratching their heads as to how, in these desperate times, you've been able to pull this off, since it would threaten the very existence of these people! Care to give me an exclusive on what magic you used to accomplish this? You're really too kind. Well, I don't want to give away any trade secrets, like selling austerity, but look around at the times. Or, better yet, just listen to the presidential debates. You'll hear a large part of my handiwork in what these candidates are saying. I just sit down with them to help them organize their thoughts, and they just run with it. If you listen closely, they're tapping into very old ideas, ideas that have been around for thousands of years, ideas and feelings that appeal to the lowest in people: malice and hatred, bigotry and racism, intolerance and prejudice. This is what sells, and a few of them are going at it hammer and tongs! What's older in this world than sowing fear and suspicion, creating hysteria, and turning people against one another -- minorities, nations, races, or religions -- instead of calming the waters and urging people to live together in peace? You'd think you were back in Germany in the 1930's with all this scapegoating going on! Who would have thought that this kind of fear-mongering would come roaring back from the past and coming from the mouths of presidential candidates! You can't make this stuff up! Ratings have literally gone through the roof. Yes, I am rather proud of this piece of legerdemain which works wonders when you tell people that it's the end of the world. And why do people buy into this paranoia? For one reason only - they're frightened and an easy prey for these presidential wannabes. And it works, especially in times of collective madness when demagogues are coming out of the woodwork to infect the susceptible with their private delusions. All I do is to help shape the chaos, stand back, and enjoy the performance. But I spend most of my time on Capitol Hill, advising on policy and legislative proposals that attack the helpless and innocent, rob them of their rights, and make the lives of the poor and oppressed even more miserable than they already are. What is older than any of these old time-tested measures that go as far back as biblical times? Getting people all riled up with raw, primal fears which advance the agenda of our billionaire friends who help get our people re-elected. It's a win-win situation all around! ***But that's not the end by any means of what you've been up to. You've also been beating the tom-toms by lobbying politicians and resurrecting other old ideas that were part of America in years gone by. You're certainly part of a noble profession that puts teeth in old ""Silent Cal"" Coolidge's immortal one-liner that ""The business of America is business."" Only now you're hawking a wider assortment of products -- candy bars, dishwashers, automobiles, fear, panic, paranoia, government proposals and policies, and even political candidates. Word comes down about what the Big Boys want, and you prepare the country for it. It's like it used to be -- democracy in action when the people thought that they had a say! Please don't misunderstand me. I don't want to press the ""advertising"" angle too hard, since I know you also function as political consultant, think-tanker, talk radio host, columnist, general factotum, and hired gun for galvanizing the public on whatever needs selling. It naturally depends on the particular account you're assigned, and in some cases you'll doubtless want to check your conscience at the door before thinking up jingles to get the public to buy what you're selling, like recycling old ideas that go back before the Environmental Protection Agency was created decades ago. But I'd be remiss if I failed to commend your unflagging dedication and persistence in trying to undermine this agency since its inception! I shouldn't think it's necessary to believe in the products you're selling, although I'm sure that it helps, especially if you want a good night's sleep when you're jingling to justify what some squeamish consciences might label as criminal enterprises on the part of your clients, like contaminating drinking water, polluting rivers, and destroying the environment. But don't get me wrong. I don't mean to suggest that you've only been active in trying to gut the EPA. It seems you're everywhere these days, from upping pharmaceutical prices 550%, which cause the death of thousands as collateral damage since their meds are no longer affordable; to trashing social justice at universities that keep their professors in poverty; and abolishing political rights across all of America. But, then again, there are always winners and losers, for that's the beauty of our free enterprise system, which has made our country great! But it's fair to say that in whatever capacity you find yourself, when you honestly believe that what you're doing is honorable, it's a laudable calling. If, however, you're in it for the power or money, then that's something else. I know, I know what you're going to say, so why don't you say it? Well, if I don't do it, someone else will, so why not me? But I want it on record that I do have a code. I'd never promote cigarettes for home consumption and kids because I'm a true American and know the very real hazards caused by tobacco. I just couldn't live with myself if someone got cancer because of my actions -- although if they're being shipped overseas, well . . . . Besides, the money is good, and when it is, it's surprising what a conscience can get used to. Don't forget, I'm trained to think short-term, quarterly dividends. It comes with the territory. Nobody thinks long-term anymore. There's no money in it. Refreshing candor, to be sure, but you sell yourself short. You try to be flexible, open-minded, so open-minded, in fact, that you'll sell anything -- within, without, or beyond reason, even what may demoralize your own nation, put millions out of work, drag down the economy, or even destroy it, as long as it advances the interests of the party you're serving, no questions asked. That's very generous of you! Thank you! Any parting words? Well, they say that the truth will make you free, but not that it will always make you happy. Given a choice between truth and happiness, most will choose happiness over truth every time. Life is not about truth, but survival, and people prefer denial rather than facing uncomfortable truths. ""Humankind cannot bear very much reality,"" said T. S. Eliot somewhere. And then there's that old Latin adage: ""Mundus vult decipi, ergo decipiatur"" or ""The world wants to be lied to, so why not oblige it!"" This little maxim has always been my inspiration, as I go about my work with a song in my heart trying to keep folks from looking into the face of Medusa and be turned into stone. However, I'm not the only one who does them this service. Look at the media! The entertainment industry! Hollywood! TV! The corporations! The politicians! Why, I'm a small-timer next to these people. They all tell lies to advance their agenda. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) cares about only one of them. A few weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered the unsealing of court documents that identified people associated with the disgraced financier, who died in a New York City jail in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to traffic minors for sex. The list could be released on Tuesday, and some of the names expected to be on it include former presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. On Sunday, Greene offered her take on the upcoming release and used the opportunity to attack Clinton, who reportedly flew on Epstein’s jet multiple times, according to Epstein’s former pilot, in a post on X: “For some us, it’s no surprise at all that Bill Clinton will be named in the Jeffrey Epstein files. “We said it a long time ago but they labeled us conspiracy theorists. “There will be lots of names you’ve never heard of and the IC collected info on them. “Pedophiles belong in jail not on secret government lists.” For some us, it’s no surprise at all that Bill Clinton will be named in the Jeffrey Epstein files.We said it a long time ago but they labeled us conspiracy theorists.There will be lots of names you’ve never heard of and the IC collected info on them.Pedophiles belong in… Clinton’s friendship with Epstein, who’s death was ruled a suicide, admittedly looks sketchy. Still, many people on X, formerly known as Twitter, called out the controversial congresswoman for going after Clinton, a Democrat, while ignoring Epstein’s longtime association with Trump. I find it really rich that Republicans are so quick to jump to, “Bill Clinton is on the Jeffrey Epstein list” and even THEN, they still can’t say the next obvious statement - that if Clinton is in it, so is Trump. If they’re both on it, lock them both up. https://t.co/5WrqNjO1cQ You're so obsessed with Bill Clinton being on the list that you're overlooking that Trump, the leader of YOUR party, will be on the same list, you raging hypocritical bigot.

Clarkson’s Vegas residency premiered in July, shortly after the release of her latest album, “Chemistry.” Though the original 10-show run concluded in August, she later announced a four-date extension that’s slated to wrap next month. “Chemistry,” which dropped in June, is Clarkson’s 10th studio album. The 14 new songs are said to have been inspired by the “American Idol” veteran’s contentious 2022 split from ex-husband Brandon Blackstock. “I hadn’t really been working hardcore on an album until I needed to,” she told Variety in 2022. “But then the whole divorce thing happened, and I needed to write it. And then I didn’t know if I was going to release it, because you can be very angry in that state of mind. So some of the songs, they definitely cover the gamut of emotions; there’s everything on the album.

On Sunday, the actor and comedian revealed on Instagram that she’s been confiding in Jane Fonda as she prepares to finalize her split from husband Randy Bick. She shared photos of a recent hangout with the “Monster-in-Law” star, showing the two women seated in a kitchen with the remnants of food on an assortment of tableware before them. “My girlfriends are going to get me through this,” Griffin wrote in a caption. “Last night I had to use the bat phone. Me…‘Fonda, it’s Griffin. My heart is broken. I can’t eat I can’t sleep.’” Fonda, she said, responded by telling her: “Come on over kid. I’ll make you something. You’ll eat and I’ll listen.” A post shared by Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) By Monday afternoon, a number of other celebrities had pledged their support for Griffin under the post. “Oh Kathy,” actor Debra Messing wrote in the comments section. ”You are loved and supported and you will rise out of this life’s difficult chapter stronger. You are a survivor. I’m so so sorry you’re hurting. I wish I could take it away.” Added Broadway’s Kristin Chenoweth: “You. Will. Get. Through. This.” Griffin filed for divorce from Bick last week, citing “irreconcilable differences.” The two began dating in 2011 and were married on New Year’s Day in 2020. Their officiant was none other than Lily Tomlin — who, incidentally, co-starred with Fonda in the classic 1980 comedy “9 to 5,” as well as on Netflix’s “Grace and Frankie,” which wrapped in 2022 after seven seasons.

Since then, they’ve appeared together at a number of events, including a 2019 concert organized by the Los Angeles LGBT Center and a 2012 pre-Grammy Awards gala. In a 2016 appearance on “Larry King Now,” Griffin recalled looking to Fonda for support following a “really gnarly breakup” with an undisclosed partner. As for specific advice, she said Fonda had told her: “Whenever you’ve been through something that really rocks your world, don’t do anything for a year.

On Monday, the “Avengers” star called his 10-year-old daughter, Ava, “Reason number One” for his recovery after he was critically injured on New Year’s Day in 2023. “I asked her to ‘wait for me’ when I first saw her January 14 as I arrived home,” Renner captioned a heartfelt Instagram post, which included a photo of Ava hugging him. “As I got better, she got better, less afraid. There is simply no better motivator to recover than to heal your family and friends.” He added: “Thank you all for your love and support this last full year. I needed every ounce of goodwill and prayer.” The Marvel actor broke more than 30 bones and underwent multiple surgeries after he was crushed by a 7-ton snowplow on Jan. 1, 2023, in Reno, Nevada. While appearing on a New Year’s Eve broadcast Sunday, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Renner what motivated him to pull through his “unbelievable battle,” prompting the actor to gush about the love of his family.

And so there’s a lot for me to get better for.” Renner went on to say that he “never thought about my own physical ailments, or my own pain, or my own anguish” because he had “so many things to fight for.” “Recovery was just a one-way road in my mind,” he said. “And my recovery became relief for me, because I know I could give relief to my family, my daughter and to all those that I really affected.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Although the idea of Trump running the country from a prison cell instead of the West Wing might be disturbing to many Americans, at least one commentator on Monday’s episode of “Outnumbered” seemed OK with it. Panelists on the Fox News show were discussing the upcoming GOP primary season and how it may affect Trump’s chances of retaking the White House when attorney Paul Mauro predicted that Trump would be the candidate “left standing” by the time Super Tuesday rolls around on March 5. But co-host Kennedy wondered what might happen if the former president, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges he faces, is “indicted at some point.” Fox News medical contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat was quick to proclaim a simple solution. “He can be president from jail if he has to,” she said, adding that Republicans are still rallying around Trump despite the multiple trials he faces. “What happens if he’s indicted at some point?”“He can be President from jail if he has to” pic.twitter.com/StvF60cW4q Although Nesheiwat and others might be comfortable with the leader of the free world governing from behind bars, many users of X, formerly known as Twitter, weren’t as enthusiastic, with some saying that her suggestion smacked of “cult” like behavior. They wanted to “lock up” Hillary over some emails, but Trump can be “President from jail if he has to.”That’s how you know it’s a cult. https://t.co/tsNzsW0JuV It. Is. A.

Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CNN in August that the Constitution “has very few requirements to serve as President,” but “does not bar anyone indicted, or convicted, or even serving jail time, from running as president and winning the presidency.” That is one reason why many opponents to Trump’s reelection are instead looking at the Constitution’s 14th Amendment as a way to keep him from appearing on ballots. They argue that Trump’s links to the 2021 Capitol riot would prohibit him from holding office under the so-called insurrectionist clause.

After getting boozed up with Andy Cohen while hosting CNN’s live New Year’s Eve show on Sunday night, Cooper found himself cracking up after singer John Mayer dialed into the show alongside some unexpected guests — a whole gang of cats. After Cohen noted that the Grammy winner was calling from a cat bar in Tokyo, a visibly off-guard Cooper launched into a fit of laughter as Mayer sat at the bar surrounded by furry friends. The “Your Body Is a Wonderland” crooner maintained a deadpan expression throughout the interview as a variety of well-fed cats inched by him, adding to the hilarity of the situation. “This doesn’t look sanitary, John!” Cohen commented as Cooper continued giggling. A totally unbothered Mayer casually replied, “I believe it passes all health codes, so I think it’s just fine.” As Mayer continued talking about the bar, Cooper fought back his laughter before stepping away from the camera. “He’s gone. He’s off with the fairies here,” Cohen joked of his co-host. “Just the shot of the cat’s ass in your face is making him delirious,” Cohen added as Mayer impressively maintained a straight face while Cooper tried to hold it together. Fans on X (formerly Twitter) couldn’t hold back from reacting over the amusing moment.

On Dec. 20, U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney temporarily blocked the law from going into effect, calling it “sweeping, repugnant to the Second Amendment, and openly defiant of the Supreme Court.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit delayed that order Saturday to give the court more time to consider the constitutionality of the law, meaning it could take effect Jan. 1 as planned. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) praised the decision in a statement Saturday. “Californians overwhelmingly support efforts to ensure that places like hospitals, libraries and children’s playgrounds remain safe and free from guns,” he said in a statement. Newsom signed several pieces of gun control legislation into law in September, including Senate Bill 2, which restricts the ability to carry firearms in “sensitive places,” such as schools, zoos, religious institutions and sporting events, and on public transportation. In his decision, Carney argued the law “turns nearly every public place in California into a ‘sensitive place.’” The California Rifle and Pistol Association is suing to block the law. Senate Bill 2 is one of many state laws going into effect Monday. Minnesota and Colorado also have gun-related laws going into effect.

Fetterman Feared News About His Depression Would End His Political Career","WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. John Fetterman acknowledges having “dark conversations” about harming himself before he hit “the emergency brake” and sought treatment for depression. He remembers thinking about his three school-age kids. “I can’t be a blueprint for my children. I can’t let them be left alone or not to understand why he would have done that,” the first-term Pennsylvania Democrat told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in a deeply personal and introspective interview taped before the broadcast that aired Sunday. So he checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, last Feb. 15. “There was nowhere else to go,” he said, describing how he often felt during his stay that “there wasn’t any hope sometimes and like, ‘What do I have left?’” He also wondered whether he would survive politically. “When it got released where I was and where it was going, it was a big story. And so, I had assumed that that would be the end of my career,” he said When he sought treatment for clinical depression, Fetterman was still coping with the effects of the stroke he had in May 2022, during his campaign for one of the Senate’s most contested seats. “My heart technically stopped, and it was a very touch-and-go situation,” said Fetterman, 54. A pacemaker was implanted with a defibrillator to manage two heart conditions, atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy. His victory over Republican Mehmet Oz had helped Democrats keep control of the Senate and made him a national figure. It was the height of his political career. But he couldn’t make it out of bed at his home in Braddock, in western Pennsylvania. “I really scared my kids, and they thought, ’You won, Dad. Why aren’t we enough? Why are you still so sad? Why are you even more sad?' And it was hard for — to explain why I was. And, of course, a 9-year-old child wouldn’t understand that. And it was awful,” Fetterman said. So much so that he said he “pleaded not to go down to D.C.” later that November for orientation sessions in Washington for newly elected lawmakers. His favorite holiday was nearing, yet he was unable to think about getting Christmas presents for his children and “dreading” his swearing in on Capitol Hill early in the new year. Within two months, he was at Walter Reed. Aides had described the new senator as being withdrawn and uninterested in eating, discussing work or the usual banter with staff. “This is a conversation that I’ve had with myself and anybody that knows they’re unable to address their depression, is they start to have dark conversations with themself about self-harm,” Fetterman said. “And things continued to kind of tick off the list. And then I kind of hit the emergency brake."" He added, “I knew I needed help.” Before checking into Walter Reed, Fetterman had never publicly discussed his battle with depression. He has since said that he has experienced it on and off throughout his life. He left Walter Reed at the end of March after six weeks of inpatient treatment with his depression “in remission,” according to a statement from his office. Doctors describe “remission” as when a patient responds to treatment so that they have returned to normal social function and they are indistinguishable from someone who has never had depression. Fetterman has since become a visible presence in the Capitol, bantering with reporters, joking with Senate colleagues and speaking up at Senate hearings. To others who are now “facing a really dark holiday time,” Fetterman offered this guidance: “I know that last year’s was desolate. And this year’s might be desolate. Next year’s can be the best ever. And that’s what happened for me.” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-ml-israel-politics_n_6592f5d0e4b0b01d3e403eaa","2024-01-01","josef federman , melanie lidman","Israel's Supreme Court Overturns Key Part Of Netanyahu's Judicial Overhaul","JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s Supreme Court on Monday struck down a key component of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s contentious judicial overhaul, a decision that threatens to reopen the fissures in Israeli society that preceded the country’s ongoing war against Hamas. Those divisions were largely put aside while the country focuses on the war in Gaza, which was triggered by a bloody cross-border attack by Hamas. Monday’s court decision could reignite those tensions, which sparked months of mass protests against the government and had rattled the cohesion of the powerful military. There was no immediate reaction from Netanyahu. In Monday’s decision, the court narrowly voted to overturn a law passed in July that prevents judges from striking down government decisions they deem “unreasonable.” Opponents had argued that Netanyahu’s efforts to remove the standard of reasonability opens the door to corruption and improper appointments of unqualified cronies to important positions. The law was the first in a planned overhaul of the Israeli justice system. The overhaul was put on hold after Hamas militants carried out their Oct. 7 attack, killing some 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. Israel immediately declared war, and is pressing forward with an offensive that Palestinian health officials say has killed nearly 22,000 people in Gaza. In an 8-7 decision, the Supreme Court justices struck down the law because of the “severe and unprecedented harm to the core character of the State of Israel as a democratic country.” The justices also voted 12-3 that they had the authority to overturn so-called “Basic Laws,” major pieces of legislation that serve as a sort of constitution for Israel. It was a significant blow to Netanyahu and his hard-line allies, who claimed the national legislature, not the high court, should have the final word over the legality of legislation and other key decisions. The justices said the Knesset, or parliament, does not have “omnipotent” power. Netanyahu and his allies announced their sweeping overhaul plan shortly after taking office a year ago. It calls for curbing the power of the judges, from limiting the Supreme Court’s ability to review parliamentary decisions to changing the way judges are appointed. Netanyahu and his allies said the changes aim to strengthen democracy by limiting the authority of unelected judges and turning over more powers to elected officials. But opponents see the overhaul as a power grab by Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, and an assault on a key watchdog. Before the war, hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in weekly protests against the government. Among the demonstrators were military reservists, including fighter pilots and members of other elite units, who said they would stop reporting for duty if the overhaul was passed. The reservists make up the backbone of the military. While the reservists quickly returned to duty after the Oct. 7 attacks in a show of unity, it remains unclear what will happen if the overhaul efforts are revived. A resumption of the protests could undermine national unity and affect the military’s readiness if soldiers refuse to report for duty. Under the Israeli system, the prime minister governs through a majority coalition in parliament — in effect giving him control over the executive and legislative branches of government. As a result, the Supreme Court plays a critical oversight role. Critics say that by seeking to weaken the judiciary, Netanyahu and his allies are trying to erode the country’s checks and balances and consolidate power over the third, independent branch of government. Netanyahu’s allies include an array of ultranationalist and religious parties with a list of grievances against the court. His allies have called for increased West Bank settlement construction, annexation of the occupied territory, perpetuating military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men, and limiting the rights of LGBTQ+ people and Palestinians. The U.S. had previously urged Netanyahu to put the plans on hold and seek a broad consensus across the political spectrum. The next four years will change America forever.

Starting Monday, police there no longer will be allowed to pull over motorists solely because they have something hanging from the rearview mirror of the windshield. That means air fresheners, parking placards and, yes, even those dice are fair game to hang. The revised Illinois windshield rule is one of hundreds of new laws taking effect with the new year in states across the U.S. While some may seem a bit pedestrian, others have real practical effects or touch on controversial issues such as restrictions on weapons and medical treatments for transgender people. Though the original Illinois windshield law was meant to improve roadway safety, it came to be seen by some as an excuse for pulling over drivers. The new law still prohibits objects that obstruct a driver’s view but forbids law enforcement officers from conducting stops or searches solely because of suspected violations. “With this new law, we are sending a powerful message that the state does not tolerate racial profiling or other forms of discrimination,” said Democratic state Sen. Christopher Belt, one of the bill’s sponsors. Another new Illinois law seeks to stifle a more modern form of distracted driving by prohibiting people from participating in video conferences or scanning social media while behind the wheel. GUNS AND PORNOGRAPHY Several states have new laws regulating guns and online activity. A Minnesota law will allow authorities to ask courts for “ extreme risk protection orders ” to temporarily take guns from people deemed to be an imminent threat to others or themselves. Minnesota will be at least the 20th state with such a red-flag law. Colorado will become one of a dozen states banning so-called ghost guns. The new law prohibits firearms that are assembled at home or 3D-printed without serial numbers, practices that have allowed owners to evade background checks. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to block an Illinois law from taking effect Monday that bans high-powered semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines. But a federal judge recently blocked a California law that would have banned carrying concealed guns in many public places. Several state laws delve into acceptable online activities. A new Connecticut law requires online dating operators to adopt policies for handling harassment reports by or between users. A North Carolina law will require pornographic website operators to confirm viewers are at least 18 years old by using a commercially available database. The law lets parents sue companies if their children were allowed to access the pornography. Another new Illinois law will allow lawsuits from victims of deepfake pornography, in which videos or images are manipulated without their consent. LGBTQ+ ISSUES Over the past few years, there has been a major push by conservatives to restrict access to gender-affirming treatments for transgender minors. Bans are on the books in 22 states, including some where judges have paused enforcement as they consider challenges to the policies. New bans on access for minors to puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery, which is rare, are scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 in Idaho, Louisiana and West Virginia. The West Virginia law contains an exception: Teens could still access treatment with parental consent and a diagnosis of severe gender dysphoria from two doctors. While many Republican-led legislatures have imposed restrictions, many Democrat-dominated states have responded with transgender protections. A law taking effect Monday in Hawaii requires new marriage certificates to be issued to people who request to change how their sex is listed. The state also is replacing gender-specific terms in state law; “mother” is being replaced with “birthing parent” and “father” with “non-birthing parent.” In Colorado, new buildings wholly or partly owned by government entities will be required to have on every floor where there are public restrooms at least one that does not specify the gender of the users. The conservative push on LGBTQ+ policies also has come with efforts to keep certain books out of school or public libraries. An Indiana law taking effect makes it easier for parents and others to challenge books in school libraries. By contrast, a new Illinois law would block state funding for public libraries that ban or restrict books. TAXES AND WAGES The new year brings a variety of new laws on taxes and wages — perennial issues for state governments. More than 20 states will raise minimum wages for workers, further widening the gap between state requirements and the federal minimum, which has been static at $7.25 an hour since July 2009. In several states, the new minimum wage will more than double that rate. Maryland’s minimum wage will be set at $15 an hour. In New Jersey, it will be $15.13 an hour for most employees. In Connecticut, $15.69 per hour. In New York City, $16 an hour, though it will be $15 in most of the rest of the state. California’s statewide minimum wage also will rise to $16 per hour. And in Washington, the minimum rate will be $16.28. Residents in some states will gain money by paying less in taxes, continuing a three-year trend in which nearly every state has reduced, rebated or suspended some type of broad-based tax. In Kansas, the sales tax on groceries will drop from 4% to 2% in its next step toward eventual elimination, producing a savings of $208 annually for a family spending an average of $200 weekly on groceries. About 1 million tax filers are expected to benefit from Connecticut’s first income tax rate reduction since the mid-1990s. Lower-income workers and retirees also stand to benefit from expanded tax breaks. Missouri also will reduce its income tax rate while expanding tax exemptions for Social Security benefits and military training pay. Businesses will be able to claim tax credits for hiring interns or apprentices. The next four years will change America forever.

The troop movement could signal that fighting is being scaled back in some areas of Gaza, particularly in the northern half where the military has said it is close to assuming operational control. Israel has been under pressure from its chief ally, the United States, to begin to switch to lower-intensity fighting. Word of the drawdown came ahead of a visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the region and after the Biden administration bypassed Congress for the second time this month to approve an emergency weapons sale to Israel. But fierce fighting continued in other areas of Gaza, especially the southern city Khan Younis and central areas of the territory. Israel has pledged to charge ahead until its war aims have been achieved, including dismantling Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for 16 years. The military said in a statement Monday that five brigades, or several thousand troops, were being taken out of Gaza in the coming weeks for training and rest. In a briefing Sunday that first announced the troop withdrawal without specifying how many forces were leaving, army spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari did not say whether the decision meant Israel was launching a new phase of the war. “The objectives of the war require prolonged fighting, and we are preparing accordingly,” he said. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas’ military and governing capabilities in its war, which was sparked by the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people. Roughly 240 people were taken hostage. Israel responded with a blistering air, ground and sea offensive that has killed more than 21,900 people in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. Israel says more than 8,000 militants have been killed, without providing evidence. It blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll, saying the militants embed within residential areas, including schools and hospitals. The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, sending swells of people seeking shelter in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless bombed. Palestinians are left with a sense that nowhere is safe in the tiny enclave. BATTLES IN THE SOUTH In Khan Younis, where Israel is believed to have thousands of troops, residents reported airstrikes and shelling in the west and center of the city. The military and the militant group Islamic Jihad reported clashes in the area. The Palestinian Red Crescent said on X, formerly Twitter, that it transported several dead and injured following a strike late Sunday in the Beach Street in Khan Younis. It posted nighttime footage showing medics carrying casualties to ambulances. Combat was also reported in urban refugee camps in central Gaza, where Israel expanded its offensive last week. “It’s our routine: bombings, massacres and martyrs,” said Saeed Moustafa, a Palestinian from the Nuseirat camp. He said he could hear sporadic explosions and gunfire in Nuseirat and in the nearby Bureij and Maghazi camps. “Just as we speak, there is a big explosion not far from my home,” he said in a phone call Monday morning. Gaza’s Health Ministry said Monday that 156 people were killed in the past day. The Israeli military meanwhile said an airstrike killed Adel Mismah, a regional commander of Hamas’ elite Nukhba forces, in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Hamas fired a large barrage of rockets toward Israel, including at its commercial hub Tel Aviv, as the clock struck midnight on New Year’s Eve. ‘A DIFFERENT MODE OF OPERATION’ Israel has said the war will last for months. It has argued that it needs time to clear Gaza of militants’ weapons and infrastructure and to prevent Hamas from being able to stage more attacks. Israel has resisted international calls for a long-term cease-fire, saying doing so would amount to a victory for Hamas. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general once in charge of strategic planning in the Israeli military, said the troop changes may be a result of the U.S. pressure. He said it indicated a shift in how Israel was conducting the war in some areas. “The war is not stopping,” said Brom. “It is the beginning of a different mode of operation.” Israelis still largely support the wars aims, even as the cost in soldiers’ lives is mounting. Over the weekend, the military said that of the soldiers killed since the ground operation began — as of Monday, 172 in total — 18 were killed by friendly fire while another 11 died by weapons or equipment malfunctions or accidents. ___ Jobain reported from Rafah, Gaza Strip and Magdy from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The queen, who is Europe’s longest-reigning living monarch, announced during her New Year’s speech that she would step down on Jan. 14th, which is the anniversary of her own accession to the throne at age 31 following the death of her father, King Frederik IX. Margrethe, 83, said the back surgery she underwent in early 2023 led to “thoughts about the future” and when to pass on the responsibilities of the crown to her son. “I have decided that now is the right time,” she said in her speech. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen paid tribute to her in a statement, offering a “heartfelt thank you to Her Majesty the Queen for her lifelong dedication and tireless efforts for the Kingdom.” Margrethe is the “epitome of Denmark” Frederiksen’s statement read, and “throughout the years has put words and feelings into who we are as a people and as a nation.” The 6-foot-tall (1.82-meters-tall), chain-smoking Margrethe has been one of the most popular public figures in Denmark, where the monarch’s role is largely ceremonial. She often walked the streets of Copenhagen virtually unescorted and won the admiration of Danes for her warm manners and for her talents as a linguist and designer. A keen skier, she was a member of a Danish women’s air force unit as a princess, taking part in judo courses and endurance tests in the snow. Margrethe remained tough even as she grew older. In 2011, at age 70, she visited Danish troops in southern Afghanistan wearing a military jumpsuit. As monarch, she crisscrossed the country and regularly visited Greenland and the Faeroe Islands, the two semi-independent territories which are part of the Danish Realm, and was met everywhere by cheering crowds. Denmark has Europe’s oldest ruling monarchy, which traces its line back to the Viking king Gorm the Old, who died in 958. Although Magrethe is head of state, the Danish Constitution strictly ruled out her involvement in party politics. Yet the queen was clearly well-versed in law and knew the contents of the legislation she was called upon to sign. She received training in French and English from her earliest years, as well as Swedish from her mother. In addition to archaeology, she studied philosophy, political science and economics at universities in Copenhagen, Aarhus and Cambridge along with the London School of Economics and the Sorbonne in Paris. Ever since his birth on May 26, 1968, Frederik André Henrik Christian has been the heir to the Danish throne. He is the oldest son of Queen Margrethe and her late French-born husband, Prince Henrik, who died February 2018. Frederik, 55, has a younger brother, Prince Joachim. Since the age of 18, he has served as regent whenever his mother was outside the kingdom and carried out official duties, shaking hands with thousands and receiving foreign dignitaries. The queen’s announcement made up only a few sentences at the end of her wide-ranging New Year’s speech which reflected on the “turbulence and upheaval in the world” amid the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, and the climate crisis. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tyre-nichols-killing-memphis-police_n_658329fae4b03e698a11c6cc","2024-01-01","phillip jackson","A Lot — And Very Little — Has Changed In Memphis Since Tyre Nichols’ Death","Tyre Nichols was about two minutes from his home on the night of Jan. 7, 2023, when Memphis police stopped him. Police vehicles surrounded him, and officers shouted threats and demanded he get out of his car. In the next moments, all caught on body-worn cameras, officers pulled the 29-year-old from his vehicle, then took turns punching, beating, kicking, pepper-spraying and hitting him with a stun gun as he called out for his mother. Nichols died in the hospital three days later. Demonstrations broke out across the country following Nichols’ death. The five officers, who were all Black, were swiftly fired from the police force; the elite tactical unit they belonged to, which specialized in street crime, was disbanded. One officer, Desmond Mills Jr., pleaded guilty to civil rights and conspiracy charges in November. The other four officers — Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Justin Smith — are still awaiting trial on murder charges and federal civil rights violations. Nearly a year after Nichols’ death, Memphis finds itself at a crossroads — and at the center of a national debate about what police reform can or should look like. The city has a new mayor, progressive district attorney and ordinance meant to put an end to the kinds of traffic stops that preceded Nichols’ death. But many question whether Memphis has made, or can make, real progress. In April, the Memphis City Council passed the Driver Equality Act — locals often call it the “Tyre Nichols ordinance” — which was meant to keep police from stopping drivers for minor traffic infractions. Officers initially claimed they had pulled over Nichols for reckless driving. Under it, Memphis police are also required to make public their data about pulling over civilians and what happens when they do. Memphis police published a database before the ordinance passed, but it doesn’t include all of the details required under the new mandate, such as the type of stop, type of vehicle and if some use of force was used during the encounter. But residents and activists say one ordinance alone can only change so much, especially if it’s not clearly enforced. “We still have the exact same training, the exact same culture — so why would you expect that anything would have fundamentally changed?” Hunter Demster, an activist with the police reform group Decarcerate Memphis, told HuffPost. “The city and the country were in such shocking dismay” after Nichols was killed, he added. “The fact that you cannot put any finger on any type of real change is deafening.” Demster alleges that he personally has been pulled over multiple times for a broken taillight since the passage of the Driving Equality Act. He said he has reported traffic stops in Memphis, including his own, to the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. And he’s concerned for the drivers from marginalized communities who have historically been targeted at traffic stops. Black drivers in Memphis were disproportionately stopped between 2017 and 2021, according to Shelby County court records obtained by Decarcerate Memphis, and were twice as likely to receive multiple citations on one ticket as white drivers. Chase Madkins, a Black father in Memphis, told HuffPost he doesn’t believe the new ordinance has changed policing in the city. Madkins said he was falsely arrested during a traffic stop in May. He said officers accused him of driving a stolen vehicle, which Madkins had recently purchased from an auction. Madkins alleges that an officer attempted to pull him out of the car, wrapping her arms around his neck and abdomen while he still had his seatbelt on. Madkins’ 2-year-old son was in the vehicle with him. “I told them, ‘You know what y’all was doing is illegal. The Tyre Nichols ordinance doesn’t allow for y’all to do these types of stops,’” he told HuffPost. “The officer said he would look into it, but he was trying to sweep it to the side.” “They literally detained me and were attempting to detain my son,” he said. “I was livid to even see them physically touching my child.” Madkins’ case was dismissed three months later because he hadn’t been driving a stolen vehicle. Part of the responsibility to enforce the Driving Equality Act will fall on newly elected Memphis Mayor Paul Young. Young has publicly supported the traffic-stop ordinance. Nevertheless, activists are concerned over the mayor-elect’s decision to keep Cerelyn Davis, who was already a controversial figure in the city before Nichols’ death, in her role as police chief. Davis previously led the “Red Dog” unit at the Atlanta Police Department, which had a reputation for terrorizing the city’s residents. She established a similar unit as leader of the Memphis Police Department: the SCORPION Unit, which stands for Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods and soon gained a similar reputation. All five officers who pulled over Nichols were members of the unit, and Davis disbanded it after his death. “These are all various different types of really aggressive police units that are hyperaggressive and over-police Black folks in urban neighborhoods,” Kareem Ali, a Memphis activist who works closely with Nichols’ family, told HuffPost. “With Tyre, it has opened up a conversation and policy change and enforced accountability in these types of police units that profile Black people while driving.” Residents are also skeptical of Young for selecting Tony Armstrong, a former Memphis Police director, to handle policing issues on his transition team. In July, Armstrong chastised Black Lives Matter supporters and activists for not being concerned about “Black-on-Black crime,” telling a local television station, “There should not be an asterisk (that) Black lives matter only when they are taken by law enforcement official.” Police oversight will also fall to the office of Steve Mulroy, who became the Shelby County district attorney in September 2022. Many Memphis residents were cautiously optimistic that his election would serve as a turning point for the city after the long tenure of Amy Weirich. The DA’s office immediately made some changes, including establishing the city’s first-ever unit tasked with handling wrongful convictions — something Weirich had long been against. Most recently, the unit reviewed the case of Gershun Freeman, a Black man who died in custody of the Shelby County Sheriff’s Department in 2022. Nine Shelby County deputies were charged in Freeman’s death in September, Mulroy’s office announced. “He has done tenfold better than past district attorneys, and I can’t imagine navigating that field with the state legislator coming after you, right-wing people coming after you, left-wing people coming after you,” Demster said. “I think in his first year in office he has a good start, but he has a long way to go.” “There is a lot of political chess going on. If he does not pursue certain cases, prosecute certain cases, the state can remove him,” he added, noting that Tennessee’s Republican governor has the right to remove a district attorney. Memphis had seen other high-profile shootings of citizens by police over the years, but the officers involved saw minimal repercussions. During her tenure as district attorney from 2011 to 2022, Weirich did not file charges against any officer in a case involving a civilian dying due to lethal force used by police. In 2015, then-Memphis Police Officer Connor Schilling fatally shot Darrius Stewart, a 19-year-old Black man, during a traffic stop. A grand jury did not indict Schilling; after Nichols’ death, Stewart’s family demanded that a new grand jury be convened. Mulroy’s office said in February that it would review information on Stewart’s case, but no movement has been made. In 2018, Martavious Banks, a Black man who was 24 at the time, was critically injured when then-Memphis Police Officer Jamarcus Jeames shot him as he ran toward his mother’s home during a traffic stop. Jeames violated policy by not having his body camera operating during the shooting, and he resigned. But none of these cases caught national attention as Nichols’ did. The Department of Justice opened a pattern and practice investigation into the Memphis Police Department in July, which is ongoing and may take up to a year to conduct. The DOJ is investigating whether Memphis police exhibited bias during traffic stops and participated in discriminatory policing, and could impose new guidance on officers if it determines they did. Tennessee state Rep. Justin Pearson (D) told HuffPost that Nichols shouldn’t have had to die for local reform to start taking place. “We have to remember, as we remember Tyre and so many lives lost to police brutality and racism, that was the same situation as the loss of Emmett Till. It shook the nation,” he said. “It should not be this way. It should not require the death of more Black people for our country to have consciousness. We do not have to wait for a tragedy to happen in order to do that work.” But Memphis residents — and people nationwide — are still waiting for police reform at the federal level. Nichols’ death prompted lawmakers to discuss once again trying to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The legislation is focused on bringing an end to tactics such as no-knock warrants and would make it easier for officers to be prosecuted for crimes against civilians; Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said during Nichols’ funeral that the bill should include a “Tyre Nichols duty to intervene” amendment, which would require an officer or officers to intervene in a situation deemed as excessive force by one of their partners on a civilian. The original bill passed the House and has been sent to the Senate, but has not moved since March 2021. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-senate-2024_n_658c420ae4b014ec45a2f589","2024-01-01","igor bobic","The Senate Is Turning More MAGA ― And It Could Boost A 2nd Trump Presidency","WASHINGTON ― A second Donald Trump presidency could be more unbound thanks to the changing face of the Republican Party, where traditional GOP stalwarts are gradually being replaced with hard-charging MAGA loyalists eager to defend and amplify his tactics. During his first term in office, Trump squared off with the likes of John McCain, Bob Corker, and Mitt Romney, establishment Republican senators who were often a thorn in his side. Now, many of the lawmakers most likely to push back against his worst instincts are either gone or heading for the exits, and a favorable electoral landscape for the GOP next year could install even more dutiful Trump allies in the upper chamber, who will be more eager to help his promised campaign of revenge than hinder it. It’s an open question as to how long 81-year-old Mitch McConnell ― the Senate GOP leader who Trump loathes ― will stick around after battling ailments this year. There is growing evidence that his once-dominant influence within the conference is waning amid numerous challenges from a wing of conservative and MAGA-allied senators who are eager to flex their muscles and forge closer ties to the de facto leader of their party. Trump’s campaign already has the backing of over 100 Republicans in Congress ― including 17 of 49 sitting GOP senators ― despite him facing historic criminal charges in four separate cases and his being impeached twice, including for trying to overturn his loss in the 2020 election. That number is only expected to grow as Trump continues his march toward the GOP presidential nomination. With just a few weeks until voters begin to cast their ballots, he dominates in polls of the 2024 race by a wide margin. The field has yet to consolidate behind an alternative; it may be too late by the time it even does. A resounding win in the Iowa caucuses could help seal the deal early for Trump, making the following primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina less relevant and setting him up for a glide path to victory. Trump’s allies believe it’s only a matter of time until the rest of the party gets behind the program ― and that this time, if he wins, his agenda, which could include massive camps to hold immigrants awaiting deportation, further corporate tax cuts and an economically disruptive 10% tariff, would be much easier to enact. “A lot of people are politically cautious, they don’t want to get involved in the primary while it’s going on, but my view is the primary is effectively over, and I’ve encouraged my colleagues to get on board,” said Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), a top MAGA supporter in Congress. “The more populist or America First side of [the GOP] will have more of an upper hand the second time around than it did in the first,” he predicted. “But it’s going to be a work in progress. These things take time.” Trump has been open about seeking vengeance in his second term, vowing to weaponize the government against his opponents if he returns to power. He has suggested that he would direct the Department of Justice to open investigations into President Joe Biden, his family and others. His allies have also described sweeping plans to expand the presidency and give Trump more power than ever if he is elected to the White House again. Many of those plans will hinge on support from his party in Congress. Some Republicans have expressed unease with the idea of restructuring federal agencies or the civil service, but there’s no telling what Trump could accomplish by pushing the bounds of executive power on his own, especially with a conservative 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court. The Senate will, at least, have a say in approving who leads Trump’s executive agencies if he wins again. An extreme choice for attorney general like Stephen Miller, who is known for his anti-immigration views, for example, would face difficulty with the current GOP leadership, but the math gets better for such a scenario with each year more Trump loyalists fill the Senate. In 2022, Trump gained several new allies in the Senate who are now enthusiastically backing his 2024 bid. Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) replaced Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who was one of a handful of Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, Vance replaced Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a former George W. Bush administration official, and Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) replaced veteran dealmaker Roy Blunt. Trump stands to gain even more allies next year, with West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice almost certain to replace Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and several other Trump acolytes vying for seats, including businessman Bernie Moreno in Ohio and veteran Tim Sheehy in Montana, both in states represented by vulnerable Senate Democrats facing reelection. Meanwhile, GOP resistance to Trump in the Senate is fleeting, and there are even signs of fatigue among some anti-Trump senators. If he wins the nomination, Trump will once again dominate questions to GOP lawmakers about his many rants, incendiary threats against opponents, or his racist comments. Some lawmakers have already taken to refusing to answer questions about the 2024 campaign entirely. Romney, Trump’s loudest critic who voted to convict him in both his impeachment trials, is retiring next year and the odds seem low that Utahns will elect someone as committed to battling the former president as he did. Even he seems a bit worn out from denouncing Trump all the time. “Donald Trump says so many absurd things,” Romney said recently in response to a Trump interview in which he said he would only be a dictator on “day one” of his presidency. “I sort of laugh at what he’s saying,” he added. “The other day, he was saying, ‘We’re going to get rid of Obamacare.’ It’s like, really, what have you got? You said that when you were president, did you ever introduce a plan to replace Obamacare? No. So at some point, you realize you don’t have to take him literally, and you don’t have to take him seriously either.” Asked about Trump’s much-criticized comments that migrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country, Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) replied sarcastically: “Looks like I’m looking forward to another year of answering these questions.” Earlier this year, the Indiana Republican vowed not to support Trump in the 2024 GOP race, saying that conservatives would not be well served “by electing someone whose core competency seems to be owning someone on Twitter.” Now he, too, seems to be dreading the odds that Trump wins the nomination again. “Horse race? Is it a horse race? No,” Young said earlier this month when a reporter tried to ask him about another Trump 2024 campaign-related question. Of course, Republicans could have avoided this scenario had more of them voted to convict Trump after Jan. 6, 2021, which would have disqualified him from holding future elected office. But a second Trump presidency, if it comes to pass, wouldn’t be entirely free of GOP detractors. Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska aren’t expected to leave Congress any time soon, and they’ve both shown a willingness to criticize the former president and join Democrats in voting against his priorities in Congress. Murkowski, for example, recently condemned Trump for making “hateful” comments about immigrants, saying that it is his rhetoric that is “poisoning our country.” The Alaska Republican won reelection to another six-year term last year and is more insulated from political pressure than most of her colleagues. Which Republican eventually succeeds McConnell in the Senate as leader could also help determine the fate of a possible second Trump presidency. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the minority whip and No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is considered a possible successor in the mold of McConnell. Thune backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) in the 2024 race and has made positive comments about former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Another possible successor, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), on the other hand, has backed Trump and is more aligned with the MAGA wing of the party. It’s not hard to tell which way the wind is blowing, however. The McConnell-backed freshman Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama, a rising star at age 41 who had been mentioned as a possible face of the GOP post-Trump, recently endorsed the former president’s 2024 bid. In an op-ed, Britt framed the choice as between Trump and Biden, even though there are several other (and younger) choices in the GOP race. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who once called Flordia Gov. Ron DeSantis the “leader” of the Republican Party, acknowledged that the GOP is “in transition” right now. “I do think that what I would call the ‘neocon’ part of the Republican Party is all but gone, and so there is more pragmatic thought on matters that involve not only the Department of Defense but the U.S. role in foreign conflicts,” Lummis said. “I do think in that regard President Trump has influenced some of the thinking. It’s healthy.” And Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), another Trump-skeptical Republican who had endorsed Scott’s failed 2024 bid, pointed out that the Republican base doesn’t see an alternative to Trump right now, even with other GOP candidates in the race.

And then it hit Los Angeles and perhaps Austin around 2015. You’d be walking down the street and get a whiff of something unique and intoxicating that was spicy and comforting all at once. It was strong and it lingered, so even if you wanted to ask the delicious stranger which scent they were wearing, they’d be long gone. It started as the aromatic emblem of American hipster culture, but Le Labo Santal 33 now has a chokehold on people of ages, genders and socioeconomic brackets (I’d keep buying the $7 sample every week, like some kind of fragrance fiend, until I could afford a small bottle). “It’s a gender-bending scent that defies traditional scent categories, with creamy sandalwood and cedarwood mingling with smoky papyrus and leathery notes,” said Bernadette Lim, a perfumer and fragrance specialist I tapped to better understand what continues to make people so rabid for Santal 33. The fact that it transcends what we’ve been conditioned to believe smells either “girly” or “masculine” is a huge selling point. The initial challenge of Santal 33, Lim argues, is part of its allure. “This complexity sparks curiosity, inviting a deeper exploration that makes the journey of appreciation more rewarding,” she said. “It develops and evolves on the skin, revealing new facets like the green, floral-woody combo.” Its dynamic nature gives the scent new life with every wear. Lim made me realize that I love bold scents that embrace the notes and traits that Santal 33 does. I truly believe the fragrance increased our collective thirst for sandalwood, leather, and a heavier scent that lustily lingers. If you’re looking to diversify your collection, here are 17 decadent scent alternatives that match Le Labo’s complexity and longevity.

The New Year’s Day quake, whose preliminary magnitude was respectively measured at 7.5 by the U.S. Geological Survey and at 7.6 by Japanese agencies, was followed by multiple powerful aftershocks. At least three deaths were reported by CNN, Financial Times and NBC. HuffPost did not independently confirm those reports. The Japan Meteorological Agency initially issued a “major tsunami warning” for portions of Ishikawa prefecture, where the quake was centered, saying waves could reach roughly 16 feet. That warning was later downgraded, saying waves could potentially reach 10 feet. Early Tuesday morning, the agency downgraded the alert again, to a tsunami advisory, but still advised residents that deadly waves could occur, according to the Associated Press. The agency also advised residents to watch for additional potential quakes over the next few days. On Monday, TV broadcasts urged “immediate” evacuation, with residents told to seek higher ground or move to the top floors of taller buildings. Authorities issued warnings for Niigata, Toyama, Yamagata, Fukui and Hyogo prefectures. Much of the rest of the coast along the Sea of Japan was placed under a tsunami advisory, where smaller waves may be expected. Multiple rail lines ― including Shinkansen routes ― have been suspended, and some highways near the quake’s epicenter have been closed, according to NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster. There are also reports of fires, building collapses and landslides. No abnormalities have been detected at the nation’s nuclear power plants, the government said. North Korea and South Korea issued tsunami warnings to residents after the quake in Japan. South Korea’s meteorological agency reported a small tsunami on the country’s eastern coast Monday morning, and said that there was the potential for larger waves to come. Officials of Ishikawa Prefecture's Suzu City say they have confirmed several houses and power poles have collapsed following a magnitude 7.4 quake Monday afternoon. https://t.co/IhqLpATlRE One of Japan’s worst natural disasters came in 2011, when a magnitude 9.0 quake triggered a tsunami, which in turn led to a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. More than 18,000 people were killed in that disaster. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

In Australia, more than 1 million people watched a pyrotechnic display centered around Sydney’s famous Opera House and harbor bridge — a number of spectators equivalent to one in five of the city’s residents. “It’s total madness,” said German tourist Janna Thomas, who waited in line since 7:30 a.m. to secure a prime waterfront location. Some 90,000 police and security officers were deployed around France including along Champs-Elysees Avenue, where large crowds took in a multidimensional light show projected onto the Arc de Triomphe showcasing the history of Paris and sports on the menu for next year's Summer Olympics in the city. In New York, people lined up early to nab a spot in Times Square for the midnight ball drop. Officials and party organizers said they were prepared to keep tens of thousands of revelers safe in the heart of Manhattan, as the city has seen near-daily protests sparked by the Israel-Hamas war. Stunning fireworks displays bloomed at iconic locations like the Acropolis in Athens, Greece; reflected in the sleek glass walls of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates; and accompanied a collective cheer filling the air in Nairobi, Kenya. China celebrated relatively quietly, with most major cities banning fireworks over safety and pollution concerns. Still, people gathered and performers danced in colorful costumes in Beijing, while a crowd released wish balloons in Chongqing. During his New Year address, President Xi Jinping said the country would focus on building momentum for economic recovery in 2024 and pledged China would “surely be reunified” with Taiwan. In Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, the mood was upbeat as revelers gathered for a fireworks show at the bamboo-shaped Taipei 101 skyscraper and at concerts and other events citywide. In India, thousands of revelers from the financial hub of Mumbai watched the sun set over the Arabian Sea. Fireworks in New Delhi raised concerns that the capital — already infamous for its poor air quality — would be blanketed by a toxic haze on the first morning of the new year. Across Japan, people gathered at temples such as the Tsukiji Temple in Tokyo, where visitors were given free hot milk and corn soup as they stood in line to strike a massive bell. At the Vatican, Pope Francis recalled 2023 as a year marked by wartime suffering. During his traditional Sunday blessing from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square, he offered prayers for “the tormented Ukrainian people and the Palestinian and Israeli populations, the Sudanese people and many others.” “At the end of the year, we will have the courage to ask ourselves how many human lives have been shattered by armed conflict, how many dead and how much destruction, how much suffering, how much poverty,” the pontiff said. In Russia, the country's military actions in Ukraine overshadowed end-of-year celebrations, with the usual fireworks and concert on Moscow’s Red Square canceled, as they were last year. Even without the festivities, people gathered in the square,and some cheered and pointed their phones at a clock counting down the year's final seconds. After shelling in the Russian border city of Belgorod Saturday killed 24 people, some local authorities across the country also canceled their firework displays, including in Vladivostok. Millions were expected to tune in to President Vladimir Putin’s New Year’s prerecorded address, in which he said no force could divide Russians and stop the country’s development. Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 35 people Sunday, hospital officials said, as fighting raged across the tiny enclave a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war will continue for “many more months,” resisting international calls for a cease-fire. Skyscrapers in Tel Aviv were lit up in yellow to call for the release of hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza for more than 80 days. “While you are counting down until the new year, our time and our lives stopped,"" said Moran Betzer Tayar, the aunt of Yagev Buchshtab, a 34-year-old hostage. In the Gaza Strip, displaced Palestinians huddled around fires in a makeshift refugee camp. “From the intensity of the pain we live, we do not feel that there is a new year,” said Kamal al-Zeinaty, who has lost multiple family members in the conflict. “All the days are the same.” In Iraq, a Christmas tree was decorated with Palestinian flags and symbolic bodies in funeral shrouds, placed beside a liberty monument in central Baghdad. Many Christians in Iraq have cancelled this year’s festivities in solidarity with Gaza, and have chosen to limit their celebrations to prayers and rituals. “We hope that the new year, 2024, will be a year of goodness, prosperity and joy,” said Ahmed Ali, a Baghdad resident. In Muslim-majority Pakistan, the government banned all New Year’s Eve celebrations in solidarity with the Palestinians. New York Mayor Eric Adams said there were “no specific threats” to his city’s annual bash. Nevertheless, police said they would expand the security perimeter around the party, creating a “buffer zone” that would allow them to head off potential demonstrations. On New Year's Eve 2022, a machete-wielding man attacked three police officers a few blocks from Times Square. The next four years will change America forever.

In Berlin, some 4,500 police officers were expected to keep order and avoid riots like those seen a year ago. Authorities also banned the traditional use of firecrackers for several streets across the city. They also banned a pro-Palestinian protest in the Neukoelln neighborhood of the German capital, which has seen several pro-Palestinian riots.

In an interview with Israeli Army Radio, ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that his “demand” was for Gaza to stop being a “hotbed where 2 million people grow up on hatred and aspire to destroy the State of Israel.” He did not specify why Palestinian civilians in Gaza would aspire to destroy Israel. According to a translation by Haaretz, the Religious Zionism party chairman also said that Israel must occupy and resettle Gaza in order to regain security. “If we act strategically, they will emigrate and we will live there. We won’t let 2 million stay. With 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs in Gaza, the ‘day after’ debate will be different,” Smotrich said, as translated by an Israel analyst with the nonprofit Crisis Group. “They want to leave, they’ve been living in a ghetto for 75 years.” Smotrich agrees with @mashagessen that Gaza is a ghetto: ""If we act strategically they will emigrate and we will live there. We won't let 2 million stay. With 100-200K in Gaza, the 'day after' debate will be diff. They want to leave, they've been living in a ghetto for 75 years."" https://t.co/jbUaFBClMF Comparing the plight of Palestinians to the suffering of European Jews during the Nazi regime has been a taboo subject, though human rights organizations and scholars have drawn similarities between the two struggles, particularly after Oct. 7. Just days ago, South Africa launched a case at the top United Nations court accusing Israel of carrying out the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Earlier this month, prominent Russian American journalist and writer Masha Gessen was almost not awarded the prestigious Hannah Arendt prize in Germany after they published an essay in The New Yorker comparing Gaza to the Jewish ghettos of Nazi-occupied Europe. “For the last seventeen years, Gaza has been a hyperdensely populated, impoverished, walled-in compound where only a small fraction of the population had the right to leave for even a short amount of time ― in other words, a ghetto,” they wrote in their Dec. 9 essay. “Not like the Jewish ghetto in Venice or an inner-city ghetto in America but like a Jewish ghetto in an Eastern European country occupied by Nazi Germany.” “Presumably, the more fitting term ‘ghetto’ would have drawn fire for comparing the predicament of besieged Gazans to that of ghettoized Jews,” they continued. “It also would have given us the language to describe what is happening in Gaza now. The ghetto is being liquidated.” This is not the first time Smotrich has spoken offensively of Palestinians. In March, the minister delivered a speech in Paris claiming that there is no Palestinian “nation,” “history” or “language.” In February, he called for a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank to be “erased” after Jewish settlers rampaged through it in response to a shooting attack that killed two Israelis. Immediately after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, he reportedly told fellow Cabinet members that “it’s time to be cruel,” even if it means killing hostages in Gaza in the process. But Smotrich is not the only Israeli official saying the quiet part out loud about Gaza. Several of the country’s lawmakers have made comments appearing to support a second Nakba (when Palestinians were expelled from their homes and land en masse 75 years ago) in Gaza in order to feel a sense of security after the war. Last week, lawmaker Danny Danon told Kan Bet radio that it would be humane for Israel to “make it easier for Gazans to leave for other countries.” Intelligence Minister Gila Gamiliel published an op-ed in The Jerusalem Post last month suggesting that Western nations should take in Palestinians from Gaza as an act of “voluntary resettlement.” Netanyahu himself has made similar comments, telling members of his right-wing Likud coalition at a meeting last week that the mass expulsion of Palestinians out of Gaza would be a positive outcome of the bombardment. Nihad Awad, the national executive director for the Muslim rights group CAIR, released a statement on Sunday demanding that the Biden administration condemn the “latest open call for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.” “Our nation’s leaders must finally acknowledge what has long been known and demonstrated daily by Israel’s genocidal actions,” Awad said. “That Israel’s racist government seeks to ethnically cleanse Gaza by slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians and making it unlivable for those it does not kill.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Kathleen Wilson filed the lawsuit last week in Hennepin County District Court, accusing Dr. Kevin Molldrem of Molldrem Family Dentistry in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, of providing negligent treatment in July 2020 that caused significant injuries to Wilson, along with providing an unsafe dosage of anesthesia and falsifying medical records to cover it up, the Star Tribune reported. Molldrem and his attorney, Nathaniel Weimer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday. According to the Star Tribune, Wilson’s legal team retained Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist in Florida, to provide an expert opinion and review Wilson’s medical records from Molldrem and subsequent providers. Goldstein’s Nov. 14 report identified various duty-of-care breaches. Goldstein said in the report that Molldrem made the right diagnosis, but he provided poor-quality treatment. Wilson had decay on “virtually every tooth in her mouth, something that is quite rare,” Goldstein wrote. Molldrem’s attempt to restore all Wilson’s teeth in one visit did nothing to address her susceptibility to disease or the potential of losing teeth, he said. “Katie required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease. Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanely possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner,” Goldstein said, adding that it is “inconceivable” to address 28 teeth in 5 1⁄2 hours. One challenge of a long appointment is maintaining adequate anesthesia, Goldstein said. The maximum dosage is 490 mg — but Molldrem administered 960 mg to Wilson. Wilson’s records show that Molldrem said he administered eight tubes of dental anesthetic, known as carpules. But Goldstein found the first dose alone was eight carpules, and he administered 15 carpules throughout the visit. Wilson went to a different dental office for an evaluation showing recurrent decay and other damage. For several months in 2022 she was treated at the University of Minnesota Dental School “for repair and replacement of many of her restorations in an attempt to stabilize her mouth,” Goldstein said.

Eddie Bernice Johnson Dies At 88","DALLAS, Texas (AP) — Trailblazing longtime U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, a nurse from Texas who helped bring hundreds of millions of federal dollars to the Dallas area as the region’s most powerful Democrat, died Sunday. She was 88. Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson and many other leaders issued statements about her death after her son posted about it on Facebook. The Dallas Morning News also confirmed her death with an unnamed source close to the family. No cause of death was given. “She was the single most effective legislator Dallas has ever had,” the mayor said in a statement. “Nobody brought more federal infrastructure money home to our city. Nobody fought harder for our communities and our residents’ interests and safety. And nobody knew how to navigate Washington better for the people of Dallas.” Eddie Bernice Johnson served in the House for three decades after becoming the first registered nurse elected to Congress and first Black chief psychiatric nurse at Dallas’ Veterans Affairs hospital. She went on to become the first Black woman to chair the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and she also led the Congressional Black Caucus. She left office in January after repeatedly delaying her retirement. Before Congress, she served in the Texas legislature. Johnson used her committee leadership position to fight against Republican efforts to block action on climate change. Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford said Johnson was “a fierce advocate for expanding STEM opportunities to Black and minority students” who also played a key role in helping the Biden administration pass a major package of incentives for computer chip manufacturers. Johnson was born in Waco and grew up in the segregated South. Dallas’ once-segregated Union Station was renamed in her honor in 2019. Her own experience with racism helped spur her to get involved in politics. She recalled that officials at the VA hospital were shocked that she was Black after they hired her sight-unseen, so they rescinded their offer for her to live in a dorm on campus. She told The Dallas Morning News in 2020 that officials would go into patients’ rooms ahead of her to “say that I was qualified.” The next four years will change America forever.

On Tuesday, the actor shared an image of herself on Instagram accompanied by a lengthy caption discussing the ups and downs of her 2023, writing, “What a year.” “This past year humbled me, broke me, built me, betrayed me, freed me, and showed me what it means to really be alive,” Bush said. “No more playing small. No more turning my back on myself. No more settling for what falls short because ‘who am I to ask for more?’ This year put me back in my body.” She said that 2023 taught her to listen to herself and to “not care about optics and instead invest in honesty,” and how that led her to leave some relationships behind. “It took me out of relationship with many of you but put me back into relationship with myself,” she said. In August, People reported that Bush had filed for divorce from Grant Hughes after a little over a year of marriage. She has since been rumored to be dating retired U.S. soccer star Ashlyn Harris, though they have not publicly confirmed their romance. Toward the end of the Instagram post, Bush also reflected on dealing with an illness. “This year I slowed down; first because illness forced me to. Second because recovery required more stillness,” she said. “In that way both sickness and healing are a gift. For those gifts I am so grateful.” Bush is presumably referencing the illness she had while working on a West End production of “2:22 A Ghost Story” in London. In July, she revealed in an Instagram post that she left the play after contracting a virus. “After weeks of being intermittently pulled off stage & visiting multiple doctors, specialists, & an all nighter in the ER, I’ve been advised by my medical team in London & America to stop performing in order to get this under control & to do so in the country where I reside under the care of my own doctors,” she wrote in the post’s caption.

Family members identified Keith “KJ” Frierson on GoFundMe as the 10-year-old victim of a fatal shooting on Saturday, after a boy of the same age allegedly stole his father’s gun. The boy who authorities say shot Keith has been arrested and charged with murder, while his father, 53-year-old Arkete Davis, is facing multiple charges including child endangerment. According to a release from the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office, deputies responded to a report of a shooting outside Keith’s family home in Foothill Farms, where they found him unresponsive and bleeding from his head and neck. Keith’s godmother, Nina Trepagnier, told CBS affiliate KOVR-TV that Keith was outside riding a bike he’d gotten as a Christmas gift. “He was helping [his mother] bring in groceries and he had just gotten his bike for Christmas, and he wanted to go out there to ride his bike,” Trepagnier told the outlet. “He was outside for all of 15 or 20 minutes just literally riding his bike right here with another little kid.” According to the statement from the sheriff’s office, responding deputies began performing life-saving efforts on Keith until fire department personnel arrived to the scene. Keith was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead, authorities said. In a post on social media, Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper said the shooting occurred in front of a 6-year-old boy. Trepagnier also indicated that Keith’s older brother was present at the scene. “His brother had to see his little brother laying on the ground, covered in blood,” Trepagnier told KOVR-TV. Witnesses told deputies that the child who allegedly shot Keith ran to a nearby apartment. Law enforcement detained everyone inside, including Arkete Davis and his two children, authorities said. According to the sheriff’s office, earlier that day Davis’ 10-year-old son had gone to get cigarettes for his father from the car, where he found a gun. The 10-year-old allegedly took the gun from the car, then “bragged” about it before shooting Keith outside the apartment’s parking lot. Detectives later found the gun in a nearby trash can and accused Davis of trying to “dispose of it.” According to deputies, Davis was legally prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm due to a felony. The gun the 10-year-old allegedly found in Davis’ car was reported stolen in 2017. “We cannot let this boy’s murder be a one-day news story and forgotten about by tomorrow morning,” Cooper said. In a GoFundMe launched to offset Keith’s funeral costs, Trepagnier said Keith’s mother and brother decided to leave their home following the shooting. The next four years will change America forever.

Bob Menendez Faces New Allegations In Criminal Case","NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez introduced a member of the Qatari royal family and principal in a company with ties to the government of Qatar to a New Jersey businessman before the company invested millions of dollars in the businessman’s real estate project, a rewritten indictment alleged Tuesday. The latest version of the indictment against the Democrat in Manhattan federal court did not identify the member of the Qatari royal family, but it said the individual was a principal of the Qatari Investment Co. The indictment said the Qatari investor then considered and negotiated a multimillion-dollar investment in the real estate project planned by Fred Daibes, one of three businessmen charged in the indictment along with the senator and his wife. All of them have pleaded not guilty. No new charges were added to the latest version of an indictment that already charged Menendez in a bribery conspiracy that allegedly enriched the senator and his wife with cash, gold bars and a luxury car. The allegations involving Qatar occurred from 2021 through 2023, the indictment said. According to the indictment, Menendez accepted cash and gold bars in exchange for seeking to induce the Qatari Investment Co. to invest with Daibes, including by taking actions favorable to the government of Qatar. The indictment said that while the Qatari Investment Co. was considering its investment in the real estate development owned by Daibes, Menendez made multiple public statements supporting the government of Qatar and then provided them to Daibes so he could share them with the Qatari investor and a Qatari government official.

The move is rare considering Israel often denounces the United Nations’ top court as biased against it and rarely cooperates in international cases involving Israel. It appears to be a signal that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is concerned that the charges could taint its reputation among other nations. On Friday, South Africa launched the case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague alleging that Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip is “genocidal in character” because the mass death, destruction, displacement and starvation of Palestinians without regard to the lives of women, children, journalists and humanitarian workers meets the qualifications of genocide under international law. South Africa can bring the case under the Genocide Convention because both it and Israel are signatories. The case itself could take years. However, South Africa has also asked the court to issue an interim order for Israel to immediately cease military operations it alleges are meant “to destroy Palestinians in Gaza.” At a Tuesday news conference, Netanyahu spokesperson Eylon Levy promised that Israel would contest South Africa’s accusation, calling the claim of genocide antisemitic and “blood libel.” The idea of blood libel, also brought up Friday by Israeli Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lior Haiat, is an antisemitic trope that falsely claims Jews ritually sacrifice Christian children. It is unrelated to the government of Israel being criticized for killing Palestinian civilians. Hamas is “hell-bent on the genocide of the Jews and sacrificing its own civilians for that cause,” Levy added. Israel “emphatically condemns South Africa’s decision to play advocate for the devil and to make itself criminally complicit with the perpetrators of the Oct. 7 massacre.” Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched an attack on Oct. 7 that led to the deaths of an estimated 1,200 Israelis and the kidnappings of about 240 people. Since then, Israeli forces have killed at least 22,100 Palestinians in Gaza, about 9,100 of whom are children, according to a report Tuesday from the Gaza Media Office. At least 57,000 Gazans have been wounded and at least 7,000 are missing. The collapse of the Palestinian territory’s health system has prevented the Gaza Health Ministry from being able to provide regular casualty updates since Nov. 10, according to Al Jazeera. Israel has also killed at least 324 Palestinians and injured more than 3,800 in the occupied West Bank, where Hamas is not stationed, according to the territory’s Palestinian Ministry of Health. Israel accuses South Africa of being “complicit with Hamas’ campaign of Genocide against our people”- saying “We assure South Africa's leaders, history will judge you”.Govt spox added that Israel will appear at ICJ where SA has filed a case accusing Israel of genocidal acts. pic.twitter.com/WCZrgBsMCc South Africa’s ruling African National Congress became aligned with the Palestine Liberation Organization under Nelson Mandela’s leadership. Mandela was a vocal supporter of the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat, saying in 1990 that South Africa identified with Palestinians “because, just like ourselves, they are fighting for the right of self-determination.” Many present-day South Africans see their fight against colonialism and apartheid in Palestinians’ struggles, with President Cyril Ramaphosa repeatedly condemning Israel’s increased violence against Palestinians since Oct. 7. “Genocide is a violation, the proof of which in court requires two elements,” Eliav Lieblich, an international law professor at Tel Aviv University, told Haaretz. “First, you have to show intention of annihilation, and second ― certain actions in the field that promote this intention.” “According to South Africa, the intention is proven by statements of senior Israeli figures and a public atmosphere of erasing or flattening Gaza, and the widespread harm to civilians and the hunger in Gaza show the factual element of the deed.” According to Haaretz, a senior legal expert familiar with the matter recently warned Israeli military leaders, including Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi, that there is a real risk of the International Court of Justice issuing an injunction demanding a cease-fire – stressing that Israel is bound by the court’s rulings, even if it considers the ICJ to be unfair. The ICJ is incredibly influential in shaping international law and public perception. This means the court’s recognition of South Africa’s genocide accusation could shape the public perception that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza and lead to diplomatic chaos. Israeli officials told Axios and Haaretz that Netanyahu wants controversial U.S. lawyer Alan Dershowitz to represent Israel at the hearing. Dershowitz, a vocal supporter of Israel, declined to comment, according to Axios. The next four years will change America forever.

He was expected to also ask the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on his eligibility to return to the presidency in a related Colorado case. The Republican candidate appealed the Maine decision by Shenna Bellows, who became the first secretary of state in history to bar someone from running for the presidency under the rarely used Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. That provision prohibits those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. The appeal now goes to Maine’s Superior Court. Trump was also expected to appeal a similar ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. The nation’s highest court has never issued a decision on Section 3, and the Colorado court’s 4-3 ruling that it applied to Trump was the first time in history the provision was used to bar a presidential contender from the ballot. Trump’s critics have filed dozens of lawsuits seeking to disqualify him from the ballot in multiple states. None succeeded until a slim majority of Colorado’s seven justices — all of whom were appointed by Democratic governors — ruled against Trump. Critics warned that it was an overreach and that the court could not simply declare that the Jan. 6 attack was an “insurrection” without a more established judicial process. A week after Colorado’s ruling, Bellows issued her own. Critics warned it was even more perilous because it could pave the way for partisan election officials to simply disqualify candidates they oppose. Bellows, a former head of Maine’s branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, has previously criticized Trump and his behavior on Jan. 6. Bellows said her own views had nothing to do with her ruling, which sought to apply the law. She acknowledged the Supreme Court would probably have the final say after the Colorado case but said she still had a responsibility to act. She was the first top election official to do so. Many others, Democrats and Republicans had told activists urging them to strike Trump from the ballot that they did not have that power. Section 3 is novel legal territory in the past century, barely used since the years after the Civil War, when it kept defeated Confederates from returning to their former government positions. The two-sentence clause says that anyone who swore an oath to “support” the Constitution and then engaged in insurrection cannot hold office unless a two-thirds vote of Congress allows it. Congress granted amnesty to most former Confederates in 1872, and Section 3 fell into disuse. Legal scholars believe its only application in the 20th century was being cited by Congress in 1919 to block the seating of a socialist who opposed U.S. involvement in World War I and was elected to the House of Representatives. But it returned to use after Jan. 6, 2021. In 2022, a judge used it to remove a rural New Mexico county commissioner from office after he was convicted of a misdemeanor for entering the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Liberal groups sued to block Republican Reps. Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene from running for reelection because of their roles on that day. Cawthorn’s case became moot when he lost his primary in 2022, and a judge ruled to keep Greene on the ballot. Some conservatives warn that, if Trump is removed, political groups will routinely use Section 3 against opponents in unexpected ways. They have suggested it could be used to remove Vice President Kamala Harris, for example, because she raised bail money for people arrested after George Floyd’s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police in 2020. Trump and his allies have attacked the cases against him as “anti-democratic” and sought to tie them to President Joe Biden because the Colorado case and some others are funded by liberal groups who share prominent donors with the Democratic president. But Biden’s administration has noted that the president has no role in the litigation. The next four years will change America forever.

Those who support using the provision against Trump counter that the Jan. 6 attack was unprecedented in American history and that there will be few cases so ripe for Section 3.

They joined the Colorado Republican Party in petitioning the high court to review the case, which rests on a clause of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment barring insurrectionists from office. In December, Colorado’s state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election — an effort that included goading his supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — meant that he had violated that Reconstruction-era clause. Trump is widely expected to fight Colorado’s ruling. He appealed a similar order keeping him from primary ballots in the state of Maine on Tuesday. Both decisions sparked scorn from the former president on social media. “I’m not an Insurrectionist (‘PEACEFULLY & PATRIOTICALLY’),” Trump wrote last month on his Truth Social platform, placing the label instead on his successor in the White House. “Crooked Joe Biden is!!!” The Colorado voters’ petition outlines two main questions for the high court: whether the president is among those elected officials subject to the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists, and whether action from Congress is required.

The voters urged the court to set aside a third question presented by the Colorado GOP: whether the First Amendment’s free speech protections might apply to the situation, giving Trump a right to appear on the ballot regardless of whether he is actually eligible.

But Gerwig’s successful trajectory from directing indie films to 2023’s highest-grossing movie — and the highest-grossing film directed by any woman in history — is still the exception to the norm. The club of directors at the helm of Hollywood’s biggest movies remains primarily a Mojo Dojo Casa House, the masculine abode of Ken (Ryan Gosling) in her film. Women, people of color, and especially women of color remain woefully underrepresented in the director’s chair on major theatrical releases. It’s a persistent problem each year, and 2023 was unfortunately no different, according to the latest research from the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which has gathered data on representation and inclusion in Hollywood dating back to 2007. Based on the initiative’s data, it has become increasingly apparent that recent pledges from Hollywood gatekeepers to hire more directors from underrepresented communities have been “performative acts by the entertainment industry and not real steps towards fostering change,” the group, founded by USC professor Stacy Smith, wrote in its latest report, whose findings were released Tuesday. Year after year, the initiative has found minimal changes in the levels of women and people of color directing major movies. For instance, over the past 17 years, just 19 women of color have directed at least one of the top 100 highest-grossing films at the box office annually (from a total of 1,700 films between 2007 and 2023), according to the group’s data. Four of them were in 2023: Adele Lim (“Joy Ride”), Celine Song (“Past Lives”), Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Wish”) and Nia DaCosta (“The Marvels”), who was the only Black woman to direct a major box-office film last year. These four women of color accounted for just 3.4% of the directors behind the 100 top-grossing films of 2023. That figure was similarly low in 2022, when 2.7% of the directors on the highest-grossing films were women of color. Women overall have also made few, if any, gains in directing in recent years. Just 12.1% of the directors of 2023’s top 100 films at the box office were women — barely a difference from 2022, when the figure was 9%, according to the report. “The percentage has not changed notably since 2018, when 4.5% of directors were women,” the report said. On average across all 17 years of the group’s data, only 6% of directors on major films were women. “These figures are not merely data points on a chart,” Smith said in a statement. “They represent real, talented women working to have sustainable careers in an industry that will not hire them into jobs they are qualified to hold solely because of their identity.” Directors of color have seen a similar lack of progress. Across the 100 top-grossing films of 2023, a total of 26 directors (22.4%) were people of color. When broken down by race and ethnicity, 14 were Asian (53.8%), eight were Black (30.8%), two were Hispanic/Latino (7.7%) and two were multiracial or multiethnic (7.7%). Once again, there was no notable improvement from 2022, when the figure was 20.7%. Both years marked a decrease from the 27.3% of directors of color in 2021. According to the group’s data, there has been no significant shift for such directors since 2016, when 13.3% of the filmmakers behind the year’s major movies were people of color. When breaking down 2023’s top films by studio and distributor, the group found that much of the work in hiring directors of color has come from smaller, independent distributors like A24, Crunchyroll, Angel Studios and United Artists Releasing, rather than from the major Hollywood studios. Year after year, the group’s findings, along with similar studies elsewhere, have continually identified a pipeline problem. Compared with their white male counterparts, most women and people of color don’t get the chance to move up the ladder, from directing independent films to episodes of major television shows, streaming movies and, eventually, big box-office hits. In other words, the larger the project, the more likely a white man gets hired to direct it. To show a snapshot of the issue, researchers compared three different levels of directing. For instance, on average, nearly 55% of directors competing in the most recent four years of the Sundance Film Festival’s U.S. Dramatic Film category — which comprises independent movies — were women, and 52% were people of color. For episodic television, 38% of directors during the 2020-2021 TV season were women, and 34.5% were people of color, according to data from the Directors Guild of America. And among Netflix’s original feature films in 2021, 26.9% of directors were women, while 22.4% were people of color. Given the drop-offs at each level, it’s no wonder that the percentages of women and people of color directing at Hollywood’s top echelons are so low.

These numbers clearly demonstrate that industry leaders and major executives with the power to greenlight movies haven’t followed through on their repeated promises to hire and support a more diverse range of directors, according to the group. “This report offers a contrast to those who might celebrate the dawning of change in Hollywood after a year in which ‘Barbie’ topped the box office. One film or one director are simply not enough to create the sea change that is still needed behind the camera,” researchers wrote in the report. “Until studios, executives, and producers alter the way they make decisions about who is qualified and available to work as a director on top-grossing films, there is little reason to believe that optimism is warranted.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The 29-year-old actor and stunt performer sustained serious injuries after a driver crashed into an outdoor dining shed at the Chirp restaurant in Manhattan at around 1:30 a.m. Monday, her representative told People in a statement. Bernans suffered multiple broken bones in the incident and is currently in stable condition. She was among eight pedestrians injured. Her son, whom she recently gave birth to, was not with her at the time of the crash. According to the NYPD via NBC New York, the accident took place during a foot chase after officers were informed about a physical assault involving a male driver, 44, and a female passenger, 34, in his black Mercedes. The driver, whose name has yet to be released, was hospitalized in critical condition and is in police custody, according to CBS News.

On Sunday night, the journalist co-hosted CNN’s “New Year’s Eve Live” alongside Andy Cohen. During their broadcast, Cohen played a clip from his Bravo talk show, “Watch What Happens Live,” for Cooper. In the clip that aired earlier this month, rapper Nicki Minaj shared her plans for 2024. “My new year’s resolution is to keep my foot on the bitches’ necks!” Minaj said. After the clip was played Sunday, Cooper appeared to be completely baffled by Minaj’s remark. “Wow, what did she say?” he asked Cohen. “Keep my foot on these bitches’ necks!” Cohen repeated, clearly amused. “Wow. Who is she referring to?” Cooper asked, puzzled, to which, Cohen hilariously replied: “Bitches!” (To those who are as bewildered as Cooper, the “Barbie World” rapper meant she wants to remain dominant over her supposed opponents.) Social media users — who instantly understood Minaj’s promise to keep her haters at bay — got a kick out of Cooper’s befuddlement and Cohen’s drunken silliness. Its him confirming its ""bitches"" for me....😭😭😭😭 🥴🥴 lmfaooo Anderson w his cute ass 😂😂😂😂😂 who is she referring too ???? Bless his heart But perhaps one TikTok user put it best. “Anderson Cooper’s journalism side couldn’t help itself! He needed clarity & answers!!” they joked.

This App, Designed For People With Disabilities, Makes It Suck Less","After graduating college, Jacqueline Child — like so many other busy 20-something Americans trying to find a partner or a hookup — dived into the tumultuous world of dating apps. In 2019, a few weeks after she started actively trying to meet someone, she matched with a guy on Bumble. When they decided to meet in person, he suggested they go for a walk. Jacqueline responded by telling him that she was recovering from a surgery, so a picnic would be better. When he inquired about the surgery, Jacqueline told him she had a connective tissue disorder. He then responded, “Well… I hope you’re not planning on having children because that would be really selfish. That’s how genetics work.” This was just one of the dozens of offensive messages Jacqueline, a Colorado native, had to stomach as she tried to navigate the toxic world of dating culture as a woman with a disability or chronic illness. And that particular message is not all that uncommon — as a young stroke survivor, I’ve even been told that online by strangers before, too. Disabled people attempting to enter their online dating era have to deal with much more than the ignorant comments. There are personal safety concerns (especially for the physically disabled) and the difficulty of navigating online dating platforms. And there’s so much more pressure involved in what most people consider the fun part: meeting in person in hopes that the online flirtation translates to real life. I don’t know anyone, disabled or not, who actually enjoys dating apps. For most of us, they’re merely a means to an end. Having to market oneself online with a perfectly curated profile, dealing with frequent rejections and investing hours trying to engage with strangers you may never meet — it’s exhausting. Those of us who are disabled or have a chronic illness also have to deal with the anxiety that comes along with not knowing how a match will respond to it. How do I tell them? When do I tell them? Will they immediately ghost or reject me? The anxiety around the disclosure of a disability can be paralyzing in itself. After being called a “burden” one too many times, Jacqueline started to feel that she might be unworthy of a romantic relationship. One day in 2021, she said to her older sister, Alexa, that she wished there was a legitimate and free dating app specifically designed for disabled and chronically ill people. Alexa, who had seen Jacqueline struggle with hurtful remarks for years, replied, “Let’s make it ourselves.” In October 2022, the sisters launched a free app called Dateability in North America. As of the end of 2023, they have 11,000 members, ranging from wheelchair users to people who are immunocompromised to even nondisabled allies. “We want to be an inclusive place where people feel safe and feel like they matter,” Jacqueline said. The decision to welcome nondisabled allies on their app stemmed from not wanting to send the important and underrated message that disabled people should only date other disabled people. “[Disabled people] are free to love whoever they want and they deserve that,” Alexa said. “But this is a good way to filter out people who would discriminate against disability.” Personally, I wholeheartedly align with the sisters’ decision to include nondisabled people on this platform, because I’m very open to being with a partner who can do the things I physically can’t. Still, I’ve always been hesitant about dating apps because I’m a hopeless romantic with a nostalgic penchant for meet-cutes and serendipitous encounters. I have no real idea what I’m looking for, or, to put it plainly, if anyone is looking for someone like me. Still, I had to check this app out, if nothing else, for the sake of good journalism. So, I recently downloaded the app, created a profile, added a few photos and started swiping away. The app lacked the sleek, streamlined aesthetic of some of the mainstream apps, but it was pretty user-friendly, efficient and accessible on more devices than just my cell phone. As I was swiping, however, I saw a few of the same faces pop up again. Since Dateability is relatively new and caters to a minority demographic (albeit the largest minority demographic), the pool of potential matches that met my age and location preferences was understandably limited. And speaking of minorities, there wasn’t much racial diversity either, but I wasn’t surprised by this: The stigma against disability in immigrant communities (among other communities of color) is such a deterrent from being public about a disability. But there was one seemingly innocuous element that made this app a bona fide game changer. As I filled out the routine questions about age, height and location, I came across a question titled, “Dateability Deets.” It then gave a pretty extensive list of options to broadly describe my disability, chronic illness or lack thereof. There was actually a box with an accurate descriptor for me to select: ambulatory wheelchair user. The phrase appeared at the bottom of my profile along with all of my other personal details. It was so freeing, knowing that whoever I match with will already know about this part of my identity — just like my listed political affiliation or religion — and be OK with it. “With the ‘Dateability Deets’ question, no awkward disclosure discussion is needed,” Alexa said. By making a disability or chronic illness no longer something that needs to be disclosed, it helps eradicate some of the stigma that comes along with it. In this space, our disabilities become an identity marker versus something to be ashamed of. “If we can be open and normalize disability, not only will our community benefit from it because we will see ourselves as more worthy, but also the people outside our community will see us that way too,” Jacqueline said.

Having every type of single person on this app will help ensure that we, as a community, aren’t willfully partitioning ourselves off on the fringes of society (the disability-unfriendly world does that enough for us anyway).

In a statement shared to his Instagram account Monday, the “Beverly Hills, 90210” actor said he and his 12-year-old daughter, Mia, were unhurt in the headline-making brawl, which was partially documented in a video published by TMZ. “Yesterday, I experienced an alarming incident involving a group of individuals on mini bikes,” he wrote. “While stuck in traffic, my car was approached aggressively by one of these riders leading to an unsettling confrontation. In an attempt to assess any damage I exited my car. This action, unfortunately, escalated into a physical altercation, which I navigated to protect myself.” Though Ziering wasn’t injured, the incident has left him “deeply concerned about the growing boldness of such groups who disrupt public safety and peace.” “This situation highlights a larger issue of hooliganism on our streets and the need for effective law enforcement responses to such behavior,” he said in his statement. “As a citizen and a parent, I find it unacceptable that groups can freely engage in this kind of behavior, causing fear and chaos, while the response from authorities seems insufficient.” He went on to urge law enforcement “to take decisive action against such lawlessness and provide the necessary resources to prevent future occurrences.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The Crimson, a student-run paper at the university, first reported the news. The resignation follows weeks of pressure after congressional testimony in which Gay appeared to prevaricate on whether calls for the genocide of Jewish students ― or simply using phrases like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” ― would violate Harvard’s rules. More recently, Gay was caught up in a wave of plagiarism allegations, including new allegations published Monday in The Washington Free Beacon. In her statement to the university community, Gay, Harvard’s first Black president, wrote that “it has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigor ― two bedrock values that are fundamental to who I am ― and frightening to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fueled by racial animus.” Gay’s tenure was the shortest of any Harvard president, having begun just last summer, The Crimson noted. Gay’s resignation follows that of Liz Magill, the University of Pennsylvania’s president, last month, shortly after a congressional hearing on campus antisemitism. In that hearing, when pressed by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Gay, Magill and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth all said that the bounds of acceptable and unacceptable speech regarding Israel, Palestine and the ongoing war in Gaza would depend on context. Their remarks led to outrage from Stefanik, as well as many alumni and donors to the schools, who consider some pro-Palestinian phrases to be tantamount to calls for violence. The same universities have also faced criticism from pro-Palestinian students who say administrators have failed to stand up for their free speech rights in the face of harassment and censorship. In November, Gay condemned the phrase “From the river to the sea,” writing that it bore “specific historical meanings that to a great many people imply the eradication of Jews from Israel and engender both pain and existential fears within our Jewish community.” Notably, an antisemitism advisory group established by Gay did not include several scholars of antisemitism at Harvard whose views, Jewish Currents editor-at-large Peter Beinart observed, “complicate the conflation of antisemitism and anti-Zionism.” The initial attacks against Gay after her congressional testimony were met with opposition from some Harvard faculty and students. More than 700 faculty members urged the Harvard Corporation, the school’s governing board, to resist calls for Gay’s ouster, signing a letter calling on the body to “defend the independence of the university and to resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard’s commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay.” But the accusations of plagiarism in Gay’s academic work proved difficult to ignore. Though they were first raised publicly by the conservative Free Beacon and the right-wing political activist Christopher Rufo, Harvard on Dec. 12 acknowledged “a few instances of inadequate citation” in Gay’s work that it nonetheless said did not qualify as research misconduct. On Dec. 20, the university said Gay’s doctoral dissertation included “duplicative language without appropriate attribution,” and said Gay would update the dissertation. In response to the allegations, Gay said on Dec. 11 that she stood by “the integrity of my scholarship,” which focuses on race and politics. In a separate note Tuesday, the fellows of Harvard College, who make up the Harvard Corp., said that Gay had “acknowledged missteps and has taken responsibility for them.” The letter also condemned “repugnant and in some cases racist vitriol” directed at the outgoing president. Alan M. Garber, the university’s provost and chief academic officer, will serve as interim president, the letter said. In her statement Tuesday, Gay wrote that it had become clear, after consulting with the Harvard Corporation, that it was “in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge with a focus on the institution rather than any individual.” She also indicated that she would not be leaving the university, and would return to the Harvard faculty. Gay previously served as dean of the school’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The next four years will change America forever.

I’ve got my documentary series coming out, ‘The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard.’ I just put out an e-book that I’m super proud of.” Blanchard said the book won’t be “a rehashing of everything that happened,” but a “reflection” of what she has “learned and experienced” during her time at Missouri’s Chillicothe Correctional Center before she was cleared for early release in September. Her story has already been dramatized in the 2019 Hulu series “The Act” and detailed in HBO’s 2017 documentary “Mommy Dead and Dearest.” “Happy New Year’s Eve! I’m about to celebrate with my family,” Blanchard said in another video. “I have my dad and my stepmom Kristy here, and of course my husband,” Blanchard continued in the follow-up TikTok. “We’re looking to ring in the new year together, and it’s going to be really awesome to have some family time after so long.” Blanchard married Louisiana teacher Ryan Scott Anderson behind bars in 2022. For years, Blanchard’s mother foisted a litany of illnesses and conditions upon her ― including brain damage, leukemia and muscular dystrophy ― that she did not actually have. Blanchard was also made to use a wheelchair, fed unnecessary medicines, and forcibly kept indoors by her mother. Dee Dee Blanchard was found stabbed to death in her home in Springfield, Missouri, in 2015. Gypsy Rose ultimately admitted to conspiring with her boyfriend at the time, Nicholas Godejohn, to kill her mother. Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Blanchard has found support for her early release among countless abuse victims in addition to her own family. Her stepmother, Kristy Blanchard, suggested in 2019 that Gypsy Rose would have died had things continued on the way they had been. “Dee Dee would tell me, ‘When I die, I hope she dies with me, because one can’t live without the other,’” Kristy told In Touch Weekly. “Now thinking back, it’s like, ‘Oh my god, she would’ve ended up — She would’ve killed Gypsy. She would have.’” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

The individual, who was not immediately identified, shot out a window to gain access to the Ralph L. Carr Colorado Judicial Center in Denver shortly after being involved in a two-car crash outside the building around 1:15 a.m., the Colorado State Patrol (CSP) said in a release. The man, who allegedly pointed a handgun at the other driver before fleeing the scene, entered the building and held an unarmed guard with the CSP’s Capitol Security Unit at gunpoint. He then demanded access to other parts of the building, which also houses the Colorado Court of Appeals, the CSP said. “The individual obtained keys from the security guard and proceeded into other parts of the building and accessed an unknown number of floors,” state police said. The suspect fired multiple gunshots inside before calling 911 and voluntarily surrendering around 3 a.m. No injuries were reported, though there is “significant and extensive damage to the building and the investigation is ongoing,” police said. The man was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, authorities added. The next four years will change America forever.

Promising Amazon reviews: “The Antigen Rapid Test has proven to be both effective and user-friendly.

Saleh Arouri, who was the most senior Hamas figure killed since the war with Israel began, was also a founder of the group’s military wing. His death could provoke major retaliation by Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah militia. The strike hit an apartment in a building in a Shiite district of Beirut that is a Hezbollah stronghold, and Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to strike back against any Israeli targeting of Palestinian officials in Lebanon. Hezbollah and the Israeli military have been exchanging fire almost daily over the Israeli-Lebanese border since Israel’s military campaign in Gaza began nearly three months ago. But so far the Lebanese group has appeared reluctant to dramatically escalate the fighting. A significant response now could send the conflict spiraling into all-out war on Israel’s northern border. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the strike was carried out by an Israeli drone, and Israeli officials declined to comment. Speaking to reporters, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari did not directly mention Arouri’s death but said, “We are focused and remain focused on fighting against Hamas.” “We are on high readiness for any scenario,” he added. The killing comes ahead of a visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, even as the United States has tried to prevent a spread of the conflict, repeatedly warning Hezbollah — and its regional supporter, Iran — not to escalate the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with the assault in Gaza until Hamas is crushed and the more than 100 hostages still held by the militant group in Gaza are freed, which he has said could take several more months. At the same time, Israeli officials have increasingly warned in recent days of stepped-up action against Hezbollah unless its cross-border fire stops. Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened to kill Hamas leaders wherever they are. The group’s Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into southern Israel killed around 1,200 people, and some 240 others were taken hostage. Israel claims to have killed a number of mid-level Hamas leaders in Gaza, but this would be the first time it has reached into another country to target the group’s top leaders, many of whom live in exile around the region. Arouri was the deputy of Hamas’ supreme political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and headed the group’s presence in the West Bank. He was also a key liaison with Hezbollah. Tuesday’s blast shook a residential building in the Beirut suburb of Musharafieh, killing four people, according to the Lebanese news agency. Hamas confirmed that Arouri was killed along with six other members of the group, including two military commanders. Haniyeh said the movement was “more powerful and determined” following the attack. “They left behind them strong men who will carry the banner after them,” he said of those killed. Hezbollah called the strike “a serious attack on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty and resistance.” “We affirm that this crime will never pass without response and punishment,” it said. Since the Gaza conflict began, Lebanese have feared their country could be pulled into a full-fledged war. Hezbollah and Israel fought a monthlong war in 2006, when Israeli bombardment wreaked heavy destruction in southern Lebanon. Israel’s air, ground and sea assault in Gaza has killed more than 22,100 people in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The campaign has driven some 85% of Gaza’s population from their homes, forcing hundreds of thousands of people into overcrowded shelters or teeming tent camps in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless bombed. Israel’s siege of the territory has left a quarter of Gaza residents facing starvation, according to the United Nations. Israel announced Monday that it would withdraw five brigades, or several thousand troops, from Gaza in the coming weeks. Still, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said it would be a mistake to think that Israel is planning on halting the war. “The feeling that we will stop soon is incorrect,” he said Tuesday. “Without a clear victory, we will not be able to live in the Middle East.” Israel has said it’s close to achieving operational control over most of northern Gaza, where ground troops have been battling militants for over two months. But Gallant said several thousand Hamas fighters are believed still to be in the north, and residents reported clashes in several parts of Gaza City, as well as in the nearby urban Jabaliya refugee camp. Fierce fighting has continued in other parts of the Palestinian territory, especially the south, where many of Hamas’ forces remain intact and where most of Gaza’s population has fled. Palestinians reported heavy airstrikes and artillery shelling in the southern city of Khan Younis and farming areas to the east. The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israel bombed its headquarters in the city, killing five people. At least 14,000 displaced people are sheltering in the building, it said. Fighting was also underway in and around the built-up Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. The army issued evacuation orders to people living in parts of nearby Nuseirat camp. A strike Tuesday leveled a building in Nuseirat, killing at least eight people, according to officials at the nearby hospital. Associated Press footage showed people pulling several children out of the wreckage. In other developments, officials said Israel will defend itself before the United Nation’s top court against charges that it has engaged in genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. The announcement set the stage for what is likely to be a landmark case in international law. South Africa launched the case Friday at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands, saying the Israeli military campaign targeting Hamas has resulted in enough death, destruction and humanitarian crisis in Gaza to meet the threshold of genocide under international law. South Africa asked the court to order Israel to halt its attacks in Gaza. Israel rarely cooperates in international court cases against it, dismissing the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased. Its decision to respond to the charge signals that the government is concerned about potential damage to its reputation. The genocide charge strikes at the heart of Israel’s national identity. The country sees itself as a bulwark of security for Jews after the Holocaust killed 6 million Jews, and world support for Israel’s creation in Palestine in 1948 was deeply rooted in outrage over Nazi atrocities. The convention against genocide was drawn up by world powers the same year in hopes of preventing similar atrocities. Eylon Levy, an official in the Israeli prime minister’s office, accused South Africa of “giving political and legal cover” to Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack triggered Israel’s campaign. “The state of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at the Hague to dispel South Africa’s absurd blood libel,” he said. Many South Africans, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, have compared Israel’s policies regarding Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank with South Africa’s past apartheid regime of racial segregation.

In a statement, the biotech entrepreneur claimed that the polling requirements amount to “a desperate bid by CNN to limit the scope of debate in the Republican presidential primary and to prop up the least conservative and most corrupt candidate in the race (Nikki Haley),” referring to the former U.N. ambassador who is also in the 2024 GOP contest. Ramaswamy said he’ll be attending a competing event with conservative podcaster Tim Pool in Des Moines instead. To qualify for the Jan. 10 debate, each candidate must be polling at least 10% in three surveys, including one CNN poll of likely Iowa GOP caucusgoers. Ramaswamy has consistently polled well under 10%, and Tuesday’s attack against CNN is likely a bid to preempt the network’s debate announcement. Ramaswamy’s self-funded campaign has struggled in recent weeks. It stopped spending money on television ads, a major way of getting your message out in early-nominating states. Ramaswamy instead seems to be adopting a strategy of bashing the media and sharing conspiracy theories to draw eyeballs. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the race by a mile, is scheduled to attend a Fox News town hall at the same time as the CNN debate, in another bid to counterprogram his dwindling GOP competition. Trump, who was impeached for inciting an insurrection, is skipping the primary debates entirely. Last month, Trump said he would be willing to participate in a primary debate if the race comes down to just him and a single rival after the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23.

The “Killers of the Flower Moon” star revealed Sunday in an interview with People that her Indigenous heritage — she has Blackfeet and Nez Perce ancestry — taught her to rethink pronouns at an early age. “I remember being 9 years old and just being a little disheartened, seeing how often a lot of my boy cousins were misgendered because they wore their hair long,” Gladstone, 37, told the outlet. “It happens to a lot of kids, I think, especially Native boys … getting teased for it.” “So I remember back then being like, everybody should just be they,” she said. Gladstone added that most Indigenous languages use only “they” pronouns and that the gender of Blackfeet members “is implied” in their name. She also noted that even this isn’t binary, however, as Gladstone’s grandfather was named “Iron Woman” despite his gender. “I wouldn’t say that he was nonbinary in gender, but he was given a woman’s name because he kind of carried himself, I guess, the way that women who have that name do,” Gladstone said. “And there were lots of women historically and still now who are given men’s names,” she continued. “They fulfill more of a man’s role in society as far as being provider, warrior, those sort of things. So, yeah, my pronoun use is partly a way of decolonizing gender for myself.” Gladstone, who was raised on a Blackfeet reservation in Montana until she was 10, is already garnering Oscar buzz for her performance in “Flower Moon.” The Martin Scorsese drama chronicles the real-life murders of Osage Nation members in 1920s Oklahoma.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. When I planned a long trip to the snowy north last winter, this Miami girl had a slight panic: What could I wear on my legs if went outside to exercise? My ski pants seemed excessive, so I went on a search and discovered Baleaf’s fleece-lined leggings. They’re available with multiple pockets and even in a water-resistant option I knew would serve me well if it began to snow while I was on a walk. And I loved them. Turns out I’m not alone: These have rave reviews from shoppers who say the leggings keep them warm without limiting movement or looking bulky, are flattering, don’t feel cheap, are comfortable, are good for both winter sports and wearing around the house, fit well and keep them coming back to buy more. Best of all, they’re up to 36% off right now at Amazon, in one-pocket, three-pocket and water-resistant styles, each in many colors and sizes XS-6XL. To my shock, these are even cheaper right now than they were for Amazon’s huge Prime Big Deal Days sale. The fleece lining isn’t ultra-thick, but I did find it made a huge difference in how warm I was (Baleaf says they can keep wearers warm even in temperatures under 50 degrees, which tracked with my experience). They were also great to wear as pajamas and sitting around in the house, which means fall is the perfect time to buy and begin enjoying them. Because they’re a wee smidge thicker than regular leggings, I found they were just a bit tight in my usual leggings size, though I still wore them comfortably without exchanging. Baleaf provides a chart on the listing page so you can find the perfect fit. Check out some promising reviews from Amazon: ″I live in these! I saw these out because I was looking for a fleece lined legging. It’s harder to find than you would think. I absolutely love these and keep coming back and buying more. I got the three pocket kind recently which is perfect for my phone. I wear them for all my winter sports and even around the house too. There’s enough spandex to keep it flexible but not too stretchy plenty to keep warm. I highly recommend these. Sometimes this brand feels cheap to me but not in the case of these leggings.” — Melissa “I l love the Beleaf clothing. I am a senior citizen and I get a lot of compliments. I have the Bermuda shorts, fleece leggings, sport tops and they are fabulous. Fit perfectly.” — Amazon customer “Keep you warm! I bought 2 pairs of these for a trip to Iceland. I literally wore them everywhere!! They were so cozy, comfortable and looked great.” — Amazon customer “So cozy! I ordered these leggings after seeing then advertized on TV. I am wearing them right now as it has cooled off today in NC. They are so comfortable, fit so great. They have a cozy, light weight fleece lining and have two pockets for a cell phone. I am 5′8′ and 180# and ordered an XL as I don’t like spandex leggings too too tight. These fit perfect. I know I will wear them alot this fall and witner for walking, running errands or just relaxing at home. Don’t hesitate to buy these. A great purchase!!!!” — LM Smith “Get them and be invincible. I hate the cold, like I medically have a cold aversion. But I just went on a walk in 50 degrees F on a RAINY day and felt amazing! The water kind of beaded on the [water resistant] pants but didn’t soak in. I washed before wearing and don’t see any change in quality… yet. I’m 5’5, 140lb, athletic and pear shaped and the M is a fantastic fit, hitting my ankle with a functional waist tie. I feel like I can actually be inspired to go outside in winter and fall now? I dunno, just get them.” — Ziroinka ″Bought two pair of these and wore them while on vacation in October in Ireland. These kept me warm in windy weather.

She was 32. In a statement on Sunday, South Australia Police said a woman had died after she was struck by a car in an inner suburb of the city of Adelaide on Saturday night. She suffered serious injuries and died in a hospital overnight. Police said the driver, a 33-year-old man, was known to the woman, and was arrested and charged with causing her death by dangerous driving, driving without due care and endangering life. He was bailed and is scheduled to appear in court on March 13. Local media named Hoskins as the woman, and it was widely reported that her husband, fellow pro cyclist Rohan Dennis, was the man arrested. Reached for comment, a South Australia Police spokesperson told HuffPost it is policy not to name those involved in an incident due to local privacy laws. Hoskins was allegedly hit by a pickup truck driven by Dennis near their Adelaide home, Australia’s public broadcaster, ABC News, reported. Hoskins’ parents, Peter and Amanda, and sister, Jess, issued a joint statement on Tuesday via AusCycling. “Words cannot convey our grief, sadness and the tragic circumstances of Melissa’s passing. Myself, Amanda, Jess and families, are utterly devastated and still struggling to process what has happened,” the statement said. “Not only have we lost a daughter and sister, her children have lost their mum, a freewheeling spirit, a giver with a big heart, patience and zest for life.” “She was the rock of their life and ours and we need to honour her memory so they can grow up knowing who she was, what she stood for and what she gave to everyone whose life she touched,” it continued. The funeral will be held in Hoskins’ hometown, Perth, and a memorial service will take place in Adelaide after this month’s Tour Down Under event. The family has requested privacy as they grieve. Hoskins competed in team pursuit at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. Her team won gold in the team pursuit at the 2015 world championships in France. Dennis was part of the Australian team that won silver in the team pursuit at the London 2012 Olympics. He won bronze at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. Hoskins had retired from pro cycling in 2017; Dennis retired earlier this year. Tributes flowed from members of the cycling community around the world. The Australian Olympic Committee expressed “the utmost sadness” over the news. “Our condolences go to Melissa’s family, friends and the cycling community at this extremely difficult time,” it said. “I have a very heavy heart. My thoughts are with their children, family and fellow friends. This is a very difficult and tragic time. RIP,” wrote Australian Olympic cyclist Anna Meares. Annette Edmonson, another champion cyclist from Australia, said that “the world has lost one of its shining stars this weekend.” “A fun, loving, hilarious person, who was so talented in so many areas. A force to be reckoned with, she took the track and road cycling world by storm, before pursuing her next dream, starting a family and becoming the ultimate Mum,” she wrote. “You drove me to become a better athlete,” she added. “We were so competitive on the track and road, but when we came together in the team time trial and team pursuit, we were one.” The next four years will change America forever.

The “Doggystyle” rapper has been officially hired by NBC as “special correspondent” for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris, and will not only provide his distinctive take on the competitions but also visit famous landmarks and interview the athletes. The news was first announced at halftime during “Sunday Night Football’s” coverage of the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings game on NBC and its Peacock platform. Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, has since confirmed the new gig himself. “I grew up watching the Olympics and am thrilled to see the incredible athletes bring their A-game to Paris,” he told several outlets in a statement Sunday. “It’s a celebration of skill, dedication and the pursuit of greatness.” “It’s going to be the most epic Olympics ever, so stay tuned, and keep it locked,” Snoop continued. “Let’s elevate, celebrate and make these games unforgettable, smoke the competition, and may the best shine like gold. Peace and Olympic LOVE, ya dig?” Snoop has undergone a transition over the years from 1990s gangsta rapper to a family-friendly face who has co-starred in a variety show with Martha Stewart, made his own cereal and partnered with dozens of recognizable brands. NBCUniversal says it will livestream all Olympic competitions on Peacock, and are hoping to differentiate its nightly broadcast so sports fans will still tune in. The network is counting on the rapper, who previously commentated the 2021 Tokyo Olympics alongside Kevin Hart, to do just that.

Fascinated by what it held, I grabbed the rest of the books I have from the ’80s, ’90s and ’00s. Looking at 25-plus years scattered across my desk, I wondered: How had I accumulated so many datebooks? Saving datebooks isn’t a practice I’ve pursued; it evolved from drinking coffee with my pocket planner every morning. Scanning lists, ticking off completed tasks, adding appointments and reminders — all of it grounds me and gives me the feeling I have a modicum of control over my life. So, come every new year, I can’t just ditch the 12-month relationship I’ve established with my little Moleskine from the previous year. I’ve always saved my journals — but datebooks (also known as calendars) capture something else. Cracking open a calendar from the past is like rummaging through the junk drawer in your childhood kitchen. You’ll find knickknack notations, gobs of cyclical tasks, grocery lists, birthdays to remember, library books to renew, coffee dates with people you can and can’t recall and cryptic notes. Surveying the detritus of my daily doings from 1989, I was befuddled by notes devoid of context. “Order 40-pound pig.” Why? “Get more boxes. Pack books, chairs, dishes.” Which move was that? On Feb. 15, 1993, I scribbled “Buy Amtrak ticket.” Two weeks later the reminder resurfaced. Where was I going? Flipping ahead to April, it ends up I’d planned what I thought might be my last solo trip (to Washington, D.C.) before I delivered my first child four months later. With planners as dated as mine, I come across obsolete errands and practices — videos to return to Blockbuster, typewriter ribbons to replace and stamps to buy for mailing self-addressed stamped envelopes with manuscripts. It’s hard to believe, but I even wrote my Social Security number on 1983’s personal information page. I’ve encountered cringeworthy relics, too. Leafing through calendars from my 20s, I winced at daily calorie consumption totals, weekly assessments of how my Levi’s fit (“tight”/“medium”/“loose”) and predictions of when a letter would/should arrive from a man who never wrote me back. Still, I unearthed enough nuggets to neutralize those embarrassing bits. Take, for instance, a yellow sticky note that fell from 2007: “Can’t wait for your visit!” in my mom’s happy handwriting. Inside July 30, 2006, my then 10-year-old daughter used a hot pink marker to scrawl “My brithday” in her dyslexic print. Quotes and random journal-ish jottings cropped up, too. What prompted me, as a high school junior, to copy this line from poet Dylan Thomas across 1978’s address page: “I said some words to the close and holy darkness, and then I slept.” In another datebook from 1985, desperation claimed the first week of May: “The uncertainty is too much. I’ve taken enough risks to last a lifetime.” That year I was recovering from a failed attempt to serve in the Peace Corps, a throughline manifested in a slew of affirmations, inspirational quotes and therapy appointments. Most years contained throughlines — some more dramatic than others. In 2009, a family move from New York to North Carolina explained the endless to-do list dominating the pages from February through August. September through December exposed the fallout: I found Zoloft refill reminders, mentions of family therapy sessions and weekly grief counseling appointments for my depressed teenage daughters. Clocks move ever forward but datebooks provide a tangible conduit to the past. They allow us to flip forward or backward in time, a tactile experience that’s more satisfying than swiping a finger across a screen. This is something I realized at the beginning of 2021 when I tried relying solely on Google Calendar. With the ongoing pandemic I figured I wouldn’t have much to keep track of since 2020 was practically blank. But by mid-February 2021, I had a fresh Moleskine in hand. I know you’re probably wondering: Why go old-school analog with a tool as essential as a datebook? I still use Google Calendar at times because it can be more efficient. But consider how much time you waste being sucked into the vortex of rabbit holes inherent in apps. Consider the satisfaction intrinsic in dragging a pen through a procrastinated task you’ve finally tackled. Consider how open dates are waiting for on-the-fly brainstorming and the chance to accommodate an impromptu journal entry. And, lastly, let’s not forget posterity: how your handwritten notations will preserve a smidgen of your physicality for the ages. Paging through a datebook from the past, you’ll find yourself taking stock. How did I use my time? Why did I waste it on that job/project/relationship? Look at what I accomplished! As acclaimed author Annie Dillard famously said: “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” Several years ago, while clearing my parents’ attic, I discovered a calendar my dad kept in 1965. A freebie from his insurance agent, the datebook’s weeks were cluttered with junk drawer minutiae: reminders to vote, attend barbershop quartet practice, church suppers and coin collector meetings — along with doodles galore. Gazing at the gray ovals penciled inside an eight, I wondered: Is this how he’d occupied himself on a call with a long-winded someone? Paging past June, I stopped on July 22, where he’d written “7:30 Poverty Program, City Hall,” in his slanted script. In 1965, I was four, too young to know about then-President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty initiatives. Decades later, after Alzheimer’s began affecting my dad’s memory, I learned from a family friend that he had helped launch a local chapter of Head Start in my hometown, Jennings, Louisiana. The initiative, which was originally called Project Head Start, began as an eight-week summer program before becoming a federally funded project for low-income and at-risk children and families. Now, I have evidence of his involvement with the group and his calendar plays a newfound role as a primary source document. That discovery got me thinking about how our seemingly mundane notations provide continuity between the past and present, and how they hold far more resonance than we might imagine at the time. As the blank dates of a new year accrue the granular minutia of our day-to-day stuff, week after week, month after month, the datebook morphs into a retrospective collage that’s as messy as life itself. Taken together, the datebooks from my 20s tell the story of a young woman who made too many lists, wanted to save the world and was teetering toward an eating disorder. One day, when my daughters survey my datebooks, they’ll recognize aspects of the 60-something me in the 20-something me. They’ll smile at the solo escapes I planned on Mother’s Day when they were little and be reminded that our shabby Ethan Allen sofa was delivered on Nov. 8, 2004. But will they notice the emotional mud seasons I slogged through? How calls, dinner dates and birthday reminders nurtured my deepest friendships? Whatever they (or anyone else) finds, my datebooks will tell the story of not only what I was up to, but who I was and who I was becoming over time. And as my life continues to unfold, my datebooks serve as a constant reminder of Annie Dillard’s sage advice. This is why I’m inviting you to use a datebook in 2024. Who knows? Years from now, you or someone else might come upon a gem amid the minutiae of your days — a doodle, stray jotting or something else that reveals something about you or how you lived. Something you can’t know now because you haven’t yet written it in your datebook. You can read Jean Coco’s recent work in Brevity, Ninth Letter online, Hippocampus and The Sun’s Readers Write.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heart-health-cardiologists-new-years-resolutions_l_65831ae9e4b0d9bdbf6876af","2024-01-02","jillian wilson","The 4 New Year's Resolutions Cardiologists Always Make","It’s the season when many people set New Year’s resolutions for the year ahead, and these goals are often related to physical health. Experts say there’s one big area that many people should focus on when it comes to their well-being: cardiovascular health. “Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in America,” said Dr. William Cornwell, a cardiologist at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital. “And, sadly, people... lack a clear understanding of the health or unhealth of their hearts until something catastrophic happens, such as a heart attack or a stroke.” But there are lifestyle habits you can adopt to manage some of the factors ― like high cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure ― that put you at risk of heart attack and stroke. Cardiologists say they encourage these lifestyle habits every year. Below, doctors shared with HuffPost the New Year’s resolutions they set and recommend to patients in the name of heart health. No surprise here: All of the experts we spoke to said exercise is an important resolution to set every single year. “First and foremost, from a cardiac standpoint regarding cardiovascular health, exercise needs to be at the forefront,” Cornwell said. “For me, personally, it is a part of my everyday routine and every year,” he said. “There needs to be a renewed commitment to ensure that exercise is at the forefront of everything that you should be thinking about to improve or maintain your cardiac health.” “Exercise also brings a number of other benefits to other organ systems, in addition to improvements in quality of life and your overall ability to function well without symptoms,” Cornwell noted. “So, for many reasons — the heart really only being one of many — if there was going to be one New Year’s resolution, exercise should be the one.” Admittedly, it can be hard to jump into fitness in January, a month marked by early sunsets and cold temperatures in much of the country. But it’s still important to prioritize movement during this time of year, said Dr. Johanna Contreas, a member of the National Hispanic Medical Association and a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York. “Winter months, we tend to see an increase in cardiovascular disease and heart attacks and heart failure, hospitalization,” Contreas said, “because those winter months, you’re more indoors, less likely to be active. So, we always try to tell patients: Think about ways that you can remain active.” In other words, your version of exercise does not have to take the form of an outdoor run or walk. You could focus on walking up and down the stairs throughout the day, making a point to get up from your computer after long meetings, or signing up for a fitness app that allows you to exercise from home. (Peloton, Alo Moves and FitOn are all good options.) As for how much you need to exercise each week, Cornwell said the American Heart Association’s guidelines recommend 150 to 300 minutes of mild to moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking, doubles tennis or gardening), or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous exercise (like running, jumping rope or swimming laps), each week. “I tell people, [if] you really want to start a healthy year, know your numbers and know what is healthy for you,” Contreas said. When talking about “numbers,” experts are referring to things like a person’s blood pressure, cholesterol and fasting glucose, said Dr. Elizabeth Jackson, director of the cardiovascular outcomes and effectiveness research program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medicine. High cholesterol and high blood pressure can put you at increased risk for heart attack and stroke, which means they’re important to manage through medication and/or lifestyle changes. Jackson also recommends “knowing your fasting glucose, because we know that in the U.S. we have a high prevalence of diabetes, but we also have a high prevalence of pre-diabetes — people who are not quite meeting the definition of diabetes, but they’re not in the normal range.” According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, having diabetes makes you two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease. You can ask your doctor for your numbers, and they can either share the data they have on file or order tests to determine this information. “It’s important to know where you’re at in terms of those numbers, but also not to be discouraged if numbers are out of whack,” Jackson noted. You can get to a healthier place by adhering to lifestyle adjustments like sticking to an exercise regimen, quitting smoking, and more ways that are outlined in the AHA’s Life Essential 8. Additionally, you can talk to your doctor about medication to see if that’s the right choice for you. Eating a nutritious diet full of things like fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean protein and beans is known to be beneficial for your heart health and your health overall. According to Jackson, thinking wholeheartedly about your diet is a good goal for the new year. To focus on your nutrition, Jackson suggests food-prepping for the week so you’ll have something nutritious to grab when you’re hungry. She also suggests trying out new heart-health recipes each week. The American Heart Association has recipes, she noted, that can help maintain or improve your cardiac health. If this feels too daunting, Contreas said, you can try simple hacks like adding vegetables to your rice to make your meals more nutritious. Additionally, you could try eating vegetarian a few days a week, or even for a few meals a week. Contreas noted that it’s important to be mindful of your salt intake, too. Consuming too much salt can increase your blood pressure, she said. And, as mentioned above, high blood pressure can put you at risk for heart attack and stroke. “Sleep is very important,” Contreas said. “Sleep deprivation, we know now, is very unhealthy, and it can cause increasing cardiovascular disease” and put you at higher risk for depression and high blood pressure. Contreas said one of her New Year’s resolutions is to help workers at her hospital get better sleep, in particular those who have to work the night shift. It’s recommended that adults get between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. “It may not be possible every night,” Contreas acknowledged. “But as much as we can stick to [it] would be important.” Jackson and Cornwell both pointed out that healthy sleep is part of the AHA’s guidelines to better cardiovascular health, and is an important goal to focus on every year. “We don’t have to go and be perfect every day right away,” Jackson said. “It’s not like January 1 starts, and all of a sudden your lifestyle habits are going to change dramatically and never go back.” You should cut yourself some slack if you miss a day at the gym or fall back into an old habit you’re trying to break. Additionally, it’s OK to let yourself have rest days (your body needs them!) and allow yourself desserts and foods that aren’t particularly heart-healthy, too. “But, knowing that if you’re putting in more healthy-type behaviors — healthy diet, physical activity, good sleep — most days, or more than you were, then that’s contributing,” Jackson said. “It really adds up.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-eat-on-a-budget-without-cooking-at-home-all-the-time_l_6580bfa6e4b0e142c0bee0d6","2024-01-02","leigh weingus","How To Eat On A Budget Without Giving Up Takeout, According To Financial Planners","There are tons of reasons why cooking at home is a great idea, and I can recite them all. Home-cooked food is almost always healthier than anything you’ll get in a takeout container, it’s better for the environment, and it can be a mindful, meditative way to spend an evening. Last, but certainly not least, home cooking will definitely be easier on your bank account than the GrubHub app. But while I strive to cook at home as often as possible, sometimes I want — no, need — to just have a plate or bowl of fully prepared food handed to me. In a month like January, that makes me feel extra guilty because I’ve already spent way too much money during the busy holiday season. In an effort to spend less on food this month and in the coming months of 2024, I decided to talk to financial experts to get their best tips for eating on a budget without cooking all the time. Here are their top budget-friendly food tips that involve as little cooking as possible. While this tip does involve a little bit of cooking, it really is just a little bit. According to Shinobu Hindert, a certified financial planner (CFP), the prepared foods section of your local grocery store can be your best friend. “You can buy a pre-made chicken salad and add it to a pre-made salad mix that you toss together,” Hindert told HuffPost. “You can have that for two nights, depending on the size of the chicken salad you get. Trader Joe’s has great pre-made options, too. For example, you can buy a pre-made salad mix or burrito. This is more expensive than buying it all together, but you save money by not wasting any food you’re not eating and it’s less expensive than going out.” While takeout is more expensive than eating at home, every takeout order doesn’t have to make a huge dent in your credit card. “Make a list of local places you like to have takeout from that are under your budget,” Hindert said. “Tier them into two categories: Budget-friendly and splurge. If you know cooking a typical meal at home costs you about $10 per person then grabbing takeout from Chipotle, for example, won’t break the bank.” But, she said, if you have a favorite takeout place where dishes run $15-plus, this becomes an expensive habit. “If you have restaurants pre-picked and budget out what you can comfortably spend, it minimizes any hangry splurges,” Hindert noted. “Maybe you skip the appetizers and use the leftovers for lunch the next day to make this budget-friendly. Get creative!” As with most things in life, there is a way to save money on takeout. Tori Dunlap, the author of ”The Financial Feminist,” says she’s all about the DashPass, which offers $0 delivery fees, lower service fees, and 5% DoorDash credits back on pickup orders, and much more. “One of my favorite strategies is using the free DashPass subscription that comes with my credit card to cut down on costs,” she said. Dunlap also suggests thinking through our takeout orders before you place them. “What can you order that will last?” Dunlap said. “Ordering meals that are larger that you can split up, for example, can be a smart move. A pizza can be dinner then lunch the next day. I also try to order things I know will keep for a day or two — sushi, for example, is so yummy but hard to keep as a leftover.” One of the best ways to limit what you spend on takeout (or restaurants in general) is to make a plan for it. While we all go over budget sometimes, having a rough guideline for how much you want to or able to spend on takeout can be helpful. “Carve out time to sit down and budget what you really spend on take-out,” Hindert said. “It may be more or less than you think. Once you see your bottom-line number you can make choices.” If you want to continue spending at the same rate, Hindert added, where can you cut back? “It could be on your daily morning latte or maybe the weekend brunch with friends,” she said.

You need to make lifestyle choices of what is most important to you.” One point both Dunlap and Hindert make is that when it comes to budgeting, as long as your needs are met, you should focus on spending your money in a way that makes you happy. So hey, if takeout or eating out at restaurants makes you happy, create a budget that accommodates that want. Just be forewarned that you’ll probably need to put a limit on how many impulsive Amazon purchases you make, but that’s not so bad, right?

Enter the Alli V-neck tunic sweater, which I discovered through Nuuly, a clothing rental service that’s part of Free People’s parent group, URBN. Since then, I’ve purchased it (and re-rented it) in multiple colors. This knit sweater is thick, oversized and soft. My biggest pet peeve with sweaters is how itchy or irritating they can be on your skin, especially in winter when skin is already parched and suffering. That isn’t an issue with this V-neck. I own it in camel and black, but I’ve also worn it in white and green through my rental subscription. It also comes in pink, blue, gray, lavender and more, depending on where you purchase it. Best of all, this sweater is incredibly versatile. It makes you feel like you’re the main character in a Nancy Meyers movie ― or at the very least, the main character of your Zoom calls. I’ve used it as a pullover instead of a sweatshirt. I’ve worn it under coats to protect me from frigid temps. I’ve dressed it up for holiday dinners. I’ve lounged in it on days when I’m too lazy to wear anything else. The sweater comes in sizes XS to XL, and I highly recommend sizing down. I normally take a size large, but I’ve worn it in a medium and even a small, and both maintained the oversized look. This is also a dream garment if you’re on the taller side. I’m 6 feet tell and I can easily wear it with leggings, although the more you size down, the shorter it gets. (But it’s still workable!) If you’re looking for a sweater that can do it all, this is it. The only thing you’ll regret about your purchase is that you didn’t do it sooner. Trust me. You can check out some reviews below or just scroll down to get this versatile winter must-have for yourself. “I purchased the Titan grey color and it’s so gorgeous. It has a really large gauge knit. It’s a nice thickness. It hangs well and sort of slides off toward the shoulder. It’s a very flattering sweater; I may purchase more colors!” — AngieH at Nordstrom “Wow! What a great piece! I love oversized sweaters and have plenty from FP, but didn’t really like the look of this sweater online. I was wrong! Bought it only because of great reviews. Now it is my absolute favorite sweater! It is oversized but not too bulky. It is very soft and hangs beautifully. I love how heavy and thick it is. The neck line is so flattering. It is so very stylish and warm. I am 5’5 , 102 lb and XS fits great. I wouldn’t want it to fit any tighter. Love it!!!” — Babka at Free People “If u want the v neck to hang off your shoulder like the image order TTS, if you want just an oversized look order 1 size down. Long sleeves with a square boxy hang on the body. It is a heavy great quality sweater!” — beachgurl87 at Free People “Love love love this chunky v neck sweater! I purchased in gray and camel and so happy I did!!” — Jnes at Bloomingdale’s"

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went to a football game on Monday to support the Texas Longhorns in their Sugar Bowl matchup against the Washington Huskies. It didn’t go well for Texas as Washington won 37-31 to advance to next week’s national championship game. The Texas defeat also continues what some fans see as a trend: When Cruz turns up, his team loses. In autumn, he showed up to support the Houston Astros in the American League Championship Series. They lost, and some fans blamed Cruz. In 2018, he was blamed for jinxing the Houston Rockets when the team was eliminated from the NBA playoffs with Cruz in attendance. And in 2017, fans blamed a poorly timed Cruz selfie for Texas Tech’s defeat in the NCAA finals. Last year, Cruz pushed back at the notion that his presence is a curse for sports teams, calling Rolling Stone magazine “lying hacks” for an article on fans begging him to stay home from the Astros game. But after the Longhorns’ loss, some fans are taking it out on Cruz: Sports bettors are now 15-2 since 2017 when betting the moneyline against teams Ted Cruz shows up to support in person.They would have profited $2,344 if they placed a $100 bet on each game. pic.twitter.com/WBH5vq36VW Its time for UT to ban Ted Cruz from all games The all time greatest jinx in sports, Ted Cruz ladies and gentlemen pic.twitter.com/alenudVpsD Hear us out.

The airline said all 379 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated. The coast guard pilot escaped its aircraft but the other five crew members were found dead, Japan’s transport minister, Tetsuo Saito, confirmed. The plane was due to travel to the guard’s Niigata base to assist with recovery efforts after a series of earthquakes. At least 17 of the people evacuated from the plane were injured, according to NHK, citing the Tokyo Fire Department. A Japan Coast Guard spokesperson confirmed a collision between the passenger plane and its flight MA-722, a Bombardier Dash-8. Footage from NHK showed the Japan Airlines aircraft ablaze on the runway. Earlier footage posted online showed a burst of flames as the plane landed. 【羽田空港 日本航空の機体が炎上】国土交通省東京空港事務所によりますと、羽田空港でJALの旅客機から炎があがっていると聞いているが客が搭乗しているかどうかなどはまだわからない、情報を確認中だと話していました。https://t.co/UGWveQ1hVi#nhk_video pic.twitter.com/s4YDQhcfll The flight, JAL516, had departed from New Chitose Airport in Hokkaido to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. All of Haneda Airport’s runways were closed from around 6 p.m. local time, The Japan Times reported, with flights being diverted to Narita Airport. Authorities were still working to extinguish the blaze, which appeared to have spread to most of the plane, more than an hour after the flight landed. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, addressed the incident in a news conference Tuesday night. He confirmed that the coast guard team had been on their way to deliver aid to the earthquake-stricken region in western Japan. He called it a “very disappointing and saddening situation,” according to a Sky News translation. “I’d like to express my respect towards their sense of duty, as well as offer my heartfelt condolences for their losses,” he said. The transport minister said the cause of the incident was unclear and multiple departments, including police and the Japan Transport Safety Board, were investigating. He said the ministry was working to get Haneda Airport’s operations back up and running as soon as possible. Plane manufacturer Airbus said that the A350-900 plane involved in the collision was delivered to Japan Airlines from the production line in November 2021.

Officials warned that more quakes could lie ahead. Aftershocks continued to shake Ishikawa prefecture and nearby areas a day after a magnitude 7.6 temblor slammed the area on Monday afternoon. Forty-eight people were confirmed dead in Ishikawa, officials said. Sixteen others were seriously injured, while damage to homes was so great that it could not immediately be assessed, they said. Japanese media reports said tens of thousands of homes were destroyed. Government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi said 17 people were seriously injured and gave a slightly lower death tally, while saying he was aware of the prefecture’s tally. Water, power and cell phone service were still down in some areas, and residents expressed sorrow about their destroyed homes and uncertain futures. “It’s not just that it’s a mess. The wall has collapsed, and you can see through to the next room. I don’t think we can live here anymore,” Miki Kobayashi, an Ishikawa resident, said as she swept around her house. Their house was also damaged in a 2007 quake, she said. Although casualty numbers continued to climb gradually, the prompt public warnings, relayed on broadcasts and phones, and the quick response from the general public and officials appeared to have kept at least some of the damage under control. The rescue efforts that quickly followed from firefighters, police and the military proved a testament to how this nation has repeatedly withstood disasters, which have practically become a part of everyday life. Toshitaka Katada, a University of Tokyo professor specializing in disasters, said the people were prepared because the area had been hit by quakes in recent years. They had evacuation plans and emergency supplies in stock. “There is probably no people on earth other than Japanese who are so disaster-ready,” he said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Katada warned the situation remains precarious and unpredictable. The March 2011 quake and tsunami in northeastern Japan had been preceded by other quakes. “This is far from over,” Katada said. Predictions by scientists have repeatedly been proven wrong, such as with the 2016 quake in southwestern Kumamoto, an area previously seen as relatively quake-free. The only real projection possible is that you can’t make projections, Katada added. “Having too much confidence in the power of science is very dangerous. We are dealing with nature.” Japanese media aerial footage showed widespread damage in the hardest-hit spots, with landslides burying roads, boats tossed in the waters and a major fire that had turned an entire section of Wajima city to ashes. Japan’s military dispatched 1,000 soldiers to the disaster zones to join rescue efforts, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday. “Saving lives is our priority and we are fighting a battle against time,” he said. “It is critical that people trapped in homes get rescued immediately.” A quake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.6 shook the Ishikawa area as he was speaking. More quakes continued to rock the area, reaching more than 100 aftershocks over the past day. Nuclear regulators said several nuclear plants in the region were operating normally. The 2011 quake and tsunami caused three reactors to melt and release large amounts of radiation at a nuclear plant in northeastern Japan. News videos showed rows of collapsed houses. Some wooden structures were flattened and cars were overturned. Half-sunken ships floated in bays where tsunami waves had rolled in, leaving a muddied coastline. On Monday, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a major tsunami warning for Ishikawa and lower-level tsunami warnings or advisories for the rest of the western coast of Japan’s main island of Honshu, as well as for the northern island of Hokkaido. The warning was downgraded several hours later, and all tsunami warnings were lifted as of early Tuesday. Waves measuring more than one meter (3 feet) hit some places. People who were evacuated from their houses huddled in auditoriums, schools and community centers. Bullet trains in the region were halted, but service was mostly restored by Tuesday afternoon. Sections of highways were closed. Weather forecasters predicted rain, setting off worries about already crumbling buildings and infrastructure. The region includes tourist spots famous for lacquerware and other traditional crafts, along with designated cultural heritage sites. U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that his administration was “ready to provide any necessary assistance for the Japanese people.” Japan is frequently hit by earthquakes because of its location along the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. ___ Kageyama reported from Tokyo.

Officials in New Jersey say at least 13 buses from Texas and Louisiana have arrived in the state since Saturday ferrying about 450 migrants. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has continued to send migrants from his state to Democrat-led cities in a so-called protest against President Joe Biden’s immigration policies, despite sharp criticism from human rights advocates who have accused him of using human beings as political pawns. 2/4 Below is info from our JC emergency management that tracks these issues. At this point, approximately 10 busses from various locations in Texas and one from Louisiana have arrived at various transit stations throughout the state, including Secaucus, Fanwood, Edison, Trenton. 3/4 Approx 397 migrants have arrived at these locations since 12/30. NJ Transit is apparently the receiving agency, and there was a conf call between state police/NJT earlier today, which local governments were not part of. Adams last week passed an executive order meant to limit such arrivals in New York, requiring bus companies to provide 32 hours notice before dropping migrants off in the city. Arrivals are also limited to specific times of day between Monday and Friday. “We cannot allow buses with people needing our help to arrive without warning at any hour of day and night,” Adams said at the time. The shift was meant to address a surge in asylum seekers in New York, which has processed more than 161,000 since the spring of 2022, according to The New York Times. But the mayors of Secaucus, New Jersey, and Jersey City, New Jersey, said in recent days buses have unloaded hundreds of passengers who are then guided to train stations to New York. “It seems quite clear the bus operators are finding a way to thwart the requirements of the executive order by dropping migrants at the train station in Secaucus and having them continue to their final destination,” Michael Gonnelli, the mayor of Secaucus, said in a statement, describing the set-up as a “loophole” around Adams’ order. He added the outcome seemed to be an “unexpected consequence” of the new rules. Adams’ office blasted Abbott’s busing policy in a statement this week. “Texas Governor Greg Abbott continues to treat asylum seekers like political pawns, and is instead now dropping families off in surrounding cities and states in the cold, dark of night with train tickets to travel to New York City, just like he has been doing in Chicago,” his office said in a statement to media outlets.

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) knows who to blame for her decision to ditch her own constituents and run in a different district in the upcoming election: Barbra Streisand and Ryan Reynolds. “Hollywood is trying to buy their way into Congress,” the conspiracy theorist and “Beetlejuice” fan told right-wing podcaster and former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon on his “War Room” show Saturday. Boebert barely won reelection in 2022, defeating Democratic challenger Adam Frisch by 546 votes in a race virtually no one expected to be close. Rather than face Frisch again, Boebert said last week she’ll run in a neighboring district instead. Frisch has so far raised $7.7 million, compared to Boebert’s $2.4 million ― a difference she attributed to Deadpool and pals. “It’s coming from Hollywood when you have Barbra Streisand coming in and donating to the Democrat, when you have Ryan Reynolds coming in and donating to the Democrat,” she told Bannon. The two Hollywood stars named by Boebert combined for about 0.03 percent of Frisch’s haul: FEC records show Reynolds contributed $1,500 in 2023, while Streisand contributed $1,000. “We have to shut down the Hollywood elites who are trying to buy my current district,” Boebert declared.

Lee, 59 and the head of the main opposition Democratic Party, was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Police and emergency officials said he was conscious and wasn’t in critical condition, but his exact status was unknown. The attack happened when Lee walked through a crowd of journalists and others after finishing a tour of the site of a new airport in Busan. The attacker, posing as a supporter, approached Lee, saying he wanted to get his autograph, and then stabbed Lee in the neck with a knife, according to Busan police. Lee slumped to the ground, where a person pressed a handkerchief to his neck to stop the bleeding. A witness, Jin Jeong-hwa, told YTN television that Lee bled a lot. Videos circulated on social media showed the suspect, wearing a paper crown reading “I’m Lee Jae-myung,” being chased and tackled by several people. Police said officers arrested the man on the spot. During questioning, he refused to identify himself or say why he attacked Lee, according to Yonhap news agency. Lee’s Democratic Party called the incident “a terrorist attack on Lee and a serious threat to democracy.” It called on police to make a through, swift investigation of the incident. Party spokesperson Kwon Chil-seung told reporters at Pusan National University Hospital that Lee’s jugular vein was believed to have been damaged and there was concern over the large amount of bleeding. He said Lee was being airlifted to a hospital in Seoul for surgery. Hospital officials would not comment on Lee’s condition. President Yoon Suk Yeol expressed deep concern about Lee’s health and ordered authorities to investigate the attack, saying such violence would not be tolerated, according to Yoon’s office. Lee lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon by 0.7 percentage point, the narrowest margin ever recorded in a South Korean presidential election. Since his election defeat, Lee has been a harsh critic of Yoon’s major policies. Last year, Lee launched a 24-day hunger strike to protest what he called Yoon’s failure to oppose Japan’s release of treated radioactive wastewater from its crippled Fukushima nuclear power, his mishandling of the country’s post-pandemic economy and his hardline policies on North Korea. Lee faces an array of corruption allegations, including one that he provided unlawful favors to a private investor that reaped huge profits from a dubious housing project in the city of Seongnam, where Lee was mayor for a decade until 2018. Lee has denied legal wrongdoing and accused Yoon’s government of pushing a political vendetta. Last September, a South Korean court denied an arrest warrant for Lee over the allegations, saying there wasn’t a clear risk that he would destroy evidence. The court hearing was arranged after South Korea’s opposition-controlled parliament voted to lift Lee’s immunity to arrest, a move that reflected growing divisions within his Democratic Party over his legal troubles.

His supporters see him as an anti-elitist hero who could reform establishment politics, eradicate corruption and solve growing economic inequality. Critics view him as a dangerous populist who relies on stoking divisions and demonizing his conservative opponents. Lee is also known for his self-made success story. He worked in a factory as a boy, an experience that left him with an arm disability. He later made his own way through school and passed the country’s notoriously difficult bar exam to work as a human rights lawyer. Lee joined a predecessor of the Democratic Party in 2005. Previously a political outsider, he rose sharply amid public anger over an explosive 2016-17 corruption scandal that eventually led to the ouster of then conservative President Park Geun-hye.

Franco appeared before prosecutors while accompanied by two lawyers, days after not showing up for a meeting with prosecutor Olga Diná Llaverías, according to the official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the case. The official said the interview lasted nearly three hours. Llaverías had originally requested Franco appear Dec. 28, two days after prosecutors and police visited two of Franco’s properties in Baní, the All-Star player’s hometown some 37 miles (60 kilometers) southwest of the capital, to request his appearance. They did not find the 22-year-old player there. Authorities have released little information about the case because it involves a minor. Franco must be brought before a judge within 24 hours, according to Dominican law. Franco’s U.S. attorney, Jay Reisinger, declined comment. The AP was not able to reach Franco’s attorneys in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic’s prosecutors’ office said on Aug. 14 that Franco was under investigation because of postings on his social media channels suggesting he had a relationship with a minor. The AP has not been able to verify the reported posts. Franco was placed on administrative leave by Major League Baseball in August under its the joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy with the players’ association. He was paid and received service time while on administrative leave.

In a series of photos, Lively, 36, posed alongside the beloved rodent chef Remy from Disney’s 2007 “Ratatouille” film while dressed casually in a long-sleeve yellow T-shirt, Mickey Mouse ears and sneakers, with her handy-dandy breast pump on her hip. “Pumping at @disneylandparis,” she captioned her post, including an emoji of a glass of milk. “Cheers Remy.” In comments on the post, fans expressed appreciation for her openness about using a portable breast pump on the getaway. “Love seeing pumping normalized! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 get it mama! Happy new year!” one person commented. Another joked, “If you haven’t pumped while waiting in line at Disneyland what are you even doing?! 😂 Mine was an hour wait at Indiana Jones. Pumped 11oz.” “Thank you for pumping in public and helping to make a positive change for the next generation of pumping moms out there,” another wrote in a lengthy comment. “I’m hoping that by the time my daughters become moms they’ll live in a society where moms feel comfortable and empowered to take care of their babies wherever they are. The more people see women breastfeeding in public, the more normal it becomes, so thank you for being a part of that.” Another added, “Love normalizing pumping in public 👏❤️.” Lively tied the knot with Ryan Reynolds in 2012. Last February, the couple announced the birth of their fourth child but gave no details. They also share daughters James, 9, Inez, 7, and Betty, 4. In May 2022, Lively gushed about the positive effect motherhood has had on her self-image. “I think having children for me made me feel so much more in my skin,” she told Forbes at the time. “I never felt more myself or at ease in my own body or more confident — not to say that there aren’t a bevy of insecurities coming at me a million times a day, but I just feel incredibly settled.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He was 88. McCann died Friday in Los Angeles a week after being hospitalized with pneumonia, according to his longtime manager and producer, Alan Abrahams. A Lexington, Kentucky, native, McCann was a vocalist and self-taught pianist whose career dated back to the 1950s, when he won a singing contest while serving in the U.S. Navy and appeared on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” the top variety program of its time. With admirers including Quincy Jones and Miles Davis, he went on tour worldwide and released dozens of albums, starting in 1960 with ""Les McCann Ltd. Plays the Truth.” He was best known for “Compared to What,” a funky protest song on which he first teamed up with his future musical partner, saxophonist Eddie Harris. Written by Eugene McDaniels and recorded live at the 1968 Monteaux Jazz Festival, “Compared to What” blended jazzy riffs and McCann's gospel-style vocals. The song condemned war, greed and injustice with such couplets as “Nobody gives us rhyme or reason/Have one doubt, they call it treason.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The rhetoric has garnered charges of ethnic cleansing and forced displacement, and a rare rebuke from U.S. officials. But there are no signs of the calls losing steam within Israel. “What needs to be done in the Gaza Strip is to encourage emigration,” Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Sunday. Referring to Gaza as a “ghetto,” he added: “If in Gaza there will be 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs and not 2 million, the entire conversation on ‘the day after’ will look different.” The following day, Smotrich referred to the Jewish settlement of the territory as “important” and said Palestinians should be encouraged to leave the Gaza Strip. The idea of expelling ― or encouraging the “voluntary” migration of ― Palestinians from Gaza, once a fringe view held by extremists like Meir Kahane, has become normalized in Israeli society since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that resulted in the deaths of some 1,200 Israelis and the abduction of 240 more, according to Israeli officials. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said Monday that the current war presented an “opportunity to concentrate on encouraging the migration of the residents of Gaza.” Such a policy, he added, was “a correct, just, moral and humane solution.” And last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told one lawmaker who’d called for “voluntary immigration” from Gaza that he was working to facilitate that movement. “Our problem is [finding] countries that are willing to absorb Gazans, and we are working on it,” Netanyahu said. One unnamed senior source in Israel’s security cabinet (Smotrich and Ben Gvir are both members) told Zman Israel, The Times of Israel’s Hebrew sister site, “Congo will be willing to take in migrants, and we’re in talks with others.” Israeli military action has already forcibly displaced the vast majority of the population within Gaza, which itself consists mostly of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and their descendants. Throughout the recent bombardment and invasion of Gaza, Israel has repeatedly urged civilians to move further south within the territory ― only to strike those areas as well. Infrastructure in Gaza, from homes to bakeries to hospitals, has been devastated, and the territory faces widespread medical need and looming famine. “The bottom line is that, in Gaza, pretty much everybody is hungry at the moment,” Arif Husain, the chief economist at the United Nations World Food Program, told The New Yorker recently. Some in Israel ― including parliamentarian Ram Ben Barak, co-author of a Wall Street Journal opinion article calling for international “relocation programs” for tens of thousands of Gazans ― have stressed that their proposals would be voluntary. But Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, featuring what President Joe Biden last month called “indiscriminate bombing,” has left few safe options left for Gazans wishing to remain in the territory, which is about the size of Philadelphia. In that context, critics say, “voluntary” migration amounts to illegal forced displacement. “It’s so cynical to call it ‘voluntary migration,’” Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, told Democracy Now on Friday. She added: “It’s forced displacement. It’s a crime against humanity ... . It should be stopped. It’s shocking to see the silence of the international community in the face of these unfathomable ideas.” Also last week, Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met and “reiterated their complete rejection of all attempts to liquidate the Palestinian issue and forcibly displace Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,” according to Jordan News Agency. And on Wednesday, Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, condemned Ben Gvir and Smotrich’s comments, writing, “Forced displacements are strictly prohibited as a grave violation of [international humanitarian law] & words matter.” “It’s so cynical to call it ‘voluntary migration.' It’s forced displacement.” The Biden administration, Israel’s chief ally and weapons supplier, showed no signs of cutting off arms sales to Israel due to the “migration” rhetoric, even though the calls were at odds with U.S. priorities for the region. On Friday, the State Department announced that it had yet again circumvented Congress to sell Israel roughly $147.5 million worth of 155-millimeter artillery shells and related components. Still, U.S. officials did condemn the language: Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesperson, said Tuesday that the U.S. “rejects” the statements from Ben Gvir and Smotrich, calling the rhetoric “inflammatory and irresponsible.” Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, amplified that sentiment with a statement of her own. But the statements appeared weak to some observers. “I wonder which speaks louder,” former State Department lawyer Brian Finucane observed: “[The State Department] continuing to authorize US arms transfers to Israel, including the 155mm artillery shells approved via emergency procedures on Friday” or “issuing sternly worded statements.” Israeli politicians quickly answered the question. “I really admire the United States of America but with all due respect, we are not another star in the American flag,” Ben Gvir said, adding: “The emigration of hundreds of thousands from Gaza will allow residents [of the border area] to return home and live in security and protect [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers.” Smotrich, for his part, referenced a poll that he said indicated “more than 70% of the Israeli public today supports a humanitarian solution of encouraging the voluntary immigration of Gaza Arabs and their absorption in other countries.” Smotrich did not say where the figure came from, though at least one recent poll showed similar figures. (In 2016, Jewish Currents noted recently, a Pew poll found that almost half of Israeli Jews either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, “Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel.”) They’re not alone: Israel’s intelligence minister and several members of the Israeli Knesset have also called for the international community to take in Gazans via “voluntary” migration. Some Israeli politicians have also explicitly called for the re-establishment of Israeli settlements in Gaza, another idea that has gained steam since Oct. 7. (Israel withdrew its settlers from the Strip in 2005.) And one recent Jerusalem Post opinion piece, by an Israeli geographer, referred to Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula as “an ideal location to develop a spacious resettlement for the people of Gaza.” Gazan objections to such a plan, the geographer Joel Roskin argued, can be chalked up to “their desire to destroy Israel.” The next four years will change America forever.

You’ve got to be clear that you don’t want certain customers coming in.” Wilson, who is no longer with Lululemon, also criticized the company’s decision to include people in its advertising whom he deemed “sickly” and “unhealthy”-looking and “not inspirational,” according to Forbes. Wilson founded the apparel brand in 1998 and resigned as chairman in 2013, after making fatphobic remarks in response to a backlash the company received for the sheerness of some of the brand’s leggings. “Frankly, some women’s bodies just don’t actually work [for the yoga pants],” Wilson said on Bloomberg TV’s “Street Smart” program in November 2013, months after the company initially came under criticism for selling yoga pants that turned out to be see-through. “It’s more really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it.” In recent years, the company has tried to distance itself from Wilson’s infamous comments, introducing extended sizing in 2020. The retailer now says its core values include “personal responsibility, entrepreneurship, honesty, courage, connection, fun, and inclusion.” In 2020, the company created a team dedicated to the principles of inclusion, diversity, equity and action, or “IDEA.” However, some Lululemon employees have said the company lacks racial sensitivity. One former employee told Business Insider in 2021 that Lululemon remained an emblem of “privileged white wellness.” Wilson, a 68-year-old billionaire, still owns an 8% stake in Lululemon. He has made or been accused of making a number of controversial comments over the years — including blaming divorce rates on birth control pills and allegedly suggesting that child labor is acceptable. He has also repeatedly suggested that the “Lululemon” name was chosen with the Japanese market in mind. “A Japanese marketing firm would not try to create a North American sounding brand with the letter ‘L’ because the sound does not exist in Japanese phonetics,” Wilson wrote in a blog post for the company in 2009, Business Insider reported. “By including an ‘L’ in the name, it was thought the Japanese consumer would find the name innately North American and authentic.” The next four years will change America forever.

At the event, Haley said that the Civil War was about the government and “the freedoms of what people could and couldn’t do.” She later admitted to Fox News that “the first thing I should’ve said was slavery.” “It just shows you who she is,” Hostin said. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.’” But Hostin wasn’t done. She pointed out that “this isn’t the first time” the former South Carolina governor has been a “hypocrite” on race. “She said, ‘I, as a South Carolina governor, took down the Confederate flag,’” Hostin said. “Nikki Haley, you took down that flag because you were forced to.” Haley was praised by then-President Barack Obama in 2015 for calling and later succeeding in the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House, The Washington Post reported. But she also did this after nine Black churchgoers were murdered in Charleston in 2015 by an avowed racist and had previously dismissed the issue of the flag, suggesting its presence wasn’t a big deal. Hostin noted on “The View” that she covered the shooting as a journalist, was in Charleston when the flag was taken down and was enraged by Haley’s speech at the time. “When she took it down, she said, ‘For many people in our state, the flag stands for traditions that are noble. Traditions of history, of heritage and of ancestry,’” Hostin said, pointing at the camera. “So you can kiss my grits when you try to say some nonsense about how you ‘should’ve said slavery, everybody knows slavery.’ She didn’t say it intentionally because 85% of Republicans are white and she does not want to lose those votes.” Haley’s remarks that the Confederate flag represent noble traditions and Southern heritage are nothing new. The Confederate flag is thought by some to be a tribute to the “Lost Cause” — or the belief that the Confederacy fought not to uphold slavery but to protect states’ rights and preserve a genteel way of life for white landowners. This reimagining of the cause of the war was created by white Southerns shortly after their 1865 defeat in the Civil War. It was an attempt to show the South’s role, and the deaths of thousands of Confederate soldiers, in a more positive light, according to National Geographic.

The Confederate flag, however, wasn’t a popular way to boast of Southern pride until “the 1940s and 1950s as part of a massive resistance campaign against the civil rights movement,” Matthew Guterl, a professor of Africana and American studies at Brown University, told The Washington Post in 2015. “It wouldn’t exist in our national popular culture without this moment,” Guterl said. “When African Americans fought for their equality … the battle flag was recovered and redeployed as a symbol of opposition to it.” He added: “What was once a very blatant, full-throated defense of white supremacy has now become this gesture to heritage and history that is presented as though it has nothing to do with the civil rights movement.

Greg Abbott to court again over his escalating response to border crossers arriving from Mexico. The lawsuit draws Texas into another clash over immigration at a time when New York and Chicago are pushing back on buses and planes carrying migrants sent by Abbott to Democrat-led cities nationwide. Texas is also fighting separate court battles to keep razor wire on the border and a floating barrier in the Rio Grande. But a law Abbott signed last month poses a broader and bigger challenge to the U.S. government’s authority over immigration. In addition to allowing police anywhere in Texas to arrest migrants on charges of illegal entry, local judges could also order migrants to leave the country. The law is set to take effect in March. The lawsuit was filed in Austin. Civil rights organizations and officials in El Paso County, Texas, filed a lawsuit last month that similarly described the new law as unconstitutional overreach. The Justice Department sent Abbott a letter last week threatening legal action unless Texas reversed course. In response, Abbott posted on X that the Biden administration “not only refuses to enforce current U.S. immigration laws, they now want to stop Texas from enforcing laws against illegal immigration.” On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson and about 60 fellow Republicans visited the Texas border city of Eagle Pass, which has been the center of Abbott’s $10 billion border initiative known as Operation Lone Star. Johnson suggested he could use a looming government funding deadline as further leverage for hard-line border policies. President Joe Biden has expressed willingness to make policy compromises because the number of migrants crossing the border is an increasing challenge for his 2024 reelection campaign. Johnson praised Abbott, who was not in Eagle Pass, and slammed the lawsuits that seek to undo Texas’ aggressive border measures. “It’s absolute insanity,” Johnson said. There are consequences for migrants who enter the U.S. unlawfully by crossing the border between ports of entry. You may be returned to your home country if it is quickly determined you are not eligible for asylum. pic.twitter.com/2BrS7gdPlJ Illegal crossings along the southern U.S. border topped 10,000 on several days in December, a number that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Troy Miller called “unprecedented.” U.S. authorities closed cargo rail crossings in Eagle Pass and El Paso for five days last month, calling it a response to a large number of migrants riding freight trains through Mexico to the border. Authorities this week also resumed full operations at a bridge in Eagle Pass and other crossings in San Diego and Arizona that had been temporarily closed. Legal experts and opponents say Texas’ new law is the most far-reaching attempt by a state to police immigration since a 2010 Arizona law that was partially struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. Under the Texas law, migrants could either agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Migrants who don’t leave could face arrest again under more serious felony charges. The next four years will change America forever.

The law can be enforced anywhere in Texas but some places are off-limits, including schools and churches. For more than two years, Texas has run a smaller-scale operation on the border to arrest migrants on misdemeanor charges of trespassing. Although that was also intended to stem illegal crossings, there is little indication that it has done so.

Later in the chat, Owens was asked if he considers himself to be “the catch” in his relationship with Biles, to which he replied: “I always say that the men are the catch.” Among those who came to Biles’ defense was “View” co-host Sunny Hostin, who expressed her dismay over Owens’ comments on Tuesday’s episode. “He knew who she was. She was on a Wheaties box,” Hostin said. “Everybody knows who Simone Biles is. I don’t know who he is.” Later, she added: “I have trouble with a man who can’t let his spouse or partner shine. That’s troubling to me ... you’re both shining. You’re thriving. You have each other.” Echoing those sentiments was Sara Haines, who zoomed in on Owens’ gender-specific observation. “The part that got me is when he says: ‘I always think the man is the catch,’” Haines said. “Have you met other men, and are you listening to yourself right now? I cannot believe.” Alyssa Farah Griffin, however, urged her co-hosts not to criticize Owens so harshly, given that he was attending college when his future wife catapulted to global fame in 2016. “If you watch them together, he treats her like a queen,” she noted. “He realized he did get the greatest of all time, and she’s amazing. I think he actually does treat her super well. I root for this one.” Biles and Owens went public with their romance in 2020, and got married in April of last year. Appearing on Peacock’s “Back That Year Up” last week, Biles didn’t address her husband’s comments directly but hinted that the two athletes have a competitive nature. “At the end of the day, gymnastics is harder, if he agrees or not,” she said. “He has done my workout in the gym, and he could barely do it, and then I went to their NFL workout and I crushed it.” Watch “The View” segment on Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens below.

It is unclear whether they may have crossed the Danish border. Block’s children were still reported missing as of Tuesday, according to the outlet. German Federal Police and Schleswig-Holstein state police did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for an update on the children’s whereabouts. Authorities have not released a motive, however Danish police are currently investigating whether the kidnapping is connected to Block and Hensel’s ongoing custody battle, according to Metro. The couple has been involved in “an ugly custody battle” since their divorce in 2018.

My 4-year-old pronounced ""French hens"" as ""henchmens"" and now the third day of Christmas is a heist movie. When my daughter was four she tried to say she had the ""heebie jeebies"" but it came out ""Hebrew Bee Gees"" and that's how it's been pronounced in my house for the last ten years People from New England, I have one kid who pronounces it ""Massive Two Shits"" so act accordingly please My kid sure is doing a lot of dinosplaining for someone who pronounces it belociraptor 2 pronounces Ladybug ""itchy butt"" and I just thought you all needed to know that. Our toddler is currently loving the movie Brave and keeps pronouncing the name of the princess as Mierda instead of Merida, and I hope you all know that mierda is shit in spanish so our next family get together will be interesting My 5 year old pronounces whack-a-mole exactly like guacamole My 1yo recently learned how to say “Hiiiii!” Except she pronounces it with a “D.” So every morning when I get her up the first thing she says to me in her sweet little voice: “Dieeeeee.” 4: Are you peeing or pooping? Me: What? I’m peeing, why? 4: It’s hard to know, you pee AND poop out of your pajama. Me: Uhhhh…I think you mean vagina and no that’s not accurate. Hats off to the waiter that kept a straight face as my 5yo ordered the vagina for lunch instead of the lasagna. I miss the days when my kid pronounced it “skellington” like some kind of victorian urchin Even though my oldest daughter is now 20 I'm still a annoyed that someone at some point told her they're pronounced strawberries, not straw babies My toddler pronounces “twirling” like “squirreling” and no one better not ever correct her. #toddlerlife #toddlers #parenting 9 is a FAB reader.But yesterday he pronounced “prologue” as “proLUGE” & it reminded me of the words he mixed up as a toddler:McDonald’s was “making Donald’s”Yellow was “yeller”fruit snacks were “nemos” (my fave)I needed that throwback after another LONG homeschool day ❤️ Please don’t be offended when my 4yo introduces you to Percy, his toy parrot. He can’t pronounce his “r”s. My 2 yo pronounces Corn Flakes ""porn face"", which makes the sentence ""mommy is eating corn flakes"" less family friendly than it should be. 9: Daddy, I’m only going into 4th Grade, I don’t talk like William Shakespeare yet (pronounced as Shaq-is-pear) My 4yo pronounces peanut butter as ""peed-a-butter"" and that is now how that is pronounced from here on in, and I will not be taking questions on the matter.

A trailer for a new horror movie starring a knife-wielding Mickey Mouse dropped Monday — the same day the 1928 version of the Disney character featured in the short film “Steamboat Willie” entered the public domain. Titled “Mickey’s Mouse Trap,” the trailer features a “Steamboat Willie” version of the rodent playing a fatal game of cat and mouse with a group of young adults who have to Donald duck his blade. The film was shot, edited and directed by Jamie Bailey and written by Simon Phillips, who also assumes the role of the murderous mouse, Entertainment Weekly reported. Phillips also posted the trailer to his YouTube account. The upcoming movie isn’t just having fun at Disney’s expense. It seems to be lifting iconography from other beloved franchises as well. In the teaser, the killing spree is set in an amusement park arcade — a setting better suited for another well-known mouse, Chuck E. Cheese. The villain in this movie also wears a twisted-looking Mickey Mouse mask that vaguely resembles Ghostface’s in the “Scream” movies. If that seems like a stretch, a character in the trailer literally says: “Like, if he was in a horror movie, you’d never say, ‘I’ll be right back.’ Because then you don’t.” In the original 1996 “Scream” movie, a character says the line: “Never ever ever under any circumstances say ‘I’ll be right back’ because you won’t be back.” The idea to model a murderous Mickey after Ghostface may seem a bit lazy, but it makes sense if you want to slap together a trailer quickly enough to release it the same day the copyright on the “Steamboat Willie” film expired. Creators are only allowed to use “the more mischievous, rat-like, non-speaking boat captain” featured in “Steamboat Willie” in their work, according to copyright law, The Associated Press reported. So, modeling a murder-happy Mickey that’s not allowed to talk after the mostly silent Ghostface — who rarely speaks in person and usually makes his legendary quips over the phone — creates a nice loophole. “Mickey’s Mouse Trap” isn’t the only “Steamboat Willie” horror offering we’re going to get, either. A video game from Nightmare Forge, titled “Infestation 88,” also released a trailer Monday featuring a much more sinister Mickey. Director Steven LaMorte is set to work on an untitled horror-comedy based on “Steamboat Willie” that will start production in the spring, Variety reported. But this time the “sadistic mouse will torment a group of unsuspecting ferry passengers.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

(AP) — A New Jersey imam shot outside a Newark mosque on Wednesday succumbed to gunshot wounds, authorities said. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said that the imam’s loss will be felt across the state and city. He said the evidence doesn’t indicate a motive related to bias or terrorism. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — A New Jersey imam was critically wounded in a shooting outside a mosque on Wednesday. Officers sought to identify and arrest the shooter, and while the motive wasn’t clear, the governor promised to do what’s possible to protect houses of worship. The cleric was shot after 6 a.m. outside the Masjid-Muhammad-Newark Mosque, Newark Public Safety Director Fritz Fragé said in an emailed statement. The victim was taken to nearby University Hospital and is in critical condition, authorities said. Hours later, police had no one in custody. It's unclear what led to the violence and if the imam was targeted. Fragé said the shooting is under investigation and no other information is available. A message seeking more information was left with the mosque. Gov. Phil Murphy identified the victim as Imam Hassan Sharif. He noted that authorities have no information about who shot him, or why. “At a time when the Muslim community is concerned by an increase of bias incidents and crimes, I want to assure the Muslim community and people of all faiths that we will do everything in our power to keep all residents safe, especially in or near our houses of worship,” Murphy's statement said.

Holmes","Amy Robach says that she fell “into like” with fellow TV journalist T.J. Holmes and there was nothing she could do about it. During an episode Tuesday of their iHeartMedia podcast, “Amy and T.J.,” the couple and former co-hosts of “GMA3: What You Need to Know” reflected on their relationship and their eventful past year. The two became the subjects of a media frenzy when news of their romantic relationship became public in November 2022, and now they’re dishing on how their romance came to be. Speaking about things that she’s learned in 2023, Robach said: “It’s better to fall into like and then walk into love.” “I chose love after falling into like,” she said about her feelings for Holmes. “I couldn’t help how much I liked you. I just always liked being around you.” Holmes and Robach were married to other people when the Daily Mail sparked a media frenzy on Nov. 30, 2022, by publishing photos of them having drinks together and staying at a cottage in upstate New York. A spokesperson for ABC announced in January 2023 that the two would be leaving the network after they were taken off the air the month before. The two had also appeared frequently on “Good Morning America.” They both have insisted in earlier episodes of their podcast that they were in the middle of divorcing their spouses when they were photographed out and about together. Robach reportedly separated from actor Andrew Shue in August 2022, and their divorce was finalized last March. Holmes filed for divorce from attorney Marilee Fiebig in December 2022 and reached a divorce settlement in October. Elsewhere in Tuesday’s episode of “Amy and T.J.,” the TV journalists shared a slew of lessons from 2023, with many of their revelations hinting at their past relationships and their very public romance scandal. “You don’t really know someone until you divorce them,” Robach said at one point in the episode. “In 2023, I learned that tabloid stories aren’t reported, they’re planted,” Holmes said at another point. On Sunday, Robach and Holmes shared a video montage recapping their past year together in a joint Instagram post on New Year’s Eve.

The NLRB officials allege in a complaint filed Wednesday that SpaceX interrogated workers about the letter and pressured them not to distribute it, according to board spokesperson Kayla Blado. The letter had directly criticized Musk’s behavior on social media. The complaint also claims the company “invited employees to quit” and threatened them with termination for exercising their rights, Blado said. SpaceX, which is based in Hawthorne, California, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is against the law for employers to retaliate against workers for exercising “protected concerted activity,” or banding together with other workers in hopes of improving their working conditions. Employers who violate the law can be ordered to offer reinstatement or other measures to make workers whole. Late last year an attorney filed charges with the labor board against SpaceX alleging the company had fired several workers for “speaking up against SpaceX’s failure and refusal to address the culture of sexism, harassment and discrimination that permeates the workplace.” Employees had written the open letter in 2022 and cited some of Musk’s tweets on his social media platform now known as X, according to the charges. The decision by the NLRB’s general counsel to pursue a case against SpaceX means investigators at the board looked into the allegations and found merit in them. Barring a settlement between the board and the company, the case would go to a hearing in which witnesses are called for both sides. The charges submitted to the labor board alleged that after firing five workers, SpaceX continued a “campaign of retaliation and intimidation,” including “coercive interrogations” that led to another three terminations. They also said that during interviews, management showed workers screenshots from private Signal chat groups, making them believe they were being watched. One of the fired workers told The New York Times in November that “it was hard for me to believe what was happening, it was so brazen.” The next four years will change America forever.

He purchased X, then known as Twitter, in 2022 for $44 billion. He said last year that he had laid off 6,000 employees since acquiring it. X has suffered from an exodus of advertisers no longer willing to promote their products on the platform under Musk’s management. Musk recently said such companies can “go f**k” themselves.

As of Wednesday afternoon, the states that have reported receiving bomb threats include Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi and Montana. The threats resulted in government buildings either proceeding with an evacuation or a lockdown as police searched the area, but local authorities so far have not found evidence of dangerous items. Gabriel Sterling, the operating officer for the Georgia secretary of state’s office, said earlier Wednesday that a bomb threat was delaying the state Capitol from opening. The Georgia Department of Public Safety said it determined the threat was not credible after conducting a sweep of the building. According to the department, the bomb threat response was triggered by a hoax email sent to a state employee. The state Capitol has since been given the all clear. In Kentucky, police asked everyone to evacuate the state Capitol after the secretary of state’s office received an email containing a bomb threat. KSP is investigating the threat, according to Gov. Andy Beshear (D), who added that everyone who was at the Capitol is safe. Officials said the threat was also sent to multiple secretary of state offices throughout the country, according to LEX18-TV. It’s unclear if all the state Capitols reporting threats on Wednesday specifically received the same email containing a bomb threat. “We are aware of similar threats made to other offices across the country,” Beshear posted on X. “We thank our first responders for their quick response, and we will provide more updates.” While everyone is safe, KSP has asked everyone to evacuate the state Capitol and is investigating a threat received by the Secretary of State’s Office. We are aware of similar threats made to other offices across the country. 1/2 In Michigan, an emergency announcement said that the state Capitol had been evacuated on Wednesday morning “due to safety and security concerns. According to The Detroit News, an email reportedly containing a bomb threat was sent to the Michigan State Capitol Commission’s general account. State troopers were still sweeping the Capitol as of Wednesday afternoon, the outlet reported, and officials will keep the building closed for the rest of the day. “This is not how I wanted to start 2024,” Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky tweeted. “I’m glad everyone is safe, but this violence is detrimental to our democracy.” The Mississippi State Capitol went on lockdown due to a bomb threat, according to Department of Public Safety spokesperson Bailey Martin. Martin said the investigation is ongoing, but police have since searched the area and did not find any dangerous items. Connecticut and Montana’s state Capitols also underwent evacuations in response to a bomb threat, however officials in both states have since reported that a police sweep of the buildings revealed no explosives. Across the state Capitol, local outlets reported that the Minnesota Supreme Court had to evacuate the building in the middle of oral arguments due to a threat. It’s unclear whether that threat has been resolved. In a statement to HuffPost, the FBI said it is “aware of the numerous hoax incidents wherein a bomb threat at a state Capitol building is made,and urges the public to “remain vigilant” and inform law enforcement of any suspicious activity. “The FBI takes hoax threats very seriously because it puts innocent people at risk,” the agency said. “While we have no information to indicate a specific and credible threat, we will continue to work with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to gather, share and act upon threat information as it comes to our attention.” The threats come just days after Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows became the target of a swatting attempt, where someone makes a fake call to emergency services with the intent of bringing a large first responder presence, including SWAT teams, to another person’s residence. Bellows was not home at the time. Last week, Bellows came under the spotlight for deciding to remove Trump from the 2024 presidential ballot. The secretary of state believes that the swatting attempt stemmed from that decision because it occurred after a conservative activist posted her home address on social media. “And it was posted in anger and with violent intent by those who have been extending threatening communications toward me, my family and my office,” she told The Associated Press on Sunday.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. From bending to lifting to pushing, shoveling snow is nothing short of a whole-body workout. And while we don’t have the answer to making snow removal completely effortless, there is a solid solution for making it a whole lot easier. In fact, there’s a Shovelution. With an ergonomic spring-loaded double handle, Snow Joe’s strain-reducing Shovelution shovel helps you clear walkways and stairs without all the hunching over (the brand says it can reduce up to 30% of back strain). The second handle acts as a fulcrum to let you “spring and fling” snow with ease and lift more without bending and toss it out of the way without over-extending. And right now, it’s on sale for even less than its Black Friday price. This 20-inch-wide shovel is currently $29.99 with an additional $6-off coupon you can apply before checkout, making it less than $24. It’s a lightweight shovel that reviewers say is great for older folks, people with mobility or back issues or anyone who just really despises shoveling. It even has an impact-resistant blade for tough jobs. “I was worried this would be a gimmick, but it isn’t,” one reviewer wrote, adding that because the shovel itself is lighter than other models, they didn’t think it would be durable, but the spring-assisted handle really made shoveling easy. In fact, multiple reviews call this shovel a game-changer. Whether you have a lot of space to clear or just need to shovel a short walkway, this ingenious two-handle shovel is here to save you from straining and stressing your muscles this winter. The brand even offers a two-year warranty. Read some of the thousands of reviews from Amazon, where the Shovelution has a 4.5-star rating from more than 25,000 users: “As the person that shovels the driveway, I can say this is a great shovel. Always used a tradition one, but having the added handle makes so much difference in moving/throwing the snow. Have used it once with an 8-inch wet snowfall. First time I finished shoveling snow & didn’t have a backache!” — b.horn “Wow, I should have bought this sooner! This is my 2nd winter living in a place where it snows. I was clueless last winter and bought a cheaper, more standard snow shovel. It took forever to clear snow and my back would be sore afterwards. That’s not the case with this snow shovel! As a short, disabled woman, I was able to use it to clear 8 inches of snow from this season’s first snowstorm quickly and easily with 0 back pain. Definitely recommend it.” — Annie H “Love the additional handle to help in lifting heavy wet snow. We had a lot of snow this past winter and this shovel met our needs. Cut threw the ice adequately although some areas were pretty packed due to our laziness. But all in all this is the best shovel we’ve had in years.” — CJ “Normally, I don’t give any product 5 stars, but this shovel is easily 5 stars! First, it is my lightest shovel. Second, it has a metal strip that not only makes the shovel stronger but makes it easier to scrape ice off the sidewalk. Then there is the flexible handle. I can push the snow, then easily scoop it up and flip it with NO back strain. I can do this standing straight up. I have a bad back and this shovel is very back friendly. An incredible and simple invention. I like it so much I was thinking of buying several of these and giving them to my neighbors as gifts. They are all using older shovels with no handles and they have to hunch over to move the snow.” — Amazon customer“I was a little worried when i unpacked the shovel and seen the secondary handle was made from flat flexible metal but ended up being my favorite part about the shovel. It being able to flex makes the shovel even easier to use as it just adjusts to your movements while tossing snow or going to shovel some up. The light weight of the shovel has me a little worried about how long it will last but the plus side to that is it is light weight and good for when you need to shovel heavy snow. I’ve had this for over a year with no signs of any failures or issues.” — Nicholas Raimondo"

Ex-musician Theobald “Theo” Lengyel, 54, was arrested in connection to the homicide of Alice “Alix” Kamakaokalani Herrmann, authorities announced Tuesday, after the unidentified remains were discovered in a wooded area in Tinley Regional Park in Berkeley. Herrmann, a 61-year-old resident of Capitola, was last seen in nearby Santa Cruz on Dec. 3. She was reported missing by her relatives after she missed a flight to Hawaii on Dec. 12, the Capitola Police Department said in a Dec. 26 press release. In Wednesday’s court filing, the offense date is listed as Dec. 5. Hermann, a competitive paddler and member of the Santa Cruz Outrigger Canoe team, had participated in a morning paddling practice on Dec. 3, according to a Facebook post by the Northern California Outrigger Canoe Association. Authorities said Hermann’s SUV had been found parked in front of Lengyel’s house in El Cerrito, and that they had found evidence indicating that she was the victim of a homicide. Lengyel, also known as Mylo Stone, was a former saxophonist and a founding member of the experimental rock band Mr. Bungle. He had been named a primary person of interest early in the investigation and had not been cooperating with investigators, the El Cerrito Police Department said in a Dec. 18 statement. At the time, authorities asked residents who frequented “regional parks and open spaces” to “be on the lookout for anything suspicious” that could provide information related to Herrmann’s disappearance. Herrmann’s parents were folk musicians, and she had composed a “round” for a popular New Year’s song sung every year by the San Francisco Folk Music Club, a member of the club said on its Facebook page. Friends of Herrmann described her as a “sweet and trusting soul” and a “warm, loving human” with an adventurous spirit, noting that she traveled the world to compete in outrigger races. In a 2015 interview shared by Loudwire, former Mr. Bungle musician Trevor Dunn said the band had “unanimously decided to go on without [Lengyel] because he wasn’t growing with the rest of the band and we were running out of things for him to do. He got pissed off and I haven’t heard from him since.” The Capitola Police Department said formal identification of the remains is pending DNA confirmation. The Santa Cruz County Coroner’s Office told HuffPost the results are still pending. Lengyel is also charged with felony burglary and felony auto theft for unlawful taking or driving a vehicle.

Or so says Donald Trump’s logic. As part of his arguments against special counsel Jack Smith’s federal case against him for his actions leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, the former president continues to claim that commanders-in-chief can never be charged for anything they do as part of their official duties. It’s a view that has galvanized lawyers from across the political spectrum to urge federal appellate judges to reject Trump’s claims. “It would turn the office of the presidency into the office of state-approved lawlessness,” said Glenn Kirschner, a federal prosecutor for more than two decades in Washington, D.C. Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House lawyer and one of the signatories to an amicus brief in the case, said Trump’s argument that he should be immune from any prosecution is “no more ridiculous” than the Biden hypothetical. He said Trump’s lawyers have not been able to come up with any sound legal arguments on his behalf because there aren’t any. “There is no legal support. That’s the reality,” he said. “It’s the same as he’s been saying for years: He could kill someone on 5th Avenue.” Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said that as outlandish as the Biden example sounds, if Trump’s view of presidential immunity is correct, Biden could get away with it ― “as long as he could assert some sort of national security rationale for doing so.” Neither Trump’s campaign staff nor his lawyers responded to HuffPost’s queries. But his lawyers have repeatedly argued that everything Trump did leading up to and during the assault on the Capitol by a mob of his followers was part of his “official” duties as president, and therefore cannot be punished via the criminal justice system. In defending Trump’s action, his lawyers in a Tuesday night filing repeated Trump’s claims that he was looking into voter fraud, although the only real allegation of “fraud” was coming from Trump himself with virtually no evidence. “President Trump was carrying out his duties as chief executive to investigate the overwhelming reports of widespread election fraud,” wrote lawyers John Sauer, John Lauro and Todd Blanche, who then cited one of Trump’s own social media posts as proof. Smith, who is prosecuting Trump on a range of charges including conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding based on the Jan. 6 coup attempt, said in another filing that if Trump’s analysis is correct, it would legalize a parade of tyrannical behavior. “The defendant’s sweeping immunity claim threatens to license presidents to commit crimes to remain in office. The founders did not intend and would never have countenanced such a result,” Smith wrote in an 82-page brief filed over the New Year’s weekend. He then went on to present scenarios even more extreme than the hypothetical of Biden shipping Trump off to the island where Napoleon was ultimately exiled, should Trump’s immunity claim be accepted by the courts. “That approach would grant immunity from criminal prosecution to a president who accepts a bribe in exchange for directing a lucrative government contract to the payer; a president who instructs the FBI director to plant incriminating evidence on a political enemy; a president who orders the National Guard to murder his most prominent critics; or a president who sells nuclear secrets to a foreign adversary, because in each of these scenarios, the president could assert that he was simply executing the laws; or communicating with the Department of Justice; or discharging his powers as commander-in-chief; or engaging in foreign diplomacy,” Smith wrote. “Under the defendant’s framework, the nation would have no recourse to deter a president from inciting his supporters during a State of the Union address to kill opposing lawmakers ― thereby hamstringing any impeachment proceeding ― to ensure that he remains in office unlawfully,” he went on. A White House spokesperson, citing its continuing policy, declined to discuss Trump’s legal case but said that Biden had worked to restore the Department of Justice’s independence. Norm Eisen, a White House lawyer during the Obama administration who worked on the House of Representatives’ legal team during the first Trump impeachment, said Trump’s immunity theory would undo the founders’ goal of avoiding an unaccountable monarchy. “Trump’s argument actually turns the American idea on its head,” Eisen said. “Election to the presidency would become an authorization to go on a non-stop crime spree as long as a president could claim that his actions, however tangentially, were related to his official duties. This can’t be right.” Trump’s claim of “absolute immunity” has already been rejected by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the case. Smith asked the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and settle the question immediately, skipping review by the appellate level court, but the high court declined to do so. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has fast-tracked the case and could rule relatively soon after next week’s oral arguments. If it upholds Chutkan’s December ruling, Trump would have the right to appeal that to the Supreme Court, although that court may choose not to take it. Chutkan had planned to start Trump’s trial on the four-count indictment in early March, a date that may not be possible given the months likely to be lost in the current appeal. Trump is separately under federal indictment in South Florida for refusing to turn over secret documents he took with him to his Palm Beach country club when he left the White House. He also faces an indictment in Georgia state court based on his attempt to overturn the state’s 2020 election results, and another indictment in New York state for falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to a porn star.

Steve King","Steve King, the white supremacist former congressman from Iowa, endorsed longshot candidate Vivek Ramaswamy in the state’s Republican presidential primary on Tuesday. “Vivek Ramaswamy is going to shock the world at the Iowa caucus because he is the only candidate in this race who’s had the courage to oppose the CO2 pipelines here in Iowa, to publicly oppose the climate change cult, to commit to pardon peaceful Jan 6 protestors on day 1, and to end birthright citizenship for kids of illegals in this country,” King said in a statement obtained by Politico. The Ramaswamy campaign also produced a video of King making the endorsement, in which he calls Ramaswamy the candidate who will “restore the pillars of American exceptionalism.” King, a Republican, spent 18 years in Congress as a representative for the conservative northwest corner of Iowa, earning a reputation as one of the furthest-right and most racist legislators in Washington. He lost his 2020 primary race to a relatively more moderate Republican, Rep. Randy Feenstra, after a series of remarks he made condoning white supremacy. Since he left office, King has openly embraced well-known white supremacists, even speaking at the 2022 American Renaissance conference in Tennessee, the annual gathering that has attracted some of America’s most notorious racists and anti-Semites, including Nick Fuentes and Richard Spencer. On Tuesday, Ramaswamy responded to King’s endorsement on X, formerly Twitter, saying: Most people are sheep when it comes to making endorsements, but @SteveKingIA doesn’t do what he’s “supposed to.” He votes his conscience and that’s why I respect him. Steve King was America First before it was cool. The likes of Steve King & Pat Buchanan were the OGs. He doesn’t back down from a fight and he certainly doesn’t bow to the Establishment. Grateful for his endorsement. Next up #shocktheworld on Jan. 15. Ramaswamy, a former biotech entrepreneur, has repeatedly embraced fringe far-right figures and positions during his campaign. He has touted the work of Richard Hanania, a racist far-right writer exposed by HuffPost as “Richard Hoste,” the pseudonymous author of dozens of articles on white supremacist website. Some of the articles Hanania wrote under the pen name advocated for the forced sterilization and ethnic cleansing of non-white people. Ramaswamy provided a blurb for Hanania’s book, “The Origin of Woke,” published by HarperCollins in September, calling him “unafraid to transcend the Overton Window on issues of race and gender” and saying that his book amounted to “a devastating kill shot to the intellectual foundations of identity politics in America.” And as noted by Politico, Ramaswamy has called the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol an “inside job” and even used a televised debate appearance in December to push the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, which maintains that Democrats are importing immigrants into the U.S. to replace white voters. Ramasamy called the Great Replacement — which has motivated multiple white supremacist mass shootings — “not some grand right-wing conspiracy theory, but a basic statement of the Democratic Party’s platform.” King’s endorsement was once highly sought after in Iowa, with Republican presidential hopefuls courting the congressman every couple years. But King’s political capital slowly depleted after a series of reports detailed his extensive history of racist comments and deep ties to white supremacists at home and abroad. In 2018, HuffPost reported that King had traveled to Austria, where he did an interview with a far-right publication in which he promoted the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. He also made headlines for repeatedly promoting neo-Nazis on Twitter and for endorsing a white supremacist candidate for mayor of Toronto. “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King told The New York Times in a 2019 interview about immigration. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?” The next four years will change America forever.

A federal judge on Thursday ordered former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis to fork over the six-digit figure, which is in addition to a $100,000 award that a jury ordered her to pay to the couple in September. This new award, issued by U.S. District Judge Daniel Bunning, will cover $246,026.40 in attorneys’ fees and $14,058.30 in expenses that David Ermold and David Moore reported racking up in their lawsuit against Davis. Bunning said he reviewed the attorneys’ detailed time records and considered rates of inflation before approving the award. “Given the nature of this case and its lengthy procedural history, the Court finds the hours expended to be reasonable,” he wrote in his opinion. Liberty Counsel, a conservative Christian organization that represented Davis, said it will appeal the September verdict against her up to the U.S. Supreme Court following this latest ruling. That court previously declined to hear an appeal from Davis’ lawyers in the case in 2020. “…Davis is not liable for any damages because she was entitled to a religious accommodation from issuing marriage licenses under her name and authority that conflicted with her religious beliefs,” Liberty Counsel said in a statement Tuesday. The judge’s ruling follows Davis denying the couple a marriage license in 2015 under her personal belief that marriage is only legitimate between a man and a woman. Issuing a license to a same-sex couple as county clerk — whose responsibilities include issuing such licenses ― would violate her beliefs and rights, she argued. Her refusal, however, violated the couple’s constitutional rights, Bunning ruled in 2022. Davis “cannot use her own constitutional rights as a shield to violate the constitutional rights of others while performing her duties as an elected official,” he argued.

A Conservative Attack Helped To Fan The Outrage","WASHINGTON (AP) — American higher education has long viewed plagiarism as among the most serious of offenses. Accusations of plagiarism have ruined the careers of academics and undergraduates alike. The latest target is Harvard President Claudine Gay, who resigned Tuesday. Reviews by Harvard found multiple shortcomings in Gay’s academic citations, including several instances of “duplicative language.” While the university concluded the errors “were not considered intentional or reckless” and didn’t rise to misconduct, the allegations continued, with new ones as recently as Monday. Many came not from her academic peers but her political foes, led by conservatives who sought to oust Gay and put her career under intense scrutiny in hopes of finding a fatal flaw. Her detractors charged that Gay — who has a Ph.D. in government, was a professor at Harvard and Stanford and headed Harvard’s largest division before being promoted — got the top job in large part because she is a Black woman. The focus on Gay came amid backlash over her congressional testimony about antisemitism on campus. Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist who helped orchestrate the effort against Gay, celebrated her departure as a win in his campaign against elite institutions of higher education. On X, formerly Twitter, he wrote “SCALPED,” as if Gay was a trophy of violence, invoking a gruesome practice taken up by white colonists who sought to eradicate Native Americans and also used by some tribes against their enemies. “Tomorrow, we get back to the fight,” he said on X, describing a “playbook” against institutions deemed too liberal by conservatives. His latest target: efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in education and business. “We must not stop until we have abolished DEI ideology from every institution in America,” he said. In another post, he announced a new “plagiarism hunting fund,” vowing to “expose the rot in the Ivy League and restore truth, rather than racialist ideology, as the highest principle in academic life.” Gay didn’t directly address the plagiarism accusations in a campus letter announcing her resignation, but she noted she was troubled to see doubt cast on her commitment “to upholding scholarly rigor.” She also indirectly nodded to the December congressional hearing that started the onslaught of criticism, where she did not say unequivocally that calls for the genocide of Jews would violate Harvard policy. Her departure comes just six months after becoming Harvard’s first Black president. As the figureheads of their universities, presidents often face heightened scrutiny, and numerous leaders have been felled by plagiarism scandals. Stanford University’s president resigned last year amid findings that he manipulated scientific data in his research. A president of the University of South Carolina resigned in 2021 after he lifted parts of his speech at a graduation ceremony. In Gay’s case, many academics were troubled with how the plagiarism came to light: as part of a coordinated campaign to discredit Gay and force her from office, in part because of her involvement in efforts for racial justice on campus. Her resignation came after calls for her ouster from prominent conservatives including Rep. Elise Stefanik, a Harvard alumna, and Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager who has donated millions to Harvard. The campaign against Gay and other Ivy League presidents has become part of a broader right-wing effort to remake higher education, which has often been seen as a bastion of liberalism. Republican detractors have sought to gut funding for public universities, roll back tenure and banish initiatives that make colleges more welcoming to students of color, disabled students and the LGBTQ+ community. They also have aimed to limit how race and gender are discussed in classrooms. Walter M. Kimbrough, the former president of the historically Black Dillard University, said what unfolded at Harvard reminded him of an adage from his mother, a Black graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1950s. As a Black person in academia, “you always have to be twice, three times as good,” he said. “There are going to be people, particularly if they have any inkling that the person of color is not the most qualified, who will label them a ‘DEI hire,’ like they tried to label her,"" Kimbrough said. “If you want to lead an institution like (Harvard) … there are going to be people who are looking to disqualify you.” The allegations against Gay initially came from conservative activists, some who stayed anonymous, who looked for the kinds of duplicated sentences undergraduate students are trained to avoid, even with citation. In dozens of instances first published by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, Gay’s work includes long stretches of prose that mirror language from other published works. A review ordered by Harvard acknowledged she duplicated the language without using quotation marks. Harvard previously said Gay updated her dissertation and requested corrections from journals. Among her critics in conservative circles and academia, the findings are clear evidence that Gay, as the top academic at the pinnacle of U.S. higher education, is unfit to serve. Her defenders say it isn’t so clear-cut. In highly specialized fields, scholars often use similar language to describe the same concepts, said Davarian Baldwin, a historian at Trinity College who writes about race and higher education. Gay clearly made mistakes, he said, but with the spread of software designed to detect plagiarism, it wouldn’t be hard to find similar overlap in works by other presidents and professors. The tool becomes dangerous, he added, when it “falls into the hands of those who argue that academia in general is a cesspool of incompetence and bad actors.” John Pelissero, a former interim college president who now works for the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, said instances of plagiarism deserve to be evaluated individually and that it’s not always so cut and dried. “You’re looking for whether there was intentionality to mislead or inappropriately borrow other people’s ideas in your work,” Pelissero said. “Or was there an honest mistake?” Without commenting on the merits of the allegations against Gay, President Irene Mulvey of the American Association of University Professors said she fears plagiarism investigations could be “weaponized” to pursue a political agenda. “There is a right-wing political attack on higher education right now, which feels like an existential threat to the academic freedom that has made American higher education the envy of the world,” Mulvey said. She worries Gay’s departure will put a new strain on college presidents. In addition to their work courting donors, policymakers and alumni, presidents are supposed to protect faculty from interference so they can research unimpeded. “For presidents to be taken down like this, it does not bode well for academic freedom,” she said. “I think it’ll chill the climate for academic freedom. And it may make university presidents less likely to speak out against this inappropriate interference for fear of losing their jobs or being targeted.” ____ Balingit reported from Sacramento. ____ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The suit, obtained Tuesday by multiple media outlets, was filed at the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles by two women identified only as Jane Does. The women accused Lythgoe of sexual assault/battery, sexual harassment, negligence, gender violence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiffs were reportedly contestants on “All American Girl,” a single-season ABC reality show from 2003 that Lythgoe produced. The lawsuit notes that filming for the show occurred in Los Angeles between January and May 2003, during which time Lythgoe ― reportedly referred in the filing as “John Roe N.L.” ― allegedly made unwanted “sexual advances” after a wrap party. The plaintiffs say Lythgoe took an “unusual interest” in one of them and “insisted” that she “ride in his car to go back to the studio where everyone else was going” for an afterparty. The other woman allegedly followed “to ensure her colleague was not left alone.” The former “Idol” producer allegedly took the women to his home and pulled his sweater over one of the women’s heads, “attempting to kiss her and pushing her body close to his.” He allegedly pinned the other woman against a grand piano when his first advance was rejected. Lythgoe is alleged to have “pushed himself against [the second woman’s] body, and forced his mouth and tongue onto her despite her numerous statements telling him not to and attempts to pull her face away from his.” Lythgoe also allegedly groped the women on the set of the show. Representatives for Lythgoe did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Abdul, who was one of the original “Idol” judges from 2002 to 2009, claimed in her own lawsuit last week that Lythgoe sexually assaulted her during the show’s early seasons and once more during her 2013-2016 tenure on “Dance.” Lythgoe denied her claims. “To say that I am shocked and saddened by the allegations made against me by Paula Abdul is a wild understatement,” he said in a statement. “For more than two decades, Paula and I have interacted as dear — and entirely platonic — friends and colleagues.” “While Paula’s history of erratic behavior is well known, I can’t pretend to understand exactly why she would file a lawsuit that she must know is untrue,” Lythgoe went on. “But I can promise that I will fight this appalling smear with everything I have.” Abdul sued prior to Sunday’s expiration of the Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act, which permits civil suits on claims that would otherwise be dismissed due to the statute of limitations. However, Tuesday’s plaintiffs filed suit after the expiration of the Accountability Act, which means they may have waited too long under California’s standard 10-year statute of limitations.

The Rage Against the Machine guitarist responded Tuesday on social media to a segment that saw pundits decry Green Day’s performance on New Year’s Eve after the “American Idiot” band changed their lyrics to slam former President Donald Trump’s “MAGA agenda.” The original 2004 song famously had frontman Billie Joe Armstrong slam the “redneck agenda” of former President George W. Bush and his invasion of Iraq. Fox Business pundit Cheryl Casone appeared not to mind the track — until it was changed to diss Trump. “The original song was actually a post-9/11 song because the band at the time was upset about what was happening overseas in the Iraq War and all that,” she said. “It’s probably their biggest hit, but now, to change it, to continue to make it political, you’re just alienating people.” Morello responded to the clip on Twitter, formerly X, with 3 simple words: “Is that so?” That sentiment was echoed by countless users who not only found the pearl-clutching on Fox hilarious, but utterly hypocritical. The conservative network has, after all, previously platformed right-wing artists like Ted Nugent and Kid Rock for their own hateful rhetoric. “This same network gets analysis from Fabio and Paulie D,” wrote one user on X. “The song was already (very unambiguously) about how much a republican and his supporters suck, I feel like I’m taking crazy pills,” wrote another about the “American Idiot” track. “Did they think it was a song about a random idiot going on adventures?” Is that so? https://t.co/S41zMFqpGn Others were confused by another Fox Business pundit arguing that Armstrong is no longer “raging against the machine,” when Green Day is a separate band entirely. That ignorance was presumably spurred by an X post from Elon Musk, who owns the social media platform. “Green Day goes from raging against the machine to milquetoastedly raging for it,” he wrote Monday. Morello, who graduated from Harvard University with a political science major, has been a lifelong activist — who performed at Occupy Wall Street events in the U.S. and Europe and co-founded the Axis of Justice nonprofit organization in his spare time. Rage Against the Machine has consistently shared their political views in song lyrics and performances. During their 2022 tour, the band displayed the message “Abort the Supreme Court” following the fall of Roe v. Wade and pledged to donate to reproductive rights organizations. Other users joined Morello in criticizing the pundits for appearing more concerned with song lyrics instead of actual issues affecting Americans. Nobody wants to hear from musicians. For more, turn to Ted Nugent. pic.twitter.com/mN3ZKlhaCP ""Don't listen to Tom Morello who has a political science degree from Harvard, instead listen to DJ Pauly D from the Jersey shore & Wrestler Tyrus."" - Fox News probably pic.twitter.com/UK4ubpTYpd Conservatives really aren't very big fans of free speech.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday repeated his criticism of the Israeli government’s military approach in Gaza, calling on his fellow lawmakers to reject the Biden administration’s request for billions in military aid for Israel. The Biden administration has asked Congress to approve an additional support package for U.S. allies, including Israel, which Sanders described as “unconditional military aid” for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to continue with their brutal war. “Enough is enough,” Sanders said in a statement. “Congress must reject that funding. The taxpayers of the United States must no longer be complicit in destroying the lives of innocent men, women, and children in Gaza.” The war has so far killed over 22,300 people in Gaza, according to local officials, and displaced 85% of the territory’s population. Sanders said the issue at hand “is not complicated,” noting that while Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and nearly 240 were taken hostage initiated the current conflict, Israel’s war has led to “catastrophic” results on the ground for Palestinians. “While we recognize that Hamas’ barbaric terrorist attack began this war, we must also recognize that Israel’s military response has been grossly disproportionate, immoral, and in violation of international law,” Sanders said. He added that is important for Americans to keep in mind that Israel is fighting mostly “with U.S. bombs, artillery shells, and other forms of weaponry.” Last month, Sanders wrote a letter to President Joe Biden, saying it would be inappropriate to provide funding for Israel beyond what’s needed for “defensive systems that will protect Israeli civilians against incoming missile and rockets attacks.” He also urged Biden to support U.N. efforts to stop the suffering on the ground. The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution to provide more aid for Gazans on Dec. 22 amid U.S. resistance that led to the weakening of the proposal. The U.S. abstained from the vote. The U.S. had previously vetoed a resolution calling for a humanitarian cease-fire in the besieged territory. Sanders has also introduced a resolution to investigate Israel’s indiscriminate bombing in Gaza. Meanwhile, as the fighting continues, Israel is thought to be behind a blast in Beirut that killed Saleh Arouri, a top Hamas political leader Tuesday, prompting fears that the conflict could spread across the region. Israel has not commented on the strike. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

In a statement shared by the state media TASS, Russia’s Defense Ministry said: “At around 9 a.m. on January 2, while an Air Force plane was flying over the village of Petropavlovka in the Voronezh Region, there was an emergency release of aviation munitions.” Voronezh borders the Ukrainian region of Kharkiv, an area Moscow illegally annexed and claimed as part of Russia in September 2022, although it continues to be a battleground. Petropavlovka itself is less than 150 km (93.2 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The statement said that no one was killed or injured, but at least six privately owned buildings were impacted. It added: “An investigation is underway into the circumstances of the incident. “A commission is working on-site to assess the nature of the damage and assist in the restoration of buildings.” Social media showed a large crater in the village, with multiple buildings destroyed. The local governor, Aleksander Gusev, said: “I tasked my colleagues in the Voronezh region government to swiftly address issues concerning compensation payments and the construction of new housing. “Our commitment is to ensure no one is overlooked.” Gusev has said the authorities will assess the damage done and pay out compensation. According to the Kyiv Post, local residents complained an entire street had been destroyed. The incident came as Russia has been attacking Ukraine with renewed intensity recently. One Ukrainian MP said the last few days could be the “biggest attack” on Kyiv since the war began in February 2022. This barrage came after the Russian city of Belgorod was targeted by Ukraine, a move Moscow has described as a “terrorist attack.” The Russian forces also accidentally bombed Belgorod, which is around 40km (about 25 miles) from the Ukraine border, in April last year. In a statement released at the time, the Russian defense ministry admitted one of its warplanes had “accidentally discharged aircraft ordnance” — meaning it had mistakenly dropped a weapon. No one was killed in the incident, according to officials. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for what appeared to be the deadliest militant attack to target Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran’s leaders vowed to punish those responsible for the blasts, which wounded at least 211 people. The blasts were minutes apart and shook the city of Kerman, about 820 kilometers (510 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran. The second blast sprayed shrapnel into a screaming crowd fleeing the first explosion. An earlier death toll of 103 was revised lower after officials realized that some names had been repeated on a list of victims, Iran’s health minister, Bahram Einollahi, told state TV. Many of the wounded were in critical condition, however, so the death toll could rise. The gathering marked the fourth anniversary of the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guard’s elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. The explosions occurred near his grave site as long lines of people gathered for the event. Iranian state television and officials described the attacks as bombings, without immediately giving clear details of what happened. The attacks came a day after a deputy head of the Palestinian militant group Hamas was killed in a suspected Israeli strike in Beirut. The first bomb Wednesday was detonated around 3 p.m., and the other went off some 20 minutes later, the Iranian interior minister, Ahmad Vahidi, told state television. He said the second blast killed and wounded the most people. Images and video shared on social media appeared to correspond with the accounts of officials, who said the first blast happened about 700 meters (765 yards) from Soleimani’s grave in the Kerman Martyrs Cemetery near a parking lot. The crowd then rushed west along Shohada Street, where the second blast struck about 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) from the grave. A delayed second explosion is often used by militants to inflict more casualties by targeting emergency personnel responding to an attack. Iranian state TV and state-run IRNA news agency quoted emergency officials for the casualty figures. Authorities said Thursday would be a national day of mourning. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the attackers will face “a harsh response,” though he didn’t name any possible suspect. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi added: “Undoubtedly, the perpetrators and leaders of this cowardly act will soon be identified and punished.” Iran has multiple foes who could be behind the assault, including exile groups, militant organizations and state actors. While Israel has carried out attacks in Iran over its nuclear program, it has conducted targeted assassinations, not mass casualty bombings. A U.S. State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said American officials had “no reason” to believe Israel was involved in Wednesday’s attack in Iran. Sunni extremist groups including the Islamic State group have conducted large-scale attacks in the past that killed civilians in Shiite-majority Iran, though not in relatively peaceful Kerman. Iran also has seen mass protests in recent years, including those over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in 2022. The country also has been targeted by exile groups in attacks dating back to the turmoil surrounding its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran itself has been arming militant groups over the decades, including Hamas, the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels. As Israel wages its devastating war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, both Hezbollah and the Houthis have launched attacks targeting Israel that they say come on behalf of the Palestinians. Israel is suspected of launching the attack Tuesday that killed a deputy head of Hamas in Beirut, but that attack caused limited casualties in a densely populated neighborhood of the Lebanese capital. Last week, a suspected Israeli strike killed a Revolutionary Guard commander in Syria. A Houthi spokesman, Mohammed Abdel-Salam, sought to link the bombings to Iran’s “support for the resistance forces in Palestine and Lebanon,” though he did not specifically blame anyone for the attack. In Beirut, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called the people who died in the attacks “martyrs who died on the same road, cause and battle that was led by” Soleimani. The government of neighboring Iraq expressed condolences to the victims, and the European Union issued a statement offering “its solidarity with the Iranian people.” Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s regional military activities and is hailed as a national icon among supporters of Iran’s theocracy. He also helped secure Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government after the 2011 Arab Spring protests against him turned into a civil, and later a regional, war that still rages today. Soleimani had been relatively unknown in Iran until the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. His popularity and mystique grew after American officials called for his killing over his help in arming militants with penetrating roadside bombs that killed and maimed U.S. troops. A decade and a half later, Soleimani had become Iran’s most recognizable battlefield commander. He ignored calls to enter politics but grew as powerful, if not more so, than its civilian leadership. Ultimately, a drone strike launched by the Trump administration killed the general, part of escalating incidents that followed America’s 2018 unilateral withdrawal from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Soleimani’s death has drawn large processions in the past. At his funeral in 2020, a stampede broke out in Kerman and at least 56 people were killed and more than 200 were injured as thousands thronged the procession. Until Wednesday, the deadliest attack to strike Iran since the revolution was the 1981 truck bombing of the Islamic Republican Party’s headquarters in Tehran. That attack killed at least 72 people, including the party’s leader, four government ministers, eight deputy ministers and 23 parliament members. In 1978 just ahead of the revolution, an intentionally set fire at the Cinema Rex in Abadan killed hundreds of people. ___ Associated Press writers Amir Vahdat and Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran; Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey; Bassem Mroue in Beirut; and Jack Jeffery and Emma Burrows in London contributed to this report.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tokyo-japan-plane-fire_n_65955396e4b0f27b6e35e4be","2024-01-03","foster klug , mari yamaguchi","Investigators Focus On Air Traffic Communication After Fatal Tokyo Plane Collision","TOKYO (AP) — Investigators were focusing on communication between air traffic control and two aircraft at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport on Wednesday, a day after a large passenger plane and a Japanese coast guard aircraft collided on the runway and burst into flames, killing five people. The accident occurred Tuesday evening when the Japan Airlines flight 516 plane landed on one of Haneda’s four runways after the coast guard aircraft — a Bombardier Dash-8 — had also entered, preparing to take off. An orange fireball erupted from both aircraft as the JAL plane continued down the runway covered in flames while spewing gray smoke. Within 20 minutes, all 379 passengers and crew members slid down emergency chutes and survived. The pilot of the coast guard plane, which exploded, evacuated with injuries but five crew members were killed. The Transport Ministry released a transcript of air traffic control communication of about 4 minutes and 27 seconds just before the crash. It showed no clear takeoff approval for the coast guard plane. According to the text, the Tokyo air control gave the JAL Airbus A350 permission to land on Runway C, noting that there is a departing plane, with the JAL pilot repeating the action. The coast guard plane said it was taxiing to the same runway, and the traffic control instructs it to proceed to the stop line ahead of the runway. The controller noted the coast guard gets the departure priority, and the pilot said he was moving to the stop line. Their communication ends there. Two minutes later, there was a three-second pause, apparently indicating the time of the collision. Police began a separate probe into possible professional negligence. Tokyo police said that investigators examined the debris on the runway and were conducting interviews. The JAL plane had flown from Shin Chitose airport near the northern city of Sapporo, and the coast guard Bombardier was preparing to depart for Niigata to deliver relief supplies to the central regions hit by powerful earthquakes on Monday that killed more than 60 people. On Wednesday, six experts from the Japan Transport Safety Board examined what remained of the aircraft, the board said. TV footage showed the severely damaged A350′s wings among the charred, broken parts of fuselage. The smaller coast guard plane resembled a mound of rubble. Investigators plan to interview the pilots, officials as well as air traffic control officials to find out how the two planes simultaneously ended up on the runway, JTSB said. The two sides had different understandings of their permission to use the runway. JAL Managing Executive Officer Tadayuki Tsutsumi told a news conference late Tuesday that the A350 was making a “normal entry and landing” on the runway. Another JAL executive, Noriyuki Aoki, said the flight had received permission to land. Air traffic officials gave the JAL airliner permission to land while telling the coast guard pilot to wait before entering the runway, the Transport Ministry transcript showed. But according to an NHK television report, the coast guard pilot said he was given permission to take off. The coast guard said officials were verifying that claim. All passengers and crew members left their baggage and slid down the escape chutes within 20 minutes of the landing as smoke filled the cabin of the burning aircraft — an outcome praised by aviation experts. Videos posted by passengers showed people covering their mouths with handkerchiefs as they ducked down and moved toward the exits. Some passengers told news media they felt safe only after reaching a grassy area beyond the tarmac. “The entire cabin was filled with smoke within a few minutes. We threw ourselves down on the floor. Then the emergency doors were opened and we threw ourselves at them,” Swedish passenger Anton Deibe, 17, told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. “The smoke in the cabin stung like hell.” The fire is likely to be seen as a key test case for airplane fuselages made from carbon-composite fibers — featured on the A350 and the Boeing 787 — instead of conventional aluminum skins. “This is the most catastrophic composite-airplane fire that I can think of. On the other hand, that fuselage protected (passengers) from a really horrific fire — it did not burn through for some period of time and let everybody get out,” safety consultant John Cox said. Haneda’s three other runways reopened late Tuesday, but about 140 flights had been canceled Wednesday alone due to the closure of the runway, transport officials said. The airport was packed Wednesday as many holidaymakers wrapped up their New Year travel, including those who who survived the fire and spent the night at the airport or at nearby hotels, trying to change their flights. Haneda is the busier of the two major airports serving the Japanese capital, with many international flights, and is favored by business travelers due to its proximity to central parts of the city. Tuesday’s accident was the first severe damage to an Airbus A350, among the industry’s newest large passenger planes. It entered commercial service in 2015. Airbus said in a statement it was sending specialists to help Japanese and French officials investigating the accident, and that the plane was delivered to Japan Airlines in late 2021.

The Fox News host announced on his radio show Tuesday he had moved to the Sunshine State after years of railing against Democrat-led states and cities and threatening to move from New York. “We are now beginning our first broadcast from my new home, and that is in the free state of Florida,” Hannity declared on his iHeartRadio show. “I am out. I am done. I am finished in New York.” He celebrated that he would finally have “representatives in the state that I’m living in that share my values,” citing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott. On “Hannity” Tuesday evening, he explained his motivations to Fox News viewers. “Like so many Americans, I left New York for good, and am now in the state with, let’s see: warmer weather, law and order, better education, more freedom, better quality of life and guess what? No state income tax,” he said. Hannity had lived on Long Island, and routinely broadcasted from his home studio there. He would go to Fox News’ Manhattan headquarters to host live studio audiences. For the wealthy, Florida, which does not levy a state income tax, has long been viewed as a tax haven. The state has also shifted increasingly to the right in recent years, becoming a hotbed for conservative policies under the “anti-woke” Gov. DeSantis. The next four years will change America forever.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Curtis announced his campaign to a TV station after saying last fall he had decided not to run. After people asked him to reconsider, he decided he could carry over his work representing Utah but with a bigger platform, Curtis told KSL-TV. Curtis has served eastern Utah's Third District since 2017. He was previously mayor of Provo, Utah, for seven years and for a time was a county-level Democratic Party official. Brent Orrin Hatch also announced his candidacy Tuesday. Hatch is one of six children of the late Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, who retired after 42 years in office in 2019 and died in 2022. Brent Hatch is a trial lawyer who is treasurer and past director of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization that advocates interpreting the U.S. Constitution according to the context in which it was written. He was an associate White House counsel under President George H.W. Bush and a Utah delegate to the 2004 Republican National Convention. He described himself as “not a professional politician” in a statement through his campaign. ""I have worked for over 33 years here in Utah as a lawyer protecting the rights of individuals and companies. But I still have an insider’s knowledge of the highest levels of government,"" he said in the statement. Romney, 76, announced in September he won't seek a second term in the Senate, saying it was time for younger leaders to step in. Romney also served as governor of Massachusetts and was the 2012 Republican nominee for president. Romney is among several Republicans who opposed former President Donald Trump and have been voted out or not sought re-election. The next four years will change America forever.

The strike was widely blamed on Israel but it’s implications for the war remain unclear. Israeli officials have not commented on the strike Tuesday that killed Saleh Arouri, the most senior Hamas member slain since the war in Gaza erupted nearly three months ago. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said “we are on high readiness for any scenario.” Hamas' Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into southern Israel killed around 1,200 people, and some 240 others were taken hostage. Israel’s air, ground and sea assault in Gaza has killed more than 22,100 people, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Israel's campaign has driven some 85% of Gaza’s population from their homes, forcing hundreds of thousands of people into overcrowded shelters or teeming tent camps in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless bombed. A quarter of Gaza’s population face starvation, according to the United Nations, as Israeli restrictions and heavy fighting hinder aid delivery.

Here's what's happening in the war: BERLIN – Germany has joined in strong criticism of two Israeli ministers’ calls for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Sebastian Fischer said Wednesday that Berlin, a close ally of Israel, rejects the comments by Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir “in the strongest terms” and that “they are neither useful nor helpful.” He underlined the position of Germany and its Group of Seven allies that “there must be no expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, there must be no territorial reduction of the Gaza Strip.” He added that “from our point of view, a two-state solution remains the only sustainable model for Israelis and Palestinians to live together peacefully.” PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has warned Israel against contemplating a forced displacement of Gaza residents. In a phone call on Tuesday with Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s War Cabinet, Macron “argued that statements relating to the forced displacement of Gazans were unacceptable and contradicted the two-state solution which constitutes the only viable solution for a return to peace and security for all,” the president’s office said in an overnight readout of the phone call. Macron also warned against the risk of spreading conflict, saying it is “essential to avoid any escalatory attitude, particularly in Lebanon,” the statement said. “France will continue to pass these messages to all actors involved directly or indirectly in the area,” it added. WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has spoken out against the comments of two far-right Israeli ministers who recently called for Palestinians to be resettled outside of Gaza. In a statement Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller called Israeli Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir’s comments “inflammatory and irresponsible.” On Sunday, Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, said Israel should “encourage migration” from Gaza and re-establish Jewish settlements in the territory, where it withdrew settlers and soldiers in 2005. Ben Gvir has made similar comments about resettling Palestinians. Miller said Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have “repeatedly” told the U.S. leaders that “such statements do not reflect the policy of the Israeli government.” “Gaza is Palestinian land and will remain Palestinian land, with Hamas no longer in control of its future and with no terror groups able to threaten Israel,” Miller said.

We impart our values by telling them what to do and not to do, and, more powerfully, by example. How they see us treating others is the way that our children tend to treat people in their own lives. But as kids enter school and start to spend less time under our direct supervision, the center of their universe shifts away from parents. The thoughts and opinions of their peers increasingly exert a pull on them as they make their way toward adolescence. All of this is healthy and normal, but it can be tricky for parents trying to figure out their role. What should we do if one peer in particular seems to be wielding a negative influence? How should we bring this up with our children, while maintaining respect for their independence and encouraging them to solve problems on their own? Here, two experts share tips for parents who are navigating this situation. Even if they’re not telling you everything that goes on during their day, you know your kid. If you feel like something is “off,” then that’s worth paying attention to. “You might notice a change in your child’s attitude, behavior or personality,” pediatric psychologist Ann-Louise Lockhart told HuffPost. “You might also see changes in how they approach school, grades, academics and their future goals,” Lockhart said. “Their appearance, interests or hobbies might be impacted as well. They might also be less interested in prior friendships, and act negatively around friends and family.” Of course, your child’s friendships will ebb and flow, and you can’t — and shouldn’t — try to stay on top of every little shift. It’s important that your child has an opportunity to learn how to navigate conflict and changes in their relationships with peers. “Friendships are dynamic and while one day things may seem rocky, another day they may be great,” Aliza Pressman, a psychologist and the author of “The 5 Principles of Parenting,” explained to HuffPost. “If we are invested in daily changes, it would be unsustainable and potentially hovering,” she said. However, if you notice that your child’s mood shifts or they behave differently around one particular friend, that’s something worth further examination. We tend to think of a friend’s bad influence as involving substance abuse, but there are other ways that kids can bring each other down. “Some other negative influences include the way they speak to adults in their lives (teachers, parents, grandparents, coaches), as well as peers and siblings,” Lockhart said. “This can include making more negative, insulting or judgmental statements. It can include making fun of other people’s appearance or trying to shame or embarrass them in front of others.” Changes like these are worth paying attention to, but you don’t want to open the conversation by telling your child that you think a friend is a bad influence on them. To gain a better understanding of the situation, it’s important that you are able to listen, without judgment, to what your child tells you about their friendship. They may need you to simply act as a sounding board rather than give advice. “Err on the side of giving silent space for your kid to talk to you, and hold off on questions until you can honestly seem agenda-free,” Pressman advised. “Most of the time, school-aged and certainly middle school and older kids do not need us to intervene unless they are being bullied or bullying someone,” she said. Pressman also suggested that parents ask directly, “Do you think you want me to help out with this, or do you feel like you want to vent to me but not have me say anything?” Kids can often lead themselves to a solution. It may take nothing more than gentle eye contact and a few well-timed nods from you, or a couple of phrases to encourage them to keep going, such as “What makes you say that?” and “Tell me more.” You may have a few words in mind to describe your child’s friend, but keep anything that bears a judgment out of your conversation with your child. Instead, stick to the facts. What have you noticed? How is your child different? Lockhart suggested that you say something like “I notice you’ve been spending a lot of time with X. ... I’m concerned about how you seem to have changed since you’ve been spending more time together. I notice you spend more time in your room, exclude your sister from things you used to like doing together, and your grades have dropped.” When you withhold your own judgment, it gives your child an opportunity to respond without getting defensive of their own actions or their friend. This increases the odds that they’ll see something in a new light as a result of your conversation. Again, it’s important to set your own opinions aside and signal that you are truly open to changing your opinion based on what your child tells you. “Try asking with curiosity and making observations with neutrality, versus lecturing and sounding judgmental,” Pressman advised. One strategy to facilitate this is to start phrases with the words “I wonder.” For example, Pressman offered, “I wonder how you are feeling about Sally. I noticed you both have been bickering a lot lately.” Observations phrased this way “allow our kids to think about how they feel and come up with some observations and solutions with us,” she said. Lockhart emphasized the need to figure out what it is that your child is gaining from this friendship. “Find out why your child likes this friend,” she said. “Look for themes. Does this friend help your child feel included, accepted, noticed or popular? Notice what your child gets out of this friendship they felt was missing from their life before.” It’s crucial to have this information as you support your child in their problem-solving. Basic questions about your child’s relationship with the friend can help you understand their dynamic. Lockhart suggested these: “What do you like about your friend? What do you have in common? What do you like doing together?” After having these conversations with your kid and expressing your concerns about their changed mood or behavior, it’s important that you stand back and let them handle the next steps on their own. “This gives your child the opportunity to learn how to critically think about the people in their lives, how to practice good judgment and decision-making skills, and then follow through,” Lockhart said. “It’s tough as a parent to watch your child struggle, but it’s a very important future life skill.” She suggested that parents say something supportive but nonprescriptive, such as “This friendship seems very important to you. I’ve expressed my thoughts on it and how I feel like it’s affecting you. I encourage you to look at the pros and cons of this friendship. I’m here to support you through it. I’m here for you.” It can be incredibly tempting to say judgmental things about another child or their parent, but you should keep these thoughts to yourself, or perhaps vent them to a therapist or trusted friend. You can’t ever know the whole story regarding any other child or parent, Lockhart said. Rather than judging, she suggested that you “empathize with others, understand they are impacted by multiple life circumstances, and then stay in your lane.” Your focus should be on your own child and giving them support as they manage the situation. If you suspect that your child may be getting bullied, or bullying others, then you absolutely do need to step in. “In general, if someone in a socially powerful position is persistently and intentionally cruel and enlists others, it’s time to intervene,” Pressman said. This might involve contacting another child’s parents or reaching out to a teacher, school counselor or coach for help managing the situation. In the same way that you just know when something is amiss with your kid, you will also know things have become dire “when you feel like you’re losing your child,” Lockhart explained. In such a case, present your actions as a way to protect your child rather than a prohibition on the friendship. “You’re too important to me to lose you to an unhealthy friendship,” Lockhart suggested saying. “That’s the true message,” she said. “It’s not that you’re ruining their life by intervening, but you care and love them too much to watch them be negatively impacted.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

When we can stick to moderate drinking, however, we usually feel pretty good about ourselves. According to the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is defined as no more than two drinks per day for men, and no more than one drink per day for women. That means if we have a glass of wine after work every day, we’re not doing much harm to our bodies and brains, right? That depends. Dr. Elizabeth Landsverk, a geriatrician and dementia expert, tells HuffPost that the way alcohol impacts the body will vary based on your age. If your 2024 goals include plans to drink in moderation, here’s what she wants you to know. Your 20s, Landsverk says, are a resilient time for the body — which is probably why hangovers aren’t nearly as bad during that decade. “The liver and brain have the most resilience during that time,” she said. “The frontal lobes (reasoning, and judgment) are not quite developed. One is more likely to be open to drinking more or taking more risks, and this can set habits that will cause problems down the line.” You probably won’t notice a huge difference as you head into your 30s as long as you’re drinking moderately, but it’s important to keep your overall health in mind. “Ask yourself: How is your health otherwise? Obesity, which is epidemic in America, increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver,” Landsverk said. “Alcohol increases the risk of liver disease and scarring (cirrhosis). As a geriatrician, I would say a glass or two a week is fine. Some doctors say one drink a day is fine, but it is also neurotoxic and that can catch up with you.” In your 40s, more health risks begin to pop up, Landsverk explains. “Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol all increase the risk for heart attacks, strokes and small stroke dementia,” she said. If you’re living with any of these conditions, even a small amount of alcohol can further increase your risk of events like heart attacks or strokes, so keep that in mind. Once you hit your 50s, Landsverk says, even moderate drinking can wreak havoc on the body. “Alcohol, besides the vascular damage and dementia risks, increases the risk of breast cancer, esophageal cancer and liver cancer (after disease),” she said. Because cancer risk drastically increases as we age, adding any amount of alcohol into the mix will only further increase that risk. “Plus, as we age, good sleep is more elusive,” Landsverk added. “Substances like caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol all hinder sleep” In your 60s, you’ll likely begin to feel the effects of moderate drinking on your body. “I can speak from experience: This is the age when tolerance may decrease dramatically,” Landsverk said. “I am healthy. I can ski or swim a mile, but a glass of wine makes me feel ill and slow the next day.” This, she says, is because older people are more likely to lose the enzyme to metabolize alcohol (alcohol dehydrogenase). “At this point, I can tolerate about one glass a week,” Landsverk noted. “If I had it daily, I would feel sick with just one glass a day. Older people have less reserve in the brain, liver and kidneys. The damage to the brain from even one glass a day is worse [when you’re over 60].” Landsverk suggests that you think of alcoholic beverages like candy bars. “They’re nice with some meals, but they can increase your weight and blood sugar, and over decades adds to cancer risk and chronic illnesses that can lead to poor health.” If you want to stay as healthy as possible and feel your best as you age, do you have to give up alcohol completely? No, Landsverk emphasizes, and it’s important to remember to remember that other factors influence the impact alcohol has on your health and well-being, such as if you’re living with a disease like obesity or hypertension. If you’re older and in generally good health, you shouldn’t worry too much about the occasional alcoholic beverage. That’s certainly the case for Landsverk. “I have decided that a glass of wine with a nice meal is worth it,” she said. “But not every night.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

She was clad in a voluminous brilliant blue caftan topped off with a green cardigan — but what really sparked a shopping urge were her semi-opaque, cobalt blue tights. Not everyone may feel totally comfortable sporting head-to-toe color like Peck, but the idea of adding a bright spot to an outfit in the form of colorful hosiery felt like something readily achievable. A post shared by Meredith Peck (@sparkandpepper) “Colored tights can be a fun way to add a pop of color to an otherwise neutral outfit,” Peck told HuffPost in an email, encouraging the mixing and matching of standout colors like blues, reds and hot pinks. “You don’t have to spend a lot of money to experiment with color and stand out while expressing your personality.” When looking for colorful opaque tights, pay attention to the denier — which, as the hosiery brand Swedish Stockings explains, is another word for the weight or thickness of your stockings. According to multiple brands and outlets, something around 40 deniers and up will offer a more opaque look. Peck’s best advice for trying out colorful hosiery? “Don’t take it too seriously and have fun with it!” In the spirit of enjoyment, we’re rounded up nine pairs of opaque and semi-opaque tights to jazz up your winter outfits.

If you’re anywhere north of 50, it’s likely those days are over. You may have already noticed how lipstick tends to run into even the finest lines around your mouth, leaving you with a smeary mess that can’t be blotted away with tissues. Fortunately, there are smart, savvy makeup artists who have shared their expertise with us. They offered some insight on why our lipstick seems to suddenly turn on us. Michelle Wong, the cosmetic chemist behind the popular site Lab Muffin, said: “As you get older, your skin tends to thin and develop more lines and furrows, which act as ‘channels’ for lipstick, which has pigments that are slightly soluble in the product’s oils.”’ Is there an official name for this new indignity? “It’s called lipstick ‘feathering,’ because instead of a sharp, crisp line around the lips, it can look like a feather around the edges — a bit soft and never defined,” explained makeup artist Mila Thomas. After all those years of aiming for moist, glossy lips, you’re going to need to transition away from those types of products. “Oily, liquid lip products are more prone to feathering,” Wong said. “Lip glosses applied on top of lipsticks are common culprits.” Makeup artist Jamie Greenberg said that matte products might be a better fit for an older cosmetics user. “Anything too wet, glossy or thick will make the problem worse,” she said. Thomas explained the reason why: “If the formula is too wet, it will more easily bleed into the skin beyond the lip line.” There are techniques to avoid out-of-control pigment from spreading all over your face. But you’ll need to do a little pre-work before applying your favorite lippy. It’s going to take some trial and error as you experiment with products and application methods. “I know it’s super-annoying, but there’s a technique out there for everyone,” said Jeanine Lobell, makeup artist and founder of the Neen cosmetics brand. “It can help to exfoliate the lips daily, and to use lip balm each day to keep lips smooth,” Thomas said. Greenberg suggested using a lip scrub on and above the lips, too. If you want to do even more to set your lips up for success, she suggested using a nighttime lip mask. Now that you’re exfoliated, balmed and masked, here’s how to apply lipstick so it stays where you put it. Start with a mattifier/filler. “Put it on the lip line, going on the skin and in the outer corners,” Lobell said. Apply lip-filling primer to smooth skin and create a barrier between your lipstick and any natural oils. Brush on lip stain for a long-lasting color base. Outline: Greenberg recommended lining lips with a flesh-toned concealer or lip pencil to create a barrier between the lipstick and the fine lines around your lips. Lobell outlined the process she uses: “Fill in the lip line, overdrawing very slightly. It’s very important not to draw all the way to the outer corner, because stopping a little short of the lip line is more flattering. Once you’ve applied liner, even if your lip color migrates, it will be held in place by the liner.” Brush on lipstick: Greenburg uses a lip brush instead of applying the lipstick directly. “Brush out from the pout of your lips outwards,” she advised. Blot: Thomas said, “Take a tissue and split it apart so it’s only one-ply. After you apply one coat of lipstick, lightly blot lips with the tissue.” Add another coat: “The two-coat layering technique, with blotting in between, will make the color more long-lasting and help it stay in place,” Greenberg explained, Finally, a bit of powder: “Dab the entire lip area with a bit of translucent powder and you should be ready to go,” Greenberg said. “Use a more matte long-wear color for better control,” Lobell said. “A matte lipstick that’s full-coverage with a smudge-resistant finish is going to ‘travel’ less than other formulas.” Still craving a bit of shine? “Keep gloss away from the edges of your lips, and apply it sparingly,” Wong said. “If you need your gloss, keep it more centered on the lips when you apply it, tap lips together, and allow the extra to make it evenly shiny,” Lobell said. “If you love a creamy formula, tap the lips with blotting paper after you apply it.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

It may seem like you have to pee every hour (or maybe every other hour). Depending on who you ask, this might not be viewed as a problem but merely a symptom of aging. And it’s true: A host of changes happen to your body as you get older, including bladder issues. While urinary incontinence affects people differently ― especially with age ― there are a few explanations for why you may experience this. We asked gynecologists, urologists and pelvic floor therapists to delve into the common reasons you have to pee more frequently as you get older. Here’s what to know: According to the North American Menopause Society, estrogen levels tend to decrease when people enter the early stages of menopause, also known as perimenopause. “Estrogen is an integral hormone for maintaining bladder wall strength,” said Dr. Monica Grover, an OB-GYN and chief medical officer at VSPOT. “As it declines, the tissues supporting the bladder wall start to become weak and stiff, thus increasing the frequency to urinate.” You may want to talk with your doctor about getting your estrogen levels checked if you think this could be part of the problem. Signs of decreased estrogen, particularly as a result of menopause, may include breast tenderness, frequent urinary tract infections and bone loss. Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when one or more of the pelvic organs (bladder, bowels, uterus) are not optimally supported by the pelvic floor muscles and ligaments. “If your bladder prolapses, it can sag into your front vaginal wall where residual urine can hang out after your pee,” said Sara Reardon, board-certified pelvic physical therapist and founder of The Vagina Whisperer. “Therefore you feel like you don’t empty completely and shortly after peeing, you may feel like you have to go again.” While you’ll want to talk with your doctor about ways to strengthen your pelvic floor, kegel exercises can be helpful. According to the Urology Care Foundation, about 10 in 25 women and 3 in 25 men will have symptoms of a urinary tract infection during their lifetime. “As women age and progress through menopause, the diminished estrogen reserves change vaginal tissue to become more dry as well as the vaginal pH,” Grover said. “As a result, women do not experience the typical telltale signs of a UTI ― such as pain ― but will most likely experience frequent urination.” Have you ever thought to yourself, “I feel like my bladder has gotten smaller”? That actually does happen as you age. “The amount of urine it takes for someone to get the urge to go is less with aging and the amount of urine the bladder can hold is less,” Reardon said. “Often this is why aging women get diagnosed with Overactive Bladder because the bladder becomes more sensitive and shrinks.” In particular, the elastic tissue becomes stiffer and the bladder becomes less stretchy, which tends to cause more frequent urination. Constipation is more common with aging and it actually can lead to more urinary urgency. “If the colon and rectum are full of poop, this actually can put pressure on your bladder, causing it to feel like you have more urgency to pee,” Reardon said. Addressing constipation with exercise, dietary fiber, hydration and proper pooping mechanics can actually help your bladder urgency. As you age, the likelihood of having chronic illnesses and taking multiple medications increases. “Certain medical conditions like diabetes or heart disease can lead to increased urine production,” said Dr. Anat Sapan, board certified OB-GYN and menopause expert. “Similarly, many medications, such as diuretics commonly used for high blood pressure, can increase urinary frequency.” If you’re the type of person who drinks a cup of coffee (or two) and likes to drink, whether that’s a glass of wine or beer, then that might be the reason you have to pee so much. “Caffeine and alcohol are both bladder irritants and diuretics, which increase your body’s tendency to excrete water through urine,” said Dr. Andrew Y. Sun, board-certified urologist and chief medical adviser for Marius Pharmaceuticals. “Limiting the consumption of coffee, soda, wine, cocktails — even chocolate — can help reduce the need to pee frequently.” As men age, the prostate naturally increases in size, squeezing the urethra so that instead of peeing through a fire hose, you’re peeing through a cocktail straw instead. “If the prostate gets tight, then the bladder has to work extra hard to pump the urine out through this tighter opening,” Sun said. “Over time, because the bladder is ‘working out’ so much, it becomes thicker and more spastic, which can cause overactive bladder and frequency of urination.” Treatments for this problem include medication to relax and shrink the prostate or surgical procedures to open it up. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Type 2 diabetes most often develops in people over age 45. A common symptom of Type 2 diabetes is frequent urination, which might explain the need to pee more as you get older. “Generally there’s a build up of glucose in the blood which forces the kidneys to work harder to filter and absorb the extra sugar,” said Dr. Erica Montes, a physician and an adviser for pH-D Feminine Health. “However, when the kidneys can’t keep up, the extra sugar goes into the urine which could lead to more frequent urination.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

On his primetime show Tuesday, Jesse Watters said he had recently received a “delightful reading” from a fortune teller at a dinner party. “And when I asked her about Trump, she said there’d be a grave injustice this fall, and we may not even have an election,” he said. He introduced Paula Roberts, “The English Psychic,” to give a second opinion on what’s in store for Trump. Roberts, whose website describes her as a psychic, clairvoyant and seer, pulled an ominous-looking tarot card from her deck. “Uh oh,” Watters said. “I mean, I do recognize that I’m at Fox TV,” she prefaced her reading. “A sense of loss,” she predicted. “A sense of loss, but it’s very specific,” she continued stammering, ”no, let me move on.” “It’s as if he may be thinking more about what he’s lost and not still taking full advantage of what he still has,” she concluded. Watters replied: “That’s a great interpretation, Paula.” This “English psychic” on Fox News had an ominous prophecy about Trump in 2024:“Uh oh…I do recognize that I’m at Fox TV. A sense of loss.” pic.twitter.com/youmR7rk2U Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has continued to peddle lies that the 2020 election was rigged against him, and has been laying the groundwork to make the same complaints should he lose this year. Facing four criminal indictments, he has cast the prosecutions as politically motivated attempts at election interference. Watters also asked Roberts for a reading on President Joe Biden. “Lots and lots and lots and lots of money,” she said. Laughing, Watters asked, “from China?” ostensibly alluding to Republican allegations about Biden’s involvement with his family’s foreign business dealings.

The tattoo design — a hand heart on Hamlin’s neck with a heart monitor line enclosed inside — was shared in an Instagram post by Miami-based tattoo artist Alexander Brenes on Tuesday. “1 year later still locked inn 🫶,” the caption read, a likely reference to Hamlin’s life-threatening medical incident last January. A post shared by Alexander Brenes (@chinkaliftattoos) The 25-year old athlete collapsed during the first quarter of the Bills vs. Cincinnati Bengals football game at Paycor Stadium in Ohio last year. After being revived on the field by medical personnel, the athlete was transported to the hospital. He remained in critical condition in the intensive care unit, where he made remarkable strides toward recovery. “When you put real love out into the world, it comes back to you 3x’s as much,” he wrote in an Instagram post that week in response to the supportive messages he had received. “The Love has been overwhelming, but I’m thankful for every single person that prayed for me and reached out.” The Bills safety was discharged from the hospital the following week and, with his doctor’s clearance, made his return to the field in August.

On a Tuesday episode of “The Pat McAfee Show” on YouTube, the injured Jets player talked with the co-hosts, sports analysts Pat McAfee and A.J. Hawk, about a court document revealing the names of dozens of associates and victims of Epstein that is expected to be released this week. “There’s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, who are really hoping that list doesn’t come out,” Rodgers said. Rodgers also talked about the list (but not Kimmel) on a February 2023 episode of “The Pat McAfee Show,” which led Kimmel to play a clip of the discussion on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” calling Rodgers a “tin foil hatter” and adding it “might be time to revisit that concussion protocol, Aaron.” McAfee brought up Kimmel’s previous jab at Rodgers on the Tuesday show. “Jimmy mocked him for it, and Aaron has not forgotten about it,” McAfee said. Rodgers added: “I’ll tell you what, if that list comes out, I will definitely be popping some sort of bottle.” Kimmel clapped back on X (formerly Twitter) later Tuesday. “Dear Aasshole: for the record, I’ve not met, flown with, visited, or had any contact whatsoever with Epstein nor will you find my name on any ‘list’ other than the clearly-phony nonsense that soft-brained wackos like yourself can’t seem to distinguish from reality,” Kimmel said. “Your reckless words put my family in danger.

In a split decision on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta dismissed the wrongful death and negligence civil counts of the lawsuit filed last January by Sandra Garza, the longtime partner of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick. The judge decided that Garza, who was Sicknick’s fiancée, lacked the standing to file such claims since she wasn’t his spouse and didn’t fit the legal definition of a domestic partner, NBC News reported. Sicknick died shortly after the 2021 Capitol riot, where he had collapsed while defending the Capitol building and was transported to the hospital. A medical examiner confirmed that he died of natural causes after having multiple strokes. According to the Department of Justice, video footage from the riot showed two rioters, Julian Elie Khater and George Pierre Tanios, assaulting police officers including Sicknick by spraying a substance in their faces. The two men were arrested and charged with assaulting U.S. Capitol officers, among other charges, though neither of them were charged with Sicknick’s death, CBS News reported. Khater, who admitted to spraying Sicknick, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to more than six years in prison. Tanios admitted to purchasing the substance in the spray and pleaded guilty to lesser charges, and was also sentenced to serve time. In her lawsuit last year, Garza alleged wrongful death, conspiracy to violate civil rights and assault, among other claims against Trump, Khater and Tanios, and sought at least $10 million in damages from them. While the wrongful death and civil negligence counts have been dismissed, the judge has allowed Garza’s other claims against Trump to proceed under D.C.’s Survival Act, which allows an individual’s legal representative to pursue legal action on behalf of them after their death. (Garza is the representative of Sicknick’s estate). “We are pleased to see that our lawsuit in pursuit of justice for the late Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died in the aftermath of the January 6th insurrection, has been permitted to continue. We are now considering our next step options, to include deposing former President Trump,” Mark Zaid, an attorney for Garza, said in a statement on Thursday, according to CBS News.

According to police, Zhuang was found “alive but very cold and scared” inside a tent with nothing but a heat blanket and sleeping bag to keep him warm and a limited supply of food and water. Police said Zhuang’s host family in Riverdale, in the Ogden area, told detectives they heard him in the house on Thursday morning and were unaware he had gone missing. Zhuang’s family in China gave detectives a photo of what appeared to be their son being held captive and in danger, police said. Zhuang’s family told investigators they transferred $80,000 to bank accounts in China after receiving several threats from the alleged kidnappers. A joint investigation with Riverdale police, the FBI, the U.S. embassy in China and Chinese officials found that Zhuang was possibly a victim of a criminal trend known as cyber-kidnapping. Surveillance footage and bank records revealed that Zhuang had purchased camping equipment on Dec. 20, police said. His bank records and phone location indicated he visited the Brigham City Canyon area, about 25 miles north of Ogden, where police suspected Zhuang was setting up camp. Police said they feared he would freeze overnight. Zhuang was found inside a tent in a wooded area along with several phones believed to have been used to carry out the cyber-kidnapping, police said. “Relieved” to have been found, Zhuang asked officers for a “warm cheeseburger” and to speak to his family in China to let them know he was safe, police said. According to police, Zhuang’s case mirrors other cyber-kidnapping cases in the U.S. that have targeted exchange students. Police said extortionists will contact foreign students, tell them to isolate themselves and convince them to take photos to make it appear they are being held captive. “The victims comply out of fear that their families will be harmed if they don’t comply with the cyber-kidnappers,” police said. The criminals convince the victim to send the photos to their family in a demand for a ransom. They may also monitor their victim through a video call, such as FaceTime or Skype, and then send the photos and voice recordings to convince the family their loved one is in danger, police said.

It’s one of numerous cases involving abortion restrictions that have played out in state and federal courts after the U.S. Supreme Court ended abortion rights in 2022. The administration issued guidance that year saying hospitals “must” provide abortion services if there’s a risk to the mother’s life, citing the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment for anyone who arrives at the emergency room. Texas state courts have also brought separate cases about when abortion must be allowed there, despite bans on it under most circumstances. The Texas Supreme Court ruled last month against a woman who asked for permission to abort a fetus with a fatal diagnosis. The same court heard arguments in November on behalf of women who were denied abortions despite serious risks to their health if they continued their pregnancies; the justices have not ruled on that case. Abortion opponents have challenged the emergency care law guidance in multiple jurisdictions. In Texas, the state joined abortion opponents in a lawsuit to stop the guidance from taking effect and won at the district court level. The Biden administration appealed to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. But the appeal was rejected in Tuesday’s ruling by a unanimous three-judge panel. The ruling said the guidance cannot be used to require emergency care abortions in Texas or by members of two anti-abortion groups that filed suit — the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations. The California-based 9th Circuit has allowed use of the guidance to continue in an Idaho case, which is pending at the U.S. Supreme Court. Opponents of the guidance said Texas law already allows abortions to save the life of the mother, but that the federal guidance went too far, calling for abortions when an emergency condition is not present and eliminating obligations to treat the unborn child. The 5th Circuit panel sided with Texas. The opinion said language in the 1986 emergency care law requires hospitals to stabilize the pregnant woman and her fetus.

In the appellate hearing last November, a U.S. Justice Department attorney arguing for the administration said the guidance provides needed safeguards for women, and that the district court order blocking the use of the guidance was an error with “potentially devastating consequences for pregnant women within the state of Texas.” The panel that ruled Tuesday included Engelhardt and Cory Wilson, nominated to the court by former President Donald Trump, and Leslie Southwick, nominated by former President George W.

Abasolo also spoke out about the divorce in a statement on Instagram. “After more than 4 years of marriage, Rachel and I have made the difficult decision to part ways and start anew,” Abasolo wrote. “I’m a family man, but sometimes loving yourself and your partner means you must let go.” Last month during an appearance on Nick Viall’s podcast, “The Viall Files,” Lindsay opened up about how the two have been living “totally different lives” due to their hectic work schedules (Lindsay is a podcaster and TV personality; Abasolo is a chiropractor). “Bryan is a sole practitioner [and] he leaves the house at 8. He comes home at 9 o’clock, 9:30 [at night] sometimes. It’s just him by himself,” Lindsay explained.

On Sunday, the reality star shared an Instagram video showing off the massive faux-snow-covered yard at her $60 million mansion outside Los Angeles, filled with holiday lights and a seemingly endless number of evergreen trees. Social media users wasted no time blasting the opulent display, which Kardashian described simply as a “winter wonderland.” Flooding the post’s comments section, followers accused the Skims founder of flaunting her wealth. “All that money you spent on that bull crap you could help people that really need it,” one user wrote. Another complained: “This is called too much money and you don’t know what to do with it all. I can give you some ideas.” “With the money that was spent with this spectacle could you not have perhaps toned it down just a smudge and donated a few million dollars to 100 poor families,” a third person said. “Kim, people are dying,” another user added, nodding to big sister Kourtney Kardashian’s viral quote from “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” The “American Horror Story” star’s video comes after the mom of four hosted her family’s annual Christmas Eve party last month. Kardashian made headlines when eagle-eyed fans noticed that she was missing from a recent Christmas-themed Instagram video starring siblings Kourtney Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner, as well as mom Kris Jenner. “We couldn’t find kimberly,” Kylie Jenner playfully captioned the video — which, ironically, was filmed in Kim Kardashian’s house.

In a two-page letter to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Habash, who is Palestinian American, outlined his reasons for leaving. “[T]he actions of the Biden-Harris Administration have put millions of innocent lives in danger, most immediately for the 2.3 million Palestinian civilians living in Gaza who remain under continuous assault and ethnic cleansing by the Israeli government. Therefore, I must resign,” he said. Here is my resignation letter in it’s entirety. My words: pic.twitter.com/xv9oVn94Vt In the letter, Habash described himself as a descendent of Palestinian Christians who lived through the violent 1948 mass relocation effort to create the Israeli state. “My grandparents, aunts, and uncles walked over 35 miles, from Yaffa to Lydda to eventually Ramallah, just to survive. For 75 years, my relatives have never been allowed to return to their familial homes,” he said. The U.S. has continued to supply Israel with resources to aid its offensive in the tiny Gaza Strip since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants. Last month, Biden said his commitment to Israel is “unshakeable,” while warning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel is losing global support. “Millions of Palestinians have faced decades of occupation, ethnic cleansing, and apartheid, and the Biden Administration’s passive acceptance of this status quo is wholly out of line with democratic values,” Habash said, adding that U.S. military support has led to the deaths of children, journalists and medical professionals, “violat[ing] our moral obligation as stewards of our country’s tax dollars.” He also criticized the Israeli government’s claim that it aims only to destroy Hamas rather than all of Gaza. According to the Hamas-run health authority in Gaza, more than 22,000 people have been killed since the current conflict began. In the letter, Habash also encouraged the Education Department to protect students’ right to protest the war, noting how “alarming” the violence against Palestinian and Muslim Americans has been due to the conflict.

In the podcast episode, released Wednesday, the “Friday After Next” actor pulled no punches when he doubled down on a previous accusation that Cedric stole one of his best jokes, telling host Shannon Sharpe that Cedric later tried to “rewrite history.” Cedric (born Cedric Kyles) had denied stealing the joke from Williams during an appearance on “Club Shay Shay” in 2022. But Williams insisted in Wednesday’s episode that Cedric did lift his joke. “He thought that I was just a no-name comedian, and that he could take this joke and nobody would know,” Williams said. “The issue was that I had already done this particular joke on BET’s ‘ComicView’ twice.” Williams has claimed that Cedric copied a bit that he used during a 1998 appearance on BET’s stand-up comedy series “ComicView.” Williams accused the “Barbershop” actor of performing the alleged stolen joke in the 2000 film “The Original Kings of Comedy.” Clips of both comedians performing their jokes have made the rounds on X, the former Twitter. “This is not just some random joke, this is my very best joke, and it’s my last joke and it’s my closing joke,” Williams said. “1998, I’m doing this joke, it’s on ‘ComicView.’ Cedric comes to the Comedy Store, he watches me in the audience, he comes backstage, he tells me what a great job I did and how much he loves the joke.” He continued: “Two years later he’s doing that as his last joke on the ‘Kings of Comedy’ and he’s doing it verbatim. He’s just changed my car into a spaceship.” Williams claimed that Cedric and his longtime friend, comedian and TV host Steve Harvey, had already apologized for the alleged stolen joke. “I gave him a pass, for a decade,” Williams said. He argued that he’s only speaking out now because Cedric denied stealing the joke in 2022. Cedric, for his part, told Sharpe in 2022 that Williams’ accusation was “ridiculous” and “some internet shit.” He then claimed that the timeline of when both comedians told their jokes didn’t square with Williams’ claims. A representative for Cedric did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Williams’ most recent interview. However, the “Johnson Family Vacation” actor responded to some of Williams’ claims in the comments section of a “Club Shay Shay” Instagram post on Wednesday. “Revisionist History, regardless of whatever [Williams’] opinion, My career can’t be reduced to One Joke Katt Williams claims as his,” Cedric wrote. “I been over 40 movies, my specials and brand speaks volumes for [who] I am. The ppl I have put on including ‘Katt in the Hat.’ At the Gibson Amphitheater.” “And all that tough talk! Is corny af,” he later wrote in a follow-up comment. “I’m grown ass man. And none of that shit gonna go like you think. You do you and I got this over here.” Elsewhere in his appearance on “Club Shay Shay,” Williams criticized the comedic skills of Harvey, Rickey Smiley, Tyler Perry, Kevin Hart and Michael Blackson — and leveled a slew of other insults and claims. On Thursday, Hart responded to Williams’ interview in a social media post promoting his new film “Lift.” Williams had accused Hart of being an “industry plant,” suggesting that the “Night School” actor took shortcuts to reach such success in his career.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/vili-fualaau-may-december-reaction_n_65970134e4b0bf73e178c7f5","2024-01-04","curtis m. wong","Mary Kay Letourneau's Ex Shreds 'May December' Movie: 'I'm Offended'","Vili Fualaau might have been the inspiration for one of the characters in “May December,” but he probably won’t be rooting for the film this awards season. In a Hollywood Reporter interview published Thursday, Fualaau confirmed that he’d seen the movie, a fictionalized take on his real-life experiences in the 1990s and 2000s. But Fualaau said that he was angered at having never been contacted by director Todd Haynes, screenwriter Samy Burch or actor Charles Melton, who portrays the Fualaau-like character. “I’m still alive and well,” he told THR. “If they had reached out to me, we could have worked together on a masterpiece. Instead, they chose to do a ripoff of my original story.” He added, “I’m offended by the entire project and the lack of respect given to me — who lived through a real story and is still living it.” Released in November, “May December” is loosely based on the case of Seattle-area teacher Mary Kay Letourneau, who in 1997 pleaded guilty to the second-degree child rape of Fualaau, a former student in her sixth-grade class. The couple raised two children and were married in 2005, shortly after Letourneau was released from a seven-year stint in prison. The two split in 2017 but remained close until Letourneau’s death in 2020 at age 58. “May December” changes many of the specifics of the case, including locations, professions and names. The film follows Elizabeth Berry (played by Natalie Portman), a television actor who is gearing up to portray Gracie Atherton-Yoo (Julianne Moore) in a biopic. Unlike Letourneau, Gracie isn’t a teacher, but rather a former pet shop owner living in relative seclusion with her much younger husband, Joe Yoo (Melton), and their children after getting out of prison. Joe is said to have been a 13-year-old seventh grader when he and Grace begin a sexual relationship, later marrying his abuser. “May December” has received widespread praise from critics, with Moore and Portman considered to be front-runners for this year’s Academy Awards. Melton, best known for his portrayal of Reggie Mantle on “Riverdale,” has also been singled out for his performance, which received a Golden Globe nomination. Despite the obvious parallels, the creative team behind “May December” has said the movie was never intended as a faithful look at Letourneau’s case. “It wasn’t the same details — I certainly don’t want anyone to assume that we’re trying to say all these conversations happened behind closed doors,” Burch said at the film’s Los Angeles premiere. “This was just a jumping off point and a way that something like this made sense to me emotionally.” Speaking to HuffPost in November, Haynes noted: “The stroke of genius in the script is how she [Burch] separates the story from the tabloid event of Gracie meeting Joe, which happened 20-some years in the past. It’s really about this outsider coming into a well-fortified community, a neighborhood, a family that’s built up so many barriers to survive that kind of an event.” In his Hollywood Reporter chat, Fualaau, now 40, said that he wouldn’t be opposed to seeing his story adapted for the big screen again in the future ― albeit by a different creative team. “I love movies — good movies,” he told the outlet. “I admire ones that capture the essence and complications of real-life events. You know, movies that allow you to see or realize something new every time you watch them. Those kinds of writers and directors — someone who can do that — would be perfect to work with, because my story is not nearly as simple as this movie [portrays].” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jeffrey-epstein-documents-unsealed_n_65974084e4b0f27b6e36d43c","2024-01-04","larry neumeister","More Jeffrey Epstein Documents Unsealed","NEW YORK (AP) — A new batch of unsealed documents pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of teenage girls was released Thursday, adding several hundred pages to the fountain of information detailing how the financier leveraged connections to the rich, powerful and famous to recruit his victims and cover up his crimes. The 19 documents, or about 300 pages, were half as many as the over 40 documents released Wednesday. The documents so far — with more to come — were sprinkled with names of celebrities and politicians who socialized with Epstein or worked with him in the years before he was publicly accused nearly two decades ago of paying underage girls for sex. Most of those names were familiar to anyone who has followed the scandal closely, including the criminal trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was Epstein’s former girlfriend, household manager and chief recruiter of young, vulnerable females. It was during Maxwell’s criminal trial two years ago that Epstein’s victims, some of whom aspired to be models or artists, described how he dropped the names of his famous and influential friends to suggest that he was the victims’ ticket to reaching their dreams. Maxwell, 62, was convicted of sex trafficking charges and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. The roughly 250 documents being unsealed, starting this week, in one of the lawsuits against Maxwell mostly rehash what has long been known about a man who traveled in elite circles until his July 2019 sex-trafficking arrest left him so cornered that he took his own life in jail. But they have included a few fresh details about a pyramid of abuse that grew over three decades and damaged dozens of teenage girls and young women. Among the famous people in Epstein’s orbit before he was exposed as a sexual predator were former Presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, singer Michael Jackson and magician David Copperfield, according to the accounts of his victims and other witnesses quoted in newly released documents. None of those men were accused of wrongdoing. There were also repetitions of well-known stories about Britain’s Prince Andrew. He was sued by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre, who said she had sexual encounters with the royal when she was 17. The prince, who denied the allegations, settled the lawsuit in 2022. The court documents being released now are related to a 2015 lawsuit that Giuffre brought against Maxwell. Thousands of pages of documents in that lawsuit had been made public previously, but some sections had been blacked out because of privacy concerns. U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska ordered last month that those redactions be lifted, mostly because names in the documents had already been made public through news coverage or through other court proceedings. Among the more interesting documents released Wednesday was the May 2016 deposition of Johanna Sjoberg, who worked as a masseuse in Epstein’s household. Sjoberg said she once met Michael Jackson at Epstein’s Palm Beach, Florida, home, but that nothing untoward happened with the late pop icon. Epstein also had homes in Manhattan, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands. She also described an April 2001 trip to New York in which she said Prince Andrew touched her breast while they posed for a photo at Epstein’s Manhattan town house. Clinton previously said through a spokesperson that although he traveled on Epstein’s jet several times, he never visited his homes, had no knowledge of his crimes, and hadn’t spoken to him since his conviction. Trump has also said he once thought Epstein was a “terrific guy,” but that they later had a falling-out. Sjoberg also testified that she once went to a dinner at one of Epstein’s homes that was also attended by magician David Copperfield. She said Copperfield did magic tricks before asking if she was aware “that girls were getting paid to find other girls.” One allegation against Epstein and Maxwell was that some girls he paid for sexual acts later recruited other victims. Sjoberg said Copperfield didn’t get more specific about what he meant. A Copperfield publicist didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The newly released records also include many references to Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling agent who was close to Epstein and who killed himself in a Paris jail in 2022 while awaiting trial on charges that he raped underage girls. Giuffre was among the women who accused Brunel of sexual abuse. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Juvenal Antero, 24, was identified as the victim of a fatal shooting after two people “forced their way” into his family’s apartment, Dallas police said in a press release. According to the release, police responded to reports of a shooting at around 2:40 p.m. They found Antero had been shot and took him to a local hospital, where he died from his injuries. Police said the suspects left the home following the break-in. In an email to HuffPost on Thursday, a police spokesperson said there had been no update in Antero’s case. Antero’s wife, Elizabel Cardenas, described the incident in an interview with ABC affiliate WFAA, saying she and their 4-year-old son were home at the time. Cardenas told the outlet the two individuals knocked on their door asking for a plunger before forcing their way into the home. “I’m slamming the door on his hand, and I’m holding the door with all the strength that I could pull,” Cardenas said. According to Cardenas, Antero grabbed his gun and jumped in front of their 4-year-old to protect him, but was shot. “We were his everything. We were all that mattered to him,” Cardenas said. Cardenas told NBC affiliate KXAS-TV she is 11 weeks pregnant, and that her husband was excited to see sonogram images and hear the unborn child’s heartbeat at an upcoming appointment.

Chris Christie (R) admitted in a new presidential campaign ad that endorsing former President Donald Trump in 2016 was a mistake on his part. “I have an admission to make. Eight years ago when I decided to endorse Donald Trump for president, I did it because he was winning, and I did it because I thought I could make him a better candidate and a better president,” Christie said in the 66-second ad released Thursday. “Well, I was wrong, I made a mistake.” After he dropped out of the 2016 presidential race, Christie supported Trump and briefly led his presidential transition team. Last year, Christie was asked about his judgment in regard to endorsing Trump in an interview with Vanity Fair. “I’m not perfect. I can be wrong sometimes. I think everybody can,” he said. Unlike some of the other GOP presidential candidates, Christie has consistently criticized Trump both before and during his 2024 campaign. While Trump is facing a myriad of legal issues, including numerous criminal cases and disqualification from ballots in two states, he is still leading the Republican 2024 primary polls with an average of 61.8%, according to FiveThirtyEight. Trailing behind him are Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (12.1%), Nikki Haley (11.2%), Vivek Ramaswamy (4.8%), Christie (3.4%) and Asa Hutchinson (0.8%). Elsewhere in the ad, Christie addressed Trump’s lead in the polls. “Now, we’re confronted with the very same choice again,” he said. “Donald Trump is ahead in the polls, so everyone says, ‘Anyone who’s behind him should drop out, and we should make our choice Donald Trump versus Joe Biden.’ Well, Joe Biden has had the wrong policies, and Donald Trump will sell the soul of this country. Neither choice is acceptable to me, and it shouldn’t be acceptable to you.” The next four years will change America forever.

Mitch Clem, her manager, said she died Thursday at an assisted living home in Los Angeles of natural causes. “Today’s a sad day for Hollywood,” Clem said. “She is the last of the last of old Hollywood.” Johns was known to be a perfectionist about her profession — precise, analytical and opinionated. The roles she took had to be multi-faceted. Anything less was giving less than her all. “As far as I’m concerned, I’m not interested in playing the role on only one level,” she told The Associated Press in 1990. “The whole point of first-class acting is to make a reality of it. To be real. And I have to make sense of it in my own mind in order to be real."" Johns’ greatest triumph was playing Desiree Armfeldt in “A Little Night Music,” for which she won a Tony in 1973. Sondheim wrote the show’s hit song “Send in the Clowns” to suit her distinctive husky voice, but she lost the part in the 1977 film version to Elizabeth Taylor. “I’ve had other songs written for me, but nothing like that,” Johns told the AP in 1990. “It’s the greatest gift I’ve ever been given in the theater.” Others who followed Johns in singing Sondheim’s most popular song include Frank Sinatra, Judy Collins, Barbra Streisand, Sarah Vaughan and Olivia Newton-John. It also appeared in season two of “Yellowjackets” in 2023, sung by Elijah Wood. Back when it was being conceived, “A Little Night Music” had gone into rehearsal with some of the book and score unfinished, including a solo song for Johns. Director Hal Prince suggested she and co-star Len Cariou improvise a scene or two to give book writer Hugh Wheeler some ideas. “Hal said ‘Why don’t you just say what you feel,”’ she recalled to the AP. “When Len and I did that, Hal got on the phone to Steve Sondheim and said, ‘I think you’d better get in a cab and get round here and watch what they’re doing because you are going to get the idea for Glynis’ solo.”’ Johns was the fourth generation of an English theatrical family. Her father, Mervyn Johns, had a long career as a character actor and her mother was a pianist. She was born in Pretoria, South Africa, because her parents were visiting the area on tour at the time of her birth. Johns was a dancer at 12 and an actor at 14 in London’s West End. Her breakthrough role was as the amorous mermaid in the title of the 1948 hit comedy “Miranda.” “I was quite an athlete, my muscles were strong from dancing, so the tail was just fine; I swam like a porpoise,” she told Newsday in 1998. In 1960’s “The Sundowners,” with Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum, she was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar. (She lost out to Shirley Jones in “Elmer Gantry.”) Other highlights include playing the mother in “Mary Poppins,” the movie that introduced Julie Andrews and where she sang the rousing tune “Sister Suffragette.” She also starred in the 1989 Broadway revival of “The Circle,” W. Somerset Maugham’s romantic comedy about love, marriage and fidelity, opposite Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger. “I’ve retired many times. My personal life has come before my work. The theater is just part of my life. It probably uses my highest sense of intelligence, so therefore I have to come back to it, to realize that I’ve got the talent. I’m not as good doing anything else,” she told the AP. To prepare for “A Coffin in Egypt,” Horton Foote’s 1998 play about a grand dame reminiscing about her life on and off a ranch on the Texas prairie, she asked the Texas-born Foote to record a short tape of himself reading some lines and used it as her coach. In a 1991 revival of “A Little Night Music” in Los Angeles, she played Madame Armfeldt, the mother of Desiree, the part she had created. In 1963, she starred in her own TV sitcom “Glynis.” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

One observant fan spotted as much this week after flipping through a 2009 issue featuring Swift on the cover. In the Glamour article, the singer-songwriter described her ideal partner. Swifties were stunned when those words seemed to perfectly match the man she’s dating today. “I think it’s more a question of confidence,” Swift, 19 at the time, told Glamour. “I wouldn’t want to be with a pushover who would let me make all the plans and have all the control,” she continued. “It’s really natural for me to go into planning mode, but I’d rather be with someone who has his own voice and passion and ambition.” Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, is arguably the farthest thing from a pushover, since his job involves regularly blocking tackles for his quarterback. As for having his own voice ― well, Kelce does host a weekly podcast with his brother. Swift also said in the Glamour interview that it can put strain on a romantic relationship when one person is a professional entertainer and the other isn’t. After “interviews all day” and being “on stage every night,” Swift told the magazine, she “can only give someone what’s left.” “It’s always going to be long-distance, even if I date the boy who lives next door to me in Nashville,” she added. “I’ll be flying to see him and flying him places to see me. It feels like it would involve more scheduling, and I already deal with a lot of scheduling in my life.” Swift told the outlet she “would probably stop thinking that way” if only she “met somebody who was worth it.” Fast forward to 2024, and the singer has not only flown out to Kansas City, New York and Boston to see Kelce play, but seen him return the favor. What about that “question of confidence” Swift emphasized? Kelce arguably answered it months before they hard-launched their relationship in October. He not only tried to give her his number at an “Eras Tour” concert in July, but spoke about the attempt on his podcast. “Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” Swift recently told Time magazine, which named her its Person of the Year for 2023. “We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to know each other.” Swifties are naturally overwhelmed at how prescient the singer’s old interview has proven. found this magazine with taylor on the cover from 2009 and this is what she said about being in a relationship back then omg some of it still applies pic.twitter.com/fqGaVxHEP7 Not her describing Trav, 15 years back 😭 https://t.co/iCgIeHSHl6 It still applies today, I wonder if some of her views and mindsets have changed, but I'm calling this pure manifestation 🥹 https://t.co/qcIo6oZ4fE i am not gonna say it but I am thinking it https://t.co/f7JSbrVYDD We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The suspect died of what investigators believe is a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and at least one of the victims is a school administrator, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity. Perry has about 8,000 residents and is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Des Moines, on the edge of the state capital’s metropolitan area. It is home to a large pork-processing plant, and low-slung, single story homes spread among trees now shorn of their leaves by winter. The high school and middle school are connected, sitting on the east edge of town. High school senior Ava Augustus said she was in a counselor’s office, waiting for hers to arrive, when she heard three shots. She and other people barricaded the door, preparing to throw things if necessary, with a window being too small for an escape. “And then we hear ‘He’s down. You can go out,’” Augustus said through tears. ”And I run and you can just see glass everywhere, blood on the floor. I get to my car and they’re taking a girl out of the auditorium who had been shot in her leg.” Three gunshot victims were taken by ambulance to Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines, a spokesperson for its health system said. Some other patients were transported to a second hospital in Des Moines, a spokesperson for MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center confirmed, declining to comment on the number of patients or their statuses. Vigils were planned Thursday evening at a park and a local church. A post on the high school’s Facebook page said it would be closed Friday, with counseling services planned at the public library Friday and Saturday. In Washington, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland was briefed on the shooting. FBI agents from the Omaha-Des Moines office are assisting with the investigation led by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. The shooting occurred in the backdrop of Iowa’s first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses. GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy had a campaign event scheduled in Perry at 9 a.m. about 1 1/2 miles (2.4 kilometers) from the high school but canceled it to have a prayer and intimate discussion with area residents. Mass shootings across the U.S. have long brought calls for stricter gun laws from gun safety advocates, and Thursday’s did within hours. But that idea has been a non-starter for many Republicans, particularly in rural, GOP-leaning states like Iowa. As of July 2021, Iowa does not require a permit to purchase a handgun or carry a firearm in public, though it mandates a background check for a person buying a handgun without a permit. Ramaswamy said the shooting is a sign of a “psychological sickness” in the country. In Des Moines, GOP rival and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that gun violence “is more of a local and state issue” in an interview with the Des Moines Register and NBC News. The high school in Perry is part of the 1,785-student Perry Community School District. The town is more diverse than Iowa as a whole, with census figures showing that 31% of the residents are Hispanic, compared to less than 7% for the state. Those figures also show that nearly 19% of the town’s residents were born outside the U.S. An active shooter was reported at 7:37 a.m. Thursday and officers arrived seven minutes later, Dallas County Sheriff Adam Infante said. Emergency vehicles surrounded the middle and high school. Zander Shelley, 15, was in a hallway when he heard gunshots and dashed into a classroom, according to his father, Kevin Shelley. Zander was grazed twice and hid in the classroom before texting his father at 7:36 a.m. Kevin Shelley, who drives a garbage truck, told his boss he had to run. “It was the most scared I’ve been in my entire life,” he said. Rachael Kares, an 18-year-old senior, was wrapping up jazz band practice when she and her bandmates heard what she described as four gunshots, spaced apart. “We all just jumped,” Kares said. “My band teacher looked at us and yelled, ‘Run!’ So we ran.” Kares and many others from the school ran out past the football field, as she heard people yelling, “Get out! Get out!” She said she heard additional shots as she ran, but didn’t know how many. She was more concerned about getting home to her 3-year-old son. “At that moment I didn’t care about anything except getting out because I had to get home with my son,” she said. Erica Jolliff said that her daughter, a ninth grader, reported getting rushed from the school grounds at 7:45 am. Distraught, Jolliff was still looking for her son Amir, a sixth grader, one hour later. “I just want to know that he’s safe and OK,” Jolliff said. “They won’t tell me nothing.” ___ Fingerhut reported from Sioux City, Iowa.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), the House’s third-ranking Republican, announced Thursday on social media that she had withdrawn her endorsement of Craig Riedel, a GOP former state representative running for Congress from Ohio. “I was very disappointed in his inappropriate comments regarding President Trump,” Stefanik said. “As we begin 2024, my focus is on ensuring we nominate the strongest candidates on the ballot who are committed to electing President Trump this November and expanding our House GOP Majority.” Riedel’s crime? He said he wouldn’t endorse Trump and suggested his habit of insulting people is not presidential. “I think he is arrogant. I don’t like the way he calls people names. I just don’t think that’s very becoming of a president,” Riedel said in an audio recording posted by right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last month. Stefanik’s un-endorsement is the latest signal of the Republican Party’s complete and total loyalty to Donald Trump, even as he faces a slew of criminal indictments, including for his efforts to steal the 2020 election and incite the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Within an hour of the recording going online, Riedel announced he would, in fact, endorse Trump and claimed that a “trickster” aligned with Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had goaded him into making anti-Trump statements. But the damage had been done. Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio) immediately rescinded his Riedel endorsement, and days later Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) announced he would support Riedel’s opponent in the Republican primary, J.R. Majewski. Some Republicans had previously hoped Riedel would beat Majewski in the GOP primary because Riedel would likely be a stronger candidate in the general election. Majewski failed to unseat Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) in 2022 after it came out that Majewski had lied about his military service. Majewski suggested this week that Riedel was the bigger fraud, saying on social media that Riedel had “presented himself as a Trump supporter and accepted hundred of thousands in campaign cash knowing he was a closet never-Trumper.” The next four years will change America forever.

Gay, who was Harvard’s first Black president and also serves as a professor of government and African American studies, penned an op-ed in The New York Times two days after she sent a letter to the Harvard community announcing she would step down as president and remain part of the faculty. “For weeks, both I and the institution to which I’ve devoted my professional life have been under attack,” she wrote in the Times. “My character and intelligence have been impugned. My commitment to fighting antisemitism has been questioned. My inbox has been flooded with invective, including death threats. I’ve been called the N-word more times than I care to count.” “My hope is that by stepping down I will deny demagogues the opportunity to further weaponize my presidency in their campaign to undermine the ideals animating Harvard since its founding: excellence, openness, independence, truth,” she continued. Gay’s resignation came after weeks of pressure on the university to punish the president for not directly answering a question from Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) about whether calls on campus for the genocide of Jewish students ― or even the use of controversial pro-Palestinian expressions like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” ― would violate Harvard’s rules. Gay, along with two other university presidents, said in a congressional hearing that the acceptability of any on-campus speech regarding the violence in Gaza would depend on the context. The remarks by the various presidents drew an immediate firestorm of criticism. In her op-ed, Gay acknowledged that she has “made mistakes,” citing her initial response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants against Israel. She wrote that during the congressional hearing, she should have condemned antisemitic behavior more forcefully. The Harvard Corporation, the school’s governing board, supported Gay during the controversy by saying she was defending the university’s academic freedom. More recently, Gay ― who was president for less than a year ― came under fire after right-wing voices accused her of plagiarizing other scholars in her own peer-reviewed academic writings on the significance of people from marginalized communities holding office in American politics. According to Gay, her research found that “when historically marginalized communities gain a meaningful voice in the halls of power, it signals an open door where before many saw only barriers,” resulting in a strengthened democracy. Harvard acknowledged some instances of inadequate citation in Gay’s work, but said that she quickly corrected them. Gay said the process of correcting duplications was “consistent with how I have seen similar faculty cases handled at Harvard.” “I have never misrepresented my research findings, nor have I ever claimed credit for the research of others,” she wrote on Thursday. “Moreover, the citation errors should not obscure a fundamental truth: I proudly stand by my work and its impact on the field.” The resignation makes Gay’s tenure the shortest of any Harvard president, and comes at a time when academic institutions increasingly face threats of censorship from mostly right-wing figures who seek to stifle speech from people who come from marginalized backgrounds. “It is not lost on me that I make an ideal canvas for projecting every anxiety about the generational and demographic changes unfolding on American campuses: a Black woman selected to lead a storied institution,” Gay wrote. She urged the public to be “more skeptical than ever of the loudest and most extreme voices in our culture.” The outgoing president also said that the campaign to push her out of her role was “merely a single skirmish in a broader war to unravel public faith in pillars of American society.” “Campaigns of this kind often start with attacks on education and expertise, because these are the tools that best equip communities to see through propaganda,” she wrote. “But such campaigns don’t end there. Trusted institutions of all types ― from public health agencies to news organizations ― will continue to fall victim to coordinated attempts to undermine their legitimacy and ruin their leaders’ credibility.” The next four years will change America forever.

Around Christmas, Ramaswamy stopped advertising on television. The famously (or maybe infamously) aggressive debate-stage gladiator will not qualify for the final televised debate before the Iowa caucuses. And in line with Ramaswamy’s late-in-the-game embrace of right-wing conspiracy theories, his campaign’s idea of a last-minute coup is landing the endorsement of former U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a far-right lawmaker whose history of racist remarks led to his defeat in a Republican primary in 2020. “He’s a very intelligent podcaster,” said Will Ritter, a Republican television ad maker, referencing Ramaswamy’s prolific podcasting as a candidate. “He should stick to podcasting.” David Kochel, a longtime Iowa Republican strategist who advised Jeb Bush’s 2016 campaign, put it slightly differently. “He’s the Ted Talk candidate,” he said. For a brief moment over the summer, Ramaswamy’s outsider background, intelligence, and Donald Trump-like penchant for provocation had him nipping at the heels of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. His dominant performance in the inaugural debate prompted national interest in his candidacy from conservative voters ― because of, rather than in spite of, the revulsion he inspired among liberals. But a host of factors have converged to reduce Ramaswamy’s chances of success to somewhere in the “slim-to-none” range. He is now in fourth place in polls of the Iowa caucuses with an average of 6% support. In New Hampshire, which Ramaswamy’s campaign expected to be more favorable for his bid, the candidate is polling slightly lower on average. Ramaswamy’s campaign maintains that the polls fail to capture the depth of the entrepreneur’s support since so much of the excitement he generates is among first-time caucus-goers not targeted by public surveys. “Vivek is attracting new voters to the party who resonate with his message — from libertarians to independents to young people who are excited to vote in their first election for him, he is creating a broad coalition that will shock the system,” said Zachery Henry, a Ramaswamy campaign spokesperson. Henry also rejected the idea that the campaign’s drawdown on television, where it had spent $4.7 million to date, was tantamount to throwing in the towel. He claimed that the campaign has increased its paid communication spending outside of TV, which it sees as a more efficient use of cash. “We are focused on bringing out the voters we’ve identified,” Henry said. “And the best way to reach them is using addressable advertising, mail, text, live calls, and knock on doors to communicate with our voters on Vivek’s vision for America, making sure they have a plan to caucus, and then turning them out.” The campaign does not rule out returning to the television airwaves in the final week before the Jan. 15 caucus. A new infusion of cash will make that possible. Ramaswamy has spent $26 million of his own money on his candidacy, according to the campaign. Axios reported that he has since sold $33 million in stock to invest significant new sums into the campaign. “From libertarians to independents to young people who are excited to vote in their first election for him, he is creating a broad coalition that will shock the system.” But it’s unlikely that new money can succeed where the old money fell short. And while every outsider candidate promises to win by reshaping the electorate, few have pulled it off ― not least someone with a polling deficit as large as Ramaswamy’s. What is instead more plausible is that Ramaswamy could not convert the initial novelty of his bid into sustained support. Ramaswamy’s approach has been inconsistent, relying on a flood-the-zone strategy with media appearances and debate performances, which ultimately failed to make a compelling enough case for his candidacy. After a pugilistic opening round on the debate stage, Ramaswamy pivoted to the role of peacemaker in the second debate, calling on his fellow candidates to be more respectful to one another. The shift in tone raised questions about his authenticity. “The fact that he was two completely different people between the first debate and the second debate gave people the impression that he’s a performer,” Kochel said. “I think he just comes across as a phony.” In his third and fourth debate performances, Ramaswamy was a prizefighter once more, but often in ways that seemed counterproductive. Time and again, he aired his contempt for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley with gleeful put-downs that failed to stall her rise in the polls. In November, when Ramaswamy accused Haley of hypocrisy for allowing her daughter to use TikTok while she called for banning it, Haley shot back, “You’re just scum.” Ritter likened Ramaswamy’s short-lived popularity to other fad candidacies, like businessman Herman Cain’s in 2012. “People who might be a little bored of the primary gave him a chance,” Ritter said. “But he continued to embarrass himself by being zany in the debates.” Now Ramaswamy appears to be closing his campaign by embracing the right wing’s more outlandish conspiracy theories. In the most recent Republican debate in December, Ramaswamy declared himself the sole candidate willing to argue that the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, “does now look like an inside job.” He has accompanied his appeals to right-wing paranoia with tirades against the media and the “establishment” that have met with applause from audiences of likely Iowa caucus-goers, who continue to turn out for his events across the state. But Ramaswamy’s appeal with a segment of the GOP grassroots has failed to generate an uptick in the polls. That disparity underscores the main obstacle for Ramaswamy: Trump, the man he is most often compared with. With Trump in the GOP’s populist lane, there was precious little room for anyone else. “If you like Vivek’s message, you’re already voting for Trump,” Kochel said. “If Trump looked wounded like he wasn’t going to be able to get the nomination, Vivek might get another look. But Trump is leading by 30 points, so why throw away your vote?” Indeed, trying to be Trump while also trying to beat Trump has put Ramaswamy in an awkward place messaging-wise. His latest argument for why he would be a better president than Trump is that he is less bloodied by the political and legal attacks to which Trump has been subject. “They’ve got four different wars they’ve waged on this man,” he told NBC News’s Dasha Burns on Wednesday as part of the “Closing Arguments: Iowa” interview series. “At the end of the day, if we need a commander-in-chief who is going to lead us to victory, I think that our base needs to choose the general who is not yet wounded in that war.” One advantage of Ramaswamy’s youthful ― and more libertarian ― brand of Trumpian nationalism is that however he fares in Iowa and New Hampshire, he will almost assuredly emerge unscathed with the party’s core base of Trump loyalists and alternative media consumers. In lieu of next Wednesday’s CNN debate, he will hold a live audience event in Des Moines with conspiratorial right-wing radio host Tim Pool. “The Steve King endorsement is maybe a sign that he’s not really running for president, but he’s maybe running to be the next Alex Jones or Nick Fuentes or something that I don’t quite understand,” Kochel said. Ramaswamy’s campaign and allies maintain that he is still well-positioned to defy the polls by turning out first-time caucusgoers who are less likely to respond to polling and watch television. One such booster is former Iowa Secretary of State Matt Schultz, who backed the two previous Republican winners of the Iowa caucuses: then-Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum in 2012 and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016. He sees an excitement for Ramaswamy at campaign stops that reminds him of the late-moving momentum for Santorum. The next four years will change America forever.

Ladapo has challenged coronavirus mandates and vaccines since his controversial appointment by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in late 2021. In a letter to Ladapo last month, the FDA broke down his claims while calling his concerns that DNA fragments could enter a cell’s nucleus “quite implausible.” Peter Marks, the director of the FDA’s center for biologics evaluation and research, cited animal studies with mRNA technology over the last decade that he said show no evidence of genotoxicity, which damages genetic information in a cell and causes cell mutations. He also cited ongoing surveillance of more than 1 billion doses of mRNA coronavirus vaccines that have been administered to humans globally, with “nothing to indicate harm to the genome, such as increased rates of cancers.” The next four years will change America forever.

Which is why I don’t get why he does this stuff,” he said while highlighting the 8,000-plus Floridians who died from the coronavirus last year.

Of course, you also don’t want to be fussing with your old, semi-broken snowblower that takes forever to turn on, runs on smelly gas and is too cumbersome to use. To help you stay safe and shoveled-out this winter, we rounded up some highly rated easy-to-use electric snow blowers in a variety of sizes. Whether you’re plowing a large plot or just need to dig out a little walkway, these reviewer-loved machines are here to save you some major time, sweat and tears. Every option has a slew of reviews saying that it’s physically easy to move around, a low-maintenance appliance, or both. Most are cordless and run on reusable batteries, but some need to be plugged in. For the latter, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute says to ensure you’re using an outdoor extension cord that’s long enough to safely plow your area without you tripping or running over the cord. OPEI also suggests grabbing a snow blower clean-out tool to ensure you are never, ever reaching into your snow blower, even when it’s completely turned off. We hope you find an option that works for you and your household to keep spirits bright, even as the snow falls.

Trump’s filing claims that Smith, who is prosecuting the former president in a D.C. federal court, is in violation of a stay order put in place by Judge Tanya Chutkan after the prosecutor submitted new pretrial filings during the ongoing stay period. The stay order was put in place after Trump appealed a previous decision by Chutkan rejecting Trump’s assertion of absolute immunity from criminal prosecution. That appeal will be heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Jan. 9. Smith’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The argument Trump puts forward in his filing is that Smith’s motions are filled with “partisan rhetoric” that “mirrors the Biden Administration’s dishonest talking points.” Since Trump is relieved of having to respond by the stay order, “the prosecutors seek to weaponize the Stay to spread political propaganda.” Like many Trump-related legal motions, this filing is likely little more than a bid to buy time. Since his multiple indictments for trying to steal the 2020 election and illegally taking classified documents, Trump has engaged in a legal battle to delay his trials as much as possible, since he would become immune from prosecution, and even have the power to dismiss federal charges, if he were to win the 2024 election and take office again. Trump faces four charges in the trial, including conspiracy to defraud the country by lying about election fraud, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding for planning to derail the counting of electoral votes on Jan. 6, obstruction of an official proceeding for the attempt to do so, and conspiracy against rights for his efforts to threaten people’s right to vote. It’s one of four separate legal battles the former president is facing: two related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, one regarding his alleged mishandling of classified documents, and one relating to his 2016 hush money payment to a porn star. The request that Smith be held in contempt revolves around the prosecutor’s continued filing of pretrial motions during the stay period where Trump is relieved of the “burdens of litigation.” That relief means that Trump need not respond to motions filed by the prosecution until the appeal is concluded. The prosecution’s continued motions, Trump argues, place an ongoing burden of litigation on him, in contravention of the stay order. The next four years will change America forever.

Log in to hide these messages. The pretrial filings Trump accuses Smith of improperly submitting are known as motions in limine, which state what evidence or arguments should be held inadmissible during the trial. The court previously ordered Smith to file these motions by Jan. 9, which is also the date Trump’s appeal is slated to be heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Smith’s motions aim to hold that filing deadline, which Chutkan said may still stand, depending on the appeal verdict, in her stay order. With Trump asking the court to rule that the prosecution’s motions be withdrawn, and that they be forbidden from submitting any more filings until the stay is lifted, the contempt request can be seen as Trump’s effort to tie up Smith’s motions and further delay the trial if he loses his appeal.

On Wednesday, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said in a statement shared on X, formerly Twitter, that he was “proud to endorse” Trump for president. A day earlier, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) endorsed Trump in a similar statement on X. Both men had thrown their hats in the ring during the chaotic House speaker race last year. In a lengthy Truth Social blast at the time, Trump called Emmer a “RINO,” an acronym for “Republican in name only,” and said voting for him would be a “tragic mistake.” Emmer voted to certify the 2020 election results, which Trump has falsely claimed were rigged. When Scalise was up against Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) for the job, Trump endorsed Jordan and cited Scalise’s cancer diagnosis as a concern. “I never cease to be amazed at how willing these people are to sacrifice their honor and their dignity to worship this man and keep a job,” Conway said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Thursday. “It’s not worth being a member of Congress if you have to kowtow to a psychopath like this,” he added. Psaki, who served as President Joe Biden’s first White House press secretary, said the lawmakers look pathetic and spineless. “Their dignity is looking, you know, is being questioned here for good reason,” she said. “It’s sad and pathetic, and it’s an addiction to Donald Trump by the core of the Republican Party,” she added. Trump leads the GOP presidential pack by a significant margin, even though he has been criminally indicted four times on dozens of felony counts. Nonetheless, few elected Republicans have been willing to criticize him, and even his presidential rivals are reluctant to go after him.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/michael-fanone-2024-message-voters_n_65957bcbe4b0f27b6e35ff9c","2024-01-04","josephine harvey","Michael Fanone Has A Grave Warning For Voters","Former D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone believes the 2024 election will be the most consequential of his lifetime. “The future of our democracy is at stake,” he told HuffPost this week, when asked what he’d like to say to voters. “Ultimately, you, the American voter, will be the last line of defense when it comes to preserving democracy as we know it and ensuring the peaceful transfer of power. And it’s that serious.” “I’ve been of voting age for many, many years, and every year it seems that we’re told by politicians that this election is ‘unlike any other,’” he continued. “But I’m nobody, just some average American, and I’m telling you that this election is like no other.” Fanone, who sustained a heart attack and traumatic brain injury after he was beaten and electroshocked by supporters of then-President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, spoke to HuffPost ahead of the third anniversary of the Capitol riot. He said that in a lot of ways, he’s come to terms with his experience that day, and resolved much of his trauma. But he’s infuriated by Republicans’ ongoing whitewashing and lies about what took place. “Imagine the most traumatic, or a traumatic event in your life, that reaches the level of attention that January 6 garnered,” he said. “I mean, it was an international story. And spending three years trying to convince people that it actually fucking happened.” “It’s frustrating,” he said. “It’s angering. It’s perplexing.” A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released this week found that in the years since a December 2021 survey, the number of Republicans who believed President Joe Biden’s election was legitimate had dropped from 39% to 31%. It also showed Republicans becoming less likely to believe that Jan. 6 rioters were mostly violent, and more likely to absolve Trump of responsibility for the attack. Alarmingly, a quarter of respondents said they believed the conspiracy theory, promoted by multiple prominent Republicans, that the FBI organized the insurrection. Fanone told HuffPost that lies “are the source of Donald Trump’s stranglehold over his supporters.” “Without those lies, I think that you would start to see his support erode,” he said. “But there’s the whole idea that the election, the 2020 election was stolen, not just from Trump, as he says, but from his voters. That really is the source of his power.” Trump is by far the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. But even if he weren’t, Fanone said he would have “a very difficult time” voting for any Republican candidate, “unless the party itself is willing to acknowledge the role that it played” in making the Capitol attack possible and subsequently whitewashing it. Fanone said he voted for Trump in 2016, but now believes that “Republicans have become the party of insurrection.” In Fanone’s view, Trump’s Republican rivals have largely hesitated to speak out against the quadruply indicted former president because they’re afraid of him and his political power. “I think it’s disgraceful,” Fanone said. “I think that any of those candidates who are unwilling to call out Donald Trump and MAGA for what it is don’t deserve to run for office.” Facing 91 felony counts, including two indictments connected to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, Trump has only intensified his election fraud lies, and has lain the groundwork to contest this year’s results should he lose. He has also leaned increasingly into authoritarian rhetoric and reportedly plans to implement an even more extreme agenda should he win a second term, including by using the Justice Department to exact revenge on political opponents. Fanone said his own priorities boil down to protecting democracy in 2024. “For me, the single most important issue is democracy,” he said. “And I see President Joe Biden as our best defender of democracy.” He said he doesn’t have much planned to mark the date on Saturday. “I don’t think about my experience on January 6 on the anniversaries,” he said. “I just think about where we are as a country and how far we have to go.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Your Dog Might Have The Answer.","Thanks to processed foods, stress, less-than-stellar microbiomes and a slew of other factors, attaining the perfect poop is a challenge for many people. Because so many of us want to be doing it better, there are countless books, websites and TikTok videos offering advice on how to level up in the bathroom. But the key to going number two like a pro might actually be the furry friend snoozing on the couch next to you. “I always say, look at dogs: Your dogs poop beautifully,” Dr. Evan Goldstein, a nationally renowned anal surgeon and the CEO and founder of Bespoke Surgical, told us — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, co-hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — when we recently chatted with him. “It’s the diet, and [dogs] go when they actually need to ― not like ‘I need to go to work, so I need to force it.’” Dogs also squat when they defecate, which Goldstein said was another important component of a healthy pooping routine. “Have you ever seen a baby with a diaper that just stands but kind of squats? That’s kind of the positioning [that’s best for pooping],” Goldstein said. “[Squatting] is really putting all of the pressure away. It’s dispersing pressure as much as possible, so that now, everything is opening to give the capacity so you can evacuate [your poop] and be comfortable with it. If you’re pushing and pushing and red in the face ― don’t do that! And then you have to look at diet and what you’re eating, and fiber and motility agents.” Deciding on a pooping position is a personal choice, Goldstein noted, adding that people sometimes opt to prop their legs up on a stack of books or use a Squatty Potty-style toilet stool. “Some people put their arms up ... like on a roller coaster, because it straightens the colon, it changes the angle for people,” he said. One other reason Goldstein praised dogs’ approach to pooping? “They don’t need to clean [after they go] — at least for the most part,” he said. He noted that “the preferred method of wiping is not wiping,” as the use of toilet paper and too much rubbing can harm the thin, delicate skin around the anus. Instead, Goldstein recommended using a bidet or cleaning in the shower, and then gently patting the area dry. If you’re going to wipe, he recommended a gentle swipe or two while sitting down on the toilet, and then finishing wiping — or, more ideally, “blotting” — in a partly squatting, partly standing position, which he said keeps pressure off the area. Ultimately, Goldstein said, “think of pooping as ‘less is always more.’ We don’t want to be going a bazillion times a day. We want to wipe less. We want to create an environment where it’s like ‘drop and leave.’” Just like our dogs. Goldstein also chatted with us about what an ideal poop looks like (spoiler alert: your dog is your role model here too), why he wants wet wipes banned, and much more: After you’ve had a listen above or wherever you get your podcasts, subscribe to “Am I Doing It Wrong?” so you don’t miss a single episode, including our investigations of the ins and outs of tipping, how to score the best deals on airline tickets, apologizing, vanquishing your credit card debt, finding love online, online shopping, overcoming anxiety, making a big life change and getting a tattoo.

The “Transformers” star, who was reportedly confirmed Sunday by Bishop Robert Barron, was celebrated Tuesday in a Facebook post by the Capuchin Franciscans’ Western American Province. LaBeouf was shown smiling alongside robed friars, who were “overjoyed” at his decision. “We are thrilled to share that our dear friend Shia LaBeouf has fully entered the Church this past weekend through the sacrament of confirmation! The Capuchin Franciscan friars are overjoyed to welcome him into the fold and witness his deep commitment to his faith journey,” the post said. Elsewhere, the post went on to say that LaBeouf’s decision to join the church “is a testament to his sincere desire to grow in his relationship with God and live out the Gospel values.” “As Capuchin Franciscans, we believe in the transformative power of faith and the incredible impact it can have on one’s life. We are humbled and grateful to walk alongside Shia as he takes this important step in his spiritual journey.” LaBeouf was born to a Christian father and Jewish mother; he was both baptized as a child and had a bar mitzvah at 13. In a 2022 interview, LaBeouf told Bishop Barron his Jewish faith “felt fake” because he never properly “invested” in it and was largely committed to the teachings because his grandmother wanted him to. He reportedly converted to Catholicism after starring in the titular role of Abel Ferrara’s 2020 film, “Padre Pio.” The eponymous Capuchin friar, who is venerated as a saint, was purportedly marked by stigmata. LaBeouf’s confirmation sponsor, Brother Alexander Rodriguez, told the Catholic News Agency on Wednesday that the actor plans to become a deacon “sometime in the future.” Rodriguez, who starred as a friar in “Pio” and helped LaBeouf prepare for playing the Italian priest, said LaBeouf was inspired during production. “He just spontaneously said, ‘I want to become a deacon,’ and he still feels that way,” Rodriguez said. In May 2023, LaBeouf told ChurchPOP he was enrolled in the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults and had seven months left to be confirmed into the church. His conversion in 2022, meanwhile, notably arrived after a string of harrowing allegations against him. LaBeouf was accused in late 2020 by his ex-girlfriend, FKA Twigs, of “relentless abuse” that allegedly included sexual battery, assault and emotional distress. The actor told The New York Times at the time that he has “no excuses” for his alcoholism, “only rationalizations.” “I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years,” he said. LaBeouf’s trial is scheduled for Oct. 14, 2024. Need help? Visit RAINN’s National Sexual Assault Online Hotline or the National Sexual Violence Resource Center’s website.

Wasn’t expecting that.Kid #1: So I can go to college, buy a big house & be my OWN BOSS & do what I WANT. My toddler’s New Years resolution is to push every button, beep every beep, and make me lose the last shreds of sanity, patience, and scalp hair that’s left to me.Happy New Year my ass. New Years Resolutions last week: Drink less, Get fit, Spend more time with my kids.New Years Resolutions this week: Spend less time drinking around my fit kids. My 8yo told me her New Year’s resolution is not to step on anthills if anyone needs a lesson in realistic goal-setting. Went shopping and asked my 4 year old if he could please make it an easy trip and he replied “I WILL NEVER MAKE IT EASY!” so I guess his New Year’s resolution is to get into resistance training.

Indeed, certain sounds, meanings, aesthetic qualities and even pop culture moments can play a role in the names people choose for their children in a given time period. “Long ago are the days of choosing a generic name simply because ‘it sounded good,’” baby name consultant Taylor Humphrey told HuffPost. “In my business, I witness such intentionality around the process of choosing a name that deeply resonates with both parents.” To get a sense of what’s resonating with people these days, HuffPost asked naming experts to share some of the themes they think will influence parents’ baby name choices this year. We’ve rounded up nine interesting trends below. “I believe we will see more names with the very chic ’O-’ending,” Humphrey said. She noted that this is especially true with names for boys like Mateo, Enzo, Milo and Thiago. The vowel sound ending offers something a little more playful and unexpected next to so many names that end in consonants. Other popular O-enders due for increased (or continued) popularity in 2024 include Hugo, Apollo, Arlo, Leo, Cosmo, Theo, Margot, Cleo and Santiago. “Maverick ranks in the boys’ Top 50,” said Abby Sandel, creator of the baby name blog Appellation Mountain. “Legend isn’t far behind, and names like Legacy are climbing, too. Parents name for meaning, but it’s less about old-school religious virtues, like Modesty or Prudence. Instead, we’re opting for Wilder and Rowdy ― high-energy names that suggest adventure.” She also highlighted “thoughtful” names like Knowledge and Wisdom. “And when we do opt for something spiritual, it’s likely to be a symbolic word name, like Shepherd, Chosen, or Psalm,” Sandel added. “One specific trend we expect to gain more ground is girl names for boys,” said baby naming expert and Nameberry editor-in-chief Sophie Kihm. “Celebrities like Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, with their son Wren, and Rhianna, with her son Riot Rose, are leading the charge. A combination of increasingly progressive societal views on gender identity and appreciation for softness and symbolism is behind this trend.” Sandel echoed this theory, observing that the list of Top 1,000 names for girls has become a solid place to look for naming inspiration for boys. “For ages, conventional wisdom held that names would fall in use for boys if they caught on for girls,” she noted. “That’s just not true anymore. Names like Eden, Sutton, and Murphy made the girls’ Top 1,000 first, before becoming stylish for boys, too. Now Wren and Scout are set to be the newest crossovers from the girls’ list.” “Antique names continue to grow, along with very modern names,” said Sherri Suzanne, a baby name consultant and the founder of My Name for Life. “However, the most desired names in my practice remain familiar-but-underused classics ― names that are known but never achieved great popularity or have waned in popularity over time. It may explain why names from the mid-to-late 20th century may be reappearing sooner than expected.” She listed Scott, Kelly, Linda and Eileen as examples that have been popping up again lately. Heidi Prunkl, a name consultant and founder of Baby Name Sunday, has also taken note of vintage names that carry a sense of familiarity without feeling overused. “Definitely we will see more ‘old man’ names for boys like Monty, Ralph and Willis,” she said. “A generation grew up answering to Hailey, Kaylee, and Kylie; Kayla, Kaitlyn, and Brooklynn,” Sandel said. “The urge to mix and match to create new names remains strong, but here’s the twist for the 2020s: the first element is a nature name. We’ve seen Emberlynn and Lakelyn, Wrenlee and Oaklie.” She believes Dovelyn, Riverlynn, and Rainlee have potential to join those increasingly popular options in this category as well. “Names like Sunday and Waverly that just happen to look like elaborations of Sun and Wave might be the biggest winners of this trend,” Sandel added. “Parents are crossing borders in the name world more and more,” Suzanne said. “Non-English names are growing, partly the result of changing demographics but also as a way to expand the palette of available names.” Don’t be afraid to look into your family’s cultural heritage or popular picks around the world as you consider name options. “I’ve noticed a delightful preference for names that carry both sophistication and versatility, ensuring they gracefully evolve with each child,” said name consultant Lilia E. Corrigan of Heartbabynames. “A unique charm is becoming increasingly sought after, as families aim to bestow names that radiate a distinctive and individualistic ‘main character’ quality. This upcoming year seems to embrace names that not only captivate with style but also resonate with deeper, personal meaning ― a trend that brings both comfort and excitement to the baby naming journey.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Many parents are making efforts to harness the power names often carry. “Names can evoke a certain feeling, and they can convey a specific aesthetic awareness,” Humphrey said. “As ‘-core’ aesthetics become more ingrained in the fabric of how we describe our personal style, I believe we’ll see more parents opting for baby names that symbolize and communicate their values and vision.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

And Tiny Accused Of Drugging, Raping Air Force Veteran In Los Angeles Hotel Room","Grammy-winning rapper T.I. and his wife Tiny are being accused of sexual assault. The lawsuit was filed anonymously Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court by a woman who alleges they drugged her at a nightclub in 2005 and raped her in their hotel room. The couple, whose real names are Clifford and Tameka Harris, released a statement addressing the complaint and denying the accusations. “On the heels of positivity, negativity always rears its ugly head,” the couple told People in a statement Wednesday. “This plaintiff has been threatening to file this lawsuit for THREE years. For THREE years, we have emphatically and categorically denied these allegations.” They continued, “For THREE years we have maintained our innocence and refused to pay these extortionate demands for things we didn’t do. For THREE years, we’ve maintained the same position while the claims in this story have changed time and time again.” In court documents obtained Wednesday by multiple media outlets, the woman was identified only as Jane Doe. She accused the couple of sexual battery, battery, sexual assault, negligence, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The complaint arrived several years after a woman in Las Vegas and another in Los Angeles filed a police report accusing the couple of sexual assault. The latter filing stated the incident occurred in 2005, seemingly suggesting a connection to Tuesday’s lawsuit. The plaintiff alleged in her complaint that she was in her early 20s and serving in the U.S. Air Force when she met the celebrity couple. Doe claimed she was introduced to them in the VIP section of a nightclub in Los Angeles by a man named Caviar. Tiny gave her a drink before the trio returned to the couple’s hotel room with two other women, who left before Tiny took Doe’s clothing, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiff alleged she was “extremely shocked and uncomfortable” when T.I. and Tiny joined her in the shower. Doe claimed she felt “extremely dizzy and lightheaded” when ― after T.I. allegedly told her Tiny would bathe them both ― Doe was “signaled” to get into bed with T.I. The rapper allegedly ordered her in bed to rub oil on his back. Doe claims Tiny was later straddling her back and “pinning” her down as T.I. allegedly “proceeded to slide his toes into [Doe’s] vagina.” She purportedly told him, “No” before he left to get a condom, as Tiny allegedly continued “grinding on” and “massaging” her rear. Doe said in the complaint that she wound up vomiting as she “grew increasingly sicker and felt extremely ill by the assault.” She then crashed on the couch, “naked, dazed, sickened and weak,” and woke up in the morning with vaginal “itching and burning,” according to the lawsuit. The complaint was filed under California’s Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act, which permits civil suits on claims that would otherwise be dismissed due to the statute of limitations. Meanwhile, T.I. and his wife appear steadfast in their innocence. They said in their statement, “Our position is clear… We are innocent of these fake claims, we will not be shaken down, and we look forward to our day in court.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

In a lengthy Instagram post, the pop star dismissed rumors that she’s in the studio after Page Six, and The Sun recently reported that she’s been working on her first project since her 2016 album “Glory.” “Just so we’re clear most of the news is trash !!!” Spears wrote on Wednesday. “They keep saying I’m turning to random people to do a new album … I will never return to the music industry !!!” The singer pointed to her interest in songwriting, noting that she writes “for fun” or other people. “For those of you who have read my book, there’s loads that you don’t know about me … I’ve written over 20 songs for other people the past two years !!!” said Spears, who revealed that she wrote a song days after releasing her memoir “The Woman in Me” last year. “I’m a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way !!!” she added. Spears also dismissed rumors that her book was released “ILLEGALLY” without her approval. The caption was included alongside a photo of artist Guido Reni’s painting “Salome Bearing the Head of St. John the Baptist.” A post shared by Maria River Red (@britneyspears) Spears’ recent music output includes her song “Hold Me Closer” with Elton John, a 2022 track that marked her first release since the end of her conservatorship the year prior, as well as her collaboration with Will.i.am titled “Mind Your Business” which dropped last year. In her memoir, the singer has also reflected on her love for her album “Glory.” “I worked hard on those songs, which gave me confidence,” wrote Spears of the project, which Billboard noted came after two albums she wasn’t “pleased with.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/golden-bachelor-singles-biggest-misconception_n_65946f32e4b0912833ae16c4","2024-01-04","bella de paulo","I Study Single People For A Living. 'The Golden Bachelor' Got This 1 Thing Totally Wrong.","Thursday night, on live TV, Gerry Turner, the “Golden Bachelor,” will marry Theresa Nist. I’m happy for anyone whose dreams have come true. But I’m sad too. And mad. “The Bachelor” franchise shamelessly promotes the conventional wisdom that true happiness is a prize bestowed only upon those in committed romantic relationships, and that single people, in contrast, are stuck leading lesser, sadder lives. That’s not just untrue, it is harmful. I’m a social scientist and I’ve been studying single people for decades. I’ve found that more single people than most of us ever imagined are happy and flourishing, and they are happy and flourishing because they are single — not in spite of it. Throughout their adult lives, they keep getting happier and happier with their single lives. I call them “single at heart.” I’m one of them and I just wrote a book about us. In Bachelor Nation, people like us are unfathomable. We got erased, and Gerry, Theresa, all the other women who vied for his affections, and everyone who watched the show was deprived of an appreciation for the meaningfulness, fulfillment, psychological richness and joy that the single at heart experience. “The Golden Bachelor” peddles a romantic fantasy that takes that great, big, open-hearted experience that is love and stuffs it into the box called romance. It diminishes all the other profound experiences of love in our life. The single at heart don’t buy that. We have more expansive notions of love. Taking in the show, we would have recognized and appreciated a truly inspiring love story, one that should have been the envy of everyone on “The Golden Bachelor” and everyone watching it — the 60-year friendship between two contestants, Ellen and her friend Roberta. When Ellen emerged from the limo that first night, it was Roberta she called out to even before she greeted Gerry. In one of the early episodes, Ellen said, “I haven’t felt special in a very long time.” Joan, another contestant, remarked, wistfully, “As you get older, you become more invisible,” and said she was grateful to have felt seen by Gerry. Faith was thankful to feel heard. She said that Gerry listened to her and that was something she wanted. Ellen, though, was supremely special to Roberta. If Joan has a close, longtime friend, she likely feels “seen” by that friend, and probably felt even more so as their friendship deepened. The people in Faith’s life we met during the home visit seemed to listen to her with care and love. But all of these women had internalized the romantic fantasy that insists that if you don’t feel special to a romantic partner or seen or listened to by a romantic partner, then you are not special or seen or listened to at all. They’ve been robbed. Of course, romantic relationships are different from friendships. Apart from friends with benefits, our friends will not quench our desires for sexual intimacy. But by thinking about our friendships in terms of what they do not offer, we miss out on what they do. A nine-year study of nearly 6,000 adults showed that over time, the single people who were not looking for a romantic partner valued their friendships more, and as those friendships became more fulfilling, their single lives did too. The dynamic was just the opposite for the single people who wished they were coupled. Over time, they valued their friends less, invested in them less, and then felt even more driven to find a romantic partner. “Alone” was a dirty word on “The Golden Bachelor.” Theresa told Gerry, “I don’t want to be alone.” Then she repeated it. Gerry agreed, adding, “It sucks to be alone.” But neither Theresa nor Gerry was alone. They both have people in their lives whom they love and who love them. The romantic fantasy erased those profoundly significant connections. In romantic fantasyland, no matter how many caring and loving people you have in your life, if you do not have a romantic partner, you are alone. That’s a stingy view of human connection. The single at heart do not feel alone in the world. And we are not afraid of spending time alone. In fact, we cherish our solitude. That’s one of our superpowers. It protects us from feeling lonely, it got us through the worst of the pandemic, and it prepares us for later life. In old age, we will continue to value, rather than fear, the time we have to ourselves. The single at heart are savorers, who notice and appreciate sensual experiences. In response to the question of what makes her happy, one of the women who shared her story in my “Single at Heart” book said, “I love the blue of the blue jay at the feeder right now. I love how Yo-Yo Ma recovered when his cello slipped while he was playing it. I love the sound of whip-poor-wills. I love the spiders in my kitchen, the birds at my feeders, my cats sleeping under their blankets.” What a difference from Gerry’s inability to appreciate nature’s spectacular displays without a romantic partner: “OK, it’s a beautiful sunset,” he said during one episode, “and you walk inside and you go, like, who’s here? Well, who do I share it with?” The romantic fantasy has robbed him of some of the true joys of life. The romantic fantasy is soul-sucking when it persuades people that they really are incomplete without a romantic partner. Leslie told Gerry, “You make me feel whole.” And Gerry, talking about Theresa, said, “She could be the person who completes me and I could be the person who completes her.” What if the women of “The Golden Bachelor” did not feel incomplete without a man and instead lived their single lives fully and joyfully? Maybe Theresa would not have waited for Gerry to come along before she learned Italian and went to Italy. Maybe she would have gone with friends or relatives, or on her own. One of the single at heart women I interviewed saved up enough money to take a year off and travel the world. It was a deeply meaningful experience. The single at heart do not split the tasks of everyday life with a spouse, and that can add to their competence. For example, one of the single at heart women I talked to said, “Because I live alone, I have acquired an arsenal of diverse skills. I can handle basic carpentry, electrical and plumbing repair, cooking, sewing, landscaping and financial planning.” Another was renovating her home with an eye toward living safely and comfortably as she grew older — she was just 33. The romantic fantasy may be at its cruelest when it robs people of hope. Gerry told Theresa that he wanted “hope that I will have someone to enjoy the rest of my life with,” adding, “that hope is huge.” Theresa concurred. “That’s what you need to wake up each morning,” she said. I think it would be different if they appreciated what single life has to offer. One of the single at heart women who shared her story said, “The longer I’m single, the more I love it. I can’t imagine life any other way.” Another said that her single life “just gets sweeter.” In their personal stories, they were giving expression to what the large-scale surveys had already shown: that single people just keep getting more and more satisfied with their single lives, especially if they are embracing their single lives rather than fleeing them.

I don’t want to diminish the significance of the quest of the women (and man) of “The Golden Bachelor.” I understand that they may feel unhappy if they never again find romantic love, and that’s valid. I just wish they could muster a bit of resistance to the romantic fantasy that deprives them of the joy and fulfillment they could be experiencing in their single lives and belittles the love they already have. That way, they could all have hope. Bella DePaulo (Ph.D., Harvard University) has always been single and always will be.

What about all that?” said Goldberg, who has previously defended abortion rights on the program. The federal appeals court’s decision comes a month after the Texas Supreme Court blocked a judge’s ruling that allowed Kate Cox ― a woman with a potentially life-threatening pregnancy ― to get an emergency abortion in the state. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), in a letter sent to three hospitals, threatened to prosecute any doctors who helped perform the abortion for Cox, Reuters reported. Cox ultimately fled Texas to have an emergency abortion. Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin called the federal appeals court’s ruling “draconian and backwards” while co-host Sunny Hostin predicted the decision would make its way to higher courts. “And I am not a proponent of abortion, but they got this wrong,” Hostin said. Goldberg later made a plea for abortion rights as she referred to Cox’s life being “in danger” as a result of the post-Roe rulings on abortions in Texas. “For me, it feels like this is just a power play. You want to make sure that you have control over somebody’s body, whether it kills ’em or not. And you don’t care whether it kills ’em. You don’t care that you are tearing this woman up,” Goldberg said. “She didn’t want to have an abortion. She wanted a baby, the baby is not viable. She doesn’t want to go through this. And yet you are sitting there, allowing this torture to happen. That’s what’s wrong ― is you are torturing someone and you know it.

And the reason that it has is maybe you haven’t put it to bed yet,” host Harris Faulkner said to the Republican presidential hopeful. The Fox News host pointed to criticism from Black conservatives and asked Haley, “What have you learned?” Haley claimed, “What I should have said immediately was that the Civil War was about slavery. But I just assumed that that was a given.” She brought up the fact that, when she was governor of South Carolina, she authorized the removal of the Confederate flag from statehouse grounds in 2015 after a racist mass shooting that killed nine Black churchgoers in Charleston. (She had been reluctant to address the issue for years prior, however, and had previously defended the flag). “Really, the media is the only one that has talked about this issue,” Haley added of her slavery omission. Harris pointed out, “No, that’s actually not true.” Haley went on, insisting that “not one person on the ground in New Hampshire or Iowa are talking about it. I’ve done multiple town halls.” That also isn’t true. The day after the incident, a voter asked Haley a question, offering her an opportunity to “redeem yourself after last night’s slavery thing.” Nikki Haley on her viral Civil War/slavery response: “Really, the media is the only one that has talked about this issue.”Fox News’ @HARRISFAULKNER: “No, that’s actually not true.”Haley: “Not one person on the ground in New Hampshire or Iowa are talking about it.” pic.twitter.com/lMbYQROwNH That morning, following fierce backlash overnight, Haley had backpedaled, telling a New Hampshire radio station the Civil War was obviously about slavery. She also claimed the person who asked the question was a “Democrat plant.” Faulker acknowledged the “plant” accusation but suggested it was irrelevant, noting that Haley declined to cite slavery as the cause of the war even when prompted by the voter. “Whatever,” Faulkner said. “It’s a question put to you, and on a re-ask, ‘what would you have me say about slavery’ was your answer.” Haley said it was a mistake and her campaign was moving on. “I should have said slavery,” she said. “I didn’t do it.

While many experts say this season likely won’t prove to be as deadly as some other recent winters, it still could mean hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and many thousands of deaths across the country. New York City last week instituted a mask mandate for the city’s 11 public hospitals. Similar measures were ordered last week at some hospitals in Los Angeles and Massachusetts. Some hospitals reinstated masking rules for employees months ago, in anticipation of a seasonal rush of sick people. Flu and COVID-19 infections have been increasing for weeks, with high levels of flu-like illness reported in 31 states just before Christmas. Updated national numbers are to be released Friday, but health officials predict infections will grow in many states well into January. “What we’re seeing right now, in the first week of January, is really an acceleration — of flu cases, in particular,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is some good news. Flu and COVID-19 cases may peak by the end of the month and then drop, Cohen said. Though the flu has been skyrocketing, this year’s cases are being caused by a strain that usually doesn’t cause as many deaths and hospitalizations as some other versions. What’s more, signs suggest current flu vaccines are well-matched to the strain. “I don’t think it’s going to be overwhelming,” said Dr. William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. He deemed the current season “moderately severe.” The CDC is pointing the public to an agency website where people can look up their county, which can help them make decisions about whether to wear masks or take other precautions. Cohen urged people to get vaccinated and to seek treatment for flu and COVID-19. Vaccinations are down this year, officials say. About 44% of U.S. adults had gotten flu shots by Dec. 23, according to the most recently available CDC vaccination survey data. Only about 19% of U.S. adults were reported to have received an updated COVID-19 shot as of early December. COVID-19 cases are causing more severe disease than the flu but have been rising less dramatically. Health officials are keeping an eye on JN.1, a new version of the ever-evolving coronavirus. The omicron variant was first detected in the U.S. in September and just before Christmas accounted for an estimated 44% of COVID-19 cases. The JN.1 variant may spread easier or be better at evading our immune systems, but there is no evidence that it causes more severe disease than other recent variants, health officials say. Current evidence indicates vaccines and antiviral medications work against it. The CDC also has reported disappointing vaccination rates against another seasonal bug, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. That is a common cause of mild cold-like symptoms, but it can be dangerous for infants and older people. RSV cases rose in the fall but appear to have plateaued and are even going down in some places, according to the latest data. At Hillsdale Hospital in southern Michigan, a 65% increase in respiratory illness activity in late December triggered a limitation to visitors in the birthing center. Only a spouse, a support person and grandparents can visit. They all must wear a mask and not show symptoms of sickness. The restriction is common for the hospital around this time of year, said Dr. Nichole Ellis, a pediatrician who is the hospital’s medical chief of staff. But it’s more difficult this season, she added. “In the past, we would have one … disease that we were tracking or monitoring at one time,” Ellis said. “But now, babies and children will have multiple diseases at the same time. It’s not that they just have RSV … but they’re getting RSV and COVID at the same time, or influenza and RSV at the same time because all of the diseases are prevalent in our community.” ___ Kenya Hunter in Atlanta contributed. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

It is often caused by Alzheimer’s disease, and mainly affects those 65 and older. Unfortunately, dementia can be severe enough that it interferes with daily life, and those who have dementia often require additional care. “Dementia is a group of conditions characterized by impairment of at least two brain functions, such as judgment and memory loss,” explained Blair Steel, a psychologist at Carrara Treatment, Wellness & Spa. “Symptoms of dementia include forgetfulness, limited social skills and impairment in thinking that interferes with daily functioning.” So what causes dementia? Your age, family history, race and ethnicity, heart health and history of a traumatic brain injury are all factors that increase your risk of developing the condition. But another big category is lifestyle habits. So while you can’t control your genetics, there are a few seemingly harmless behaviors you may be doing that can increase your risk. Read on to learn more about them below: Exercising ― aerobic exercise, especially ― can help reduce cognitive impairment and dementia risk. Long-term, regular exercise can affect your brain and your overall health in a positive way, especially if you’re nearing 60. Getting your body moving daily is something you can do to decrease your risk of dementia. Steel said “being inactive does a number on the brain.” Just like other muscles, a good thing to remember is, “If you don’t use it, you lose it.” Social health plays a role in the development of dementia; an active and socially integrated lifestyle can protect against the disease. Stimulating the brain with social interaction is important for everyone, especially as they age. Though, in the age of social media, socializing has become a broader term. “We spend a lot of hours on social media, however this likely does not stimulate the brain’s experience of connection as much as socializing in person,” Steel explained. Poor social health can overstimulate the body’s stress response through increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, raise blood pressure and decrease blood flow to vital organs amongst other health issues. Sleep disturbances and dementia are two common and significant health problems in older adults. (Let’s face it, sleep tends to be put on the back burner.) Whether due to family obligations, work or staying up late on your phone or watching TV, there’s always something in the way of adequate sleep. Unfortunately, sleep patterns in earlier life may contribute to later problems. If you’re having trouble sleeping, or not sleeping at all, sleep deprivation could increase your dementia risk. “Avoid screens and light after a certain hour and try to not reach for your phone if your sleep is interrupted,” Steel suggested. Try unplugging at least 30 minutes before bed. According to the Alzheimer’s Society, stress is linked to dementia because when you’re stressed and cortisol is released, it can create problems with your memory. The negative effects of stress, particularly chronic stress, on the brain can lead to cognitive decline due to prolonged elevations of cortisol — which plays an important role in how your body responds to stress. Working to reduce your stress through healthy habits can be key to mitigating this risk. Exercise, creative activities or hobbies, spending time with loved ones, meditation, watching a good show or reading a good book can all help you relax. Additionally, “try to be flexible with your reactions and avoid the ‘my way or the highway’ mentality, which can be common in older adults,” Steel said. The Alzheimer’s Society also says there’s a specific type of alcohol-related dementia that is considered alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD). This is due to the damage of the brain caused by drinking too much alcohol on a regular basis, usually over many years. Those with this type of dementia may have issues like cooking a meal, remembering things, thinking things through, and even struggle with more complex tasks like managing finances. Research shows a diet high in ultra-processed foods can increase dementia risk in adults. While no one’s diet is perfect, ensuring that the majority of the time you are sticking with well-balanced, healthy meals can be extremely beneficial.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. On a recent car trip, I found what is possibly the largest Target I’ve ever seen. I stopped just to use the bathroom, but was quickly sucked into a beauty and body section. I’m not a makeup guy, but I’m a lifelong sucker for a versatile body or hair product that’s easy to use and smells really good. At first, I spotted a travel-size Sun Bum leave-in hair conditioning spray, which like all Sun Bum products, smelled beachy and amazing. But $20 for a tiny bottle felt a little steep. I could see myself spritzing it twice, then dropping it by mistake into a dark crevice of my car, never to be seen again. I was craving a cheaper but still good-smelling hair mist when I saw it: a green beacon from childhood perched on the shelf. It was Suave Kids’ Silly Apple detangling spray, with the timeless label confirming it’s “tear-free.” It cost under $10 for more than double the size of the Sun Bum. I immediately grabbed one. A ’90s baby, the unmistakable green apple scent instantly transported me back to summer camp and swim lessons and going to sleep with wet hair. I so clearly remember my parents and babysitter using this in my thick hair to help with tangles and knots as they brushed it out, and it felt sweet and nostalgic to use it again. (In my day, there was a purple octopus on the bottle, which sadly has been replaced with some sort of green cartoon lion.) I looked forward to using this after a much-needed shower when I read the label and learned I can use it on dry hair, too. As it’s technically also a leave-in conditioner, the spray helps with flyaways and styling, while keeping hair super soft. It’s not a hair spray, so it has no hold, but that also means it’s not sticky and leaves no residue. The non-aerosol spray dispenser is easy to use and lets me get the product exactly where you want it. Whether you spray it on wet or dry hair, you don’t feel it on your hair the way you do with a texture spray or dry shampoos. It just simply lets you get a brush, comb or your fingers through hair easily, while giving a little extra shine and smoothness. I have low-maintenance hair and the hygiene habits of a teenage boy, so I don’t need much from a product other than it smelling good and helping with tangles. Yet even for folks who do have an intensive hair ritual, I would suggest this budget-friendly timeless throwback for its scent and help with knots and tangles. Many reviews are from adults who use it for themselves, saying that it works on curls and that it performs better than even salon-grade products. Some even mention this product helping them with severe matting and knotting when postpartum depression made hair maintenance challenging. And again, I feel compelled to mention the smell: It’s super fresh and fruity without being too sticky sweet or overwhelming and it just makes you feel good. I’ve been laughing to myself and calling it my new perfume, though the fragrance only lasts for about an hour or so after you spray it on your hair. I recently mentioned my purchase to a child-free friend, and to my surprise, she said she keeps some in her house for herself as well. I’m telling you, the smell is a must. The softness and detangling is just extra. Here are some reviews from others adults who love this “kid” product, too: “I absolutely love this stuff! I’m a grown man in my mid 20’s, and I used to use this stuff back in the early 00’s. Back when’s there was an apple octopus on the bottle! This stuff is affordable and STILL SMELLS THE SAME years later! It still works as well too!! I used to use another detangler spray, but they recently changed the formula for the worse and sometimes it’s insanely priced at certain beauty stores! I decided to back to the reliable detangler that was of my childhood! I can buy this anywhere, it still smells great, is super effective, and it’s usually at a great price point! I know the bottle says “kids” but this stuff is great no matter your age. It’s reliable and has been for well over 15+ years! Seriously buy this!” — Carl W, via Target “This product works for KIDS and ADULTS! I have thick hair and this product helped my hair get untangled!” — Kay, via Target “Okay, so I read the previous review about the lady who has hair depression, and I’m the same way. I had postpartum depression where I would just let myself go and not brush my hair. THIS. IS. MAGIC. A must have!!! Works great for kids too, but works amazing for adults as well! I’m now currently pregnant with #2 and now my hair is starting to become really curly and knotty, and it can comb through my curls with ease! It also makes my curls more noticeable and healthy looking. Everyone has been giving me compliments about how good my hair looks and “what perfume are you wearing” - y’all, it’s the dang suave detangler ! WHO KNEW?! and it’s like three bucks. A hair MUST HAVE!!! :)” — nltakacs, via Target “Great smell, easy to use nozzle, but most importantly great detangler. And between myself and my kids we have short to very long hair.” — Hemmyhere “This product is not just for kids !! Even as an adult I struggle with my hair getting tangled. This is only product I have found that helps detangle my hair !! Been using it since I was kid. Although , the bottle has changed from the octopus to the lion the Apple sent is still my favorite and smells amazing. Can’t rave about this product enough!” — EmilyB2723, via Target “I am an adult and I have been using this since I was a kid for about 15 years and I absolutely love it! I have tried other products. But I always come back to this one for the wonderful apple smell and because it is great at detangling without leaving oiliness. All around great product and not just for kids.” — Val, via Target By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wait-is-oat-milk-bad-for-you-nutritionists-have-thoughts_l_65942ae5e4b0912833adf6fb","2024-01-04","julie kendrick","Wait, Is Oat Milk Bad For You Now? Nutritionists Have Thoughts.","After years in the “health halo” spotlight, some consumers are starting to question whether oat milk is all it’s cracked up to be. In the grocery aisle and in line at the coffee shop, folks are wondering if soy, almond, rice pea — or even regular old cow’s milk — are better options. Most of us aren’t even sure how they manage to milk those tiny flakes of oats. Happily, nutritionists are here to clear up the confusion. “Oat milk is created by milling whole oats, adding water and enzymes and filtering the liquid from the solids in a centrifuge,” explained registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) Vicki Shanta Retelny. “Oat milk must be fortified with calcium, iron, vitamin A and vitamin D to make it nutritionally comparable to cow’s milk.” Even with so many other options, some nutritionists remain fans. “My favorite plant milk happens to be oat milk,” said RDN Andrea Mathis. “I love its naturally creamy texture and how it adds a great source of fiber to my smoothie recipes.” Texture is one benefit, and ecology is another. “One of the big draws of oat milk is that it appears to be more environmentally sustainable than some other types of plant-based beverages, requiring less water and producing less waste,” said registered dietitian (RD) and naturopathic doctor Jennifer Salib Huber. RDN Tamar Samuels noted that oat milk is also popular for what it doesn’t have — nuts or dairy. If you’re avoiding gluten, you need to tread carefully around oat milk. “While oats are naturally gluten-free, they have a higher risk of cross-contamination, because they are typically processed in facilities that manufacture gluten-containing products,” Samuels said. “If weight loss is your goal, you might want to consider decreasing high-calorie, low-protein beverages, like large oat milk lattes,” she added. “And if you’re managing high blood sugar, you should also be mindful, since many oat milk products have more added sugar and oils compared to other milk alternatives.” RD Marissa Meshulam told us: “While oat milk is delicious, unfortunately it’s not the most nutritious option. Oats are a highly sprayed pesticide crop, so if you are drinking it, I highly recommend organic. From a nutrition standpoint, one cup of oat milk provides the same amount of carbohydrates as a slice of bread, about 15 grams. And then when oats are processed into oat milk, the starches in oats are broken down to simple sugars.” To make oat milk creamy, many manufacturers add in canola oil or other oils, she added. “A splash in a cold brew when you get coffee is no big deal, but an oat milk latte every morning is not my favorite option,” she said. RDN Sharon Palmer noted that oat milk typically has a lower protein content (about two to three grams) compared to dairy milk or soy milk. “Oat milk also tends to be higher in calories and carbohydrates compared to other plant-based milks like almond and soy milk,” Samuels said. “For example, one cup of oat milk has about 100 to 150 calories and 16 to 20 grams of carbohydrates, compared to almond milk, which ranges from 45 from 100 calories per cup, and one gram of carbohydrates.” RD Barbara Ruhs offered this brand breakdown: “Silk, Chobani and Oatly, which are the leading brands, all have 120 calories per eight-ounce serving, with fewer than three grams of protein and 15 to 18 grams of carbohydrates. Planet Oat has 90 calories and similar levels of protein and carbohydrates.” If you’re shopping for new types of plant milk, consider this advice from Retelny: “Just because something is plant-based, that doesn’t mean it’s healthy or nourishing,” she said. RDN Jill Nussinow agreed: “Many people think that plant milks are better for them, which might not be the case.” Many of the nutritionists we spoke with favored soy over oats. “Soy milk is the most nutrient-dense of the plant milks,” explained Palmer. “I prefer soy milk because it has the best nutritional profile,” Ruhs said. “The other thing unique to soy is that it’s the most significant source of isoflavones — a flavonoid that is special to soy that has a multitude of health benefits, especially for women,” Ruhs said. “They help with perimenopause and menopausal symptoms, have anti-inflammatory properties and are beneficial for heart and neurological health.” Retelny agreed: “If I were to choose a plant milk, it would be soy milk, since it’s like cow’s milk from a nutritional standpoint and it contains those beneficial phytoestrogens.” “I use soy milk more frequently, because it’s the most affordable plant milk, especially Trader Joe’s organic unsweetened soy milk,” Nussinow said. “It has [a high] amount of protein, and it contains only soybeans and water.” RDN Chelsey Amer said: “While I’m a fan of dairy milk, my favorite milk alternative is Ripple plant-based milk, which is made with pea protein. It contains a similar nutrition profile to dairy milk. It’s a great dairy-free alternative for kids who need the nutrients in milk, like protein and calcium, but can’t tolerate dairy.” “I’m a fan of nut milk blends and coconut milk,” Meshulam said. “These tend to be lower in carbs and provide some fat, which not only makes them creamier, but helps with blood sugar stabilization.” Her two favorite brands are Malk and Three Trees. “Both use organic, simple ingredients and are less watered-down than other brands, so you get that creaminess in the mouthfeel.” When it comes to coconut milk, Samuels offered this caution: “If you have or are at risk for heart disease, be mindful of your coconut milk intake, as it can increase your LDL cholesterol.” While we’re out looking for the next new thing in nutrition, some nutritionists suggested more traditional options. “I think old-fashioned cow’s milk is going to be more in demand in the future, since it’s a readily available commodity that, in many regards, is the standard of optimal nutritional value when compared to plant milks,” Ruhs said. “It naturally contains eight grams of protein per serving. And there’s also a2 Milk, which contains more of the type of milk protein that makes it easier to digest.” “If you suffer from bloating and gas, be especially mindful of ingredients like gums and carrageenan, which may increase these symptoms,” Samuels said. “If you use plant milks as a regular part of your diet, like in cereal and smoothies, make sure it’s nutrient-rich,” advised Palmer. “It should provide a significant source of protein, about seven grams, and about 30% of the vitamin D calcium requirement for the day, which is particularly important for children.” Noting that people will continue to demand transparency about ingredients and how products are made, RD Sara Haas said that she seeks out ingredient lists that match her preferences: “I always look for no flavoring, no gums, no additives and no sugar.” Palmer suggested finding a fave and sticking with it: “Since there are so many products available, do some research to find a plant milk that works for you. Then you won’t always have to read labels each time you shop.” “For most adults, milk of any kind should be considered a beverage instead of a primary source of nutrition,” Huber said. “This means that taste preference and any other values-based considerations can be factored into the decision, not just nutrition.” “Taste and affordability are two big factors when choosing a plant-based milk,” Ruhs said. “Even if one option has superior nutritional benefits, if you’re not going to drink it, it’s not giving you any benefits.” She also said that it might be wise to keep a few different kinds on hand. “I like dairy milk in my morning coffee, but I keep soy milk in the fridge to use in smoothies and baking applications. Every once in a while, if I’m eating freshly baked cookies, I prefer dairy milk, too.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

It’s an elevated take on a casual and popular crossbody style that covers all the necessary bases: It’s roomy, looks fabulous with a range of aesthetics and can be dressed up or down. But don’t get me started on the $2,550 price point, which has sent me searching for more affordable options in both leather and vegan leather fabrications. A huge part of the bag’s appeal lies in its ubiquitous shape. Also commonly referred to as a sling, crescent or half-moon bag, the banana bag is as convenient as it gets. It’s a low-effort chic silhouette that’s ideal for everyday use, and I find it’s more versatile than a boxy handbag. Last summer, Uniqlo’s breezy nylon version of the shoulder bag went viral on TikTok, making it the most coveted purchase of the season. Below, I’ve rounded up the best takes on this must-have popular bag style. Made in sleek and soft sumptuous leather or faux leather in a range of sizes and price points, they all capture the effortless vibe of the Row’s popular-but-pricey version.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. In a caffeinated world filled to the brim with automated coffee makers and fancy brewing gizmos, sometimes the simplest of tools are the way to go — especially tools with a time-honored reputation endorsed by coffee aficionados and everyday coffee-lovers alike. The Chemex pour-over coffee maker is one well-regarded brewer and carafe that has utilized a classic and beautifully functioning manual design for decades and is recommended by Jordan G.L. Hardin, director of food and beverage at Alfred Coffee, and Sumi Ali, co-founder of Yes Plz Coffee. Referenced by Hardin as a “perennial” choice for pour-over coffee preparation, the Chemex can be used to nurture enhanced and nuanced flavors from every type of roast, and is not just for coffee, either, but also for teas. First made in 1941 by a German chemist, its minimalist design has remained virtually untouched and is even in the permanent collection of the The Museum of Modern Art. It’s made from a non-porous borosilicate glass that won’t absorb odors or residues, is dishwasher-safe and can be refrigerated for storing and reheating leftover coffee, without the coffee’s losing flavor. This means it can be a great option for making cold brew. This space-conscious coffee maker, which comes in a few different capacity options, features a designated pour spout to create the proper air channel and a beautiful wooden collar to make the Chemex safe to hold even when contents are hot. It also conveniently uses compostable natural paper filters that the brand claims ensure uniform extraction and remove undesirable elements from grounds. Hardin explained a bit about how the pour-over brewing process works: “The paper filter goes in, hot water gets heated in a kettle (I always recommend the gooseneck Fellow Stagg EKG) and is poured over the ground coffee. From there, it’s really about pouring technique; how long you ‘bloom’ the coffee (release the gases), what pouring pattern you’re using, [how] quickly you pour and how much water, etc.” He said that there are several videos available to help users learn more about this method and how to customize a perfect-tasting brew. This isn’t the first time we’ve sung Chemex’s praises. In 2013, former HuffPost reporter and self-proclaimed “coffee nerd” Rebecca Orchant wrote about her personal experience with the display-worthy vessel. According to Orchant, a daily coffee drinker who, until that point, had exclusively used a French press, the Chemex was even less complicated to use, and made a delicious, almost flawless cup of coffee every time. “Because you are pouring hot water over the grounds, coffee from a Chemex can never be over-brewed,” Orchant wrote, adding that one of the things she loves most about the brewing system is how clean it is. “With a French press, the mesh collects microscopic coffee grounds on each use. With a Chemex, you lift the grounds out with the filter, so they never even touch the carafe, which makes it an absolute breeze to clean,” she said. If you feel like you’ve been missing out on the Chemex and all its effortless and artful functionality, make up for lost time and grab yourself one from any of the above retailers in a variety of sizes. Promising Amazon reviews: “We use our Chemex pour over pitcher every single day. While there are many pour over options available out there, this one suits our needs perfectly. The glass is well-tempered and can withstand some accidental bumps and clinks without chipping. The wood wrap is also essential to not burn your hands when holding and pouring. Cleaning is fairly simple. We use a gentle sponge to scrub inside the base and swirl some warm water and dish soap in the rinse. There’s been no issues with residue or staining. We use the Chemex filters with this and we always get a perfect tasting cup of coffee. Granted, this does take a little longer than a traditional coffee or automatic maker, but it’s worth the taste difference. We grind our own beans and use fresh water from our home filtration system. The result is smooth, high quality, delicious coffee. If there’s some leftover, I will place a tea towel over the top to keep it warm. My partner was never a big coffee drinker, but he has now become a pro at making this too and enjoys it just as much as I do. This pitcher will pay you back over and over for the initial cost and is worth every cent for the investment.” — A Singing Wolf ″Although it was designed in 1941, Chemex coffee pots remain the simplest, most easy to use coffee maker on the market. And the high-quality Chemex filters allow you to ‘espresso’ grind without tears or grounds in the pot... I like my coffee strong and I like the fine grind that creates all the flavor I’m looking for as the water quickly passes through the grounds. The improvement in coffee flavor is incredible. Strong, smooth and no bitterness. It’s easy to clean, once a week I put a couple tablespoons of vinegar in and fill it with hot water to let it soak. That helps remove any kind of coffee residue. About once a month I shake a little bit of Bon Ami into the bottom of the pot, add water, add a paper towel and use a wooden spoon to swirl off any build up. It’s an easy, two-minute operation and the results are like new, and sparkling! Easy to wipe the exterior to a sparkle too!” — Catherine Metzger, Founder, Food for the Ages (This review was edited for length. Read the full review.) “I am a huge coffee snob. I am a self professed coffee lover and I drink my coffee black, so I know good coffee. This is the best way I have found yet to make a cup of coffee. I have tried the Nespresso, the automated pour over system, and drip coffee, but this Chemex reduces the bitterness and leaves you with smooth coffee. I love it! I also love that there is never any build up. You never have to descale it. You can just hand wash it. I put mine in the dishwasher after removing the wooden neck piece and it did just fine! I love love love it! would order again 10/10.” — Alyssa By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

It is the only known operation of its kind to extract American citizens and their close family members during the months of devastating ground fighting and Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. The vast majority of people who have made it out of northern and central Gaza through the Rafah crossing into Egypt fled south in the initial weeks of the war. An escape from the heart of the Palestinian territory through intense combat has become far more perilous and difficult since. Zahra Sckak, 44, made it out of Gaza on New Year’s Eve, along with her brother-in-law, Farid Sukaik, an American citizen, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to confirm the rescue, which had been kept quiet for security reasons. Sckak’s husband, Abedalla Sckak, was shot earlier in the Israel-Hamas war as the family fled from a building hit by an airstrike. He died days later. One of her three American sons, Spec. Ragi A. Sckak, 24, serves as an infantryman in the U.S. military. The extraction involved the Israeli military and local Israeli officials who oversee Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the U.S. official said. There was no indication that American officials were on the ground in Gaza. “The United States played solely a liaison and coordinating role between the Sckak family and the governments of Israel and Egypt,” the official said. A family member and U.S.-based lawyers and advocates working on the family’s behalf had described Sckak and Sukaik as pinned down in a building surrounded by combatants, with little or no food and with only water from sewers to drink. There were few immediate details of the on-the-ground operation. It took place after extended appeals from Sckak’s family and U.S.-based citizens groups for help from Congress members and the Biden administration. The State Department has said some 300 American citizens, legal permanent residents and their immediate family members remain in Gaza, at risk from ground fighting, airstrikes and widening starvation and thirst in the besieged territory. With no known official U.S. presence on the ground, those still left in the territory face a dangerous and sometimes impossible trip to Egypt’s border crossing out of Gaza, and a bureaucratic struggle for U.S., Egyptian and Israeli approval to get themselves, their parents and young children out of Gaza. —- Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/no-labels-democrat-bipartisan-ticket-trump_n_659468afe4b0912833ae154c","2024-01-04","jennifer bendery","No Labels: We May Not Put A Democrat On Our Bipartisan Ticket In 2024","No Labels, the centrist political group planning to offer a bipartisan “unity ticket” for the 2024 presidential election, may not actually have a Democrat on its ticket, one of its top leaders said in a video recording of a recent event that was obtained by HuffPost. “One of the things we’ve also gotten asked about is there’s, of course, Republicans, Democrats, there’s also independents and their presence on the ticket,” Ryan Clancy, chief strategist for No Labels, said in a Dec. 20 Zoom event titled “Common Sense Talks With Ryan Clancy.” “And what if it’s a Republican and an independent? I think that’s certainly possible,” he said. Clancy was responding to an attendee who raised a concern shared by many Democrats as No Labels prepares to launch a third-party presidential candidate: They will function as a spoiler, taking Democratic and independent votes away from President Joe Biden and boosting presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. It’s clearly a touchy subject for the group, which for much of the past year has been fending off growing fears that it would tilt the election to Trump. “We’re not spoiling anything,” former Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat who joined No Labels last year to coordinate efforts to get on state ballots, told The Guardian on Saturday. Nixon said at the Zoom event that the group has so far secured a slot for a No Labels presidential candidate on 12 of the 50 state ballots. “Right now we’re on our way to moving forward,” he told event attendees. “And we will.” But Clancy’s squishiness over which party or parties will even be on its ticket certainly suggests that No Labels is scrambling to figure out what, exactly, it will ultimately offer the American electorate. This comes after the group announced in November that it was abandoning its in-person presidential convention, originally set to kick off after Super Tuesday in March, and instead is opting to carry out its candidate selection process virtually, giving itself more time to sort itself out. And amid this vague sense of movement, it was clear from the December Zoom event that even No Labels’ supporters and financial backers are worried they’ll end up helping Trump. Many of the questions that Clancy fielded were related to making sure that No Labels doesn’t give Trump an advantage in November. One attendee, Will from Alabama, said for him it was “absolutely the number one priority in 2024” that Trump not get reelected. Another attendee, Paula, said she’d “been a long supporter of No Labels” but looking at the group’s plans for a bipartisan ticket, she was “having trouble trying to figure out how this is going to not reelect Trump.” When an attendee named Martha asked Clancy about the idea of No Labels ditching its bipartisan “unity ticket” and instead putting up two center-right candidates to ensure that the group doesn’t pull more votes from Biden than Trump ― she proposed two Republicans, Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley ― Clancy said that was a “great question” and a “really interesting point that we should consider.” “We might end up with two independents on it in the end,” he added. Another No Labels official on the call straight-up confessed that he is nervous about the group being a spoiler for Trump. “Love everybody at No Labels,” said John Leonard, the treasurer for No Labels in Raleigh, North Carolina. “But I support what Will and Paula were saying earlier.... I really worry about the prospect of Biden losing support and Donald Trump being inadvertently elected in the Electoral College.” Asked why No Labels wouldn’t include a Democrat on its bipartisan “unity ticket,” Clancy told HuffPost on Wednesday that the group has always been open to other options. “Nothing has changed,” Clancy said in a statement. “No Labels has said from the beginning our intent is to offer our ballot line to a unity ticket featuring a Democrat and a Republican,” he said. “But we’ll be open to an independent being on the ticket if we think that gives the ticket the best chance to win.” But it sure looks like No Labels has moved its goalposts since it first touted its third-party ticket as an “insurance policy” if Biden and Trump end up being the 2024 nominees, in light of both being generally unpopular. The group has gone from promising a “unity ticket” with no commitment to which party would be at the top, to telling donors it would pick a Republican for president and presumably a Democrat for vice president to now opening the door to a Republican leading the ticket with an independent for vice president, or even two independents on the ticket. No Labels casts itself as nonpartisan and does not typically reveal its donors. But it has received significant funding from a prominent GOP megadonor, Harlan Crow, who also helped the group bring in more than two dozen other donors, according to the New Republic. Possible candidates for the group to back include former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), retiring Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and even former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Romney has ruled out joining the group’s ticket. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Ron DeSantis over his approach toward Republican rival and former President Donald Trump on Wednesday. “Why haven’t you gone directly after him?” asked the man, who pointed to the GOP presidential candidate’s poll numbers compared to Trump. “What do you mean by going directly after?” replied DeSantis. “In my viewpoint, you’re going pretty soft on him ―,” the man added. “I’ve articulated all the differences time and time again on the campaign trail,” interjected DeSantis before claiming the media wants GOP candidates to “smear him personally,” before adding, “That’s just not how I roll.” The man, in response, declared that Trump would have won the 2020 presidential election by “a landslide” if he had “kept his mouth shut” while he was president. “He’s been his own worst enemy, there’s no question about that,” DeSantis replied. The man noted Trump’s insults toward former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “I mean, those are talking points that I would use.

I mean, is that the problem?” Garcia asked of the GOP field. The Florida governor, who once steered clear of attacking Trump, has taken an occasional swipe at the former president in recent months.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/13-year-old-beats-original-nintendo-tetris_n_65963475e4b0f27b6e364521","2024-01-03","david hamilton","Game On: 13-Year-Old Becomes First To Beat 'Unbeatable' Tetris","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The falling-block video game Tetris has met its match in 13-year-old Willis Gibson, who has become the first player to officially “beat” the original Nintendo version of the game — by breaking it. Technically, Willis — aka “blue scuti” in the gaming world — made it to what gamers call a “kill screen,” a point where the Tetris code glitches, crashing the game. That might not sound like much of a victory to anyone thinking that only high scores count, but it’s a highly coveted achievement in the world of video games, where records involve pushing hardware and software to their limits. And beyond. It’s also a very big deal for players of Tetris, which many had long considered unbeatable. That’s partly because the game doesn’t have a scripted ending; those four-block shapes just keep falling no matter how good you get at stacking them into disappearing rows. Top players continued to find ways to extend their winning streaks by staying in the game to reach higher and higher levels, but in the end, the game beat them all. Until, that is, Willis managed on Dec. 21 to trigger a kill screen on Level 157, which the gaming world takes as a victory over the game — something along the lines of pushing the software past its own limits. 13 year old Willis Gibson aka Blue Scuti became the first recorded person to beat Tetris causing the game to freeze after reaching level 157 pic.twitter.com/uRt3KOasTh The makers of Tetris agree. “Congratulations to ‘blue scuti’ for achieving this extraordinary accomplishment, a feat that defies all preconceived limits of this legendary game,” Tetris CEO Maya Rogers said in a statement. Rogers noted that Tetris will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year and called Willis’ victory a “monumental achievement.” It’s been a very long road. Early on, “the Tetris scene people didn’t even know how to get to these higher levels,” said David Macdonald, a gaming YouTuber who has chronicled the gaming industry for years. “They were just stuck in the 20s and 30s because they just didn’t know techniques to get any further.” Level 29 posed an especially tough roadblock because the blocks began falling more quickly than the in-game controller could respond. Eventually players found ways to make progress, as Macdonald chronicled in his detailed video on Willis victory. In 2011, one got to Level 30 using a technique called “hypertapping,” in which a player could rhythmically vibrate their fingers to move the game controller faster than the game’s built-in speed. That technique took players to level 35 by 2018, after which they hit a wall. The next big thing came in 2020 when a gamer combined a multifinger technique originally used on arcade video games with a finger positioned on the bottom of the controller to push it against another finger on the top. Called “rolling,” this much speedier approach helped one player reach Level 95 in 2022. Then other obstacles arose. Because the original Tetris developers had never counted on players pushing the game’s limits so aggressively, bizarre quirks began to crop up at higher levels. One particularly difficult issue arose with the game’s color palette, which traditionally cycled through 10 easily distinguished patterns. Starting at level 138, though, random color combinations began to appear — some of which made it much harder to distinguish the blocks from the game’s black background. Two particularly devilish patterns — one a dim combination of dark blues and greens later dubbed “Dusk,” the other composed of black, gray and white blocks called “Charcoal” — proved taxing for players. When combined with the strain of increasingly longer games, which could run 40 minutes or more, progress slowed again. It took a Tetris-playing AI program dubbed StackRabbit to break that logjam by helping map out just where players might happen across a glitch resulting in a kill screen, and finally beat the game. StackRabbit, which managed to make it all the way to Level 237 before crashing the game, ran on a modified version of Tetris, so its achievements aren’t strictly comparable to those of human players. And its findings weren’t immediately applicable to the human-played game, either. But its runs clearly demonstrated that game-ending glitches could be triggered by very specific events, such as which block pieces were in play or how many lines a player cleared at once. That let human players take over the task of mapping all possible scenarios that could cause such crashes in the original game. These typically resulted when the game’s decade-old code lost its place and began reading its next instructions from the wrong location, generally resulting in garbage input. A massive effort spurred by StackRabbit’s experience eventually led to the compilation of a large spreadsheet that detailed which game levels and which specific conditions were most likely to lead to a crash.

In his livestream video, he appears to hyperventilate before barely gasping “Oh my God” several times, clutching his temples and worrying that he might be passing out. After cupping his hands over his mouth in an apparent attempt to regulate his breathing, he finally exclaims, “I can’t feel my fingers.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

According to KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, defendant Deobra Redden, 30, was in the middle of being sentenced at about 11 a.m. by Clark County District Judge Mary Kay Holthus for attempted battery with bodily harm when he attacked the judge. In a video from the courtroom, Redden is seen leaping over the bench and lunging at Holthus. The judge tried to take cover but was struck down by Redden when he landed on top of her. A few people were seen in the video coming forward to help as two men tackled Redden and pulled him away. Just before the attack, Holthus had denied probation for Redden, The New York Times reported. When his lawyer asked the judge to sentence him to probation, Holthus responded, “I appreciate that, but I think it’s time he get a taste of something else.” “I just can’t with that history,” she added. Redden, who had been before Holthus before, served a year in prison in 2021 for domestic battery and was granted parole in 2022, KLAS reported. He had also served time in 2015 after being sentenced to a minimum of 19 months for attempted theft, according to The New York Times. A court spokesperson confirmed that Holthus, 62, was injured in the attack and that her condition was being monitored, according to The New York Times. A court marshal was also taken to the hospital after being injured and was believed to be in stable condition late Wednesday. “We commend the heroic acts of her staff, law enforcement, and all others who subdued the defendant,” the 8th Judicial District Court said in a statement, according to the Times. “The court remains committed to a safe and secure courthouse and courtrooms.

She was very much against it,” Blake told the TV station. According to Fox affiliate WITI-TV, deputies said Grimes was then struck by a car driven by a 19-year-old man she knew and who was driving alongside them. Deputies accused the driver of leaving the scene and continuing to drive while his car dragged Grimes for nearly three miles. Grimes’ mother told WISN that she hoped her daughter was not conscious when the car struck her. “How do you not know you’re dragging somebody? How do you not know? I mean it seems almost sinister to me,” Blake told the ABC station. Blake added that her daughter’s boyfriend came to her home to tell her about the accident. “He said that there were bodies all over the road and he was desperately trying to find my daughter. He looked in ditches, he looked in the field, he couldn’t find her,” Blake said. The four passengers from her car were taken to the hospital, including a 17-year-old who was listed in critical condition. According to WITI, the 19-year-old driver was taken into custody “on suspicion of hit-and-run resulting in death.” In a statement to HuffPost on Wednesday, the Fond du Lac County Sheriff’s Office said it had received numerous calls about the incident and was working closely with the district attorney’s office.

During a Tuesday night episode of ESPN’s “Pat McAfee Show” on YouTube, Rodgers made comments implying that Kimmel would be affected by the list of names associated with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that were released Wednesday. “There’s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, who are really hoping that list doesn’t come out,” Rodgers said in conversation with McAfee and his co-host, A.J. Hawk. An outraged Kimmel fired back at the Jets player in a post on X (formerly Twitter) where he threatened to pursue legal action. “Dear Aasshole: for the record, I’ve not met, flown with, visited, or had any contact whatsoever with Epstein nor will you find my name on any ‘list’ other than the clearly-phony nonsense that soft-brained wackos like yourself can’t seem to distinguish from reality,” Kimmel said. “Your reckless words put my family in danger. Keep it up and we will debate the facts further in court.” During his program on Wednesday, McAfee addressed the comments made on Tuesday’s episode and responded to Kimmel’s reaction, explaining that he understood why the talk show host was upset. “I can see exactly why Jimmy Kimmel felt the way he felt, especially with his position. But I think Aaron was just trying to talk shit,” McAfee said. “We obviously don’t like the fact that we’re associated with anything negative ever. We like our show to be an uplifting one, a happy one, a fun one,” he said. “Because we talk shit and try to make light of everything, some things obviously people get very pissed off about, especially when they are serious allegations, so we apologize for being a part of it. Can’t wait to hear what Aaron has to say about it.” Rodgers has not publicly responded to Kimmel’s threat to sue. ESPN faced backlash over the controversy, Business Insider reported, though it is unclear whether the sports channel is looking into what occurred on the show on Tuesday. In an episode on Wednesday, McAfee went on to say that he hopes Kimmel and Rodgers can settle the issue through conversation rather than a lawsuit and “move along.” The next four years will change America forever.

On Tuesday, the “Pretty Little Liars” alum, 34, celebrated two years of sobriety in a heartfelt post on social media. Hale illustrated with a chart on Instagram that it’s been 24 months, 731 days and 17,523 hours since she’s been booze free. She also posted a quote by novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald which says, in part, that “it’s never too late, or in my case too early, to be whoever you want to be. There’s no time limit.” Hale had said in a November episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast that her earliest memory of drinking was on a vacation when she was 12. “This continues to be the greatest gift I’ve given myself. I remain so grateful for another year of growth, growing pains, lessons, joys, and self realizations,” Hale said in Tuesday’s Instagram post. She added: “To be able to show up as myself and to be greeted with such warmth and acceptance is something I do not take for granted ♥️.” “The interactions, conversations, and moments of vulnerability from people I know, people I used to know, from people I’ve hurt, from people who’ve hurt me, from strangers and even people on the internet have given my life so much color and meaning,” the “Bless Myself” singer continued. After expressing gratitude for all the people she emotionally “connected” with last year, Hale delivered a dose of encouragement to people who are “struggling.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

At a much-hyped appearance at the Texas border with Mexico, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said House Republicans wanted their entire immigration restriction bill passed, even as, back in Washington, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate majority leader, said that wasn’t going to happen. As the leaders’ first public remarks in the new year, they highlighted another emerging round of political chicken after Congress avoided possible shutdowns in October and November. In October, Democrats were willing to jettison needed military aid for Ukraine for a temporary funding bill, while in November, House Republicans coming off a bruising intraparty fight over who should be speaker, let Democrats carry a bill to fund the government. “We want to get the border closed and secured first, and we want to make sure we reduce non-defense discretionary spending,” Johnson told reporters at a press conference in Texas. While Johnson said there had been negotiations almost every day through holiday break, he also said in response to a separate question that House Republicans weren’t interested in seeing only portions of their immigration bill, H.R. 2, passed. “H.R. 2 is the necessary ingredient. Why? Because it has provisions that fix each of these problems and these provisions work together,” he said. In Washington, where a small group of senators and White House officials continue to try to negotiate a supplemental spending bill that would include border provisions as well as aid to Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region, Schumer warned House Republicans against overreach. If the House “clings” to H.R. 2, Schumer told reporters, “We’re not going to get a deal” on the supplemental spending bill. He also made it clear his strategy is to get an agreement with Senate Republicans he hopes the House GOP will accept. “We want to get the Senate to come to an agreement first,” he said. While the supplemental bill with international military aid is a separate negotiation than the annual spending bills that need to be passed by Jan. 19, a delay in getting to agreement on the first could lead to the talks getting combined as the government edges nearer to a shutdown. There is an appetite among House Republicans to shut down the government as at least a sign of seriousness about stopping illegal immigration. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), a member of the rightwing House Freedom Caucus, posted on social media, “Congress must refuse to fund this corrupt administration unless the border is restored. #HR2.” The agencies funded only through Jan. 19 include the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Energy, Transportation, Treasury, as well as Housing and Urban Development. In wrapping up his answer about whether House Republicans were willing to vote to shut down the government if there were no border changes, Johnson reiterated they want a secure border and to cut spending outside of the Pentagon.

In court documents obtained by the New York Post and publicized Tuesday, Clarkson claims that Blackstock once told her she wasn’t “sexy” enough to join the NBC talent competition series. Blackstock ― who, for years, acted as Clarkson’s manager ― also allegedly told her that her public persona was “too similar” to that of another “Voice” coach, country musician Blake Shelton, and that NBC executives were “looking for a more sex symbol type” like the singer Rihanna. The Post also reports that, when asked about the discussion in court, Clarkson told her lawyer Ed McPherson: “Well, a wife doesn’t forget a time she gets told she’s not a sex symbol, so that stays.” Clarkson went on to join “The Voice” for Season 14 in 2018 and continued with the show through its 21st season in 2021. She returned for Season 23, which wrapped in May of last year. Blackstock hasn’t commented publicly on the Post’s story. In November, however, a California labor commissioner ordered him to pay Clarkson more than $2.6 million over unlawful business deals he made on his ex-wife’s behalf. Clarkson split from Blackstock in 2020 after seven years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in 2022. They share a daughter, River Rose, 9, and a son, Remington Alexander, 7. Clarkson initially had to pay Blackstock $115,000 a month in spousal support, but those payments reportedly came to an end this month. The “American Idol” veteran and talk show host also alluded to the demise of her marriage on her 10th studio album, “Chemistry,” released last year. In an interview with People published Wednesday, Clarkson opened up about her use of songwriting as a “healthy outlet” for her grief.

On Tuesday, the Food Network star posted a makeup-free “PSA” video on Instagram to address those who mocked her gray hair and use of filters. “I’m filming with no filter today because some of y’all get really bent out of shape when I choose to use a filter, which I’ve told you about,” she said. “Sometimes I use a filter, and sometimes I don’t. Most of the time, I do use a filter because this is me with no makeup, and this is no filter.” The 63-year-old went on to shut down the social media users who accused her of wearing wigs in her posts. “Can you get me a wig without flipping gray roots then, please? Because I’m tired of getting my roots done every two weeks,” she said as she lowered her head to give viewers a closer look at her hair. Despite the negative comments, the “Kid’s Baking Championship” host didn’t hesitate to acknowledge the people who have been “really kind” and “sweet” to her on social media. “Thank goodness 99.9% of you are like, really kind, sweet people and don’t give a flying flip whether I have roots or I put a filter on,” she said. Bertinelli’s followers stuck up for her in the comments section amid the remarks about her looks, including “Saved by the Bell” actor Tiffani Thiessen. Thiessen told Bertinelli “don’t give that any energy friend,” before adding, “It ain’t worth it. I literally erase and ignore that noise. Did that for my sanity a long time ago.” In July last year, Bertinelli posted a video on TikTok discussing her personal experiences with a certain controversial cosmetic practice — Botox. “I have tried Botox ... and I hated it,” she said after someone made a snarky comment on social media accusing her of getting the cosmetic injections. She then shared a photo of herself with Botox taken six years ago, before saying that it “sort of changed the shape of my eyebrows.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The newly unsealed court documents are part of a now-settled civil suit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein and his partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, of coercing her to have sex with Epstein and others when she was 16. The documents include depositions, emails and other legal filings. The documents released Wednesday are the first 40 of more than 200 that will be unsealed in coming days. While many bold-faced names appear in the documents, not all of the people named are accused of misconduct. And all of the men accused by Giuffre and others in depositions of acting illegally have denied any wrongdoing. In a 2016 deposition included in the filings, Giuffre says Maxwell directed her to have sex with Prince Andrew, billionaire Glenn Dubin, model scout Jean-Luc Brunel and artificial intelligence researcher Marvin Minsky. Giuffre also said Maxwell directed her to give a “massage” to former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson. Several names in Giuffre’s deposition remain redacted. In an email to Maxwell included in the documents, Epstein tells her to “issue a reward” to any friends or family members of Giuffre’s who would be willing to discredit her accusations. One document alleges that Epstein forced an underage girl, whose identify remains sealed, to have sex with former Donald Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz on numerous occasions. It also states that Epstein trafficked her “for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” Other famous people mentioned in the documents are not necessarily implicated in Epstein’s lurid crimes, but were referenced in the unsealed depositions conducted as part of Giuffre’s civil suit. One such document alleges that Epstein once told Johanna Sjoberg, one of his accusers, that former President Bill Clinton “likes them young, referring to girls.” In another, Maxwell says that Clinton flew on Epstein’s private plane but couldn’t confirm how many times. Clinton previously denied allegations of visiting Epstein’s properties and having knowledge of his crimes. Sjoberg also identifies magician David Copperfield as a friend of Epstein’s and said he asked her if she was “aware that girls were getting paid to find other girls.” She also said she overheard Epstein on the phone saying he needed to “find some girls” in Hawaii for celebrity hairstylist Frédéric Fekkai. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered the identifying documents to be made public last month, allowing a 14-day grace period for anyone named in them to appeal their inclusion. Two people who requested to keep their names sealed, known only as Doe 107 and Doe 110, would not be immediately named, Preska said in a court order Wednesday. Doe 107 was granted an extension of time, until Jan. 22, to make a case that revealing her name would cause her physical harm. Doe 110’s plea remained under review by the court, Preska said. “The Court will render its determination on the documents relating to Does 107 and 110 in due course,” Preska said. The judge had previously said that names would be redacted if it was determined that their release would “disclose sensitive information regarding an alleged minor victim of sexual abuse who has not spoken publicly and who has maintained his or her privacy.” Giuffre ― formerly known as Virginia Roberts ― met Maxwell when she was working at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in 2000. In a 2020 interview with CBS News, Giuffre said “very well-known” people could be incriminated should Maxwell cooperate with prosecutors, including Britain’s Prince Andrew, whom Giuffre has accused of rape. Prince Andrew settled a sexual abuse lawsuit brought by Giuffre last year but has denied the allegations. Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for similar crimes.

The agency had announced its preorder sale Wednesday in a news release. The coins — a $5 gold, $1 silver and half-dollar clad — display portraits of Tubman at different points in her life. Varying in price, they can be bought individually or together in a three-coin proof set, which costs $836.25. The Harriet Tubman Commemorative Coin Program “recognizes the bicentennial of Harriet Tubman’s birth and her lifework that spans beyond liberation,” according to the Mint website. “Reflected in the unique designs of gold, silver, and half-dollar coins – this collection showcases significant periods in her pursuit of social justice and represents a different era of Harriet Tubman’s extraordinary life,” the site states. Born into slavery in the early 1820s, Tubman eventually escaped and played a pivotal role in helping rescue other African Americans through the underground railroad. She also aided in the recruitment of Black soldiers for the Union Army during the Civil War and served as a spy. The Tubman coins have been in the works for years. In 2020, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) proposed the idea with the introduction of the Harriet Tubman Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act. “Harriet Tubman was a woman of incredible courage who remains a symbol of the strength and leadership in periods of overwhelming hardship,” he said in a statement at the time. “As a crucial conductor in the underground railroad, she created a beacon of hope for slaves who fled from the undignified cruelty of human bondage. In wartime, she tended to the wounded who fought the just war for emancipation.” After passing Congress, the legislation was signed by President Joe Biden in August 2022. Designs for the Tubman coins were first released in July. They are expected to begin shipping early next month, according to the Mint. Meanwhile, efforts to redesign the $20 bill with a portrait of Tubman in place of President Andrew Jackson are on hold because of technical delays. A new design for the bill is set for 2030.

The plane’s owner and pilot, identified as Robert Sachs, reportedly died as well. Oliver was 51 years old. His daughter Madita was 10 and Annik was 12. The Royal St. Vincent and the Grenadines Police Force said in a statement that the accident occurred off the coast of Bequia. Oliver, who was born Christian Klepser in West Germany, was bound for St. Lucia with his kids in a single-engine aircraft that took off from J.F. Mitchell Airport on Bequia. Locals told The St. Vincent Times on Thursday that the plane made a sputtering noise upon takeoff. Island resident Danroy Joseph likened it to “when a vehicle is struggling — you know, stalling, struggling for power to go up a hill.” “Moments after taking off, the aircraft experienced difficulties and plummeted into the ocean,” police said in a Facebook statement Thursday. “Fishermen and divers from Paget Farm went to the scene of the incident in their boats to render assistance.” The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Coast Guard led rescue efforts. All four passengers were retrieved from the plane and ocean but were later pronounced dead. The crash occurred three days after Oliver celebrated New Year’s Eve with a post on Instagram. “The bodies were transported to St. Vincent on board the Coast Guard vessel and were taken to the Kingstown Mortuary, where post-mortem examinations are expected to be carried out to ascertain the cause of death,” police added in their statement. “I cried cried, it was our first and last film together, I loved working with him so much … He was so. nice, worked so hard and [was] such a brave actor and a beautiful gentle person,” Bai Ling, Oliver’s co-star in the upcoming film “Forever Hold Your Peace,” wrote on Instagram. She said she last saw Oliver on Dec. 20, as they wrapped up shooting on the film. Oliver had curated an impressive acting résumé. He starred as a detective for two years on the popular German TV series “Alarm für Cobra 11” before making the leap to Hollywood features. Oliver not only starred opposite George Clooney and Cate Blanchett in Steven Soderbergh’s “The Good German” (2006), but he also played opposite Tom Cruise in “Valkyrie” (2008) and under the direction of the Wachowskis in “Speed Racer” that same year.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elijah-mcclain-randy-roedema-sentenced_n_65988494e4b0f9f6621cb9b0","2024-01-05","colleen slevin","Ex-Colorado Cop Who Killed Elijah McClain Gets 14 Months In Jail","DENVER (AP) — A judge sentenced an ex-Colorado police officer to 14 months in jail for his role in the death of Elijah McClain after hearing the young Black man’s mother on Friday call the officer a “bully with a badge” who will always have blood on his hands. The officer, Randy Roedema, was the most senior law enforcement member charged in McClain’s death and was the only one found guilty. He was the most senior officer who initially responded to the scene. A jury convicted him in October of criminally negligent homicide, which is a felony, and third-degree assault, which is a misdemeanor. The 23-year-old’s killing received little attention at the time of his death, but gained renewed interest the following year as mass protests swept the nation over the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. McClain’s death became a rallying cry for critics of racial injustice in policing. In a separate trial, two paramedics were recently convicted for injecting McClain with an overdose of the sedative ketamine after police put him in a neck hold. Sentencing will come later this year for the paramedics, who had been trained to use ketamine to treat “ excited delirium ” — a disputed condition some say is unscientific, rooted in racism, and used to justify excessive force. Before the judge handed down the sentence, McClain’s mother Sheneen McClain raged against Roedema after he expressed remorse but stopped short of apologizing. “Randy Roedema stole my son’s life,” she said, “All the belated apologies in the world can’t remove my son’s blood from Randy Roedema’s hands.” Protecting the community was “the furthest thing from his mind” the night the was stopped walking home from the store, she said. Roedema also spoke at the hearing, as well as his sister and former military colleagues — he was a U.S. Marine who was wounded in Iraq. “I want the McClain family to know the sadness I feel about Elijah being gone. He was young,” Roedema said. Roedema suggested Friday that first responders get more training in how to deal with such situations that led to McClain being given an overdose. “Ultimately the situation has caused a lot of pain and we are faced with the choice of how to deal with it,” Roedema said. McClain was stopped by police after a 911 caller reported that he looked suspicious. Another officer put his hands on McClain within seconds, beginning a struggle and restraint that lasted about 20 minutes before paramedics injected him with the ketamine. Experts say the sedative ultimately killed McClain, who was already weakened from struggling to breath while being pinned down after inhaling vomit into this lungs. For Roedema, criminally negligent homicide, defined as killing someone by failing to recognize a substantial risk to their life, carried a punishment of probation up to three years in prison. The assault conviction was punishable by probation up to two years in jail. Judge Mark Warner, a former prosecutor who has been a judge for nearly 20 years, had to determine a fair sentence by weighing how this homicide case compares to others he has seen in his career, said former district attorney George Brauchler. A first conviction can lead to a sentence of probation, but the judge must also consider that Roedema was a uniformed police officer, given special authority and respect by society, and a jury convicted him of taking a life, Brauchler said. “I don’t know how that person gets to go home that night” on probation, said Brauchler, who prosecuted the 2012 Aurora theater shooting case. “I think that would be very tough.” Roedema helped hold McClain down while paramedics administered the ketamine. He was often visible in the body camera footage shown over and over to jurors, and could be heard directing others how to restrain him. The same jury that convicted Roedema acquitted former officer Jason Rosenblatt, whose lawyers stressed that he wasn’t close to McClain when the ketamine was injected. A different jury acquitted officer Nathan Woodyard a few weeks later, after he testified that he put McClain in a neck hold, briefly rendering him unconscious. Woodyard testified that he feared for his life after Roedema said McClain had grabbed for one of their guns. Prosecutors say the gun grab never happened. Aurora Fire Rescue paramedics Jeremy Cooper and Peter Cichuniec were convicted last month. Cichuniec, the senior officer, was found guilty of the most serious charge faced by any of the first responders: felony second-degree assault. It carries a mandatory prison sentence of between five and 16 years in prison. In a statement after those final verdicts, McClain’s mother said having three out of the five defendants convicted was not justice, merely “a very small acknowledgment of accountability in the justice system.” “There were at least 20 individuals there the night my son was alive and talking before he was brutally murdered. Aurora Colorado Police Department and Fire Department kept everyone else on their payroll because both of those departments lack humanity, refusing to admit their inhumane protocols,” she said. The paramedics’ verdicts came a day after after a jury in Washington state cleared three police officers of all criminal charges in the 2020 death of Manuel Ellis, a Black man who was shocked with a stun gun, beaten and restrained face-down as he pleaded for breath.

Candace McCoy, professor emerita at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, doesn’t see the recent acquittals there or in Colorado as a sign that the push for police reform is waning. Instead, she said it’s a reflection of how hard it is convict police officers of crimes because jurors tend to give them the benefit of the doubt for how they act in emergencies. While it was rare to prosecute cases against law enforcement in the past, the fact that more of them are being pursued now is not enough to create police reform, she said. “The way to change and reform the police is to change the culture and the departments, and individual prosecutions will not do that,” McCoy said.

Joseph Edward Walker, 30, and Judy Bribiescas, 39, were charged with first-degree manslaughter in the death of their daughter, who was found overdosed in a motel room in Kennewick, Washington, reports CBS affiliate KEPR, citing court documents. Surveillance footage cited in the court documents showed Bribiescas walking into the motel room in Kennewick with their 8-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter on Dec. 27. A spokesperson for the Kennewik Police Department told HuffPost that Walker was living with Bribiescas and her two children at the time of the incident, which violated a no-contact court order she had with him. According to court documents, the couple’s son told investigators that his parents were in the bathroom, and police believe they were using drugs at the time. Authorities believe the 4-year-old swallowed the fentanyl pills while her parents were in the bathroom and overdosed, according to the document. Surveillance footage allegedly showed Walker later handing the 4-year-old’s body to Bribiescas before fleeing the scene in his car. Kennewick police responded to a report regarding a 4-year-old who had stopped breathing. When they arrived, they attempted life-saving measures, police said in a statement. They said the 4-year-old was taken to to a local hospital, where she died. According to the court documents, the girl had swallowed at least two fentanyl pills, and doctors found another pill stuck in her nose. A Kennewick police spokesperson told HuffPost that the girl ingested “rainbow fentanyl” pills, which are colorful pills that look like candy. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has claimed the product is intentionally aimed at children, but drug experts say that is likely untrue. Bribiescas was arrested following the incident, and Walker was arrested Thursday in Richland, Washington, police said. Need help with substance use disorder or mental health issues?

He noted the former president’s recent use of rhetoric echoing Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and his expressed desire for “revenge,” and he suggested Trump was not only a threat to Americans’ voting rights but also their broader freedoms. He called his predecessor “sick” for laughing about the October 2022 attack on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul. “Donald Trump’s campaign is about him, not America, not you,” Biden said. “Donald Trump’s campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. He’s willing to sacrifice our democracy to put himself in power.” Though the speech’s timing may seem obvious (it was scheduled for Saturday, the third anniversary of the U.S. Capitol attack, but was moved up because of an approaching winter storm), the location was also important. Biden contrasted the sacrifices made by Gen. George Washington’s troops at nearby Valley Forge and Washington’s decision two decades later to allow for a peaceful presidential transfer of power to Trump’s own refusal to accept his reelection defeat. “Donald Trump exhausted every legal avenue available to him to overturn the election. Every one,” Biden said. “But the legal path just took Trump back to the truth: that I had won the election and he was a loser.” Trump’s campaign responded to Biden’s speech by claiming the “radical left Democrats” are the ones who pose a threat to democracy, arguing that the multiple investigations of Trump’s role in the insurrection, his handling of classified documents and his hush-money payments to a porn star were all part of a liberal plot to bring him down. “The bottom line today is that Joe Biden has given up on running an issues-based campaign for 2024,” Jason Miller, a top adviser to Trump, wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “Rather than help those suffering from Bidenomics or our porous southern border, Biden plans on weaponizing government against his leading political opponent.” Biden delivered the speech even as faith in American democracy, battered by Trump’s authoritarianism, years of congressional dysfunction and decades of growing economic inequality, was at all-time lows. A recent poll from Gallup found just 28% of Americans were satisfied with the way democracy was working in the United States, a record low. Many Democrats have been eager for Biden to begin defining the 2024 race as a referendum on the choice between himself and Trump, hoping the contrast will remind voters of Trump’s deficiencies and lift Biden’s weak approval ratings. (The two men are essentially tied in public polling.) Biden’s campaign has said it hopes rhetorically raising the stakes of the election will engage tuned-out voting blocs that have drifted away from the president.

The speech comes as Biden’s reelection message shifts from trying to sell “Bidenomics” ― a slogan that ended up being derided by Democrats and doing little to concretely improve the president’s image ― and toward a focus on Trump and the threat his authoritarian tendencies pose to the country. The campaign released a television ad touching on similar themes earlier this week. “I refuse to believe that in 2024, we Americans will choose to walk away from what has made us the greatest nation in the history of the world: freedom, liberty,” Biden said. “Democracy is still a sacred cause.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The justices said they would hear arguments in April and put on hold a lower court ruling that had blocked the Idaho law in hospital emergencies, based on a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration. Hospitals that receive Medicare funds are required by a federal law to provide emergency care, potentially including abortion, no matter if there’s a state law banning abortion, the administration argued. The legal fight followed the court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to severely restrict or ban abortion. The Biden administration issued guidance about the law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, two weeks after the high court ruling in 2022. The Democratic administration sued Idaho a month later. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Idaho agreed with the administration. But in a separate case in Texas, a judge sided with the state. Idaho makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion. But the administration argues EMTALA requires health care providers to perform abortions for emergency room patients when needed to treat an emergency medical condition, even if doing so might conflict with a state’s abortion restrictions. Those conditions include severe bleeding, preeclampsia and certain pregnancy-related infections. “For certain medical emergencies, abortion care is the necessary stabilizing treatment,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in an administration filing at the Supreme Court. The state argued that the administration was misusing a law intended to prevent hospitals from dumping patients and imposing “a federal abortion mandate” on states. “EMTALA says nothing about abortion,” Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador told the court in a brief. Just Tuesday, the federal appeals court in New Orleans came to the same conclusion as Labrador. A three-judge panel ruled that the administration cannot use EMTALA to require hospitals in Texas to provide abortions for women whose lives are at risk due to pregnancy. Two of the three judges are appointees of President Donald Trump, and the other was appointed by another Republican president, George W. Bush. The next four years will change America forever.

Hendrix wrote that adopting the Biden administration’s view would force physicians to place the health of the pregnant person over that of the fetus or embryo even though EMTALA “is silent as to abortion.” After Winmill, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, issued his ruling, Idaho lawmakers won an order allowing the law to be fully enforced from an all-Republican, Trump-appointed panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But a larger contingent of 9th Circuit judges threw out the panel’s ruling and set arguments in the case for late January.

Earlier this week, Stanley, the company behind the TikTok-famous vacuum-insulated tumblers, released its limited edition Valentine’s Day collaboration cups with Starbucks, to unbelievable fanfare. The cups, sold exclusively at Target stores, had some people camping outside their local stores to secure the goods. Videos posted on TikTok show parched fans racing through the aisles of Target to get to the 40-ounce water bottles. A video on TMZ shows a man desperately jumping over the counter at a Target’s Starbucks to steal a box of the tumblers, which run for $45 apiece. (Water is essential, people, but a Stanley cup is not!) The new Stanley cups, which come in Cosmo Pink and Target Red, are already up on resale sites like eBay and listed at prices up to $300 ― not surprising given the fact that a rep for Starbucks confirmed that the cup will not be restocked. Confused by the hoopla over a water bottle? Understandable. Below, we unpack why seemingly everyone and their mother are trying to get their hands on the cup. The hype over the Stanley Cup among millennial and Gen Z women (and more recently, Gen Alpha preteens) began on social media, specifically on TikTok. There, users sing the praises of all things Stanley and show off the myriad accessories they’ve bought to upgrade their tumblers: this whole stanley thing is really starting to feel like a cult bc why would you need all that for a tumbler? pic.twitter.com/m3X1PPxytL The fandom around water bottles coincides with the “WaterTok” trend, in which people share how they turn their H2O into “spa water” or “birthday cake water” with different powders and ingredients. Hydro Flask, Yeti and cooler brands like Frank Green have their well-hydrated fans, too, but they’re nothing compared to the Stanley evangelists. “Let’s talk about the Stanley cup and what makes it so life changing,” one TikTokker intoned in her video. “I get it, you probably don’t want another cup but you need this cup.” As of now, “Stanley Cup” — the tumbler, not the trophy awarded to the winner of the National Hockey League championship — has over 52.7 million views on TikTok. That’s a pretty impressive youth following for a brand that’s over 100 years old. “When I was 11, I asked for dolls. Today’s 11-year-olds asked for Stanley tumblers,” Casey Lewis, a youth consumer trends analyst who writes the newsletter After School, told Business Insider recently. “Seeing Gen Alpha kids sobbing over water bottles is pretty surprising.” Ashlee LeSueur, a co-founder of the Buy Guide, an online shopping blog and Instagram account, was an early adopter of the Stanley Quencher back in 2017. “Of all the insulated cups... this is the one. Just trust,” LeSueur and her team wrote in 2017, raving about its ability to keep beverages cold, its straw, its handle and its ability to be tossed in the dishwasher. A post shared by THE BUY GUIDE (@thebuyguide) A viral story in November about how a Stanley tumbler was the only item that survived a car fire (with ice still inside, no less) cemented Stanley’s “unbreakable” reputation. Given the brand’s image ― and the love for all things pink post-“Barbie” movie ― LeSuer isn’t surprised the new pink-hued edition is selling out. “The consumers have made it abundantly clear that color is king,” she told HuffPost. “And the craze around the Stanley Quencher isn’t new! Even in 2021 Stanley’s website had a 30,000-person waitlist for restock notifications on the cup.” The Furby-esque frenzy around the Stanley cup is clearly the scarcity model at work: The idea that something is rare or limited edition works wonders on buyers. The fact that the Stanley cup presents affordable scarcity tips those “I’ve gotta have it” feelings over the edge, said Katie Thomas, the lead of the Consumer Institute at Kearney, a global management consulting firm. “While the scarcity model is often associated with luxury, that’s exactly the reason it’s also appealing in the mainstream ― it allows consumers to feel like they are getting something special that not everyone has, without being priced out,” she said. It taps into the emotions of consumers, Thomas said, “from the excitement leading up to the release, to the personal victory and gratification if and when the product is acquired.” For those last minute costume needs. 🎃#spirithalloween #halloweencostume #stanleytumbler #stanleyquencher pic.twitter.com/CqDXZ6itwW Hannah Shamji is a consumer insights researcher who helps marketers and founders make smarter decisions by understanding their customers. The way she sees it, people aren’t buying a Stanley mug. They’re buying into the Stanley club. “You don’t stampede in Target for a tumbler,” she said. “What [people] are buying is [a sense of] belonging. People want to be in the know or fit in.” It’s a status move, Shamji said, and that’s not a bad thing: “Status is a really powerful driver of purchase behavior, because it tugs on a very fundamental human need: to belong.” It’s why so many people are commenting or posting about the Stanley cup online, too, she said. They want to be a part of the conversation and join the hype. “Even though fans can sing its praises, people are not buying a Stanley cup because of its features and functionality,” she said. That’s not why the cup sold out in minutes, Shamji explained, or why people buy multiple colors when you really only necessitate one water bottle. “I saw one woman on TikTok with a cup in every color: The full rainbow of Stanleys,” she said. “She’s not buying on need or because the Stanley is objectively better than the Yeti. It’s not a logical or calculated purchase decision. It’s a feeling-based one.” The cup is a social currency, Shamji said, a flex, just like a large collection of Beanie Babies (of all things) were years ago. Will the excitement over Stanley tumblers last? Lewis, the youth consumer trends analyst, told Business Insider she thinks there’s nowhere to go but down from here for Stanley. “When young kids and tweens adopt a trend or product, teens and older Gen Z distance themselves,” she said. Affordable products that also signal social status from being cool or “in the know” often take off in the marketplace, but therein lies the downside: No one wants what everyone has. “The risk for a brand like Stanley is that it might become ubiquitous and is therefore no longer a symbol for one-upping in one’s social network,” said Steve Westberg, an associate psychology professor at the University of Southern California with expertise in consumer psychology. “There’s also the inherent factor that not everyone needs a cup like this and those who do probably don’t need more than one, so the total market volume has a limit,” he added. Westberg told HuffPost he thinks the water bottles will see a sales decline when the social factor no longer drives sales, but that they’ll still merit shelf space “just based on just being a darn good cup.” From Furby to Tickle Me Elmo to Beanie Babies, there will always be products that people gravitate toward and collect. It’s not entirely explainable why, said Thomas: Sometimes it’s just the scarcity in and of itself and the visibility of the product. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Oral arguments are scheduled to commence Feb. 8. The court’s decision Friday to take up the case follows a Colorado Supreme Court ruling in December that Trump is ineligible for office because he violated the 14th Amendment, which states that anyone who took an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution but then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against the nation must be barred from state or federal office. That decision cited Trump’s role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s been charged with four federal crimes over the attempted coup to remain in the White House despite losing the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden, and the trial is scheduled to start in March. Following the Colorado ruling, Trump’s attorneys asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review and overturn the state-level decision before the state nominating process begins this month. “We welcome a fair hearing at the Supreme Court to argue against the bad-faith, election-interfering, voter-suppressing, Democrat-backed and Biden-led, 14th Amendment abusing decision to remove President Trump’s name from the 2024 ballot in the state of Colorado,” Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement Friday. “We are confident that the fair-minded Supreme Court will unanimously affirm the civil rights of President Trump, and the voting rights of all Americans in a ruling that will squash all of the remaining ballot challenge hoaxes once and for all,” Cheung added. Just over a week after the Colorado decision, Maine’s secretary of state said Trump’s alleged 14th Amendment violations had precluded him from appearing on ballots in her state as well.

The renowned composer recently sat down with The Telegraph and, as co-creator of “The Phantom of the Opera,” was naturally asked if any of the theaters he owns are haunted. Webber denied as much, before making an intriguing claim about his home in London. “I did have a house in Eaton Square which had a poltergeist,” he told the outlet in an interview Tuesday. “It would do things like take theatre scripts and put them in a neat pile in some obscure room. In the end we had to get a priest to come and bless it, and it left.” This purportedly organized ghost starkly contrasts a traditional poltergeist, which remain unproven but are nonetheless known for their mischief, violence and noise. The term itself translates directly from German to “rapping” or “thudding” ghost. Webber’s home is notably situated in Belgravia, a central neighborhood developed in the 19th century by Marquess of Westminster, Robert Grosvenor. From those noble roots sprang some of the best schools and most expensive homes in the world. While Webber has yet to encounter a ghost directly, some of his famous peers have claimed to. Sir Patrick Stewart alleged in 2009 that he witnessed an apparition while performing “Waiting for Godot” with Sir Ian McKellen onstage in central London. “I have been witnessing stuff since I was 12 years old,” Stewart recently told USA Today. “And it has stayed with me throughout my life. I have sometimes quite intense feelings and nighttime experiences and occasionally I witness things.” “Why would I invent it? Because I always feel slightly foolish when I talk about this.” And Webber isn’t the first of his crew to be baffled by the unseen. Even Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who produced “Phantom,” recently admitted to feeling something strange at a nearby theater. “On the opening night of ‘Miss Saigon’ in 1989 … I walked onto the vast stage and stood with [designer] John Napier,” he told The Telegraph. “As we gazed into the beautiful empty auditorium, we felt a chill and heard some slight sounds above our heads in the grid.” “In less than a minute, it was gone, but we both felt some presence,” he continued. “Later the theatre’s old manager George Hoare told me: ‘That was the Man in Grey. He always turns up if you’re going to have a big hit!’” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Past residents of Eaton Square include former prime minister Neville Chamberlain, his foreign secretary Lord Halifax and actor Vivien Leigh. Perhaps it was one of them who nightly tended to Webber’s papers — although a housekeeper certainly makes more sense.

According to deputies, Crystal LeBlanc went to Butler’s home that night to speak to her husband, who was inside, and the two engaged in a heated argument. Butler then approached the pair at the doorway, allegedly armed with a gun. She fired a shot and Graig LeBlanc put his hand in front of the weapon in an attempt to disarm her, deputies said. The bullet shot through the chief’s hand and struck his wife in the arm, the release stated. While the chief and his wife admitted themselves into a local hospital, Butler allegedly cleaned up the crime scene in an attempt to cover up the evidence before calling authorities. In his letter published on Wednesday, Graig LeBlanc said “infidelity” on his part led to the alleged incident. “Infidelity is a breach of not only the personal commitments I made but also the professional standards we all expect from those in public service,” the police chief wrote. It’s unclear whether “infidelity” referred to an affair with Butler. The police chief said he is initiating an internal review within the police department and committed to restoring the community trust. The next four years will change America forever.

One recalled the look of pure hatred in the attackers’ eyes. Another would never forget the whine of a hundred gas masks, all operating at once. For some House Democrats who were in the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and experienced the insurrection from a unique vantage point — being the target of the attack — those were the memories that stood out shortly afterward. Prior to Jan. 6, the U.S. Capitol had not been sacked since the War of 1812. But on that day, a pro-Donald Trump mob, many of whom marched to the Capitol directly from his speech urging them to “fight like hell,” clashed with police, broke into the building, and chased lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence into hiding. The riot lasted for hours, with the mob arriving at the Capitol shortly before 1 p.m. and police clearing the building around 6 p.m. Five people died. While the attack inspired bipartisan revulsion at the time, that consensus has eroded ahead of its three-year anniversary Saturday. Now, some on the right say too much has been made of the violence, pointing to protesters who walked into the Capitol well after the first groups of attackers. But newly obtained video interviews of House Democrats who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 show vividly how traumatic that day was. As mini time capsules, they include a level of detail and rawness that will be hard to replicate as Jan. 6 recedes further into the past. The videos were the brainchild of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). As early as Feb. 2, 2021, she urged her fellow House Democrats to record their Jan. 6 memories, for “an accurate personal record and for the healing process for our Congress and, indeed, Country.” Twenty-one Democratic members did so and HuffPost obtained several of them for the following account. The half-hour interviews were conducted in the Capitol by staff from the House historian’s office. Most were given in March 2021, with one in May and another in January 2022. They have remained largely, if not completely, unseen since they were conducted. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) was first elected in 1996 and had been through the ceremonial certification process before. On the morning of Jan. 6, he said he expected some hemming and hawing as opponents made objections to some states’ electoral ballots for Joe Biden, but not much more. “I surely didn’t expect an insurrection,” he said. As a former Marine, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) was just the opposite. He had been tracking violent rhetoric online. “I knew there was going to be fireworks,” he said. Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.), a freshman member for whom Jan. 6 was only her fourth day on the job, said she thought it would be a long day and night. But she also brought to work a bottle of champagne she planned to open later with fellow freshman Rep. Nikema Williams (D-Ga.), to mark Democrats’ upset sweep the night before of two Senate seats from Georgia. “I was also in a very festive mood, wanting to celebrate what we had just done in Georgia,” she said. By the time the House began to discuss the first challenge to certification, an objection to Arizona’s electoral votes at about 1:20 p.m., attackers had already breached the bike rack fencing around the Capitol and had begun facing off with officers on the west side of the building. Inside, though, most members were unaware of the situation. Several recalled being puzzled by texts or messages from family members and staff asking if they were OK. The idea that members wouldn’t be safe in the U.S. Capitol, in the House chamber, seemed absurd. “If I respond that I’m on the floor, that means both I’m working and that I’m in a very safe location. It’s not a place that I would think would be, that there could be, a problem,” Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas) said. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), in the audience gallery one floor above and overlooking the House floor, left the room with then-Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) to check the situation for himself after one of his daughters sent him TV footage. They asked a Capitol Police officer if they were prepared. “She said, ‘Gentlemen, we’re in the United States Capitol. This is the safest building in the country. And darn right, we’re prepared.’ Ten minutes later, we were back in the chamber and the speaker and the majority leader were removed,” he said. Prior to the leaders’ removal, there had been other signs of trouble. Jacobs, sitting in the House gallery for the first time, said she didn’t understand a phone alert saying the nearby Madison Building, which is a block from Capitol, had been evacuated. “I was so new that I didn’t know what that meant,” she said. A little bit more than 50 minutes into the session, McGovern was asked by a Pelosi staffer if he could sub in for her in the speaker’s chair if she needed him to. He agreed and she thanked him as she left. “She left her phone on the table, so I expected her to be right back,” he said. But Pelosi, along with Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) had been whisked off the floor by security. The abrupt departure of the House leaders from the floor was when the gravity of the situation dawned on many members. “I remember they took Steny Hoyer so aggressively he couldn’t even bring his papers. He tried to grab his papers as they were escorting him from the chamber and he couldn’t reach them,” Allred said. Any remaining doubts were quickly dispelled by the House going into recess — and the announcement that insurrectionists were in the Rotunda, just a minute’s walk from the floor, and that Capitol Police had deployed tear gas. Security officers locked the doors to the chamber and began barricading them with furniture. Members were asked to don gas masks that were stored under the chairs. But hardly any of them knew how to use them and just getting them out of the sealed packaging was frustratingly difficult. “We couldn’t open the damn thing,” said Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.). “It’s like that paper that film used to come in but very heavy, metal. And we’re frantic. We think we’re going to die and we can’t open the damn thing.” Gallego said the order to put on gas masks was when people started freaking out. As a veteran, he explained how to put them on and urged his colleagues to keep calm once they got them on. “You could put on a hood or a gas mask and if you’re hyperventilating, you’re basically just producing more carbon dioxide than you are actually taking in oxygen and you can pass out,” he said. That’s when Phillips heard the whizzing sound he said he would never forget, as members put on their hoods, which included small fans inside. “When about a hundred of them are being used at the same time, it sounds like a siren,” he said. “It’s one of those sounds that you never quite forget. That’s what I remember more than anything else, the collective sound of the masks.” Allred said the locking of the doors and the barricade brought home that lawmakers might have to make their last stand in the chamber. “At that point, I thought that we may not have a way out,” he said. He thought about his 23-month old son and his wife, who was seven and a half months pregnant at the time. Expecting he wouldn’t be back before bedtime, he’d told his son that morning he would see him the next day. “I texted my wife, ‘Whatever happens, I love you,’ because I thought that might be the last thing I say to her,” Allred said. He took off his suit coat, ordinarily a breach of floor protocol, and talked with Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) about what they might have to do to defend themselves. Two female lawmakers, then-Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said they’d stick behind Allred, who had been listed at 6’1” and 242 lbs. during his days as an NFL linebacker. “I’ll do my best,” he told them. Around that time, attackers began pounding on the north side door of the chamber, the one the president walks through to go down the chamber’s center aisle when he gives a State of the Union address. “And it’s at that point that I started thinking about semi-automatic weapons and a mass shooting,” said Kuster. “I didn’t know if they had weapons, but I definitely didn’t know if they didn’t.” Kuster’s voice began to break as she recalled the day and she gently wiped a tear from her right eye. “I remember thinking to myself, ‘You have to think rational thoughts, don’t get frantic, just make good decisions. This is life or death.’” Kuster said she grabbed Jacobs, in her “crazy tall high heels,” and pulled her to the floor with her so they would be less visible if the attackers breached the chamber. They crouched and made their way across the gallery to the other side of the chamber. An officer led them out of the gallery to an elevator but once in, they worried where it would go. What if the doors opened and there was the mob? The officer reassured them. “He was just so incredible. He stood up like this and said, ‘Ma’am, I am here to protect you,’ and he just blocked the door,” Kuster said. Before Kuster and Jacobs left the gallery, the members and staff on the House floor were evacuated out of a door that opened into the Speaker’s Lobby, a large anteroom right outside the chamber. A combination door and glass partition sealed the lobby from the attackers. It was a break in that glass partition that Ashli Babbitt tried to climb through when she was fatally shot, only a few feet away from a door that opened directly into the chamber. Hearing the shot, Jacobs said she thought it was a flash-bang grenade. “I remember sitting and thinking to myself, ‘Those doors are going to open and there’s going to be someone with a machine gun, and we’re all done for.’ And trying to think of what I needed to send my team, so that they could at least do something good with that death,” she said. “I have been in pretty tough places. I worked [for] the State Department, the U.N., armed conflict. And it was definitely the closest I ever felt to feeling like I was going to die.” McGovern and Gallego recollected trying to ensure no one was being left behind as the floor was evacuated, making them among the last to leave. As they entered the lobby, McGovern said he felt a surge of anger as looked to his left to see the attackers trying to break the glass. “These people were breaking things, in this historic building. What the hell is wrong with you people?” he recalled thinking. “What I was really thinking was I wanted to turn and give them the middle finger and utter something that I don’t want to repeat here.” The look in their eyes was what he said stayed with him. “They seemed, like, manic, or it was like they were almost possessed in terms of just this anger. If looks could say, ‘I hate you,’ that’s the way I felt they looked at me,” he said. Gallego said he had a personal reason as well for wanting to do all he could to save his fellow members. He said he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from combat. “One of the things I’ve always regretted, from my time in the war, were when I think [about] things I should have done that could have had better outcomes. I always carry that weight with me,” he said. He then paused as his eyes began to well up. “So that day, I just knew that whatever I was going to do, I was not going to carry regrets again like that,” he said. Allred said as he left the floor he saw a staffer grabbing the decorative inkwells on the speaker’s podium and another taking the ceremonial House mace, the two oldest objects in the House. The inkwells date from 1819 and the mace from 1841, replacing the one the British burned in 1814. “It was like something out of the French Revolution or something, grabbing these kind of priceless heirlooms of our democracy and trying to preserve them from the mob.” According to the report by the congressional committee that investigated Jan. 6, the House leaders had been removed at about 2:25 p.m., a little over an hour after the session had started. The floor had been evacuated by 2:38 p.m. and the members in the gallery, who had to wait longer to get out, were gone by 3 p.m. The lawmakers and staff and even some reporters were led through the Capitol grounds’ network of tunnels to a safe room in one of the three House office buildings. But that room had big windows, and members complained it didn’t feel very safe, so they were quickly relocated to a large room in another building. But they weren’t out of the woods. There were still fears of attackers in the office buildings as well, and members worried their hiding place might be discovered. While there was broad, bipartisan support for going back into session to finish the electoral vote counting as quickly as possible, there was also talk of simply continuing the count in the room, Jacobs and Gallego said. Gallego wasn’t sure they should have even left the House floor. “We should have not shown we had fear and stayed there and continued to vote,” he said. But as time passed with no signs of danger, lawmakers began to settle in. Many members took to their phones to call friends and loved ones to let them know they were all right, even if they weren’t sure they could say that. “I thought that being taken hostage would have been the best-case scenario. I didn’t share that with my family at the time, of course,” Phillips said. By the time the building and grounds had been cleared by police pushing the attackers back, a job finished around 6 p.m., the stress had begun to wear. Kuster said she turned around to notice a Republican lawmaker next to her was not wearing a COVID mask. She offered him one from her stock of extras in her purse. “There’s a lot of people in this room, you shouldn’t be without a mask,” she told him. “And he just looked at me. He declined and he said to me, ‘I can’t breathe.’” “And I thought, ‘I can’t believe you just used those words,’” she said. The phrase had been a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement that reemerged in the summer of 2020, and which many Republicans had rejected. When lawmakers returned to the chamber at 8 p.m. after about five hours away, it was a mess. The windows of the doors had been broken and glass was strewn everywhere. One member said a faint smell of tear gas could still be made out. Democrats had assumed that because there was near-unanimity on returning to the floor as soon as possible and finishing the count, Republicans would also give up on their state-specific vote challenges. When that turned out not to be the case and objectors spoke up to dispute Pennsylvania’s results, tempers flared. “People who I know and who I knew were frightened for their lives when we were in the secure location got up and made an objection. I think 140-some odd voted to object, and that was shocking to us. That was hard to take,” Kuster said. At 3:32 a.m., the final objections had been dealt with and Biden was officially declared the 2020 winner. Jacobs, who returned to the chamber because “I didn’t want it to become this big scary place I was afraid to go to,” said she had expected more fanfare. “I’ll be honest, it was a bit anticlimactic,” she said. With three years’ hindsight, some of the takeaways in the interviews sound startlingly prescient, from lingering feelings of betrayal to uncertainty about what would be the impact of the attack. “I’m still pissed at a lot of them,” McGovern said of his Republican colleagues. “All these weeks later, I really have a hard time looking at them. I mean, I don’t want to get into an elevator with them. I’m afraid I will say something that I will regret.” Jacobs said her past in international affairs showed her the importance of there being consequences for attacks like Jan. 6. “Having worked in a lot of countries that have been torn apart by violence, how your political leaders act in the wake of that violence is one of the most important things,” she said. She added it was important Trump had been impeached — even though he was not ultimately convicted — for his actions in allegedly inciting the attack. The next four years will change America forever.

But as mounting costs and the cancellation of its landmark first power plant have burned through shrinking cash reserves, the Oregon-based company is laying off nearly a third of its workforce. At a virtual all-hands meeting Friday afternoon, the company announced the job cuts to remaining employees. HuffPost reviewed the audio of the meeting. Two sources with direct knowledge of NuScale’s plans confirmed the details of the layoffs. By Friday evening, NuScale’s stock price had plunged more than 8% as investors sold off shares. NuScale did not respond to a call, an email or a text message seeking comment. In a press release issued Monday, the company confirmed it had laid off 154 individual employees, or 28% of its full-time staff. Sources told HuffPost on Friday the cuts affected as much as 40% of the total workforce. The spokesperson who sent HuffPost the announcement Monday morning did not respond to an email asking how many part-time workers and contractors the firm has let go. Surging construction costs are imperiling clean energy across the country. In just the past two months, developers have pulled the plug on major offshore wind farms in New Jersey and New York after state officials refused to let companies rebid for contracts at a higher rate. But the financial headwinds are taking an especially acute toll on nuclear power. It takes more than a decade to build a reactor, and the only new ones under construction in the U.S. and Europe went billions of dollars over budget in the past two decades. Many in the atomic energy industry are betting that small modular reactors ― shrunken down, lower-power units with a uniform design ― can make it cheaper and easier to build new nuclear plants through assembly-line repetition. The U.S. government is banking on that strategy to meet its climate goals. The Biden administration spearheaded a pledge to triple atomic energy production worldwide in the next three decades at the United Nations’ climate summit in Dubai last month, enlisting dozens of partner nations in Europe, Asia and Africa. The two infrastructure-spending laws that President Joe Biden signed in recent years earmark billions in spending to develop new reactors and keep existing plants open. And new bills in Congress to speed up U.S. nuclear deployments and sell more American reactors abroad are virtually all bipartisan, with progressives and right-wing Republicans alike expressing support for atomic energy. But the U.S. trails rivals like China and Russia in deploying new types of reactors, including those based on technologies that scientists working for the federal government first developed. Until November, NuScale appeared on track to debut the nation’s first atomic energy station powered with small modular reactors. But the project to build a dozen reactors in the Idaho desert, and sell the electricity to ratepayers across the Western U.S. through a Utah state-owned utility, was abandoned as rising interest rates made it harder for NuScale to woo investors willing to bet on something as risky a first-of-its-kind nuclear plant. The cancellation of the so-called Carbon Free Power Project “was a surprise to pretty much everyone,” a former NuScale engineer, who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating future employers, said after losing his job. The company had become far less transparent since its stock market debut, the former employee said, noting that the press release announcing the power plant’s cancellation claimed that NuScale and its partners “mutually” decided to call it quits. “As much as NuScale might publicly say it was a mutual decision,” the employee said, “I bet they’d say laying us off was a mutual decision to part ways, too.” In 2022, NuScale went public via a SPAC deal, a type of merger that became a popular way for debt-laden startups to pay back venture capitalists with a swifter-than-usual initial public offering on the stock market. In its latest quarterly earnings, NuScale reported just under $200 million in cash reserves, nearly 40% of which was tied up in restricted accounts. On a call with analysts in November, Ramsey Hamady, NuScale’s chief financial officer, said the firm expected to “take in about $50 million worth of cash from customers from work that we do.” But the firm spent more than that in the previous three-month cycle ― a function, the executive said, of how project costs fluctuate regularly. “This isn’t just a fixed-expense business. There’s variable expense, and there’s a lot of discretionary spending,” Hamady said. “We spend more as we have contracts, and we pull in our spending as contracts either get pushed out or delayed or whether we want to focus more on discretionary spend or nondiscretionary spend.” While severance payments would add roughly $3 million in this quarter’s operating losses, the company said Monday the job cuts would save up to $60 million.

Kaufman at alexander.kaufman@huffpost.com, or text him securely on the encrypted messaging app Signal at +1 631-455-8855. NuScale, which has four other projects proposed in the U.S. and tentative deals in at least eight other countries, isn’t the only nuclear startup navigating choppy waters. In October, Maryland-based X-energy, which is working with the federal government to develop a next-generation reactor using gas instead of water for cooling, cut part of its workforce and scrapped plans to go public. In September, California-based Oklo appeared to lose a more than $100 million contract to build its its liquid-metal-cooled “micro-reactors” at an Air Force base in Alaska, as the independent Northern Journal newsletter first reported. But the Defense Department said in a statement that the deal was never finalized, and that the bureaucratic change that took place in the fall and appeared to revoke Oklo’s contract was a misunderstood procedural technicality. Oklo said it’s on track with plans to start selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Nor are the nuclear industry’s high-tech newcomers the only ones with issues. The U.S. utilities that operate the world’s largest fleet of traditional reactors balked last month at the Biden administration’s proposed regulations for making clean hydrogen fuel. Constellation, the country’s top nuclear operator, said the rules rendered existing reactors ineligible for a lucrative tax credit for making hydrogen with carbon-free electricity, and threatened to sue the administration. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago triggered an energy shock as European democracies scrambled to find alternatives to buying natural gas from Moscow. The constant need to replenish pipelines using a fuel with a wildly fluctuating price put a new premium on nuclear energy’s steady 24-hour output without needing refueling for two years or more. To boot, nuclear reactors don’t produce planet-heating emissions, and they generate orders of magnitude more electricity, more frequently and on less land, than solar panels or wind turbines. Yet as the U.S. and its allies sanctioned the oil and gas exports funding Russia’s war chest, the Kremlin’s state-owned nuclear company, Rosatom, has remained immune, since American and European reactors depend on fuel that it enriches. Russia is building most of the new reactors in the works in places like Bangladesh, Egypt and Turkey, and just signed a new deal for more in India. China, meanwhile, is constructing more reactors at home than nearly all the world combined, and built four large-scale reactors using the leading new American design before the U.S. could complete its first. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

In December, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to ban Russian uranium imports. While it’s unlikely to become law, the U.S. last year finally took the first step toward supplying its own nuclear fuel again. At an industrial site in Ohio this past autumn, the private company that succeeded what was once the U.S. government’s in-house nuclear fuel enricher began producing the American-made alternative to a special kind of uranium fuel that companies like Oklo need. In just the last few months, three new uranium mines have entered into production in Arizona and Utah. There’s a clear demand. The price of uranium eclipsed $91 per pound this week for the first time since the 2011 Fukushima disaster."

Trump stood trial in 2023 on civil charges that he, his sons Donald Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump and two other associates engaged in decades of financial fraud by inflating his net worth to obtain more favorable loans to operate in the real estate industry. New York Judge Arthur Engoron ruled on Sept. 26 that Trump had committed fraud before the trial began. Closing arguments in the trial are set to be held on Jan. 11. The brief filed by James lays out the punishment she is seeking for Trump, his sons and their associates once the trial is over. Trump should be permanently barred from working in the state of New York’s real estate industry, while his sons should face five-year bans on “participating in the real estate industry in New York State or serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or other legal entity,” according to the brief. In addition, Trump and his corporate entities should face a disgorgement of $370 million to recoup the money he saved in interest payments thanks to his fraudulent activity. Previously, James had recommended the court fine Trump at least $250 million. Trump is estimated to be worth $3.1 billion, according to Bloomberg. The recommendation of a $370 million disgorgement comes from an estimate that Trump saved $168 million in interest payments by committing fraud in his application for a loan to purchase 40 Wall Street, $139 million in profits for selling the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., $60 million in profits from the sale of the Ferry Point golf club and $2.5 million in bonuses paid to accomplices. A ban on participating in the New York real estate industry would be extremely damaging to Trump’s business empire. The court could also strip Trump of four of his signature properties in New York City, including Trump Tower, which would significantly lower his net worth. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

The renowned Palestinian professor, activist and poet was killed along with his family just a month later in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza. Alareer was one of more than 22,000 Palestinians who have been killed by Israeli forces since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel, when militants killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages. The violence toward both civilians and combatants rages on, with far more dire repercussions for the Palestinians. Those who remain in Gaza face agonizing existences. The Israeli government has blocked resources entering the region, resulting in starvation. They’ve also imposed communications blackouts and forcibly displaced 90% of Palestinians from their homes. Horrifying evidence of war crimes has emerged in recent months. Journalists and storytellers on the ground in Gaza, such as Bisan Owda and Motaz Azaiza, have been using social media to document these atrocities for the world to see. As news spreads, allies outside the Palestinian territories have been expressing their solidarity as well. “For Refaat, we must be louder than ever and make sure the focus returns to what is actually happening in real time to those on the ground,” Canadian poet Rupi Kaur wrote in a tribute to Alareer on Instagram. “Because theirs are the lives we can still save.” Kaur, whose family is from the Punjab state of India, is one of several South Asian artists using their platforms to raise awareness. Other South Asians, including poets, writers, comedians and painters, have called for a permanent end to the violence, setting up fundraisers toward humanitarian efforts and more. Their voices and work are more important than ever, especially in encouraging others in the community to speak up, since many remain hesitant to “choose a side.” There are myriad reasons behind this. Some are cultural, like fear of career repercussions, pressures of the model minority myth and internalized Islamophobia. But regardless of the reasoning, it’s critical for South Asians globally to dismantle biases that prevent us from speaking up. The silence makes us complicit. Artists have always been at the forefront of social and political issues, centering liberation and creating spaces for audiences to engage with them. As it becomes more vital to recognize Palestinians’ decades-long resistance to oppression, these South Asian artists are using their crafts — in addition to boycotting, calling representatives, engaging in protests and more — to help us process it. These writers, visual artists and literary virtuosos are masters of blending culture and activism, and they exemplify just how art is a reflection of our humanity. Whether you’re into Kaur and her poetry or not, there’s no denying that the 31-year-old’s work has always focused on the resilience of humanity. And she continues to embed that ethos in her advocacy. During the last few months, she has been writing poems, sharing updates and imploring her 4.6 million Instagram followers to take action. Perhaps most notably, she shared that she declined an invitation to the White House’s annual Diwali party days after the House of Representatives passed a resolution to fund $14.5 billion in military aid to Israel. “When a government’s actions dehumanize people anywhere, it is our moral imperative to call for Justice,” she wrote. “Demand a humanitarian ceasefire. Sign petitions. Attend protests. Boycott. Call your reps and say — stop the genocide.” No Nazar’s mission to unite communities and cultures through music might seem simple, but the DJ collective wields an unmatched artistry that expands its listeners’ worldviews sonically. It meshes South Asian sounds with genres from Afrobeats to baile funk. For Bianca Maieli, 34, and Omar Ahmed, 29, the troupe’s co-founders, it was crucial to use their music and platform to show solidarity with Palestinians. The group hosted two fundraiser DJ sets in November, one in Los Angeles and one in New York City, spotlighting a roster of Palestinian music and sounds. Part of the proceeds from the shows went to Palestine Legal, a nonprofit that protects those in the U.S. who have been targeted for speaking out for the Palestinians. The decision to host the events wasn’t easy. They grappled with the idea of hosting events while a humanitarian crisis looms. “It was challenging to follow through hosting the show because of all the emotions I was feeling — rage, sadness, guilt,” Ahmed said. “The question of ‘Why are we doing this?’ kept coming up in my head.” After conversations, they decided to go through with it, with the intention of creating a physical space for people to engage with the cause and connect with others who share their feelings. “Dance and music are linked so much to protest and politics,” Maieli said. “So we wanted to approach it from that lens in the most respectful way possible while using our artistry to hopefully make a change, if not bring awareness or uplift the community.” “People don’t realize that their single voice, combined with a billion other single voices, make up a massive collective consciousness,” Ahmed said. Everything about visual artist Babneet Paul Lakhesar, 30, is unapologetic: her work, bold and bright portraits of femininity, and her advocacy, firmly rooted in her belief in humanity. Embracing solidarity with Palestinians, then, was instinctive. As a Punjabi Sikh, Lakhesar, also known as Babbu the Painter, understood the pains and plights of Palestinians, with generations of her family and community afflicted by both the India and Pakistan Partition violence and the 1984 Sikh genocide. The artist released a #FreePalestine art series: vases patterned with the black-and-white keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian solidarity, as well as prints and stickers depicting a young girl wearing a keffiyeh with fireworks in her eyes. “The whole idea behind the painting was there’s a young woman who’s looking up, and the sky is not going to be bombed one day,” Lakhesar said. Lakhesar isn’t concerned about how her audience responds to her activism and work. “I am on a path where I want to be authentic to who I am,” she says. “And if that does not resonate with you, then maybe I’m not the artist that you’re looking for.” You may have seen Abby Govindan, 26, going viral on X (formerly Twitter) every other day for her very real and hilarious observations on the world. True to her signature honesty and outspokenness, the comedian has been vocal about her support for Palestinians over the years. Govindan says she personally chooses to not make jokes about Israel or the Palestinians because she doesn’t have the lived experience. But she’s a firm believer that “the onus should be on the rest of us to show the oppressors that we outnumber them.” In October, Govindan hosted a sold-out fundraiser comedy event in New York City with fellow comedian Mohanad Elshieky. Part of the proceeds went to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which provides medical and humanitarian aid to children in the Palestinian territories and in the Middle East at large. “People in NYC are so hungry for a political safe space where we can commiserate (and even make jokes about!) our desire for a Free Palestine far away from the islamophobia and anti-semitism that is so rife in many many other comedy spaces,” she wrote on Instagram. Govindan says she’s lost brand deals and followers because of her stance, but that if it means upholding her belief system and demanding a foundational level of humanity and empathy for the oppressed, it’s worth it. “I would much rather be on the right side of history than staying silent out of fear of alienating anyone,” she said. For Batool, who asked not to be identified by her full name in this story, protesting the treatment of Palestinians was no question. From a young age, the creative writer and poet has been instilled with a passion for bettering humanity, through her faith and identity as an American Pakistani Shia Muslim and through her family. Her father leads a nonprofit that provides humanitarian aid and health care across the globe. “It is important to me to stand up for those who are facing injustices because my poetry is rooted in my identities,” she said. “My religion and my culture provide me with the toolbox; poetry, to speak up and teach me the necessity to advocate and protest.” Writing is both how Batool processes the harrowing images coming from Gaza and how she calls for an end to the violence. She also looks to Palestinian poets and essayists — Alareer, Mosab Abu Toha, Hiba Abu Nada, Hala Alyan and others — to rekindle her advocacy for Palestinians. “I am protesting because it is the right thing to do, because I am human, because there is no other option,” the writer said. “Humanity exists in each heart that beats for change, in each cry that echoes the calls for a cease-fire and a permanent, peaceful solution.” The worlds that Hazem Asif, 30, illustrates are fantastical and retro — and those qualities are what makes him a powerful artist and activist. His work acknowledges solemn political and social realities while visualizing a vibrant optimism for a just future. On Palestine, his work dreams of its liberation. “With my artworks, I hope to express my voice and frustrations towards the silent dominant world powers and oppressors,” he said. “I perceive art not just to craft beauty but as a peace-driven instrument capable of sparking change, inspiring and educating the new generation to advocate for what is just.” Asif’s influence is global; his illustrations have been used on protest posters and shared widely across social media. He has also collaborated with Palestinian American apparel brand Paliroots, with proceeds going toward humanitarian aid in Gaza.

It’s not an interpretation. It’s not one side of a debate. It is an unequivocal, demonstrable fact.” Mattingly called out a recent Associated Press article contrasting how the insurrection is described by President Joe Biden and predecessor Donald Trump, whose followers overran the Capitol. “One attack, two interpretations: Biden and Trump both make the Jan. 6 riot a political rallying cry,” read the story’s headline. “There aren’t, in fact, two interpretations,” Mattingly said. “There is what happened, and then there are lies.” To illustrate his point, the CNN anchor played clips of Republican lawmakers describing the Jan. 6 attack “in their own words, on or shortly after that day.” For example, now-former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had detailed how rioters overwhelmed law enforcement at the Capitol. “They scaled walls,” McCarthy, then the House minority leader, said in an audio recording. “They brought ropes. They were scaling the scaffolding. They overtook the place.” “That was Kevin McCarthy a week after the attack,” Mattingly said. “He’s currently unemployed, but he was once the House speaker and did more than any other Republican to halt the party’s break from Trump after Jan. 6.” Tomorrow will mark 3 years since the assault on the U.S. Capitol – but there are many who still deny the reality of the violence that unfolded that day. @Phil_Mattingly breaks down the truth about January 6th. pic.twitter.com/onbKKEH3VH A separate clip showed Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) in February 2021, insisting, “You’re not going to get anything but condemnation from me for what happened with those criminals at the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Mattingly also read aloud a text message that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) had sent during the assault. “I was just told there’s an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol,” she wrote to Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff at the time. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she added. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” McCarthy, Hawley and Greene have since endorsed Trump’s 2024 bid for the White House. But, as Mattingly noted, what they had each described “was the reality of that day.” In the years following the riot, Republicans have sought to downplay and whitewash the violence carried out by the mob seeking to overturn the 2020 results. Trump, the leading candidate in the GOP presidential race, faces a federal indictment in connection to his attempted coup, as well as three other criminal cases. He has pleaded not guilty.

Among Americans identifying as Republican, the number who believe that Biden’s election victory was legitimate has fallen since 2021, according to a poll released this week. It also found that fewer Republicans believe Jan. 6 was “mostly violent” and that fewer think Trump bears responsibility for the attack. The Washington Post-University of Maryland poll further revealed that a quarter of Americans believe the FBI instigated the riot — a conspiracy theory that some prominent Republican lawmakers have also embraced.

But LaPierre’s departure also lines up with a civil trial against him and other NRA insiders named in a lawsuit by New York State Attorney General Letitia James. Jury selection has already begun in the trial, which is expected to begin Monday. James has accused LaPierre and other current and former NRA executives of misusing millions of dollars in donations to the nonprofit organization in a 2020 lawsuit that seeks to dissolve the group. LaPierre has denied wrongdoing. On Friday, James called LaPierre’s resignation “an important victory in our case” and said it “validates our claims against him.” “All charities in New York state must adhere to the rule of law, and my office will not tolerate gross mismanagement or top executives funneling millions into their own pockets. Our case will move ahead, and we look forward to proving the facts in court,” she said in a statement. The NRA acknowledged the start of the civil trial next week in its statement on LaPierre’s resignation while arguing that its board of directors has taken steps to right internal wrongs. The board “has undertaken significant efforts to perform a self-evaluation, recommended termination of disgraced ‘insiders’ and vendors who allegedly abused the Association, and accepted reimbursement, with interest, for alleged excess benefit transactions from LaPierre, as reported in public tax filings,” the NRA said, while also thanking LaPierre for his leadership.

The organization’s membership and donations have significantly dropped in recent years as allegations of internal mismanagement and corruption emerged and gun violence surged across the nation. The group attempted to file for bankruptcy in 2021, but the request was dismissed by a federal judge in Texas who ruled that the organization was trying to use bankruptcy to evade James’ lawsuit in New York. The NRA’s attorneys said it was trying to incorporate in Texas and avoid a political attack by James, who is a Democrat.

The uncanny resemblance between Vida and her mother, supermodel Camila Alves, came to wide attention Thursday, when McConaughey shared two rare photos on Instagram to celebrate the teenager’s birthday, leaving social media users both dazed and confused. “To Vida, who never passed a flower she didn’t pick, Happy Birthday,” McConaughey wrote in the caption, noting that Vida’s actual birthday was Wednesday. “A day late because my mobile device flew out of my pocket on the roller coaster loop at her birthday yesterday!” The photos show Vida in a field of tall grass under an overcast sky, and elsewhere gazing off at a backlit mountain on the horizon. The post has garnered more than 130,000 likes. While McConaughey was focused on the teen’s birthday, fans’ minds were elsewhere entirely. “God does she look like her mama,” wrote one person on Instagram. “Camilla’s mini me,” noted another. “Her mom’s twin,” someone else agreed. “‘Vida’ is Portuguese for ‘life’ and that’s what God gave us this morning,” McConaughey reportedly wrote on his now-defunct blog after his daughter was born in 2010. “Camila’s recovering wonderfully and we are both truly honored to welcome this little lady into our family.” Alves, who has graced the covers of publications like Men’s Vogue, Ocean Drive and People, reportedly met McConaughey at a Los Angeles bar in 2006.

The state’s Division of Elections reported that the petition to put abortion on the ballot has received 911,029 verified signatures, as of Friday morning. The state requires 891,523 signatures for an amendment — a big hurdle in Florida, which has seen some of the most high-profile abortion battles since the Supreme Court repealed federal protections in 2022. The amendment seeks to guarantee access to abortion care up to fetal viability, which is usually around 24 weeks. Although hitting the threshold is a big milestone, the state Supreme Court ― known to lean conservative ― still has to sign off on the wording of the proposed ballot initiative. “No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider,” the amendment states. As of now, the amendment clarifies that it would not change the state’s current law that requires parental consent for a minor to obtain an abortion. Abortion rights advocates celebrated the win on Friday, knowing it’s a critical step in a highly contentious abortion battle that’s been ongoing in the state. “The fact that we only launched our campaign only eight months ago and we’ve already reached our petition goal speaks to the unprecedented support and momentum there is to get politicians out of our private lives and health care decisions,” Lauren Brenzel, campaign director of Floridians Protecting Freedom, said during a Friday afternoon press conference. Floridians Protecting Freedom is a coalition of statewide organizations, including Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and Women’s Voices of Southwest Florida, that’s sponsoring the amendment. “Most initiative campaigns never make it this far,” Brenzel added. “The ones that do usually spend far more or take much longer to qualify, which is why we’re so confident that voters will approve our amendment once they’re given a chance to vote.” The Florida Supreme Court has scheduled a Feb. 7 hearing on the ballot proposal. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody and other anti-choice advocates are fighting the initiative, claiming that the amendment is misleading — a tactic used by Republicans in several other states that have since passed pro-choice ballot initiatives. Moody has filed briefs arguing that the term “viability” is ambiguous. Helene Barthelemay, an attorney defending the petition in the upcoming arguments before the Florida Supreme Court, refuted that the term is ambiguous, pointing out that the proposed amendment uses the same definition of viability as the state of Florida and the federal government. “It’s clear to us that the attorney general’s position is a disingenuous argument by a politician desperate to block Floridians from voting on this amendment,” Barthelemay told reporters on Friday. “It’s ironic because the reason this amendment has such strong support is precisely because Floridians don’t want this kind of political interference in their private lives and their personal decisions.” “The truth is voters know what viability means and they will see right through this effort to silence their voice and vote to approve this amendment in November.” Florida currently has a 15-week abortion ban in effect, which was championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), an extreme abortion opponent. DeSantis, who is also in the running to be the Republican presidential candidate, signed a six-week abortion ban into law last year, but it will not go into effect until the state Supreme Court rules on a challenge to the current 15-week restriction.

Pro-choice amendments have won out in every state where abortion was on the ballot since 2022, including in red and purple states like Kentucky and Ohio. “Signatures came from everyone and everywhere, proving once again this is not a Republican or Democratic issue — it’s about freedom, healthcare, and safety,” state Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book tweeted on Friday. “No woman and no doctor should fear imprisonment over abortion care.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for what organizers claimed would be a small book signing abruptly canceled it Thursday after learning the gathering was actually meant to commemorate the third anniversary of the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Westgate Resorts’ Kissimmee, Florida, location said the Osceola Republican Party made no mention of Jan. 6 when they pitched the event, instead describing it as a book signing for Greene’s memoir. “Please be advised that Westgate was not made aware of the purpose of this event when we were approached to host a book signing,” the resort said in a statement. “This event has been cancelled and is no longer taking place at our resort.” Despite the cancellation, the Osceola County Republican Party was still selling tickets to the event as of Friday morning. The tiered tickets range in price from $45 to $1,000, with “Super VIPs” at the highest level receiving “a special private briefing on J6 and DC in a closed-door session.” Osceola County Republican Party chair Mark Cross told The Hill Friday he was unaware Westgate had dropped them. Cross said he believed Democrats were ultimately to blame for “calling people and lying about the purpose of the event.” Asked by NBC News about the cancellation during a campaign event for former President Donald Trump in Iowa, Greene called the question “stupid” and told the outlet, “I really don’t understand the point of your question.

In fact, the Roborock Q5 was just named Wirecutter’s top robot vacuum of 2024; testers noted its competitor-besting suction abilities, easy customization options, quiet performance and impressive laser-assisted organized navigation. “The Q5 cleaned better than any other smart robot at its price,” Wirecutter’s testers reported. What more could you even want, besides a discount? Right now, the Q5 is 40% off at both Amazon and Walmart, making it a truly great time to buy. And for an additional $140, you can grab the also-on-sale upgrade Q5+ model that comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold up to seven weeks’ worth of debris. I have the predecessor model of this vacuum, and there’s truly nothing I don’t love about it: Roborock’s multi-level mapping is great, the app is so intuitive and easy to use, and there’s truly nothing better than sitting on the couch and telling your vacuum to go clean your bedroom (and that’s all you have to do). You can even circle a specific spot on the map to quickly clean up spills, watch your vacuum on the map as it goes to work, or tell it to avoid certain areas during a given cleaning. The Q5 can last up to 180 minutes on a single charge, and like any robot vacuum worth its salt, will dock to recharge if necessary before resuming whatever job you’ve given it to do. Check out some promising reviews from Amazon and Walmart, and grab one for yourself while you can save up to $300. “I reviewed 30 Robotic Vacuum in three different product reviews. Roborock Q5 Robotic Vacuum was in the top. I purchased the Roborock Q5, which is their basic model, and I was not disappointed. This is a must have Robotic Vacuum for all baby boomers including myself at 70 years old. The robot maps off the area and cleans within the perimeters not missing a thing. It captures dog hair and dust like no one‘s business. I cannot tell you how wonderful it really is. A must have!” — Martha at Walmart “After researching various similar vacuums I settled on the Q5. We dint have pets or excessive dirt so it gives us great bang for the buck. We’ve never had a robotic vacuum before and TOTALLY LOVE this thing. It creates an incredibly detailed map that easy to edit and break down into specific areas. The app is easy to use and it’s fun to watch it clean every inch that it can access. And it learns to be more efficient. You can create maps for multiple floors and just plop it onto a new floor and it’ll clean it all and go back to the starting point. You can watch it track around the map and see everywhere it cleaned. So impressed we bought a second one because our upstairs is split by a single step. So each Q5 will cover 2 different floors. You can run it remotely and have it kick in while you’re not even home. Set a schedule or vacuum on demand. Either full cleans or selected rooms. It’s so satisfying to watch a move while the little guy is doing his thing upstairs. Even under the beds and chairs where you never vacuum yourself. Oh, and it moves from hardwood to carpet nicely but to do have to remove loose cords and loose small mats otherwise it can get bound up. For $260 it’s a no-brainer. I just hope that we get good life out of it but we’ll have to see how that goes. This will definitely help your marriage and how can you put a price on that?!” — CMG at Amazon “The features this vacuum cleaner has for the price can’t be beat. We love it. App is super easy to use. Charges quickly. Large dust bin. Deep cleans and has several settings for that. Nice vacuum lines on the carpet and uses Lidar lasers for accurate cleaning. Couldn’t be more happy.” — Tomter at Walmart By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Colorado’s Supreme Court ruled last month that Trump could not legally appear on state primary ballots due to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Trump appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this week. At least four of the nine justices must agree for the case to be added to the court’s docket. The group of voters who sued to keep Trump off the ballot also asked the high court to weigh in, as did the Colorado Republican Party. Led by Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), the ranking member of the House judiciary committee’s subcommittee on the federal courts, the House lawmakers reminded Thomas about the Supreme Court’s new code of conduct, which was agreed upon by the justices amid public pressure to assure their impartiality — in large part due to a string of alarming reports about Thomas’ own conduct. The two-month-old code specifically states that justices should disqualify themselves in situations where their spouse has “a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding.” Thomas’ wife, conservative activist Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, has campaigned fervently to keep Trump in office by pushing disproven claims about election fraud. Her for-profit consultancy firm “is clearly aligned with Mr. Trump’s interests,” the House Democrats wrote. Ginni Thomas even helped plan and attended Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, rally before the crowd turned their sights on the U.S. Capitol. It was this violent event that the Colorado Supreme Court deemed an insurrection, disqualifying Trump from appearing on the ballot. “It is unthinkable that you could be impartial in deciding whether an event your wife personally organized qualifies as an ‘insurrection’ that would prevent someone from holding the office of President,” the lawmakers wrote Thursday. “You have a financial stake in the outcome of this case, which disqualifies you from any involvement in it,” they told Thomas. Last month, congressional Democrats similarly urged the justice to recuse himself from decisions involving Trump’s claim of immunity from federal prosecution.

The Supreme Court denied a request from federal prosecutors to settle Trump’s immunity argument extra quickly, but the order did not attach names to the decision. On social media, Johnson got right to the point. “I’ll say it once again,” he wrote on the platform formerly known as Twitter. “If SCOTUS wants to show the American people that it’s two-month-old Code of Conduct is worth more than the paper it is written on, Thomas must do the honorable thing and RECUSE himself ― immunity & ballot cases.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-bidens-attention-deficit_n_65981ff9e4b0912833afd144","2024-01-05","kevin robillard","Joe Biden’s Attention Deficit","Joe Biden has an attention problem. The president and his team have never aimed to dominate the news cycle in the style of his predecessor and likely 2024 challenger, Donald Trump. They’ve often been happy to take a policy win — taking Social Security cuts off the board in debt limit talks, for instance — over keeping a weapon in hand to hammer the GOP with. Other times, they’ve been happy to let an increasingly authoritarian and chaotic GOP alienate the electorate without interference. Biden generally avoids one-on-one interviews, which his team views as providing little upside but containing high risk for gaffes. As Biden opens the calendar year of his reelection, the downsides of this strategy may be coming into view: The president, who is essentially tied with Trump nationally and often trails the Republican in polls of key swing states, has left little to no impression with less-engaged voting blocs, including young people, voters who didn’t cast ballots in the 2022 midterm election and Black and Latino voters without a college degree — all groups which, at the moment, are giving Biden less support than they did four years ago. The result is a blank slate of a presidency, according to interviews with multiple Democratic strategists. Voters, they say, have minimal knowledge of Biden’s accomplishments and even less of a sense of his plans, hopes and aspirations for the country. Evan Roth Smith, a partner at the Democratic consulting firm Slingshot Strategies, noted Biden’s working-class “Scranton Joe” persona, built over five decades in politics, has essentially disappeared. “His entire persona has basically been whitewashed,” said Smith, who serves as the lead pollster for Blueprint, which aims to provide messaging advice to Democrats ahead of the 2024 election. “We have a tabula rasa president right now. He’s just being defined by whatever pops in the news cycle.” The latest iteration of The New York Times/Siena College poll, the preeminent driver of Democratic anxiety since its inception, sums up the issue quite well: Biden led by six percentage points among people who cast ballots in the 2022 midterms, but was losing among those who did not vote in the midterms by a whopping 22 percentage points. The result? Biden is winning among likely voters by a 47% to 45% margin, but trails among registered voters by a 46% to 44% margin. Those margins are obviously surmountable, and Trump remains just as unpopular with the electorate as Biden. But for Biden to win over more voters and cement his support, his campaign will need to actually get the electorate to pay attention to his popular-on-paper policy accomplishments on everything from gun control to climate change, which has so far eluded the White House and his political operation. The first element of Biden’s plan will begin on Friday and Monday, when he will deliver a pair of speeches aimed at raising the stakes of the election. His speech in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, on Friday will focus on President Donald Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, and one on Monday at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Columbia, South Carolina, the site of a 2015 mass shooting committed by a white supremacist. “This election will determine the future of American democracy and every American’s fundamental freedoms,” Michael Tyler, the campaign’s communications director, said on a call with reporters earlier this week. Another official, deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks, added: “By the time voters are thinking about the election more, our campaign will be in full swing.” The campaign is already spending tens of millions of dollars on television ads they hope will at least provide insights into how to reach these voters, who live in an ultra-fragmented media environment where they can avoid most political messaging — and usually don’t believe the political messages that do make it through. “The voters who haven’t tuned in yet are more tuned out than anyone in this conversation can possibly conceive of. Politics does not enter their list of interests at all,” a senior Biden campaign official, who requested anonymity to speak frankly about campaign strategy, told HuffPost. “They are super not paying attention yet.” The campaign’s plan for reaching these often unreachable voters is being tested now in Arizona and Wisconsin, where they are running relational organizing pilots built around giving volunteers the ability to persuade their friends and family to back Biden and turn out to vote. The Arizona project is focused on Latino voters, while the Wisconsin operation is focused on young people and Black voters. It’s clear those volunteers will have a lot of work to do — and potentially a lot to work with. In late 2023, two groups on the opposite ends of the Democratic Party’s ideological divides — the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Blueprint, which is backed by centrist megadonor Reid Hoffman — released polling showing essentially the same thing: Voters know very little about many of Biden’s most theoretically popular accomplishments. For instance, Biden’s fight against so-called “junk fees” attached to airline and concert tickets, checking accounts and hotel reservations is extremely popular with a cost-conscious public, with PCCC finding 85% of likely 2024 voters support his push to ban or limit them. But only 16% of likely voters had “heard a lot from President Biden” on the issue. Similar gaps existed on lowering the cost of insulin, giving Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices and even on high-profile Biden victories like the bipartisan infrastructure package. Of course, the groups took their recommendations in different directions: Blueprint encouraged Biden to brush aside intra-party politics and embrace policy achievements that would alienate many liberals: increasing oil production to all-time highs and cracking down on undocumented immigrants attempting to claim asylum after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. PCCC, on the other hand, was trying to find a message the entire party could jointly deliver, and recommended a message focused on increasing taxes on the wealthy and protecting or expanding Social Security. Still, Democrats and the Biden campaign can’t simply assume voters will naturally learn only the most popular things Biden has done — after all, the Trump campaign will soon be spending millions attacking Biden rather than former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. And to blame the deficit entirely on a lack of attention paid by voters is perhaps too flattering to both liberal sensibilities and the Biden administration’s accomplishments.

In Blueprint’s polling, Smith noted there was little evidence voters who paid more attention to politics were actually more impressed with what Biden has done than other voters. “There is no other shoe to fall,” he said. “There’s no evidence less partisan voters, once they read up on the guy and engage in the election, are going to instantly improve things for the president.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The committees will meet on Wednesday to consider a report recommending a contempt of Congress resolution against President Joe Biden’s son, lawmakers said Friday. “Hunter Biden blatantly defied two lawful subpoenas when he did not appear for his December deposition,” the judiciary committee said in a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter. “The President’s son doesn’t get special treatment,” said House oversight chair James Comer (R-Ky.) in a separate online posting. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the ranking member of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, said the committees’ actions against a private citizen, who has agreed to testify, are unwarranted and without precedent. Biden “has offered to testify in public, under oath, and on a day of the Committee’s choosing,” Raskin said in a statement that dismissed the Republicans’ inquiry as lacking credibility. “Chairman Comer does not want Hunter Biden to testify in public, just as he has refused to publicly release over a dozen interview transcripts, because he wants to keep up the carefully curated distortions, blatant lies, and laughable conspiracy theories that have marked this investigation,” Raskin said. “The facts and the evidence all show no wrongdoing and no impeachable offense by President Biden.” Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden’s attorney, also dismissed the investigation as a deceptive political game. “It’s clear the Republican Chairmen aren’t interested in getting the facts or they would allow Hunter to testify publicly,” Lowell said in a statement responding to Friday’s announcement. “House Republicans continue to play politics by seeking an unprecedented contempt motion against someone who has from the first request offered to answer all their proper questions. What are they afraid of?” Hunter Biden was called for questioning about his business dealings by House Republicans who have alleged ― without offering supporting evidence ― that his father benefited from his foreign business deals. He said he would answer lawmakers’ questions, but only if in a public hearing. “There is no fairness or decency in what these Republicans are doing. They have lied over and over about every aspect of my personal and professional life, so much so that their lies have become the false facts believed by too many people,” Hunter Biden said in public remarks last month. The investigation by the two committees, where Republicans hold majorities, is part of a longstanding GOP effort to impeach Joe Biden. The next four years will change America forever.

Worrell was convicted in May on charges of assault, civil disorder and obstruction of an official proceeding. On Thursday, he apologized to D.C. District Judge Royce Lamberth for his actions, while his defense attorney argued for leniency due to Worrell’s health issues. “Nearly three years ago today, I made some choices I sincerely regret,” Worrell told the judge, according to CBS News. “Please forgive me and have mercy on me.” Worrell, who was a member of the “Hurricane Coast” chapter of the Proud Boys in Florida, used a bottle of pepper spray on police officers during the riot, prosecutors said. He was arrested two months later. Following his conviction last year, Worrell was allowed to await his sentencing on house arrest after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He cut off his ankle monitor four days before his sentencing in August and went on the lam for six weeks. It was only when he tried to covertly return to his home in Naples the following month that he was caught by FBI agents who were staked outside, prosecutors said. Rather than surrendering quietly, authorities said, Worrell faked a drug overdose inside his home. Agents found him apparently unresponsive with an opioid prescription medication in his hand. He was taken to a hospital and received five days of medical care and 24-hour police surveillance before being released. “The entire time, Worrell knew he was fine,” prosecutors said in a memorandum filed last week, where they asked the court to increase the sentencing it had planned to impose. Before Worrell’s escape, prosecutors had asked the court to sentence him to 14 years. The next four years will change America forever.

Dunn was one of the few officers who testified before the House Jan. 6 select committee about the racist slurs he endured during the Jan. 6 attack. He released a book last year, “Standing My Ground,” detailing his experience, and has received both the Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Citizens Medal for serving during the insurrection. Dunn, 40, announced his candidacy in a video Friday, on the eve of the third anniversary of the Capitol riot. “On Jan. 6th, 2021, I did my duty as a police officer and as an American and defended our nation’s Capitol from violent insurrectionists,” he said in a statement. “Today, I’m running for Congress because the forces that spurred that violent attack are still at work and as a patriotic American, it is my duty to defend our democracy.” Dunn, who stepped down late last year as a Capitol police officer after 15 years, is running in the crowded primary to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes, whose district encompasses Howard County and parts of Anne Arundel and Carroll counties, all west of Baltimore. The winner of the primary is the favorite to clinch the heavily Democratic seat. The former officer’s announcement video features a reenactment of Jan. 6 with a MAGA flag in the background. Dunn said he’s running in political opposition to Trump to prevent another Jan. 6-like attack from ever happening. “We can’t ever let this happen again, and you’ve heard it from Trump himself: He is hellbent on finishing what he started this day,” Dunn says. “I believe every one of us has a role to play in this fight.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Alabama-born actor and singer rose to prominence on the Disney Channel more than a decade ago and has since continued his success streak in films like “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” and as a recording artist. Along the way, he’s found ways to highlight his love of musical theater both onstage and television. This winter, he’s delivering a dynamite performance in Broadway’s “Hadestown,” now playing at New York’s Walter Kerr Theatre. Written by Anaïs Mitchell, “Hadestown” is a musical reimagining of the Greek tragedy of Orpheus (played by Fisher) and Eurydice (Solea Pfeiffer). Their love story is intertwined with that of Hades (Phillip Boykin) and Persephone (Betty Who), the king and queen of the underworld. After Eurydice is lured into the underworld by Hades’ promises of safety and security, Orpheus sets out on a mission to rescue his beloved. But you won’t find any togas or laurel wreaths in “Hadestown,” which won eight Tony Awards after its 2019 Broadway premiere and remains a hot ticket. The show is staged in a steam-punk, fantastical version of New Orleans, while its score is a sweeping mix of jazz, blues and rock. As a self-professed “mythology nerd,” Fisher first became familiar with “Hadestown” by way of the musical’s 2010 concept album. Once he saw original cast member Reeve Carney portray Orpheus on Broadway, he knew it was “instantly something I wanted to be a part of.” And though his Broadway résumé includes “Hamilton” and “Dear Evan Hansen,” Fisher said “Hadestown” feels “unlike so much of the theater I know and love” in a number of critical ways. “I love Greek mythology, Norse mythology, and I read all of it that I can get my hands on,” Fisher told HuffPost in an interview. “I love the music, love the story, love the storytelling, love how it’s so honest right from the rip and leaves you with a hug. It’s the most complete storytelling experience I’ve had on a Broadway stage.” Catch a clip of Fisher performing “Wait For Me” from “Hadestown” below. As Orpheus, Fisher also plays guitar throughout much of the show — granting him a rare opportunity to infuse his performance with his well-honed skills as a pop-rock musician. “I got to know Orpheus by researching and listening and watching and reading, and taking elements of my own personal journey and incorporating them into [the role],” he said. “Being able to be in the band and play with the band — all of that was something that grabbed my heart. The musicians who are onstage with me aren’t really theater people. They’re touring, gigging musicians that love this craft from a different angle.” Prior to joining the “Hadestown” cast in late November, Fisher was at a personal and professional crossroads. Last spring, he starred as Anthony Hope in the Josh Groban-led revival of “Sweeney Todd,” becoming the first Black actor to play the role on Broadway. He exited the show after about three months due to a number of projects he had in the works, which were then halted by the Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes. He said he ended up using the unexpected downtime to get shoulder surgery. Behind the scenes, Fisher and his wife, Ellie, were navigating the challenges of first-time parenthood after relocating from Florida to New York early in 2023 with their 1-year-old son, Riley. “The moment Riley was born, everything else shrunk,” he explained. “The art changed, the creativity changed, perspective shifted. We had a lot of personal revelatory experiences that helped shape what we know we want as a family moving forward. My purpose is completely different. It’s fresh and new and exciting — and that is to love, to bring support, to take care of the family.” Last month, Fisher got the chance to meld his creative passion with his duties as a dad by following in the footsteps of stars like Neil Patrick Harris and Lin-Manuel Miranda as a narrator for Walt Disney World’s Candlelight Processional holiday event. “Neil said to me, ‘Jordan, this is what you have to do when you get married and have kids,’ so that, for years, has been my dream,” he said. “I’m a very proud Disney adult — I grew up loving the parks, loving everything that Disney brought to my childhood. It helped mold my imagination and love of the arts.” Festive excursions to the happiest place on Earth aside, Fisher is grateful to be putting down roots with his family in New York and expects live theater to become a bigger focus of his career moving forward.

Trump’s attorneys submitted a filing on Thursday arguing that Smith, the prosecutor overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case, has violated a stay order put in place by Judge Tanya Chutkan because he submitted pretrial filings during the ongoing pause. Chutkan put the case’s legal proceedings on hold last month while Trump pursues an appeals process on the assertion that he is immune from prosecution. “I think that this is a real sign of the lawyers not being able to say no to their client,” Weissmann told MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell on Thursday. “As somebody in the legal profession, it is disappointing.” Weissmann explained that the stay is in place largely to protect the defense, so Trump’s team doesn’t need to act until the appeal is resolved. He also suggested that Smith’s team was, if anything, being helpful by continuing to meet their deadlines, and noted that there’s no requirement for Trump’s team to look at the material. “They continued filing things and gave discovery to the defense. Usually that’s not something that the defense complains about. They want discovery,” he said. Trump’s team argued in the filing that Smith’s motions contain “partisan rhetoric” and prosecutors are trying to “weaponize the stay to spread political propaganda.” According to Weissmann, the idea that this issue would become the subject of a contempt motion says two things about Trump’s lawyers: “A, that they have no control over their client. B, they’re writing this for an audience unrelated to the court, meaning for sort of the MAGA base.” “And it’s really not how you litigate,” he added. Trump’s team have repeatedly leaned on performative antics and delay tactics in response to the four prosecutions against him, two of which he could quash if he wins his bid for a second presidency.

Friday’s report from the Labor Department showed that December’s job gain exceeded the 173,000 that were added in November. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7% — the 23rd straight month that joblessness has remained below 4%. The latest data reflect an economy and a job market that are decelerating back to pre-pandemic norms. Hiring remains steady, and while employers are posting fewer openings, they are not laying off many workers. Despite the low unemployment and cooling inflation, polls show that many Americans are dissatisfied with the economy. That disconnect, which will likely be an issue in the 2024 elections, has puzzled economists and political analysts. A key factor, though, is the public’s exasperation with higher prices. Though inflation has been falling more or less steadily for a year and a half, prices are still 17% higher than they were before the inflation surge began. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of hard times ahead after the central bank began jacking up interest rates in the spring of 2022 to attack high inflation. Most economists predicted that the much higher borrowing costs that resulted would cause a recession, with layoffs and rising unemployment, in 2023. Yet the recession never arrived, and none appears to be on the horizon. The nation’s labor market, though cooler than in the sizzling-hot years of 2022 and 2023, is still cranking out enough jobs to keep the unemployment rate near historic lows. The resilience of the job market has been matched by the durability of the overall economy. Far from collapsing into a recession, the U.S. gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — grew at a vigorous 4.9% annual pace from July through September. Strong consumer spending and business investment drove much of the expansion. At the same time, average hourly pay has outpaced inflation over the past year, leaving Americans with more money to spend. Indeed, as they did for much of 2023, consumers, a huge engine for U.S. economic growth, hit the stores in November, shopped online, went out to restaurants or traveled. Since March 2022, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times, lifting it to a 22-year high of about 5.4%. Those higher rates have made borrowing costlier for companies and households, but they are on their way toward achieving their goal: Conquering inflation. Consumer prices were up 3.1% in November from a year earlier, down drastically from a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed is so satisfied with the progress so far that it hasn’t raised rates since July and has signaled that it expects to make three rate cuts this year. Beyond a hard hit to the housing market, higher rates haven’t exerted much damage across the broader economy. Many industry sectors, including healthcare and government, have proved relatively resistant to higher interest rates. The next four years will change America forever.

But under the current circumstances, with inflation still above the Fed’s 2% annual target, a more moderate pace of hiring is seen as just what the economy needs. Lower demand for workers tends to ease the pressure on employers to raise pay to keep or attract workers and to pass on their higher labor costs to customers by raising prices.

Kennedy Jr. Support In A Very ‘West Wing’ Way","Martin Sheen says he isn’t rallying behind independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ahead of Election Day this November. “The West Wing” actor took to social media on Thursday after The Daily Mail and other outlets reported he was among the “celebrities and ‘well-wishers’” attending a “mutli-million dollar” fundraiser for the conspiracy theorist known for his anti-vaccine views. The fundraiser, set to celebrate Kennedy’s 70th birthday, has entry options between $2,500 for a guest and $50,000 for a table of 10. “I do not endorse RFK Jr nor will I be attending his party,” wrote Sheen in an Instagram Stories update. “I whole heartedly support @joebiden and the Democratic ticket for 2024.” Fellow “West Wing” co-stars Bradley Whitford, Joshua Malina and Mary McCormack also hopped on X (formerly Twitter) to go to bat for the actor, who once played President Jed Bartlet on the show. Whitford, who played Bartlet’s White House deputy chief of staff in the series, said he was issuing a statement on Sheen’s behalf: There’s a story going around saying that Martin Sheen is supporting @RobertKennedyJr for president. The story is incorrect. Martin asked us to post this on his behalf. “I wholeheartedly support President Joe Biden and the democratic ticket in 2024.Sincerely,Martin Sheen” The report from The Daily Mail cited information “released” on social media by event organizers, although it’s unclear where the publication got the details. Fox News Digital, in a report published prior to The Daily Mail, cited sources that told the outlet that Sheen would attend and introduce the candidate at the event. Sheen’s posts come after Dionne Warwick slammed reports that she was attending the fundraiser. The Daily Mail report was shared on the Kennedy campaign website and also by a super PAC ― American Values ― that supports the candidate. “I don’t know anything about this event. I did not agree to it and I certainly won’t be there,” Warwick wrote on X. “This is absolutely ridiculous. If you are going to lie on my name, at least lie about something cool. ‘Revealed: Dionne collaborates with Rihanna on new album…’” A representative for Andrea Bocelli ― who was linked to the Kennedy fundraiser, as well, in reports by The Daily Mail and Fox News Digital ― told Rolling Stone magazine that claims he’d perform at the event were “inaccurate.” This is absolutely ridiculous. If you are going to lie on my name, at least lie about something cool.“Revealed: Dionne collaborates with Rihanna on new album…” pic.twitter.com/Fve7W3Ikhl The Kennedy campaign, in a statement to Deadline, noted that the campaign “doesn’t have anything to do with” organizing the upcoming fundraiser. “The campaign has no knowledge of who is attending and can’t confirm or deny anyone’s participation, either as entertainment or as a guest,” the campaign said. A spokesperson for the Kennedy-supporting PAC Fighting 4 One America also told Deadline that it never received confirmation that Sheen would be at the fundraiser.

This Is The Lifesaving Knowledge I Wish I'd Had.","After I almost bled out during the delivery of my first child due to postpartum hemorrhage, or PPH, I had nightmares about it happening again. One week after giving birth to my second, my fears came true. I developed a pulling pain in my abdomen and called my doctor. Instinctively, I knew it was another retained placenta. The World Health Organization recently released a road map to address PPH, the leading cause of death for women in childbirth globally. According to WHO, around 70,000 women die from PPH every year. During the delivery of my first child, the doctor spent over 45 minutes trying to manually remove my placenta from my uterine wall. It ended up taking too long and I was losing too much blood, so I received an emergency dilation and curettage, or D&C. I returned to my hospital room after the surgery — shaking from adrenaline, pain medication, and the shock of losing so much blood — with my husband and baby by my side. I had survived — barely. When I became pregnant with my second child, my doctors assured me that I didn’t need to worry about the same complications happening again. They said things like “you’re overthinking it” and “we have you covered if we run into any trouble.” Though I trusted my doctors, I also trusted my intuition. With my first delivery, I knew it was not normal for the doctor to be visibly frustrated when removing the placental tissue from my uterus. I always wondered: Why did it take so long for them to decide to do a D&C? This wasn’t just anxiety-based fear. I had done my own research, and I knew that as a woman who had experienced PPH, I had a higher likelihood of having the complication again. My fear manifested itself in panic attacks, along with nightmares about dying from bleeding out on the delivery table. I had many therapy sessions about it, and ruminated over it for days at a time. My therapist attempted to rationalize away my fear, but the intrusive thoughts continued to incessantly creep into my mind. I hoped that my providers were right and my anxiety was wrong. When I finally faced the delivery of my second child, my son came out, but the placenta did not. Once again, the doctor spent a long time removing the tissue, and parts of the placenta were extracted like puzzle pieces, one by one. My husband and I looked at each other as my anxiety increased by the minute. I asked the doctor if she got it all and she replied, “Yes, I think it’s all here?” Uneasy with her response, I requested an ultrasound to confirm. She wheeled forward the dated-looking machine and placed the wand on me, as a grainy black-and-white image appeared. She squinted while examining the screen and said, “It looks OK.” I glanced at my husband and felt unsure. But still heavily medicated and numb — and going against what my body was screaming at me — I let it go. One week after delivering my son, the nightmares I had about experiencing another medical emergency due to PPH began to unfold. I called my doctor’s office with sudden acute abdominal pain. The nurse told me, “It could just be bladder retention,” but I insisted that I go in for another ultrasound. After the imaging was done, my provider came into the exam room, sat down in her chair and looked up at me. “We found retained tissue in your uterus,” she said. My anxiety suddenly rose in my chest until it took over everything and it was all I could feel. It turned out that I had been right to be worried. I was terrified. We discussed the options — either taking a drug like misoprostol to force my body to shed the tissue on its own, or doing a D&C. I chose the latter, as I knew the sooner that all of the retained tissue was removed, the less likely it was that I would end up with an infection. I hoped the procedure would be quick and go smoothly, as I wanted to get home to my newborn. That night, just before they took me back to the operating room, the nurse reviewed the protocol, which is now ingrained in my memory. “It will be a routine surgery,” she told me. “You will go to sleep. We will remove the remaining tissue. You will wake in recovery and then go home later this evening.” I texted my husband that I loved him, and then everything went black. Hours later, I woke up in excruciating pain. I cried out to the nurse who was leaning over me: “It hurts! What happened!?” I was groggy from sleep medication, but I knew I felt worse than I had after delivering a child. “Why is this happening to me?!” I loudly sobbed. The nurse put her hand on my hand and squeezed tightly. “You will be OK,” she said. I found some brief comfort in her comments, and then she pressed the pain medication button and I fell back asleep. The next time I opened my eyes, my doctor was standing at the end of my bed. “What happened?” I asked. “You hemorrhaged again,” she said. “This time you lost over a liter of blood.” I was stunned by what she was telling me. “When I went in to remove your retained placenta to take it out, you hemorrhaged,” she said. She paused and then added: “We put a balloon in your uterus to stop the bleeding. You are lucky to be alive.” I started to cry. My instinct had been right. Regardless of how experienced and well trained a doctor was, no one knew my body better than I did. My husband’s face said it all when he walked into the room. He went pale when he saw the bag of blood next to my bed draining into me. “We almost lost you ... again,” he said quietly. Twenty-four hours later, the doctor removed the device she had placed inside me, after paperwork was signed to indicate that I agreed to undergo a hysterectomy to potentially save my life if necessary. My hands gripped the sides of the bed and I prayed I wouldn’t bleed. When she was done, she gave me a look of relief and said: “I think you are going to be OK. It clotted. I don’t see any more blood.” I stayed in the hospital for two days — more time away from my newborn son — and was eventually able to stand again using a walker. When I finally made it to the bathroom on my own, I cried over the toilet, grateful that my body was healing. The hospital released me, and I cried again when my husband and my children came to pick me up to go home. If I hadn’t listened to my body and hadn’t pushed to have that second ultrasound, I could have lost my life. After experiencing two hemorrhages and facing death, I promised myself that I would tell people my story when I was ready, so that others would know what to do if it happened to them. These are my biggest takeaways related to retained tissue and PPH: Here are questions you should consider addressing with your doctor: The best thing you can do is to be informed and advocate for yourself and your health. You could end up saving your own life — just like I did. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pistorius-parole_n_6597ed70e4b0bf73e1791513","2024-01-05","gerald imray, nqobile ntshangase , mogomotsi magome","Olympian Oscar Pistorius Freed On Parole After Serving Nearly 9 Years For Girlfriend's Murder","PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius was released from prison on parole early Friday morning and was believed to be at his uncle’s mansion after authorities secretly moved the world-famous double-amputee athlete who killed his girlfriend at an undisclosed time to avoid the glare of news crews waiting outside the jail. South Africa's Department of Corrections announced in a two-sentence statement at around 8:30 a.m. that Pistorius had been released and was “now at home.” It gave no more details other than to confirm Pistorius' new status as “a parolee.” Pistorius, 37, served nearly nine years of his murder sentence of 13 years and five months for the fatal shooting of model and law graduate Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day 2013. He became eligible for early release from prison having served at least half his sentence and was approved for parole in November. Department of Corrections spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo told The Associated Press that Pistorius was processed according to procedure: taken from the Atteridgeville Correctional Center prison in the South African capital, Pretoria, to a parole office before being released to his family. Nxumalo declined to say what time Pistorius was released and where he was. “I can only tell you he was released this morning,” Nxumalo said. Pistorius was expected to initially live at his uncle’s home in an upscale Pretoria suburb after his release. A police van was outside that house and a police officer was seen coming out later Friday. The officer declined to comment to reporters. Three black private security vehicles were also parked in front of the mansion. The Department of Corrections said ahead of Pistorius’ release that it would not publicize his parole time and he was not going to be “paraded” so as to keep him away from the media that has trailed him since he shot Steenkamp multiple times through a toilet door at his Pretoria villa more than a decade ago. Pistorius will live under strict parole conditions until the remainder of his murder sentence expires in December 2029. Steenkamp’s mother, June Steenkamp, said in a statement that she had accepted Pistorius’ parole as part of South African law. “Has there been justice for Reeva? Has Oscar served enough time? There can never be justice if your loved one is never coming back, and no amount of time served will bring Reeva back,” June Steenkamp said. “We who remain behind are the ones serving a life sentence.” “With the release of Oscar Pistorius on parole, my only desire is that I will be allowed to live my last years in peace with my focus remaining on the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation, to continue Reeva’s legacy.” The Department of Corrections has emphasized that the champion Paralympic sprinter's release — like every other offender on parole — does not mean that he has served his time. Some of Pistorius’ parole conditions include restrictions on when he’s allowed to leave his home, a ban on consuming alcohol, and orders that he must attend programs on anger management and on violence against women. He must also perform community service. Pistorius will also have to regularly meet with parole officials and will be subjected to unannounced visits by authorities. He is not allowed to leave the Waterkloof district without permission and is banned from speaking to the media until the end of his sentence. He could be sent back to jail if he is in breach of any of his parole conditions. South Africa does not use tags or bracelets on paroled offenders so Pistorius will not wear any monitoring device, Department of Corrections officials said. But he will be constantly monitored by a department official and will have to inform the official of any major changes in his life, such as if he wants to get a job or move to another house. Pistorius has maintained that he shot 29-year-old Steenkamp by mistake. He testified that he believed Steenkamp was a dangerous intruder hiding in his bathroom and shot four times through the door with his licensed 9 mm pistol in self-defense. Prosecutors said he killed his girlfriend intentionally during a late-night argument. Steenkamp’s family did not oppose his parole application in November, although June Steenkamp said in a victim statement submitted to the parole board then that she didn’t believe Pistorius had been fully rehabilitated and was still lying about the killing. Before the killing, Pistorius was seen as an inspiring role model after having had both of his legs amputated below the knee as a baby because of a congenital condition. He became a champion sprinter on his carbon-fiber running blades and made history by competing at the 2012 London Olympics. His murder trial destroyed his image. He was accused of being prone to angry outbursts and acting recklessly with guns, while witnesses testified about various altercations he had with others, including an argument in which he allegedly threatened to break a man’s legs. Pistorius was first convicted of culpable homicide — a charge comparable to manslaughter — and sentenced to five years in prison for killing Steenkamp. After appeals by prosecutors, he was ultimately found guilty of murder and had his sentence increased, although that judgment by the Supreme Court of Appeal still didn’t definitively rule that he knew it was Steenkamp behind the bathroom door. Pistorius was first sent to prison in 2014, released on house arrest in 2015 during an appeal, and then sent back to prison in 2016. He was initially incarcerated at the maximum security Kgosi Mampuru II Prison in Pretoria but was moved to Atteridgeville early in his sentence because it's better suited to holding disabled prisoners. Reaction to Pistorius’ parole has been muted in South Africa, a stark contrast to the first days and months after Steenkamp’s killing, which sparked angry protests outside of Pistorius’ court hearings calling for him to receive a long prison sentence. There is no death penalty in South Africa. “He has ticked all the necessary boxes,” said Themba Masango, secretary general of Not In My Name International, a group that campaigns against violence against women. “And we can only wish and hope Oscar Pistorius will come out a better human being.” “We tend to forget that there is a possibility where somebody can be rehabilitated.” ___ Imray reported from Cape Town, South Africa. ___ More AP coverage of Oscar Pistorius: https://apnews.com/hub/oscar-pistorius By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) slammed his own party on Thursday, bemoaning its lack of accomplishments in 2023. “In my opinion, we have nothing to go out there and campaign on, Chris. It’s embarrassing,” Biggs told Newsmax host Chris Salcedo. “The Republican party and the Congress of the Majority has zero accomplishments,” Salcedo agreed. Biggs made the remark after he was asked about the House Republican majority’s “complete failures” to pass 12 annual spending bills on time. “How many of those 12 bills have been completed?” Salcedo asked. “None. None have been completed,” Biggs replied. “There’ve been a few of them. Seven I think have been sent to the Senate from the House. The Senate has not taken up a single one of those bills.” The exchange came at the end of a segment in which the two men railed against the Biden administration, congressional Democrats and their spending agenda and policies on border security and immigration. Biggs was one of eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from his House speakership in October, throwing the deeply divided caucus into disarray for weeks as they scrambled to unite around a new leader.

And it’s true that being a grandparent may allow you to participate in fun and festive occasions without having to sacrifice your financial security or uninterrupted sleep. But there are a number of ways that being a grandparent can cause stress as well as amplify any tension with your adult children. If you’re hoping to nourish strong relationships and minimize conflict with your grandchildren and their parents, here are a few missteps experts suggest you avoid, as well as what you can do to repair the damage when you do something you regret. It’s considered typical grandparent behavior to shower grandchildren with gifts, but gift giving can become a source of tension if you and the child’s parents don’t agree on what constitutes an appropriate gift. “Sometimes grandparents can get into trouble because they buy things for their grandchildren that their parents may not approve of, are too expensive or too excessive in nature,” Christopher Hansen, a licensed counselor in San Antonio, told HuffPost. A good way to avoid this is to clear any purchases, or a plan for purchases, with parents beforehand. For example, “Grandma is taking you to the zoo. You can look in the gift shop at the end of the visit and pick out one small stuffy for her to buy you.” This clarifies expectations for everyone and lets the parent know that you respect their authority, which helps cultivate trust. Complications from gift giving frequently arise when it comes to financial gifts. With the cost of child care taking an average of 27% of families’ earnings, it’s common for grandparents to either step in as child care providers or contribute to costs such as day care and tuition. But financial gifts can result in hard feelings if the money is used in a way you didn’t intend. “Clarify whether there are any expectations that accompany the gift,” Robin Kay Stilwell, a licensed marriage and family therapist, told HuffPost. “Is it a gift for the adult or child to use as they see fit, or do you have expectations regarding how you want it to be spent?” added Stilwell, who has practices in Washington, D.C., and Florida, and is a grandmother herself. Again, the best way to prevent issues from cropping up is through clear communication beforehand. You might agree, for example, to pay 50% of a child’s preschool tuition for two years with the understanding that you won’t be able to continue with similar amounts once the child enters kindergarten. Dropping by unannounced, Stilwell said, is a definite no. Doing so “sends a message that your convenience takes priority regardless of the disruption to the flow of the family unit. It is particularly difficult during dinner time, homework time or bedtime.” You also want to show understanding for how tightly packed parents’ schedules are. “Many times, grandparents forget that their children have lives with work and other commitments and don’t always have time nor want to have the time to have grandparents over because they simply are tired and are living their own lives,” Hansen said. This can sometimes mean that you don’t visit as often or for as long as you would like — but remember that the quality of the time you spend with your grandkids is more important than the quantity. Do your part by showing up and honoring any commitments you make to them. Parents’ “primary loyalty needs to shift to their family of creation,” Stilwell explained. “It can be a challenge to see them as adults with their own lives, making decisions that are disappointing to you but work for them. Avoid framing this as disloyal.” Of course, you want parents to respect your schedule as well — particularly if you’re one of their child care providers. If you’ll be providing child care regularly, it can help to set a schedule. Likewise, you’ll want to let parents know about any ongoing commitments as well as your ability (and willingness) to “drop everything” to care for grandchildren if the parents are in a pinch. “If a grandparent acts as a caregiver without clear parameters or expectations, resentment can develop,” Stilwell said. It can be a challenge to keep quiet if you see parents making what seem to be clear mistakes, but make sure that if you do raise concerns you maintain respect for their authority. “The grandparents often have a different approach to parenting that may be contrary to how the kids are raising the grandkids. It may also be different from how they parented the now-grown children. Both the parents and grandparents can be judgmental and critical of the others’ style. This can create a wedge in the relationship with the grandkids,” Stilwell said. You may feel disrespected if parents seem to dismiss your many years of experience, but at the end of the day, they have to make decisions that feel best for their family. “Sometimes grandparents take for granted that their children’s belief system and the way they want to raise their children matches what they did, and many times that’s simply not the case. Communicating and finding out how they feel about certain subjects and other things regarding their child goes a long way toward ensuring grandparents don’t overstep,” Hansen said. When it comes to things like household rules and discipline, it’s helpful to have these discussions beforehand. Clear expectations can prevent conflict later on. Extra caution is warranted with in-law relationships, particularly in cases of divorce. “A good rule of thumb is to avoid criticizing your child’s spouse or partner, directly or indirectly, even if they are the ones to vent or initiate negative comments,” Stilwell said. “Circumventing the authority and wishes of the parents,” Hansen said, is “another area where grandparents get into trouble.” Whether the issue is gift giving or household rules, “if the adult children feel that their parenting ‘rules’ or schedules are ignored or undermined, it can bleed into other aspects of the relationship, including their trust,” Stilwell said. If you want to be part of your grandchildren’s lives, it will need to be on terms that both you and their parents agree to. “Talking with one another is always the best way to gain an understanding of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable,” Hansen said. The stronger your relationship and communication with your adult child, the less likely you are to run into conflicts over care of your grandchildren. “Communicating and finding out how they feel about certain subjects and other things regarding their child goes a long way toward ensuring grandparents don’t overstep,” Hansen said. Of course, caring for kids can be complicated, often requiring you to make many decisions in rapid succession. It’s inevitable that at some point you will do something counter to parents’ wishes. How you handle this will set the tone for your relationship moving forward. “A sincere apology,” Hansen said, is an excellent place to start. “Making amends to your grandchildren or children is not a sign of weakness and demonstrates for both that even grandparents make mistakes and are human.” As with any repair work, you’ll want to acknowledge the other person’s feelings, take responsibility for your actions and offer a pledge — and perhaps a plan — for not repeating the mistake in the future. You might say, for example, “Next time I will set a timer to remind all of us when it’s time to turn off the iPad.” Though you may not feel that your actions were a mistake, “You can acknowledge that your intentions were positive and that you will work on respecting who they are and what they need from you,” Stilwell explained.

Have some compassion for yourself, too. “As a new grandfather, I have absolutely made all the mistakes I have mentioned myself,” Hansen said.

Despite the Justice Department pressing charges against more than 1,000 people linked to the insurrection, former President Donald Trump and other Republicans seem to espouse more and more false conspiracy theories about the riot and stoke the same election fraud lies that laid the foundation for the ransacking of the Capitol. In its immediate aftermath, prominent Republicans criticized Trump and held him responsible. Now, that’s almost hard to believe; many have since recanted and endorsed his 2024 presidential bid. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released this week found that the number of Republicans who believe Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election has dropped from 39% in 2021 to 31%, while 34% of Republicans believe the FBI was somehow in on the insurrection. No one has been more involved in defending Jan. 6 participants than Trump himself. He has suggested pardoning rioters if he becomes president again. He has also aided those facing criminal prosecution by appearing at fundraisers for a nonprofit group that financially supported them, and he has vowed to stop Jan. 6-related investigations if he returns to the presidency. A major focus of Trump’s reelection campaign is to rewrite the history of that day, calling it “beautiful” and claiming that rioters had “love in their heart.” At a November rally, Trump called people imprisoned over the attack “hostages,” and even honored them by playing a rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” that was recorded by Jan. 6 defendants. Five people died during or immediately after the Capitol attack, and four police officers who’d been in the fray later died by suicide. More than 140 officers were injured. Nevertheless, Trump isn’t alone in seeking to excuse, downplay or use conspiracies to explain away the day’s horrific events. At a December GOP presidential debate, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy echoed the far-right conspiracy theory that FBI agents were behind Jan. 6. “Why am I the only person on this stage at least who can say that Jan. 6 now does look like it was an inside job?” he asked. Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley — now seen as Trump’s foremost-but-still-distant rival for the presidential nomination, apparently overtaking Florida. Gov. Ron DeSantis (who called the attack a “protest” but not an attempt to overthrow the government) — has broken with Trump over how history will judge Jan. 6. “It was not a beautiful day; it was a terrible day,” Haley said on the campaign trail in Iowa last year. “And we don’t ever want that to happen again.” Yet Haley still told a 9-year-old recently that she would pardon Trump if he’s convicted of criminal charges, which include three conspiracy counts involving his effort to overturn the 2020 election, because it wouldn’t be in the country’s best interest to have “an 80-year-old man sitting in jail.” Among GOP candidates vying for the Senate, prominent election denier Kari Lake has been the outspoken supporter of Jan. 6 rioters, characterizing those prosecuted for their actions that day as “political prisoners.” Lake’s campaign in Arizona hasn’t officially been endorsed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, but several top Republican senators are backing her, including a member of Senate GOP leadership, which could help her land in the upper chamber of Congress next year. In the House, Trump has now been endorsed by around 100 hundred GOP lawmakers, including every member of party leadership, despite his role in seeking to subvert the 2020 election results. Many House Republicans also continue to fan conspiracies about the insurrection. At several times last year, they questioned Justice Department officials about how many FBI agents or informants might have been in the crowd at the Capitol. At one hearing, Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) introduced an entirely new conspiracy theory that “ghost buses” offloaded dozens of FBI informants in Washington before the attack. (FBI Director Christopher Wray has repeatedly rejected the suggestion that the agency somehow orchestrated the riot.) The most prominent piece of evidence that supposedly supported the “fedsurrection” conspiracy theory — the fact that Jan. 6 rioter Ray Epps, who conspiracists falsely claimed was a federal agent, had not been prosecuted — went up in smoke last year when the Justice Department hit Epps with charges, strongly suggesting that he wasn’t the federal asset he’d been made out to be. But lawmakers like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Troy Nehls (R-Texas) told HuffPost that their suspicions about Epps had only strengthened. Greene recently gushed about meeting Jacob Chansley, the horned Capitol rioter better known as the QAnon Shaman. A photo she shared online shows the far-right duo — the type of pairing that could even end up gracing the stage at a future Trump GOP nominating convention later this year. But the most jarring Republican statement in support of the fedsurrection theory didn’t come from a backbencher, but from new House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), in his November announcement that Republicans would make public thousands of hours of surveillance video from the Capitol attack. In the announcement, he said that the footage would be released so people could “see for themselves what happened that day, rather than having to rely upon the interpretation of a small group of government officials,” insinuating that the conventional understanding of events — that a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the building — resulted from disinformation. But Johnson gave the game away when he later said that Republicans would censor rioters’ faces to avoid potential prosecution, as amateur internet detectives have previously helped identify participants and sent tips to the FBI. “We have to blur some of the faces of persons who participated in the events of that day because we don’t want them to be retaliated against and to be charged,” Johnson said. The GOP’s efforts to whitewash the harrowing Jan. 6 attack is confounding to many of those who protected Congress on that day, including former D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, a Republican who was assaulted by Trump supporters on the steps of the Capitol. “Imagine the most traumatic, or a traumatic event in your life, that reaches the level of attention that January 6 garnered,” Fanone told HuffPost this week. “I mean, it was an international story. And spending three years trying to convince people that it actually fucking happened,” he said. The next four years will change America forever.

According to mental health experts, its worth can hardly be overstated. “Journaling is amazing. It can help lower depression and anxiety by helping reframe our thoughts,” therapist David Ibrahim, who runs Los Angeles-based trauma therapy clinic Glendale Counseling Services, told HuffPost by email. “Researching shows that [journaling] 15 minutes a day can improve mental health. “[I find that] many people come to therapy and have no clue what are they feeling or needing,” he added. “If we don’t know what we’re feeling or needing, how do we function in relationships? Or even understand the emotions and needs of others? So journaling is a way into intimacy with the self, allows us to hear our own voice [and] develop a relationship with ourselves.” Journaling can also increase your communication skills and help with distress tolerance, so you can better cope with difficulties that arise in your life, said Yara Mawad, a Los Angeles-based therapist, by email. Plus, folks may enjoy the process of recording their daily lives so they can reflect at a later time. “If you are a person who appreciates documentation and find it helpful to look back at certain points in your life to remind yourself where you were and how you were feeling in those moments, journaling can give you the experience of being able to visually see how far you have come from then to now,” Mawad wrote. The main takeaway? “Being intentional and reflective at least once in your day is a small change that can make a big difference in various areas of your life,” said Mawad. “Be open to trying new things and different kinds of journaling!” Below, we’ve rounded up some great journals based on recommendations by Mawad and Ibrahim, including options with guided prompts, journals for freeform writing or ones designed for the kid in your life.

For better or worse, my parents had my ears pierced when I was an infant, a common practice in Latine culture. As a result, I grew up giving little thought to earrings as an accessory, opting for small studs that I could wear for months at a time without changing. It wasn’t until a few years ago that I decided, in what some might call an early mid-life crisis, to add a few more piercings and really kick my earring game into high gear. Faced with the ability to create fun “earscapes” for the first time ever, I quickly came to the realization that not all earrings are created equally, and that some are decidedly more comfortable than others. So when I came upon the “nap earring” design at Maison Miru, I knew I had to try them out. These earrings are designed with push pin-style flat backs that won’t poke or scratch your skull, even when sleeping on your side. They aren’t exactly cheap, but I regret to inform you that they’re comfier than I could have possibly imagined, and worth every penny. I opted for the Everyday Nap Earrings Trio, which includes three pairs of Maison Miru’s bestselling earrings: the Celestine Crystal nap earrings, Little Bar nap earrings and Mini Crystal Trinity nap earrings. And while you can buy these each individually starting at $75 per pair, I like being able to swap them out when the mood strikes and to have multiple options available. They’re available in silver-hued solid titanium and extra-strong PVD gold plating. As someone with sensitive skin, I was worried that the earrings would secretly be made with cheap materials that irritate my delicate lobes, but I’m pleased to report that Maison Miru uses medical-grade titanium that is safe for even the most tender skin. Getting them in takes a bit of practice, so I used this TikTok video for reference the first time, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a breeze. Many professional piercers prefer flat-back earrings to traditional backings, and I now see why. I’m pleased to report that once I swapped out regular earrings for Maison Miru’s nap earrings, my fresher piercings got significantly less sore and crusty. They’re a great option for piercings that are taking a long time to heal or are otherwise giving you a bit of trouble. I would imagine that they’re also a great option for younger children who have just recently gotten their ears pierced for the first time. But true to their name, the nap earrings’ biggest selling point is that they really do feel invisible when you sleep on your side or stomach. I like to smash into my pillow or arm and was often woken up by the triad of backings poking into my skin, but no more. You don’t even realize they are there. And as if that weren’t enough, they’re cute as can be! Maison Miru has a fairly generous selection of nap earrings to choose from, so you can pick the ones that best fit your own aesthetic. I have my eyes on the Good Luck nap earrings trio next! Take a look at a few raves from happy customers, then pick up a few for yourself. The design is a total game-changer when it comes to earring comfort, and you can feel good knowing you don’t have to sacrifice style for substance. Promising reviews: “I love them !! Took a min to get in as they are so tiny. But once in they look incredible 🤩” — Allie C. “I never knew I was missing out on...I have extremely sensitive ears (allergic to multiple metals). I also constantly keep my earrings in. The only ones that don’t give my trouble are the diamond earrings I got when I got married. All the others corrode and mess up my ears- to the point I started just wearing the little plastic backings they sell earrings with so they don’t slip off the card they’re on. The idea of being able to keep them in constantly was so appealing to me. My husband (who also has metal allergies) told me to just get them finally, after staring at them forever. After a few weeks, I’m in love and already eyeing more (and more piercings!). You literally forget they are in. Just make sure you put them in somewhere there are no drains- it can take a minute to get used to and I’d be devastated if I lost one down the sink 😩 (PS- Thank you for finally bringing dainty jewelry back into the mix as well- having multiple piercings, the small ones just look better and don’t overwhelm!)” — Hope W. “Beautiful earrings! I bought the everyday nap earrings trio, and love them. They are beautiful. I like the look and the quality is great!” — Mel E. “So comfortable!! I’m allergic to normal jewelry and need titanium. This set helps me mix and match to fit my style!” — Erica W. “Perfection. I work in a very corporate atmosphere AND have three piercings in my left ear and six in my right ear. This nap trio is great in my lobe piercings as well as my helix piercings. They look classy enough for work, and cute enough for brunch or cocktails with friends. And they are sooooooo comfortable - I never take them out! Fit my ears perfectly!” — Suzy M. “Comfortable and so cute. So happy with this purchase and will buy more earrings in the future!” — Danielle By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Doctors Explain Their Endorsement","If you have trouble going number two, chances are someone will suggest downing a few cups of prune juice or eating a handful of prunes to get things going. It may sound like an old wives tale, but using prunes to relieve constipation is actually endorsed by doctors. “Prunes have been an at-home remedy for constipation for generations, and for good reason. They work,” said Dr. Nathan Wood, an instructor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Prunes are so effective at treating constipation because they have three different components that help you poop: Two types of fiber, plus fermentable sugars that each help relieve constipation differently, Wood explained. First, prunes contain soluble fibers. These “absorb water, forming a gel-like substance that softens stools, making them easier to pass,” said Dr. Alexander Jow, a gastroenterologist at Kaiser Permanente Falls Church Medical Center in Falls Church, Virginia. Second, prunes contain insoluble fiber, which “is plant material that moves through our digestive tract pretty much intact,” Wood explained. Since it “doesn’t get absorbed or completely broken down by our stomach and intestines,” it creates bulk that “helps to push things through your intestines faster,” he said. Third, prunes contain sorbitol, which is a natural fermentable sugar. “These sugars have a mild laxative effect on your digestive system by drawing water into the intestines to soften stools and stimulate bowel movements,” Jow said. Although it’s possible to get fiber and sorbitol from other foods, prunes are a uniquely good choice because “one prune contains approximately 0.7 grams of fiber, a concentrated amount for such a small fruit,” Jow said. Both prune juice and whole prunes are effective in treating constipation, Jow said. However, there are some differences to consider. Whole prunes have more fiber because the juicing process removes some. An 8-ounce serving of one cup of prune juice contains about 2.5 grams of fiber, while a serving of 10 prunes contains about 6 grams of fiber. Moreover, “whole prunes have double the amount of sorbitol in the same serving size compared to prune juice,” Jow said. Another advantage of whole prunes over prune juice is that prune juice has more sugar and calories than dried prunes. While this may not make a difference if you only consume prune juice once in a while, it can add up over time, Jow cautioned. According to Jow, the “bottom line” is that both prune juice and dried prunes will help you go. If you prefer the taste of prune juice, you will still get the laxative benefits prunes provide, but whole prunes are a healthier choice, and you won’t need as many servings to get the same amount of fiber and sorbitol. It will vary from person to person, ranging from “a few hours to a day,” Jow said. To help things along, Jow advised, “It is important to drink plenty of water while taking prunes to stay hydrated and help enhance the effectiveness of the prunes and the function of the digestive system.” The number of prunes you need to relieve constipation “varies depending on age and severity,” Jow said. To start, he suggests giving children one to two prunes or 2-4 ounces of prune juice a day. For adults, Jow recommends starting with three to five prunes or half a cup of prune juice daily or twice daily. When backed up, drinking an entire container of prune juice or down handfuls of dried prunes may be tempting. That might be especially true if the recommended amounts aren’t working for you. However, Jow urges caution. “It is possible to eat too many prunes,” leading to unwanted side effects, he said. “Excess fiber can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, gas and even diarrhea. Sorbitol is a natural laxative, so consuming too large of a quantity can also cause increased bowel movements and diarrhea,” Jow explained.

But should you buy stuff while using these public networks? In many cases, you should be fine. As the Federal Trade Commission explains, “Today, most websites do use encryption to protect your information. Because of the widespread use of encryption, connecting through a public Wi-Fi network is usually safe.” But sometimes these free Wi-Fi hotspots do get compromised by malware infection, fraudulent networks that have legitimate-sounding Wi-Fi names and man-in-the-middle cyberattacks. “Public Wi-Fi networks often lack robust security measures, which makes them attractive targets for hackers who can intercept sensitive data, such as credit card information,” said Michael Jabbara, the vice president and global head of fraud services for Visa. Amy Nofziger, the director of fraud victim support with AARP, said she’s experienced this kind of cyberattack firsthand. When she was on vacation in Las Vegas, she needed to pay a bag fee for her upcoming flight, and she entered her credit card information on the free Wi-Fi at the hotel. “Within 20 minutes, I started to get emails and calls from my credit card company alerting to charges being made on my card in others states. That’s how quickly it can happen,” she said. Luckily, there’s a simple way you can double-check that your online behavior is encrypted ― and you should do it any time you use public Wi-Fi. Here’s what to know: Before you buy anything online, the most important step you can take to ensure that the website you are using is secure is to check that the URL begins with https://. The “s” stands for secure, and there is typically a padlock icon in the address bar. Under this encryption, people who are logged in with you on the public Wi-Fi cannot see the contents of your communication, explained Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “They can see that you are going to this website, but they don’t know what page you’re going to and they can’t see what you’re typing in,” Galperin said. The HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) ensures that the data going from your device to the website you’re visiting is encrypted. As long as your website URL begins with “https,” Galperin said, you should be fine to make online purchases. If you want to make sure that you’re strictly only using these websites, Galperin recommended making it the default in your browser. On Safari, using an HTTPS URL is already the default. On Chrome, you can do this by going to Settings, selecting Privacy and Security, then Security, then toggling on the option for “Always use secure connections.” On Firefox, you can do this by going to Settings, then Privacy and Security and selecting Security. Then scroll to the “Always use secure connections” option. In addition to checking for the HTTPS, you can always go one step further and use your mobile data over public Wi-Fi if you need to make a purchase, which is what Jabbara and Nofziger both advise over using public Wi-Fi for purchases. “Using your cell service is typically safer than using public Wi-Fi for transactions, as it’s more difficult for hackers to intercept data over cellular networks,” Jabbara said. “The best course of action is to wait to use a secure network, but using mobile data is a great second option.” If you want to enhance your security, one of the most effective measures is to use a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN “encrypts your data and makes it much more difficult for anyone to intercept and read your information,” Jabbara said. And be mindful of what seems too good to be true. If a network lets you log on without entering a password or the network has a generic-sounding name like “Free Public Wi-Fi,” Nofziger said those are warning signs that the hotspot could be compromised. Ultimately, you don’t have to stop yourself from ever using public Wi-Fi ― just make sure that what you are visiting is encrypted and secure. “While it’s not necessary to completely avoid buying anything while on public Wi-Fi, it’s important to be aware of the risks and take appropriate precautions, like checking to see if the URL is safe or using a VPN,” Jabbara said.

However, experts agree that the underwear you choose can have positive or negative effects on the wellness of your genital area. For instance, underwear that makes you sweat more can lead to itching and yeast infections. Certain cuts of underwear, such as thongs, can increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis or other infections. Underwear that’s too tight can cause constriction, chafing and bacterial infections, and there is some evidence that it can affect fertility in men. When selecting a pair of underwear, it’s important to consider the fabric, fit and cut. And you’ll want to think about when and how often you change or go without underwear. We spoke with four experts — two OB-GYNs and two urologists — who gave us their best advice for choosing and wearing underwear. When selecting a pair of underwear, the fabric is a major consideration. “Generally speaking, the best fabrics for underwear are natural fabrics like cotton,” said Dr. Andrea Braden, a board-certified OB-GYN in Atlanta. “It really has to do with the breathability of that fabric. We do know that air circulates better with cotton underwear versus polyester. It is important for vulvar health to have good air circulation.” Other good natural options include hemp, bamboo and linen, said Dr. Suzy Lipinski, a board-certified OB-GYN at Pediatrix Medical Group in Denver. Urologists agree. Dr. Scott D. Miller, the medical director at Wellstar Urology in Atlanta, said that cotton stands out because “it is comfortable, cool, breathable, moisture-wicking and absorbent.” However, “these characteristics are dependent on the quality of the cotton fiber and various types of weaves,” he noted. And there are instances where other fabrics might do better. “During times of increased perspiration, cotton can retain too much moisture, leading to bacterial and fungal overgrowth,” Miller added. “In these cases, a better choice may be a fabric made of a combination of cotton and a synthetic fiber.” Lipinski advised against “non-breathable fabrics,” including synthetics such as nylon and satin. Additionally, “woven, rather than knit, fabrics or thick fabric can also limit how much [the fabric] breathes,” she said. Miller said pure polyester “is probably the worst fabric for underwear” and explained why. “Although it is among the lightest materials, it is neither absorbent nor very breathable,” he said. “However, its durability makes it a good addition as a small proportion of [fabric blends].” If you’re unsure of a particular fabric blend, Braden suggested that feeling the fabric can help you decide. “It should be soft and not slippery.” Even underwear that isn’t made of a natural, breathable fabric will often “have a cotton panel in the crotch area or gusset,” she added. And that’s a good thing: “That is because cotton is the most ideal fabric to be sitting in your ‘nether regions.’” The doctors generally agreed that when it comes to picking a cut of underwear, there’s no real right or wrong. Rather, it’s about what feels comfortable to you and what allows your body to breathe. “The key is a comfortable fit that is not constricting or chafing,” Lipinski said. “This means different underwear for different body types. … Ask yourself, does the underwear feel comfortable and move with you or tighten up and constrict? Does the underwear ride up or cause chafing? Even two pairs of underwear in the same cut but [from] different brands can fit differently.” Dr. Fenwa Milhouse, a board-certified urologist with Down There Urology in Chicago, said that “loose-fitting underwear has long been recommended,” adding that “tight-fitting underwear reduces air circulation and may increase local moisture down there, which can cause skin irritation and cutaneous or skin yeast infections.” Therefore, she encourages her patients to pick cuts that are “most comfortable for them.” However, there may be reason to believe that certain underwear styles are better for fertility than others. Milhouse noted that a 2018 Harvard study evaluating semen parameters from almost 700 men found that participants who primarily wore boxers had a 25% higher sperm concentration than those who did not. Still, “briefs have the advantage of better support and protection,” Miller said. “Boxers have the advantage of freedom of movement, although the extra material may cause bunching. Boxer-briefs combine the features of both, although most of these designs are form-fitting in the style of briefs.” Breathability doesn’t necessarily mean less fabric, with Lipinski noting how thong underwear tends to be tighter and more constrictive. “This doesn’t mean that you can’t ever wear it, just maybe minimize use or save for those special occasions,” she said. Also, consider your medical history. “If you are prone to infections, then you may want to avoid wearing a type of underwear that is a thong or sits very closely to the rear end,” Braden said, adding that it can increase risk for bacterial vaginosis. “The reason behind that is that you can have bacteria tracked from the rectal area forward when the fabric is lying that close to the rectum. So if you’re going through an infection or prone to infection, it is probably best to wear something like a bikini or brief, or even boy shorts.” The agreed-upon rule among the doctors interviewed is to change your underwear at least once per day to make sure things remain clean and dry and to decrease the bacteria load. “Bacteria is normal. We all have normal bacteria that lives on the vulva or in the rectal area,” Braden said. “What you don’t want is growth of bacteria coming from your clothing or your underwear.” Braden explained how wearing underwear for long periods of time can cause infections or odors because moisture mixes with the normal bacteria that’s down there. So it’s important to change your underwear as frequently as you can. Some people may even want to consider changing their underwear more than once a day. “If you are active and sweat a lot or struggle with incontinence, then you may want to change even more frequently,” Lipinski said. Although some doctors found no issue with sleeping in underwear when done properly, others felt it may be beneficial to go without. “In general, I recommend sleeping without underwear,” Milhouse said, adding that it allows your private parts to get air ventilation, decreases moisture and reduces irritation to the skin. “Even for my incontinent patients, at night I encourage them to sleep without underwear and pads and instead sleep commando on an absorbent towel or sheet,” she said. Ultimately, the decision is more about personal preference. However, it’s important to pay attention to how your body reacts. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Often referred to as seasonal affective disorder or SAD for short, weather-induced depression can be debilitating for many, causing everything from feelings of extreme isolation to an inability to perform everyday tasks. Fortunately, mental health-improving relief may be found in the form of SAD lamps. Hanne Hoffmann, an assistant professor of animal science at Michigan State University with a background in neurobiology, recently explained to HuffPost that our moods and physiology are quite impacted by the light we receive, and that natural sunlight exposure is often associated with “an increased sense of well-being, more energy and and an overall good mood.” Clinically called light therapy, these UV-free lamps work by mimicking outside light, specifically bright white light (which is measured in luxes), to help manage symptoms of SAD. Hoffmann recommends sitting near a SAD lamp first thing in the morning for between 20 to no more than 90 minutes for five to seven days per week. I got one for my father about two years ago (you can learn more about his exact model in the list below) and he personally attests to experiencing less anxiety, sadness and more motivation since he started using it. He lives in Oregon, where sunshine is an incredibly rare sight in fall and winter. If you buy one, pay attention to its features. “A high-quality light box will provide light at 10,000 lux when the light box is placed 12 inches or more from the eyes or face and will have a UV filter to avoid the risk of retinal damage,” Hoffmann previously said, adding that if a therapy lamp doesn’t provide 10,000 lux, longer exposure might be necessary to feel the effects. You can learn more about about SAD lamps and Hoffmann’s light therapy guidance from our previous reporting, or, if you’re ready to feel the sunshine already (well, kind of), keep reading to see some options we chose.

Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. If you don't want to sacrifice form for function, then this stylish 10,000 lux shaded lamp is a great option. The rounded shape provides a nice alternative to flat-front lamps, giving off 360 degrees of light. It includes three different color temperatures, can be used with a remote control or via touch and has a USB port for charging. This Verilux Happy Light is the exact model that I gifted my father and so far, he's been incredibly pleased with its mood-boosting power. It fits perfectly on the corner of his desk and can be displayed either horizontally or vertically to best accommodate an existing space. The Happy Light delivers one straightforward setting of 10,000-lux full-spectrum light that's both UV- and flicker-free. The highest-lux light option on our list, this frame-style therapy lamp diffuses up to 15,000 lux of UV-free light, which can be adjusted to four brightness levels and three color temperatures including warm yellow and cool white. Using the touch control buttons, users can choose from four different pre-set timers starting from 15 minutes to an hour. For anyone concerned with form as much as function, this round moon-esque lamp looks great on a bedside table or desktop. It promises up to 10,000 lux of light, five brightness levels and four brightness settings, all of which can be saved using the helpful memory function. This compact and travel-ready light panel by Circadian Optics stands like a frame to deliver up to 10,000 lux of full-spectrum light and converts completely flat with the stand doubling as a cover. Users can also choose from the three different brightness settings, each one free from harmful UV. This standing lamp can extend to be a full-length floor lamp or retract to fit on desks or bedside tables, and can use either a remote control or the built-in touch-control buttons. The neck of the light is also adjustable 360 degrees and offers 10 adjustable brightness levels up to the desired 11,000 lux. There are also five color temperatures that allow this lamp to function as a soft light source when not used for therapy purposes. Featuring a curved 16-inch tilting screen on top of a height-adjustable stand, this full-spectrum 10,000-lux lamp projects light downward up to 12 inches, mimicking natural overhead daylight. It blocks 99.3% of UV light and also has a task light setting so it can be used as a standard lamp, not just for light therapy.

Ron DeSantis ripped Fox News for “never criticizing” Donald Trump just one day after an Iowa voter confronted him for his approach toward the former president. The GOP presidential candidate, in an Iowa campaign stop on Thursday, pointed to the former president’s criticism of a six-week abortion ban in Florida and noted that Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds had signed the ban into law in the Hawkeye State. He went on to question if Trump has flip-flopped on abortion, given previous remarks and claimed he “disqualified himself” for voters who believe in “the sanctity of life” before adding that people have to hold Trump accountable. “This idea that like all these conservative radio guys and Fox News people like, they will like never criticize because they’re so concerned that someone may yell at them,” DeSantis said. “Look, anyone running for office answers to you. You have every right to hold these people accountable, and you should hold him accountable when he’s taking those positions that are not consistent with the values here in northwest Iowa.” “This idea that all these conservative radio guys and Fox News people, they will never criticize because they’re so concerned that someone might yell at them.”Ron DeSantis calls out “conservative” media for their refusal to criticize Trump. pic.twitter.com/2G8BO5hTfw DeSantis, in an interview with former NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch on Thursday, also knocked the conservative network for its counterprogramming with Trump set to air during next week’s GOP primary debate hosted by CNN. “They’re basically giving him a lifeline and making it easier for him to duck the debate,” said DeSantis, who once criticized Trump for being “missing in action” on the debate stage last year. “I think all of us should be held accountable, Dana. I don’t think it’s healthy for the conservative movement to have one candidate that is not subjected to scrutiny,” he added. “But that’s kind of what it’s been, and I think, quite frankly, Fox News has bailed him out for allowing him not to debate.” ""Fox News has bailed him out"" -- Ron DeSantis rightly points out that Fox News is ""making it easier"" for Trump to ""duck"" debates with Republican candidates by counterprogramming them with Trump town halls pic.twitter.com/nRxsTvqlbF The comments arrive a day after a man in Iowa confronted DeSantis on why he hasn’t “gone directly” after Trump on the campaign trail.

I have faith in them,” Habba told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. The remarks from Habba, who brought up Trump’s concerns with the court in an interview just a day before, arrive after the former president asked SCOTUS to overturn a Colorado Supreme Court ruling that kicked him off the state’s primary ballot last month. The Colorado court ruled that Trump was ineligible to run for the presidency again, citing the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause over his actions that led up to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Earlier this week, Trump also appealed a similar ruling from Maine’s secretary of state that removed him from the state’s 2024 GOP primary ballot. Habba, in her interview with Hannity, pointed to her faith in Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whom Trump nominated, while discussing the decisions. “You know people like Kavanaugh ― who the president fought for, who the president went through hell to get into place ― he’ll step up,” she said. “Those people will step up. Not because they’re pro-Trump but because they’re pro-law. Because they’re pro-fairness, and the law on this is very clear.” Elsewhere in the interview, Habba criticized Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, targeted in a swatting call at her home last week, for not being a lawyer and said she found “some obscure section of some statute” and applied it to the former president.

(AP) — A customer has filed a negligence lawsuit against Dunkin’, claiming he was injured by an exploding toilet at one of the coffee chain’s locations in central Florida. Paul Kerouac is seeking more than $100,000 in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Orlando, claiming he suffered “severe and long term injuries” following the explosion of a toilet in the men’s room of a Dunkin’ location in Winter Park, Florida, a year ago. After the explosion left Kerouac covered in human feces, urine and debris, he walked out of the men’s room seeking help from workers and the store’s manager, according to the lawsuit. An employee told him that they were aware of the “problem with the toilet” since there had been previous incidents, the lawsuit says, without diving into further details about the explosion. When contacted Thursday by email for more details on Kerouac’s injuries, his attorney, Scott Spradley, said he was tied up and couldn’t answer the questions until the following day. The Canton, Massachusetts-based company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ohio-trans-candidate-taken-off-ballot-dead-name_n_65971b3ce4b0912833af6bd5","2024-01-04","lil kalish","A Trans Candidate Was Taken Off The Ohio Ballot For Not Using Her Dead Name","A transgender woman running for a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives was disqualified from the race due to a rarely enforced state law requiring her to put her “deadname” on her candidate petition. Vanessa Joy is one of four trans candidates running for state House seats to fight against Ohio’s anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. Last year, Joy submitted paperwork to run as a Democrat for House District 50, a solidly Republican area south of Akron. But on Tuesday, Stark County election officials informed Joy that she would not be eligible to run in the March 19 primary even though she had collected the necessary number of signatures. Joy had legally changed her name and birth certificate in 2022, but she was told by election officials that she failed to include her former name on the petition, which is required by a little-known state law. The 1995 Ohio law states that any person who runs for public office must include their present name and any name changes from the last five years ― and failure to do so will result in suspension from office. The law does include exceptions for candidates who change their names after marriage. Joy told News 5 Cleveland that she hadn’t known about this rule ― and it does not appear anywhere in Ohio’s 2024 candidate requirement guide. The Ohio secretary of state’s office said it was aware of Joy’s disqualification. “The law applies to everyone. It is cynical and unfair to criticize the Stark County Board of Elections for their unanimous and bipartisan decision to follow Ohio law,” Melanie Amato, the director of communications for the secretary of state, wrote in an email to HuffPost. Amato said the guide does not include every statute, including this 1995 law, but she said that candidates have a right to appeal a board’s decision in court. Officials from the Stark County Board of Elections office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For trans candidates in particular, this law carries with it the possibility of being forcibly outed even if candidates have gone through a legal name change process. “In the trans community, our dead names are dead; there’s a reason it’s dead ― that is a dead person who is gone and buried,” Joy told a reporter at News 5 Cleveland. Another transgender candidate, Bobbie Arnold, who is running for a different Ohio House seat, told Cleveland.com that she was disqualified for not putting her former name on her candidate petition. However, as of Wednesday, after her interview with the local news outlet, the Montgomery County Board of Elections website showed that Arnold’s petition was certified. It is unclear whether her candidacy will be affected by this law. “In the trans community, our dead names are dead; there’s a reason it’s dead ― that is a dead person who is gone and buried.” Joy said this law would “undoubtedly” deter trans people from running for office. Ari Faber, who is running to unseat a Republican in Belmont County, said he is being forced to run under his birth name because he hasn’t legally changed his name. “The law they are using is archaic and incredibly anti-woman and anti-LGBTQ+,” Faber told Cleveland.com. “It’s being selectively applied to target transgender candidates, and that is unacceptable.” All four of these political newcomers are fighting to represent rural areas in Ohio and to push back against the onslaught of anti-LGBTQ policies and rhetoric by the state legislature’s Republican supermajority. At the end of December, Ohio’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, vetoed HB 68, a bill that would bar young trans people from gender-affirming care, such as puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapies, and also ban trans students from school sports. The rare Republican veto garnered outcry from Republican presidential candidates Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump, who have pushed forward anti-trans rhetoric and promised, as president, that they would bar trans youth, and adults, from access to health care. Ohio’s Republican lawmakers have signaled plans to override DeWine’s veto, and the state House is convening early for a special session on Wednesday to vote on this bill.

And why should I care about her favorite things?” “But where would you put a floppy disk?” Our readers will vouch for that. We recently asked them to share the people, places and events that have elicited blank stares from the Gen Zers in their lives. See what they had to say below. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length. 1. “My 21-year-old co-worker tried to tell me “Did you know Netflix used to mail people physical DVDs?” Like, yes. I did know that. It wasn’t that long ago!” ― Hannah Knaphus 2. “As a dating coach, I sometimes explain singles classified ads to Gen Zer clients. As in, did you know that people used to meet their partners by placing ads in the newspaper ― with no pictures, no extensive profile and no algorithm?” ― Jessica Engle 3. “The idea of Blockbuster on a Friday night and rewinding the tapes on Sunday!” ― Candis Ingram 4. “Dropping someone at the airport at the gate and standing by the window til the plane pulled away. The longer you stayed, the sadder the goodbye.” ― Sapna Upadhyay 5. “She thought Enya was an herb.” — Brittany Waters 6. “Baby Jessica. In the late 1980s, this 18-month-old fell in a well and the entire country was glued to our televisions for the next 56 hours. Spoiler alert: She’s fine.” ― Nick Leighton 7. “There is a very big distinction between Michael Jackson and Michael Jordan. Even though their names are similar, you can’t just swap them out at random, especially when you say you want ‘Michael Jackson shoes’ and expect Air Jordans. You’re going to get loafers!” ― Holly Walsh 8. “My kid had a conspiracy theory that ‘Pilot’ episodes meant something suspicious. I had to explain that it’s just what we call the first episode of a series!” ― Shelby Cole Harris 9. “I had to explain to my kids that Freddie Mercury was actually famous way before the movie ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ as they thought he wasn’t well-known.” ― Candy Elliott 10. “My favorite incident was with my Gen Z son and his girlfriend. She had gotten a car, it was from the late ’90s. It had a tape deck in it, which they were so excited over, so I dug up a few old cassettes I had and gave them so they could try it out. I asked about it later, and they said that they didn’t fit, that it must only play the tiny cassettes. That didn’t seem right to me, so I went out to the car to check it out. They were trying to stick it in long ways ― it didn’t occur to them to try turning it the other way!” ― Hurst D. Angela 11. “Calling the weather line on the phone. Calling the movie line for show times. And calling home after basketball practice from the pay phone when it was time for Mom to pick us up. … let the phone ring three times then just hang up. She’d know it was time and you saved your money.” ― Vickie Jones Gogo 12. “Hang on to your socks! They thought that President John F. Kennedy died in an airplane crash with his wife!” ― Jane Thayer 13. “How we were all into Gregorian chants for about six months. Then they just suddenly disappeared.” ― Jamie Viebach 14. “It’s been wild trying to explain Y2K and the hysteria that surrounded it to Gen Z. Try telling someone who was practically born with a super computer in hand that our generation was practicing survival skills for when our computers would destroy the world at midnight in the year 2000. ― @maryfairyboberry 15. “I had to explain what a milkman was to my kids. My grandfather actually was a milkman. They couldn’t wrap their heads around the whole concept. I think they think I’m making it up!” ― Kathleen Collins Ward 16. “‘In Living Color.’ I even tried explaining Homey D. Clown to their blank expressions.” ― Karen Keene Parodi 17. “I’m a younger millennial, and while talking about music from 2010, I had to explain to a bunch of Gen Zers what VH1 was because they’d never heard of it.” ― Maryam Noman 18. “S&H Green Stamps! My siblings and I had so much fun licking and pasting these into the little books and then going to the store to redeem them for fun ‘free’ items with our mom. My kids were so bewildered by this… ‘Like, why?’” ―Leslie Blanchard 19. “That Jen Aniston and Brad Pitt were once married.” ― Jillian Kalbaugh 20. “I was telling a Starbucks barista I still have my red cup from when U2 did a collaboration with them. She answered me, ‘Who?’ and we went back and forth trying to explain that U2 is a band with Bono and nothing [registered]. I felt so old that day.” ― Kourtney Clara 21. “How there’d be a busy signal when dialing a phone number, like a radio station contest phone number. My kids had never heard a busy signal.” ― Laura Harris 22. “The fax machine went off in our office and scared the teen worker so bad she thought it was a bomb. After explaining what it was, we asked her if she knew what the typewriter was, and she asked if it was another fax machine.” ― Janet Stackhouse Meek 23. “In a teacher’s workshop, I made a comment that referenced Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis. [There was] dead silence. NO ONE knew who I was talking about! Retired two years later!” ― Mary Shea Rys 24. “This one broke me: Rewinding a video. I asked my oldest to ‘rewind’ a show on on-demand, and she looked at me like I had three heads.” ― Rachel Rank 25. “Dial-up internet access. The internet arrived in the mail on a CD-ROM, usually from the company AOL. You received a limited number of minutes to access the internet per CD. Wi-Fi didn’t exist; the computer used a landline to ‘call’ the internet. My sister was familiar with the notorious screechy ‘dial-up’ sounds but didn’t associate them with internet access.” ― Penney Berryman 26. “I told my kids if I married this guy we would be like the Brady Bunch, but they had no idea who the Brady Bunch is.” ― Mary Catherine Roberson 27. “Me: Getting a haircut, talking about music and telling the stylist about Janis Joplin. Her: Who’s that?’ Me: Mind blown.” ― Donna Farrell 28. “I recently responded ‘totally tubular’ and ‘gag me with a spoon’ to a ‘what are sayings that Gen Zers will never know?’ prompt on social media. To my kids’ horror, it showed up on their newsfeeds, and they accosted me in the kitchen to explain the meanings (and myself). I told them they were popular expressions during the Valley Girl days, when leg warmers, electric blue eyeliner and Hubba Bubba bubble gum tape reigned. The blank stares I got in response were in the spirit of a stereotypical Valley Girl.” ― Jodi Meltzer HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Ron DeSantis kicked off his appearance at a CNN Republican Presidential Town Hall on Thursday with a name-dropping dig at opponent Nikki Haley. During the live town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa, DeSantis walked on to the stage and handed moderator Kaitlan Collins a jersey of Iowa Hawkeyes basketball star Caitlin Clark, alluding to a recent flub from Haley in which she mixed up the two names. “We’re excited to see the Lady Hawkeyes team. What a great coach they have. Caitlin Collins is phenomenal,” the former South Carolina governor said last week at a pre-game event, clearly meaning Clark, the Des Moines Register reported. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Collins responded to Haley’s comment: “I can assure you her free-throw percentage is much better than mine.” DeSantis, whose CNN town hall preceded Haley’s, didn’t miss taking the easy shot. “I heard the other day someone say Kaitlan Collins had some basketball skills. Now, I don’t know if that was a mistake or not, but I know in Iowa they have a Caitlin Clark, so I just wanted to give you this as a memento,” DeSantis said Thursday as he unfolded the jersey and handed it to Collins. DeSantis and Haley were scheduled for back-to-back CNN town halls on Thursday evening, just more than a week before the Iowa caucuses.

The New York Film Critics Circle recently named the filmmaker best director for his movie “Oppenheimer,” and Nolan decided to use his acceptance speech as an opportunity to wax poetic about why he doesn’t care that an aerobics instructor hurt his feelings, according to Variety. Nolan explained to a room full of professional film critics that he respects their opinions of his work because of their “objectivity.” But when it comes to anyone else, not so much. To highlight this point, Nolan shared a personal anecdote. “I was on my Peloton. I’m dying. And the instructor started talking about one of my films and said, ‘Did anyone see this? That’s a couple hours of my life I’ll never get back again!’” Nolan said. “When [film critic] Rex Reed takes a shit on your film he doesn’t ask you to work out! In today’s world, where opinions are everywhere, there is a sort of idea that film criticism is being democratized, but I for one think the critical appreciation of films shouldn’t be an instinct but it should be a profession.” Although Nolan seemed to be joking while sharing this story, he may have been a bit irked by the flippant remark because he cranked it up again on his appreciation of film critics. “What we have here tonight is a group of professionals who attempt objectivity,” Nolan continued. “Obviously writing about cinema objectively is a paradox, but the aspirations of objectivity is what makes criticism vital and timeless and useful to filmmakers and the filmmaking community.” Nolan didn’t name which of his movies was hated on or the name of the hater, but Peloton has a pretty massive fanbase, and it didn’t take long for its members to dig up the evidence. According to one Reddit user, the culprit was Jenn Sherman from a 30-minute interval and arms ride from Dec. 28, 2020. The Redditor appears to be right — and 404 published video of Sherman absolutely going off on Nolan’s 2020 film, “Tenet.” In the clip, which 404 says it found on Peloton’s official Facebook group Thursday, Sherman is working out to the song “The Plan” by Travis Scott. “This song is from a soundtrack of a movie called ‘Tenet,’” Sherman says in the clip. “Anybody see this shit? Did anybody see this besides me? Because I need a manual. Someone’s got to explain this. Yeah, I’m not kidding. What the fuck was going on in that movie? Do you understand? Seriously, you need to be a neuroscientist to understand. And that’s two-and-a-half hours of my life I want back. I want it back.” So, uh, maybe Nolan has a point about film critics after all — especially when he concluded his speech by saying: We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

On Tuesday, contestant Renee Poche filed a lawsuit against both Netflix and the show’s production company, Delirium TV, claiming “unlawful employment practices” as well as “unfair competition” and “intentional infliction of emotional distress.” She wants to halt a $4 million arbitration penalty the show’s producers sought against her in November for allegedly violating a nondisclosure agreement by speaking publicly about her experiences on the show. “My experience on ‘Love Is Blind’ was traumatic,” Poche, a Texas native who works as a veterinarian, told Variety on Wednesday. “I felt like a prisoner and had no support when I let Delirium know that I didn’t feel safe.” She went on to note: “I believe Delirium is trying to silence the abuse that occurs behind the cameras and ruin me for telling the truth.” Poche’s screen time on the fifth and most recent season of “Love Is Blind” was relatively brief. However, she was matched up with ex-fiancé Carter Wall, who is described as a “walking red flag” who was “emotionally abusive on and off camera” in court documents cited by “Entertainment Tonight,” among other outlets. Though Poche said in the complaint she was “utterly terrified of Wall” and expressed her concerns to Netflix and Delirium TV officials, she claims she was “forced to spend long stretches of time alone with him.” To represent her, Poche has reportedly hired powerhouse attorneys Mark Geragos ― whose previous clients included Michael Jackson and Winona Ryder ― and Bryan Freedman. HuffPost reached out to Netflix representatives for comment on the suit but did not hear back as of Thursday night. “Love Is Blind” premiered on Netflix during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and became an instant smash. The series follows 15 men and 15 women from the same metropolitan area who are hoping to find love. Over a period of 10 days, the prospective couples go on a series of “dates” from the privacy of individual pods, where they communicate via a speaker but cannot see each other. Poche’s case isn’t the first to be filed against “Love Is Blind.” In October, it was reported that Season 5 contestant Tran Dang had come forward with sexual assault claims against Thomas Smith, her former fiancé on the show. She also claimed that she was “falsely imprisoned” by the show’s producers, who she said acted with negligence. The show’s creator, Chris Coelen, responded to Dang’s suit by emphasizing the safety measures that were taken during filming.

Thomas Ebersole, 31 was arrested Wednesday after detectives found the 16-year-old girl in his home by tracing her location after she logged on to World of Warcraft, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by HuffPost. According to the affidavit, Ebersole initially told authorities that he did not know the 16-year-old but then brought her to the door. Deputies described her as “frustrated but cooperative.” During his interview, Ebersole allegedly admitted to having a “romantic relationship” with the 16-year-old and driving thousands of miles to Ohio to pick her up, deputies said. Detectives say he told them he knew the girl’s age and planned to the hide the teen inside his home and “have her become his wife,” according to the affidavit. Ebersole told investigators he had initially contacted the girl through Discord, an instant-messaging app popular with gamers. Discord messages cited in the court document revealed that Ebersole and the 16-year-old referred to each other by pet names, including “little wolf” and “My Hot Tier DH Tank.” The two also made several romantic statements, according to the document. Ebersole left his home in Florida on Dec. 27 to pick up the teen girl, according to messages in the app cited in the document. Deputies said they observed three bruises on Ebersole’s neck, which he said were “hickies” given to him by the 16-year-old, which she confirmed. The deputies reported that they determined the “overtly sexual” act was not “normal behavior” between a child and adult. Ebersole was taken into custody on charges of traveling to meet a minor to engage in sexual activity, interfering with child custody and sheltering an unmarried minor. An NBC News report shed light on the child safety issues surrounding Discord, citing 31 cases since the app’s creation in which adults were prosecuted on charges of “kidnapping, grooming or sexual assault” that allegedly involved communicating on the platform. According to its guidelines, Discord warns users under the age of 18 to not engage in sexual conduct that puts them at risk, and it prohibits adults from soliciting sexual content from or engaging in sexual conduct with users under 18.

DNA analysis, dental records and an endocrinologist’s evaluation are offered as evidence of Natalia Grace Barnett’s true age in “Natalia Speaks,” Investigation Discovery’s second season of its 2023 blockbuster “The Curious Case of Natalia Grace.” According to health and scientific professionals, Natalia was in fact a child in 2012 when Michael and Kristine Barnett petitioned an Indiana court to change the date on her birth certificate from 2003 to 1989. Shortly afterward, the couple moved to Canada with their three biological sons, leaving Natalia, who has a form of dwarfism, to fend for herself in apartments they rented for her in Indiana. An endocrinologist who examined Natalia in 2010 estimated her to be 9 to 11 years old. A dentist reviewing her X-rays from his 2011 examination for “Natalia Speaks” pointed out that she still had 12 baby teeth at the time, calling the results “indisputable.” Kristine Barnett, he said, left the consultation with documentation of his finding that she was 8 to 9 years old. And filmmakers were there when Natalia received the results of a recent epigenetic DNA test, which determined she is now no older than 22, making it clear she was a child when deserted by the family nearly 12 years ago. “This one little piece of paper,” Natalia said, holding up the page with the DNA results, “throws every single lie that the Barnetts have said right into the trash, with a match.” The docuseries’ first season, which aired in July, examined the bizarre claims by the Barnetts (who later divorced) that Natalia was posing as a child to hide what they alleged was a murderous intent. As Natalia points out in the second season, their accusations — that she poisoned Kristine Barnett’s coffee with cleaning fluid, pushed her into an electric fence, stood by the sleeping couple’s bed brandishing a knife and threw her brothers’ toys in the street in the hopes that the boys would get run over — parallel the story of “The Orphan,” a horror film that premiered in 2009, the year before the Barnetts adopted Natalia. It remains unclear why a probate judge would base the decision to change Natalia’s age solely on the Barnetts’ accounts and a formula based on determinations that she hadn’t grown in two years. Natalia was not at the hearing — nor was she aware it was happening, she says in the second season. Its title, “Natalia Speaks,” refers to the fact that she wasn’t heard in “The Curious Case,” outside of home videos and filmed depositions, because she was bound by a gag order. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Both Michael and Kristine Barnett were charged with neglect, but Michael Barnett was acquitted by a jury in October 2022, and charges against Kristine were later dropped. The trial court ruled that evidence about Natalia’s age and adoption could not be heard in the trial based on statute of limitation laws, but it was later released publicly by local prosecutors. Natalia hints at the possibility that she will file civil lawsuits against the Barnetts for abuse and neglect. The final episode of “Natalia Speaks” documents her adoption as an adult in June 2023 by Antwon and Cynthia Mans, a couple who had taken her in after seeing the apartment where she was living alone after the Barnetts moved to Canada. “What this adoption will do is kind of pave the way for anything you want to do legally in the future,” Natalia’s lawyer Peter Kenny said in a meeting prior to the adoption. “Because the evidence will speak for itself.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

These centimillionaires and billionaires made up just 0.05% of all American households in 2022, according to Federal Reserve data analyzed by the progressive nonprofit Americans for Tax Fairness. But they held one-sixth of so-called unrealized capital gains in the country. Unrealized gains are the primary source of income for many elite families. Under current law, growth in the value of assets like stocks, bonds, investments, real estate or businesses is not taxable until they are “realized,” or sold. The ultrawealthy can nonetheless live off these gains by taking out low-interest loans against their exorbitant wealth. And when their fortunes become inheritances, the gains are no longer taxable. “The superrich truly live in a strange and privileged world,” said David Kass, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness. While most households depend on paychecks — “income that is taxed all year, every year,” Kass noted — these untaxed gains make up the largest single source of income for the ultrawealthy. “The scandal of tax-free billionaires,” Kass added, also results in billions of dollars less in tax revenue that could fund health care, housing, education and other public programs. Led by President Joe Biden, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Reps. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) and Don Beyer (D-Va.) have introduced a “Billionaires Income Tax” in both chambers of Congress. The tax would apply only to unrealized gains held by ultrawealthy households, and could generate an estimated $500 billion in new revenue over a decade. Biden has also proposed ending the loophole, known as the stepped-up basis, that erases capital gains for tax purposes when wealthy individuals pass on their fortunes as inheritance. Both plans have virtually no support among Republicans. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Since 1989, when the Federal Reserve began collecting this data, households worth more than $100 million have nearly tripled their share of the country’s unrealized gains. The disparity in how the incomes of the superrich are taxed also deepens racial divides. Of the $8.5 trillion in untaxed wealth belonging to centimillionaires and billionaires, $7.6 trillion, or almost 90%, is held by white households. That figure is six times the total wealth of all Black households in the country, and five times the total wealth of all Hispanic households.

But President-elect Donald Trump’s intent to nominate loyalists to fill key Cabinet posts has set up a possible confrontation with the Senate, which has the constitutional responsibility for “advice and consent” on presidential nominees. Trump and his Republican allies are talking about going around the Senate and using temporary recess appointments, which last no more than two years. Invoking that authority could result in a fight that lands at the Supreme Court. Trump might also have to claim another, never-before-used power to force the Senate into a recess, if it won’t agree to one. Supreme Court has decided only one recess appointment case. In its 234 years, the Supreme Court has decided only one case involving recess appointments. In 2014, the justices unanimously ruled that Democratic President Barack Obama’s recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were illegal. But they disagreed sharply over the reach of the decision. Five justices backed a limited ruling that held the Senate wasn’t actually in recess when Obama acted and, in any event, a break had to be at least 10 days before the president could act on his own. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the other four justices, would have held that the only recess recognized by the Constitution occurs between the annual sessions of Congress, not breaks taken during a session. That would have ruled out the appointments Trump may be considering after the new Congress begins in January and he is sworn into office. Conservatives’ previous rulings may offer clues Just two justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, remain from the five-justice bloc that took the view that preserved the president’s power to make recess appointments during a session of Congress. Three others, John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, joined the Scalia opinion that would have made it virtually impossible for any future president to make recess appointments. The rest of the court has become more conservative since then, a result of Trump’s three high court appointments in his first term. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett have no record on this issue, which rarely arises in the courts. Nor does Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a 2022 appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden. There is tension between respect for precedent and original meaning A more conservative Supreme Court might come out differently today, though it’s by no means certain. Once the court decides a case, the ruling is regarded as precedent that is not lightly discarded. So even some justices who initially dissent from a ruling will go along in later cases on a similar topic. Scalia, an icon of the right, applied his originalist approach to the Constitution to conclude that there was little doubt what the framers were trying to do. The whole point of the constitutional provision on recess appointments, adopted in 1787 in the era of horse and buggy, was that the Senate could not quickly be summoned to fill critical vacancies, he wrote. Reading a summary of his opinion aloud in the courtroom on June 26, 2014, Scalia said the power to make recess appointments “is an anachronism.” The Senate always can be convened on short notice to consider a president’s nominations, he said. “The only remaining practical use for the recess appointment power is the ignoble one of enabling presidents to circumvent the Senate’s role in the appointment process, which is precisely what happened here,” Scalia said. How could the issue return to the high court? It’s not likely to happen quickly. Only someone who has been affected by an action taken by an official who was given a recess appointment would have the legal right, or standing, to sue. In the NLRB case, Obama made his recess appointments in January 2012. The board then ruled against Noel Canning, a soft drink bottling company in Yakima, Washington, in a dispute over contract negotiations with a local Teamsters union. The company sued, claiming that the NLRB decision against it was not valid because the board members were not properly appointed and that the board did not have enough members to do business without the improperly appointed officials. The Supreme Court’s ultimate decision came nearly 2 1/2 years later. Who’s who among recess appointments Among the most prominent people who were first given recess appointments and later confirmed by the Senate are Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice William Brennan and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Among those who left office after failing to win a Senate vote is John Bolton, who was given a recess appointment as U.N. ambassador under Republican President George W. Bush. Trump could try to force a congressional recess A separate novel legal issue could arise if Trump were to invoke a constitutional provision that his allies suggested would allow him to force the Senate to adjourn, even if doesn’t want to, and enable him to make recess appointments. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution includes a clause about congressional adjournments that has never been invoked. Trump’s allies read it as giving the chief executive the power step in when the House and Senate can’t agree on when to adjourn. The provision reads that “in case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper.” But some scholars, including conservative ones, argue that the House has no power to force the Senate to adjourn, and vice versa. Congressional adjournments are spelled out in Article I, which requires one chamber to consent when the other wants to take a break of more than three days. Under this view, the president could intervene only when one house objects to the other’s adjournment plan.

In an Instagram post Sunday, the former talk show host gave thanks to de Rossi for being the “best thing that ever happened” to her amid the pair’s recent move to rural England. “20 years ago today we began this relationship not realizing what a long, beautiful adventure this would be. You are the best thing that ever happened in my life. You take care of me. You help me see the good in everything,” DeGeneres wrote alongside a cozy picture of the couple. “You help to guide me and pick me up when I feel off or down.” Calling de Rossi “a beautiful soul,” DeGeneres continued, “I am so very grateful to have as a partner to navigate this crazy life with. My wife. My best friend. The love of my life.” “Thank you for being you and loving me. So happy we get to travel and explore the world together in the next 20 years, and looking forward to our first snowy Christmas,” the retired comedian added. DeGeneres also addressed the recent reports that the pair’s home in the U.K. flooded during Storm Bert. “P.S. for those of you concerned, our UK farmhouse did NOT flood,” she wrote. While de Rossi hasn’t marked the special milestone on social media with her own post, she previously gushed over DeGeneres in an upbeat Instagram post marking her 66th birthday back in January. “You continue to amaze me and inspire me. Happy Birthday to the strongest, sweetest, most brilliant person I know,” de Rossi wrote alongside a clip of the “Finding Nemo” star hitting the gym. “I’m so lucky to be standing next to you as we share this incredible life together. I love you.” De Rossi and the actor first met backstage at a concert in 2001 but didn’t start dating until they reconnected at an event in 2004.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) might not be a big fan of billionaires, but he can agree with Elon Musk on one big thing. The left-wing legislator gave a small bit of credit to tech mogul and Donald Trump ally, Musk, while criticizing the government’s outsized defense budget in a social media post on Sunday. “Elon Musk is right,” Sanders declared in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. “The Pentagon, with a budget of $886 billion, just failed its 7th audit in a row. It’s lost track of billions.” Pointing out congress’ reluctance to tackle the government’s glut of military spending, the avowed Democratic Socialist noted how “last year, only 13 senators voted against the Military Industrial Complex and a defense budget full of waste and fraud.” “That must change,” he went on. Defense spending has long been one of the bulkiest parts of the federal budget. Elon Musk is right.The Pentagon, with a budget of $886 billion, just failed its 7th audit in a row. It’s lost track of billions.Last year, only 13 senators voted against the Military Industrial Complex and a defense budget full of waste and fraud.That must change. Congress approved $841 billion in funds for the Pentagon in 2024, an amount that added up to about 12.5% of the federal government’s total yearly expenses. While the Democratic socialist and free market fanatic may seem like unlikely allies, Musk has already made a pledge to hedge government waste while copiloting Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with former Republican presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy.

She kind of ruined it for everybody. I thought I was going to have to get real East Texas on her, take off my earrings. Florida goes hard.” During Musgraves’ show in Tampa on Friday, someone grabbed her as she was walking through the crowd. Musgraves stopped singing and said to the fan, “What the fuck?” As Musgraves walked away, she said into the microphone, “Jesus fucking Christ.” Bad behavior from fans has seemingly been on the rise within the past few years. Last year, a fan threw a cellphone at Bebe Rexha during one of her concerts, leaving her with a black eye. Country singer Kelsea Ballerini was also the victim of someone throwing something at her while she performed onstage. Neither Musgraves’ rep nor Tampa police immediately responded to a request for comment. Musgraves isn’t known for staying quiet. Earlier this year, she wore a T-shirt with a comment someone had made about her online. “I liked your music but your personality seems shitty,” the shirt read, a callback to something a person wrote to Musgraves on social media in 2019.

In a video posted on Instagram Sunday, the former Minnesota Vikings player, 47, revealed that he’s “battling something internal.” “Throughout the week of the holidays, your boy has been battling something internal,” Moss said. “I just ask for all the prayer warriors to put their blessing hands on me and my family through these hard times.” The NFL icon urged his male followers to stay on top of their regular checkups in his cryptic message. “I got a great team of doctors and I got a great family around me,” he continued. “All you men, y’all do your checkups, get your blood work done, and we’ll work through it.” Moss, who is currently an analyst for ESPN’s “Sunday NFL Countdown,” explained that he was wearing sunglasses in the studio due to a possible health concern after fans expressed concern. “All right, so you see me with my Michigan turnover glasses on, y’all know what I’m battling,” he said. “God bless y’all. Thanks for the prayers.” In a follow-up video shared shortly after his initial clip, the Hall of Famer added: “There’s going to be people concerned and asking questions. At this time, I’m just going to keep a lot of things private. Just bear with me. But like I said, I need your prayers.” Moss spent 14 seasons in the NFL and played for the Minnesota Vikings, Oakland Raiders, New England Patriots, Tennessee Titans and San Francisco 49ers during his successful career. In a clip shared on X from Sunday’s broadcast, the ex New England Patriots wide receiver opened up more about his health update, noting he feels “great” but reiterated he’s “battling” an undisclosed issue. “I just want to let the viewers know that me and my wife, me and my family, we are battling something internally.

Grint, who played Ron Weasley in the magical film franchise, was ordered to pay the money in 2019 after H.M. Revenue and Customs, the U.K. tax agency, investigated his tax return from seven years earlier. The agency said Grint had wrongly classed 4.5 million pounds in residuals from the movies — money from DVD sales, TV syndication, streaming rights and other sources — as a capital asset rather than income, which is subject to a much higher tax rate. Lawyers for Grint appealed, but after years of wrangling a tribunal judge ruled against the actor this week. Judge Harriet Morgan said the money “derived substantially the whole of its value from the activities of Mr. Grint” and “is taxable as income.” Grint, 36, starred in all eight Harry Potter films between 2001 and 2011 as the boy wizard’s best friend, and is calculated to have earned around 24 million pounds from the role. He previously lost a separate court battle over a 1 million pound tax refund in 2019.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) isn’t entertaining anyone’s worries about Donald Trump’s choice for FBI director, Kash Patel. The high-profile Republican gave Patel, a former Trump adviser, a ringing endorsement while appearing on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, where he called the loyalist to the president-elect the perfect person to tackle “partisan corruption” in the bureau. “I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI,” Cruz told CBS anchor Major Garrett. “The FBI and the Department of Justice are two institutions incredibly important to the rule of law in the United States. I revere both,” he continued. As Cruz went on, he accused Democratic leaders of corrupting the country’s top law enforcement agencies. “One of the most tragic consequences of four years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is both DOJ and the FBI have been politicized and weaponized,” he said. “And I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption in the FBI.” While Cruz didn’t hesitate to throw his weight behind Patel, top FBI alumni have already come out to sound alarms about the appointment. On Saturday, Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director for the FBI, described Patel’s nomination as part of Trump’s “plan to disrupt, to dismantle, to distract the FBI.” “The fact that Kash Patel is profoundly unqualified for this job is not even like a matter for debate,” McCabe told CNN.

Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) backed FBI Director Christopher Wray during a Sunday interview with ABC News’ “This Week.” Rounds’ remarks come a day after President-elect Donald Trump announced his desired replacement for Wray’s position, Trump loyalist Kash Patel. Wray, who was appointed by Trump in 2017, is seven years into a 10-year term. “Chris Wray, who the president nominated the first time around — I think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,” Rounds told journalist Jonathan Karl. “When we meet with him behind closed doors, I’ve had no objections to the way that he’s handled himself, and so I don’t have any complaints about the way that he’s done his job right now.” Rounds added that he was unsurprised that Trump’s administration picks are “people that [Trump] believes are very loyal to himself, and that’s been a part of the process.” “Every president wants people that are loyal to themselves,” Rounds continued. Trump has bashed Wray and the FBI as a whole in recent years. At one point, the former president reportedly called Wray the “worst” member of his former administration, according to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s memoir. (For context, the FBI raided his Mar-a-Lago home in 2022, uncovering classified documents from his presidency that were improperly stored.) “The president has the right to make nominations, but normally, these are for a 10-year term,” Rounds said. “If he does [nominate Kash Patel], just as with anybody who is nominated for one of these positions, once they’ve been nominated by the president, then the president gets the benefit of the doubt on the nomination, but we still go through a process, and that process includes advice and consent.” The next four years will change America forever.

On Saturday, the pair, who have been together for more than three years, announced their engagement in a romantic video on Instagram. In the clip, set to Eric Benét’s “Spend My Life with You,” Eric Murphy is seen getting down on one knee to propose to Jasmin Lawrence in a picturesque room filled with candles and flower bouquets. The couple captioned their post: “11.27.2024. We’re engaged!! God truly blessed us with a love that feels like destiny. We couldn’t be more excited for this next chapter ❤️❤️.” “Special thank you to everyone who made this moment so beautiful!!” they added. Murphy and Lawrence’s engagement comes after the two reportedly made their relationship official on Instagram in June 2021. “Head over heels in LOVE with YOU,” Murphy captioned a post on the social media platform at the time. Though it’s unknown when they first started dating, Lawrence gushed about her relationship with Murphy while speaking with InTouch Weekly in January 2022. “We became really good friends, we bonded on a lot of things,” she said. “Obviously, we have similar backgrounds, so we understood each other on a certain level — and over time, it just, you know, became more.” Lawrence went on to explain that although both their dads had previously starred together in films like “Life” and “Boomerang,” it was one of her uncles who introduced her to Murphy.

The president-elect praised Boulos — who is the father of Michael Boulos, husband to Trump’s daughter, Tiffany Trump — as “an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world” while sharing the news on Truth Social over the weekend. Calling the Lebanese American businessman someone “with extensive experience on the International scene,” Donald Trump went on to highlight Massad Boulos’ conservative bona fides. “He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community,” Trump said. “Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East,” he continued. “He will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests, and I am pleased to have him on our team!” Boulos was a key surrogate during Trump’s campaign to win over Arab American voters in the swing state of Michigan. In the end, the Republican won the Wolverine State by around a 1.5% margin. The next four years will change America forever.

Greg Abbott (R) threatened to pull funding from Texas Children’s Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine after a doctor said on TikTok that patients don’t have to disclose their immigration status. “Hey Texas Children’s Hospital & Baylor College of Medicine, this doctor is putting your Medicaid and Medicare funding at risk,” Abbott wrote on X on Nov. 24. “You better think twice & have crystal clear records. There will be consequences for failing to follow the law in the Executive Order.” The post comes after Tony Pastor, a doctor at Texas’s Children’s Hospital and assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine, posted a TikTok, that has since been deleted, in which he encouraged patients to not answer whether they are a U.S. citizen on their intake form at the hospital. “It has made all of us physicians and providers super uncomfortable,” Pastor said in the TikTok. “No one has told us what people are going to do with this information.” On Nov. 1, Abbott issued an executive order that requires the Texas Health and Human Services Commission “to collect information on illegal immigrants who use Texas public hospitals for inpatient and emergency care and to report incurred healthcare costs due to the Biden-Harris Administration’s reckless open border policies.” “Due to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ open border policies, Texas has had to foot the bill for medical costs for individuals illegally in the state,” Abbott said in a news release. “Texans should not have to shoulder the burden of financially supporting medical care for illegal immigrants. That is why today I issued an Executive Order requiring the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to collect and report healthcare costs for illegal immigrants in our state. Texas will hold the Biden-Harris Administration accountable for the consequences of their open border policies, and we will fight to ensure that they pay back Texas for their costly and dangerous policies.” In a statement to HuffPost, Texas Children’s Hospital said it “fully supports” Abbott’s executive order and is in “full compliance.” “We have worked closely with the Texas Hospital Association and our industry partners across the state to ensure compliance in advance of the effective date,” the statement reads. “While we recognize that individuals working at Texas Children’s hold their own personal views on many topics, those opinions do not necessarily reflect the official position of Texas Children’s Hospital. We will continue to prioritize patient care while ensuring we are in full compliance with all laws and legal directives.” Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Baylor College of Medicine did not have a comment. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

On Nov. 22, Forbes released a cover story on Cooper along with a video interview with the podcaster, where she told the outlet that speaking with Harris on her podcast, which tackles topics like sex and advice for women, was “totally worth it.” “[Harris’ team] reached out to me, and I recognized that maybe in a different election it wouldn’t be the case, and who knows in future elections what I’ll do, but this specific election, the entire focus is on women’s bodies, and we’re losing rights by the day, and so, to have the most popular female podcast, where most women listen to the show in the country, it felt like a no-brainer,” Cooper said. In October, Cooper uploaded an interview with the Democratic presidential nominee in the final weeks of her campaign. The interview was met with criticism from right-wing social media users after they accused Cooper of not diving into more urgent issues like Harris’ policies. The Pennsylvania-born podcaster told Forbes that she predicted the fallout from fans before sharing the interview but “didn’t care.” “Listen, I knew it was going to come. I am very aware that my audience is very split. And I again take that with responsibility. I don’t want to alienate people, but I did feel like I had a sense of responsibility,” Cooper said. “So I kind of like didn’t care,” she continued. “When I pressed upload, I was like — not that I didn’t care what people would think, but I knew there was going to be like, ‘Cancel Alex and do all this.’” Cooper, who also offered to interview Trump but he apparently declined, added that “people can say they’re going to cancel me all day” but “they’re still listening.” After being asked if the interview was worth it despite the aftermath, Cooper doubled down on her decision to meet with Harris.

The “Curb Your Enthusiasm” star seemed tickled by what she called a “content interruption” in text at the top of the clip, where she giggled and told her politician husband, “No, you can’t take a shower!

The “Substance” star, in a recent episode of “Hot Ones,” spilled on the emotional impact of the film when asked about the first scene that called on her to cry as an actor. (“Hot Ones” and HuffPost share a parent company, BuzzFeed.) “To be such a young person dealing with loss of your partner, in reading the script, I was so overwhelmed at the kind of grief that I was going to have to tap into,” she told “Hot Ones” host Sean Evans. The Jerry Zucker-directed romance film — which also stars Patrick Swayze along with Whoopi Goldberg and Tony Goldwyn — is Moore’s highest-grossing movie to date. Moore portrays Molly Jensen while Swayze stars as Jensen’s boyfriend, Sam Wheat. In the film, Wheat is murdered only for his ghost to eventually look to protect Jensen from the man that killed him. Moore’s performance in the film would earn her a Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination at the Golden Globe Awards. Moore, who referred to her “iconic” crying technique in the movie and claimed she had “no control” over it, said “Ghost” helped her get over a “hurdle” in her life. “Not that I’ve done it always, there’s still, you know, emotionally whenever we have to be vulnerable is not easy,” she said. Elsewhere in the “Hot Ones” episode, Moore was asked about her motivation to take the part of Elisabeth Sparkle in Coralie Fargeat’s satirical body horror film “The Substance.” Evans, who referred to the actor thinking to herself that the film would either be “really amazing or a total disaster,” asked if Moore finds such a dilemma “exciting.” “It really means that it was holding something that was worth the risk,” said Moore, who added that she felt similarly about the part as she did toward “Ghost.” She later continued, “It had so many different genres mixed together. Truly, I thought, this could either be amazing or a fucking disaster.

Here's What Happens Next.","President-elect Donald Trump’s stunning announcement that he will nominate Kash Patel as FBI director sets the stage for a fresh round of turbulence at a law enforcement agency tasked with protecting the homeland and investigating federal crimes. Patel, a steadfast Trump ally with plans to shake up the bureau, is a study in contrasts from the current tight-lipped director, Christopher Wray, who preaches a “keep calm and tackle hard” mantra. In selecting Patel late Saturday over more conventional contenders, the incoming Republican president is again testing his ability to get the Senate to bend to his will by confirming some of his more provocative nominees. Wray was appointed director by Trump in 2017 and technically has three years left on his 10-year tenure. That length of time is meant to ensure that directors of the nation’s most prominent federal law enforcement agency can operate free from political influence or pressure. Presidents have typically but not always retained the director who was in place at the time they took office, as Democratic President Joe Biden has done with Wray. But it’s also the case that all FBI directors serve at the pleasure of the president; indeed, Wray was nominated after Trump fired James Comey, the FBI chief he inherited in his first term. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Sunday that the Biden administration “adhered to the long-standing norm that FBI directors serve out their full terms because the FBI director is a unique player in the American government system.” Noting that Trump had named Wray to the job, Sullivan told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that “Joe Biden didn’t fire him. He relied upon him to execute his responsibilities as the director of the FBI and allowed him to serve out the fullness of his term. ... So that’s how we approached things and we would like to ensure that the FBI remains an independent institution insulated from politics.” Trump’s announcement means that Wray can either resign from the job, consistent with Trump’s apparent wishes, or wait to be fired once Trump takes office in January. Either way, the selection of a successor is a clear indication that Wray’s days are numbered. Should Wray leave before Patel can be confirmed, the position of acting director would presumably be filled in the interim by the FBI’s current deputy director. The bureau, in a statement Saturday night, said, “Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of threats. Director Wray’s focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.” Republicans may have won control of the Senate, but his confirmation is not assured. There are no doubt lawmakers who support Trump’s desire for a radically overhauled FBI, particularly following federal investigations that resulted in two separate indictments against the president-elect, and who share his sentiment that federal law enforcement has been “weaponized” against conservatives. But Patel is likely to face deep skepticism during his confirmation hearings over his stated plans to rid the government of “conspirators” against Trump, and his claims that he would shut down the FBI’s Pennsylvania Avenue headquarters in the nation’s capital and send the thousands of employees who work there to “chase down criminals” across the country. And while Trump may have wanted a loyalist willing to pursue retribution against his perceived adversaries, that perspective is likely to give pause to senators who believe that the FBI and Justice Department should operate free of political influence and not be tasked with carrying out a president’s personal agenda. Foreshadowing the potentially bruising confirmation fight ahead, Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, wrote on social media late Saturday: “Kash Patel will be another test of the Senate’s power of advice and consent. Patel needs to prove to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he has the right qualifications and, despite his past statements, will put our nation’s public safety over a political agenda focused on retribution.” Trump has also raised the prospect of using recess appointments to push his nominees through the Senate. Patel has made a series of brash claims about his plans for the federal government, but most of those proposals would require backing and buy-in from other officials and would almost certainly encounter significant resistance. His claim that he would reduce the FBI’s footprint and authority stands in contrast to the tack traditionally taken by leaders of the bureau, who invariably say they want more resources — not less. He’s talked about trying to rid the government of “conspirators” against Trump and of going “after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” whether criminally or civilly. Under the FBI’s own guidelines, criminal investigations can’t be rooted in arbitrary or groundless speculation but instead must have an authorized purpose to detect or interrupt criminal activity. And while the FBI conducts investigations, the responsibility of filing federal charges, or bringing a lawsuit on behalf of the federal government, falls to the Justice Department. Trump last week said he intended to nominate former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi to serve as attorney general. Patel’s proposed crackdown on leaks of information by government officials to the media is an indication that he wants the Justice Department to undo its current policy prohibiting the secret seizure of reporters’ phone records in leak investigations. That policy was implemented by Attorney General Merrick Garland following an uproar over the revelation that federal prosecutors had obtained subpoenas for journalists’ phone records.

It’s unclear whether he intends to carry through on that pledge or how it would be greeted at a time when the U.S. is facing what officials say is a heightened threat of terrorism. He also says he wants to close down the FBI’s storied Pennsylvania Avenue headquarters and send the employees who work there across the country. It’s not clear if that’s a hyperbolic claim simply reflecting disdain for the “deep state” or something he’d actually try to implement, but how that would look in practice remains a big question mark.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. With endorsements from Wirecutter, Consumer Reports and Gear Patrol (plus thousands upon thousands of Amazon reviews), Coway is one of the most highly-rated brands in the crowded space of air purification. When a Coway air purifier is on sale, you want to act fast to grab one at a discounted price. Right now, you can get the popular Coway Airmega AP-1512HH air purifier for 38% off its list price at Amazon for Black Friday. Unlike many bulky (and downright hideous) home appliances, the clean design of this device will actually make you want to show it off. It’s on sale in white and could easily become your favorite machine-turned-home decor. The sleek purifier has a complex, three-stage filter that captures and reduces up to 99.97% of irritating particles ― including dust, pollutants and other allergens ― along with odors and volatile organic compounds (like airborne gases from your gas stove). It’s designed to purify rooms of up to 361 square feet and has a timer feature you can set to run one, four or eight hours before it automatically shuts off. When it comes time to replace your filters (the odor filter every six months and the HEPA once a year), the process couldn’t be any easier and a complete replacement set is easily available to grab with your purchase. You can see some promising reviews for the Coway down below or head back up to snag one for an impressive 38% off its regular price. “Three weeks in and we couldn’t be happier with this filter. Quiet and effective. If it detects contaminants the light turns red and the fan kicks up to high, which is a bit loud (when set to auto), but it doesn’t run high for long. We have a woodstove for heat, which creates a lot of dust. This has cut it back a lot, and has cut the amount of dusting I have to do overall. We’re both breathing easier, and its cut down on the smell of our 2 large house dogs.” — SpragueRiverHomestead  “Fed up with musty odors and dust this winter, we got several air purifiers. This one deserves its top reputation. It really cleans the air in a room―even a large room. I used to wake up with a headache every day; once we started using this guy, those were a thing of the past. My son was having trouble with allergies (probably to dust or mold), and we swapped units. After he started running this one in his room, he was fine. He could get a similar result with the other units only by running them at a higher, noisy level.The sleep mode is not completely silent, but quiet enough for me (a light sleeper). It is also not completely dark, but it’s easy enough to put an opaque object over the bright LED that can’t be turned off when the unit is on.One really great feature of this purifier is that if it loses power and then the power comes on again, it will start up with the same setting it was on before. All of our other air purifiers, once the power goes off, you have to manually turn it on again for it to run. Why does this matter? I plugged the Coway airmega into a smart plug so that I can control it from afar―turn it on when I’m away from home, or schedule it to run for a certain number of hours each day and turn itself off and on again. I can’t do that with the Levoits.” — Emommy  “I have two Coway air purifiers in my apartment and have run them non-stop for nearly 5 years, aside from cleaning and changing filters. Online reviews said they are durable and this is quite true. Some of my favorite features:- Easy to service. There are three layers of filtration - a screen behind the front cover that captures lint, hair, large items, an activated charcoal filter to remove odors and a true HEPA filter behind that. Removing the outer cover to vacuum the screen is very easy. Accessing the other filters is also a snap.- Very durable. As I mentioned, mine are nearly 5 years old and one has always been in a room with my two boys, so seen its fair share of knocks.- Ability to run int auto mode where it speeds up if it detects pollutants- Adjustable sensitivity to pollutants- Three fan speeds. The first two are nearly silent. The 3rd (high) makes a decent amount of noise, but the only time I ever use high is during extreme wildfire/smog events or if cooking something smokey. Middle speed moves plenty of air and should be all you need.The only con I can think of is that my interior designer wife is not crazy about their appearance. Doesn’t bother me. One of my favorite home products.” — SeattleGreen By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

That’s according to democracy activist and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, chairman of the New York-based Renew Democracy Initiative. Kasparov should know. As a celebrity chess prodigy in the 1980s, he tried to use his fame to buck the Communist system in Russia. Kasparov became a dissident after the Soviet Union fell, when Russian president Vladimir Putin began turning back the clock on the country’s nascent democracy. “There’s certain lessons that I think we can learn from Russia in the ’90s. The blurring of the lines between business and politics, which is called oligarchy by classical political philosophy ― it’s extremely dangerous,” Kasparov told HuffPost in a recent interview. Russia and some other post-Soviet countries, like Belarus or Kazahkstan, have struggled with democratic reforms and are run by strongmen able to subvert the law to reward their supporters and punish their opponents. And Musk ― as both a major government contractor (by way of his companies) and now, potentially, as a Trump official with either formal or informal authority over how the government is reorganized ― could go beyond merely being wealthy and influential, Kasparov said. “Musk could be the first oligarch,” he said. “Having the largest private contractor of the U.S. government potentially being in the position of supervising the entire U.S. budget? I mean, just think about it. If this is not classical oligarchy, what is it?” “Oligarchy is not about the amount of money,” Kasparov went on. “Oligarchy is about blurring the line, erasing the line, between business and government.” Ultimately, he said the question will hinge on whether Musk and the still nebulous Department of Government Efficiency — currently not an official agency — will operate within or outside of usual federal government ethics safeguards, and whether Musk will have to step aside from his CEO roles to run DOGE to avoid conflicts of interest. That’s because the concept of “conflicts of interest” doesn’t exist under oligarchy, he said. Official government departments can only be created by Congress, and Trump’s announcement of DOGE made it sound as if the new “department” will be only advisory in nature, at least on paper. Regardless, Musk has posted often on social media in ways suggesting it will have real power. He criticized the expensive F-35 fighter jet program, drawing the ire of many defense analysts. And he posted that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, meant to crack down on fraud in consumer lending, should be eliminated. Things may be clearer after Musk meets with congressional Republicans Dec. 5 on Capitol Hill. Trump has attacked democracy by collapsing the boundaries of what’s seen as normal, Kasparov said. Trump is already the first convicted felon to win the office and the first president to ever be impeached twice. But Kasparov said the thing to watch is not what laws Trump breaks this time but what norms he violates, and what he does simply by using the power of his office. He pointed to the fate of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrectionists as one possible example, saying he wouldn’t be surprised if some were pardoned and they were welcomed into the Oval Office with pomp and circumstance. “Presidential power will allow him to pardon these people, which will send a message to his supporters across the country: They will always be immune if they act on behalf of Donald Trump,” he said. Similarly, he said Trump’s slate of right-wing Cabinet nominees, including Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, represented another effort to break norms. As “something that was abnormal becomes normal, he moves further,” Kasparov said. As for solutions, he said Democrats need to examine the reasons they lost and learn from them. In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, Kasparov laid the blame at the feet of Kamala Harris and her failure to “separate herself from Democrats’ bankrupt and alienating status quo.” “I think she was a bad candidate, and it was a very poor campaign,” he told HuffPost. Strongmen depend on their opponents getting weary and turning inward and away from politics, a luxury Kasparov said Trump critics can’t afford now. “They want us to be passive. And yes, they voted and they lost,” he said of Harris supporters. “But what I learned from the game of chess, and I’ve been saying it at every lecture I did about strategy, [is] you have to understand why you lost.” Kasparov came to prominence in the mid-1980s as a young chess upstart, representing a break from the stodgy apparatchiks favored by Soviet officials as champions. At 22, he was the youngest world chess champion ever. (The 40th anniversary of the famous 48-game, five-month-long match with Anatoly Karpov, considered chess’ version of the famous Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match, is only a few months away.) In 2013, Kasparov fled Russia for the U.S. Now, with professional chess behind him and as the father of children who are U.S. citizens, he said he’s found a second calling in fighting autocracy globally. “It’s somehow in great demand in America,” he said, of his experience living in the Soviet Union and in Putin’s Russia. “I didn’t expect it, but I’m more than happy to share my experience, because I can speak from the position of authority.” The next four years will change America forever.

Grab It Before It Sells Out.","The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount (and when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why). HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. If you want that Dyson power but not the Dyson premium price tag, the brand’s Digital Slim vacuum cleaner might be your best bet, especially since it’s a whopping 50% off right now at Target. While the Digital Slim has some of the makings of a typical Dyson stick vacuum cleaner — a cordless design, an LCD to show you its power levels, an easy-empty canister, a long-lasting rechargeable battery — it differs from other models for being the most compact in the brand’s lineup. This cuts the fat off the more expensive models — you won’t find an LED light or laser here or a plethora of attachments — but in exchange, it’s 30% lighter and 20% smaller than the prototypical Dyson V11. That makes the Digital Slim available at an accessible price point, but at this current half-off discount, it’s even more affordable at $249.99. Compact design aside, the Digital Slim has an LCD that shows the total amount of particles it’s picking up as you clean, the remainder of your runtime left before it needs a recharge (down to the second), if maintenance is ever required and what suction mode it’s in. Set it to “auto” so it automatically adapts its suction power to the type of floor it’s over, “eco” to save on battery or “hig” to get rid of your dustiest woes. Dyson claims it can last up to 40 minutes on a single charge. The vacuum has three head attachments, too, including a no-tangle head brush, a wide nozzle brush tool and a deep crevice tool. The vacuum’s lightweight (it’s only 4.4 pounds!) and small size makes it easier to suck up cobwebs and dust you might see in your living space’s walls or ceilings. If you’re looking for a Dyson that’ll easily stow away, is easy to carry and use and doesn’t have all those premium features, grab the Dyson Digital Slim today while it’s at this shocking discount. And take a look below to see what Amazon reviewers have to say about this nifty cleaner. “I am a huge fan of Dyson product[s], have had their vacuums for years, have the Dyson hair dryer and the Dyson Air Wrap. They are all amazing. Dyson has excellent customer service as well which is a big plus in my book. The Dyson Digital Slim does not disappoint. I love the design, you can see in my last picture that it is definitely slimmer than my other Dyson, and a little smaller in length. But it has as much power as the others that I own. It actually has a little more power on the boost cycle than my other one. My 5th picture show the dog hair that I got out of my carpet in literally one minute of run time. Amazing! I love that it shows you how much battery it has when using the different modes, that is a great feature. And, it is right in your view, no having to check what mode you are in. The bin is easy to empty, just one push on the large red handle and it opens easily and empties with ease. I will never hesitate to recommend a Dyson product to anyone. They are awesome.” — Jan  “This vacuum is great, I have a Dyson ball but it’s really bulky to use for small cleanup jobs. This is perfect! Picks up dog hair like nobody’s business. Only thing I would have liked better is if the handheld trigger was an on or off button, after a while arthritis starts to kick in and it gets rough holding the trigger. Cleanup is simple, just pop open the tank and dump it out. Easy!” — A.S.  “The vacuum rocks. This is our 5th Dyson; the rest are still working somewhere. This one gets the star place in the vacuum closet and the V10 now gets moved near the kid’s space. The slim digital now has kitchen and hallway duty. Which means it will get as rough use as the V10 that has lasted us for a long time. Its only quibbles were managing its filter. The slim digital also has a much bigger filter, its noticeably lighter and looks a little shorter in length for the floor mode. The time left indicator is priceless ― so far it seems pretty accurate. I wonder if it will change as the battery wears. Same attachments - but they work well. This is the workhorse of the kitchen and hall mess and everyone down to the 10yo can use it easily. My biggest gripe with both this one and the V10 is the wall mount. The drywall attachment fasteners are cheap and fail on installation. You need to replace them with substantial anchors. If you are going into wood ― the included screws are acceptable. Why skimp on this? The overall design of the wall mount hasn’t changed much ― its smaller, but the same as the old one. -1star... time to improve.” — Christopher Powell  “It’s a Dyson vacuum. Performance and filtration are top notch. Apparently, the digital slim is very similar to the V11 we have, but lighter (which is a good thing for how it’s used) and has slightly shorter run time. We’ve also had a V8 previously. Every dyson we’ve used has been performing well and prevents dust from reentering the room. Unlike some higher and more expensive models, digital slim’s trigger needs a constant pull, but it didn’t really cause any issue for me on the V11. Therefore, the lighter slim mode should be less of an issue. Overall, I’d say price is the most significant downside for almost any dyson product. Otherwise, they all seem to perform better than similar product from other brands.

Whether you’re a fan of outdoor experiences or someone who really values being prepared, a portable power station can (quite literally) amplify your readiness. It can charge up your devices when you’re away from an outlet, come in clutch if you’re stranded and need to give your phone or hotspot a boost or give you some juice if the power suddenly goes out. We found a “great little gadget to have” during emergencies that can charge those devices in a jiffy, and right now it’s 36% off its typical price after clipping the on-page coupon. (Amazon says its regular price is $109.99, but our trackers say it’s usually $99.21.) It has eight outlet ports, including one USB-C, two USB-A and two quick-charging USB-A. Plus, it even has a built-in LED light for seeing in the dark. This model is compact enough to easily be stowed away in your car in case of emergencies!

Just don’t forget to clip the on-page coupon to get it at its lowest price! “I recently purchased the 88wh and it exceeded my expectations. Its compact size and lightweight design made it easy to carry, and the lithium battery provided ample power for all my devices. The fast charging feature was a lifesaver, quickly recharging my phone and camera. I also appreciated the solar generator option, which came in handy when we were off-grid. Overall, this power station is reliable, efficient, and perfect for outdoor adventures. Highly recommended!” — Shop till you drop  “I moved to Texas where I didn’t know hurricanes were common I purchase this after being without power twice this little geneator was able to go without charging for 2/3 days. It had a bright light attached along with enough power suppply to charge multiple things with two outlets” — Ashley Jordan  “This is a revision as I was able to resolve an open concern that I had with this item with customer service, they are very responsive and considerate, as they resolved the issue. I had initially used this item for a weekend to mostly charge a single cell phone and some battery headlamps over the course of 3 nights, oddly the charger turned off randomly. I took it home and brought it into the office to charge my phone, watch, and headphones, again it turned off between 3 USB devices. What may have occurred and I’m still testing this, is that they device may turn off automatically if one of the devices reaches full charge, either way, this still a compact item and it does it job.” — SBuck427  “I rarely write reviews because honestly who has time BUT this thing is a BEAST!!! I just returned from a week in Cuba (yes it was planned and yes it was on purpose) and they have power outages frequently/daily. I wanted to be able to charge my fan and phone during said outages. When we had power for a few hours, I would make sure to charge the battery pack. I used the battery pack continually for over 10 hours and not even one bar disappeared meaning it was still fully charged. After a few nights with my very loud roommate, I also decided to use my white noise machine so so could sleep. Again I used my battery pack to plug in the noise machine and it lasted all night so I could sleep. I HIGHLY recommend this product. Do not hesitate in purchasing it. It works great and was even charged right out of the box. Very easy to use.” — Victoria Gabroy  “I’m really impressed with the Power Station 88Wh!

The quality of the screen and resolution and whatnots are impeccable. This runs like a dream. Unless you’re just setting it up and then it takes a bit to get going due to all the information you’re logging back in with if you’re an Apple user. The appearance of this thing is beautiful. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a nicer looking laptop than this one. It’s really sleek looking. Very slim too. Also very very very light, so careful when handling it. The keyboard is practically silent when you’re typing on it. The speed on it after setting it up blew me away and I’m so happy I made this purchase. It feels so easy to use when you’re on it. Highly recommend this laptop to any Apple user that was the M3 chip, a newer laptop upgrade and something to do what you need to off of it. It’s amazing.” — Joe  “First off, I’m a gaming PC person. I do digital art as my main career, but wanted a laptop that could help me focus on studies and art. I got an HP Pavillion Aero 13, but it was too distracting. Chromebooks didn’t quite cut it... I’ve used Windows all my life but decided to venture out to try something new to spice up my lifestyle.This is my first time ever ordering a Macintosh product. It came on sale at $849.99 USD from $1,099.99 and saw that it was THIS year’s release. I was in disbelief of how big the discount was. I have only been exposed to the Apple ecosystem for around two years now (through only the iPhone and AirPods) and must tell you that this laptop feels GREAT. Even with the 8GB of RAM, everything is going smooth sails, multitasking is a natural and no program has ever felt slow up to this point. Plus, iPhone weaves extremely nice and smooth with productivity.The laptop is SUPER cool, and I have never felt a laptop this chill EVER. It got warm when installing Adobe products but it cooled off shortly after. Running games and art apps was a breeze! Discord, Word and Photoshop were running just as good as my other computers. My only complaint is all my portable hard drives are not compatible since they use NTFS... but since this was intended to largely complete college projects, I doubt it’ll be an issue.I recommend this laptop if you want a taste of Apple’s computers without spending much. I like having that hybrid world of experiencing both Windows/Android and Mac OS/iOS at my fingertips, so that’s another reason why I ordered this. I don’t regret it one bit and I almost want to hug this mini thing!” — Lawrence  “The price is definitely the worst thing about these machines. However, everything else is great. I got the 16gb ram 512gb storage model with 3 years of AppleCare. The battery is incredible. Last far more than all day. I’ll have it set up watching YouTube while I’m cooking at full volume for a couple hours and it still at 90%. Bring to college all day never had any problem. Never gotten home and has less than 50% battery even after using it in all my classes and between. Snappy when turning it on.

Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount (and when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why). HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Everybody knows it’s best to use proprietary Apple products to charge their Apple devices (or so says the company) when maintaining optimal battery life. However, that doesn’t stop some users from resorting to off-brand options — like the HuffPost reader-favorite 3-in-1 charger design — to save a few coins. But today, I’ve found a good deal for Apple purists and non-purists alike: the official Apple MagSafe charger is on sale for only $25 on Amazon. This little gadget has a 1-meter-long charging cord tech and wirelessly charges those pocketable Apple devices just by setting it on its dock. Usually $39, it’s now 23% off the list price. You can skip the hunt for lower-priced chargers and stay within the Apple ecosystem without breaking the bank. Get the deal while it’s hot because it won’t be around long. Several users say the Apple MagSafe charger provides fast wireless charging and its magnetic backing ensures that Apple products snap into alignment when docked. It’s not bulky, either; this is just a 1-meter cord that can plug into your MacBook or a USB-C port and a small charging hub fit for iPhone 12 and later models and any Apple AirPods with charging cases. The MagSafe Charger charges up to 25W when paired with a 30W or 35W power adapter. It’s simply the “best wireless charger bar none,” according to one reviewer, and today it’s at a sweet discount. Nab the Apple MagSafe wireless charger today while it’s at its lowest price of the year! “I went thru 3 different MagSafe chargers and this is the only one that fast charges. This is great. Expensive but really does the job and the cord length is great for when I’m at work. May get another just for home!” — Amazon Customer  “Let me start by saying that ever since my iPhone 15 Pro Max updated to iOS 18 none of my cheap wireless chargers are working like they used to. They all say “slow charger”. I’m not sure if Apple changed something or is making it harder for knock offs to work as well as their branded chargers, but I’ve found that the Apple MagSafe chargers are the best and do the best. I wish all chargers were 2m length standard since 1m is never enough. So, I invested in this one and it works great.” — Kyle N.  “It is Apple MagSafe, cool, fast charging, no need to bother plugging cable every time you charge your phone” — Yoonjae  “I had the 15w magsafe before and it was fast charging my phone, but when I bought my 16 pro Max I decided to change to the newer one, and you can really feel the difference that it goes faster and I like that it is a little smaller and more compact than the previous version, I have the (6.6ft) one and it makes my life easier so I can be lying down charging my phone! 😅 If you have an iPhone you must have this charger!” — Alexander Neptaly Chilel  “Slightly smaller than the previous version, this Apple accessory nonetheless does the job well. If you’re using this with other accessories (a small stand, or case, or such) you’ll want to verify that this will fit correctly.” — Ulkesh By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

We take great joy in hunting down these finds, especially when the holiday season rolls around. Nothing is more satisfying than being able to hit checkout on a cart that includes a gift for the hard-to-please design snob on your list along with a fresh three-pack of undershirts.

Ahead, we rounded up 12 special gifts that offer more than your average department store find.

We bet you can't believe how little it costs either. Available in two sizes, the vase has a slim neck and wide base for visual contrast, and the distressed finish gives the whole thing an artisan-like touch. Whether your giftee is the type to display fake plants only or look after real ones, the vase is watertight, so they won't have to worry. The neutral cream color can also lend itself well to many different decor styles. Promising review: ""Bought these online and picked them up in the store same day! If you haven't already bought these, and you're thinking about it, just go ahead and purchase because they do not disappoint! Who would've thought Target had such nice decor that could compete with Pottery Barn and CB2. Great job Target because these are heavy, beautiful and elevate any room!"" — DTarp A great gift for someone who's always hosting or likes to make their own cocktails, this five-piece set has a stunning gold-tone finish that makes the tools as much decorative as it is functional. The set includes a bar spoon, jigger, strainer and bottle opener, plus a stand with a non-slip base to show them all off. Promising review: ""The gold-tone finish is stunning and adds a touch of luxury to my home bar. The stand keeps everything organized and within easy reach. It's both beautiful and functional — a must-have for any cocktail enthusiast!"" — Lana You have to click through the reviewer photos to properly fall in love with this 9-inch marble catchall tray from Target’s Threshold home goods brand. With a scalloped exterior and a smooth finish, it has the ultra-minimal presence of something you’d see in Kim Kardashian’s comically minimal Hidden Hills mansion — without the unfathomable price tag. Promising review: ""Love this!! Had this on the wish list forever and decided to purchase. Super cute and pretty. Warm, creamy, neutral color. Heavy and well made. Glad I got this!"" — Summer65 With the three elegant, neutral shades, gold hardware and sling-front, this Universal Thread crossbody bag looks like others that cost well over $100. The three pockets can collectively hold up to 3 liters and the strap is adjustable. There are even credit card pockets to help your giftee keep their things organized. Promising review: ""I LOVE this bag. It's small, but big enough to store everything I need on the go. I have gotten so many compliments as well from people and they're always shocked to hear I got it from Target."" — lexi This rectangular clock is reminiscent of design snob-approved timepieces like Newgate’s classic Wideboy alarm clock (a version of which we also spotted at Rejuvenation). It is six inches wide and uses one AA battery. For the crunchiest person on your list, try this highly-rated meditation pillow that definitely could have some from the local health food store or hippie emporium. It's 16 inches in diameter and the removable recycled polyester cover is machine-washable. Promising review: ""I typically need 2 cushions, but this one is high enough to support my back really well. The buckwheat is really nice for those who prefer a bit of a more solid surface. I also like the handle on the side for portability. As a bonus, the green looks great with my decor!"" — Shannan Just smile and nod when everyone asks you about the out-of-the-way antique shop where you scored this “vintage” reindeer ornament. The pink ceramic confection is decorated with (what else) fluttering doe eyes, a tiny red nose and plenty of gold accents. It measures about 3 inches in height. Promising review: ""This ornament is detailed, cute, and high quality. It really looks like a vintage Christmas decoration! I hope we get more ornaments like this in the future."" — Sydney The hefty tube hoop earring has become a staple at intimidating fashion boutiques. Prices vary depending on the brand and construction, but it's more than possible to gift this look on a budget, thanks to earrings like these, which are plated with 14k gold. They're just over half an inch tall, making for a perfect accessory that will complement a variety of ensembles. Did it come from a high-end Japanese outdoor boutique or is it just an ERA (extra-regular-ass) Thermos? This 24-ounce stainless steel food container from the original emotional support cup brand is vacuum insulated to keep hot contents at temperature for 12 hours, and cold items chilly for up to 24. The lid even doubles as a serving bowl. A mainstay at the type of trendy culinary boutique that's been dubbed a “shoppy shop,” this umami-rich soy-based sauce by Bachan has a “teriyaki-ish” flavor, according to the brand, and is traditionally used to “glaze” meat and seafood dishes. Let your flavor-chasing giftee assume you made a pilgrimage to Brooklyn to painstakingly select this condiment, even if all you did was stop at your local Target. Promising review: ""What can I say, This sauce is so versatile and flavorful! I use this with almost everything. Cooking eggs, throw some sauce inside, Grilled some steaks drizzle some sauce on top to finish it off. Need a marinate, just let your chicken soak for even less then an hour and it comes out as if it was marinating all night! I can go on and on! I love you Bachan! thank you for coming onto my life!!"" — Dee Cambra I can’t believe I just used “nostalgic” as a descriptor for a disposable camera, and yet… Regardless, folks at any age will get a kick out of this pre-smartphone-era mainstay. Its artistic wrapping is a step up from the standard drugstore packaging, and your recipient can get their film developed at a number of participating CVS locations. Sure, it’s a pretty specific gift, but if you know a music nerd who has a turntable in their home, this is a surefire crowd-pleaser. If you’re anything like me, you may have the same Pavlovian response to the sounds of Vince Guaraldi’s piano and will be instantaneously transported back to wherever you spent your childhood.

Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount (and when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why). HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Even if you’re not on TikTok, you might have heard about the legendary Tineco cordless vacuum-mop that has been going viral on and even off the app for what seems like its entire existence. I never clicked “add to cart” so quickly as I did after I watched the vacuum mop eliminate a big pile of ketchup and mustard in a single pass in the clip below. As a person deep into her 30s I can confirm that I would absolutely lose my mind if I witnessed this at a party pic.twitter.com/ELzBOcFXLB “The best purchase I made in my whole life is my Tineco,” one TikTok user responded. “Every time I use it I’m still amazed.” Now that I’ve owned a Tineco iFloor 3 Breeze Complete vacuum mop for a while (I believe that’s technically Tineco’s Floor ONE S3 vacuum mop in the TikTok above, but they are similar models of essentially the same machine), I can confidently say it’s worth the money — and both models are currently on big-time sale right now for Black Friday deal at Amazon, so it’s a great time to snatch one up. In fact, the iFloor 3 Breeze Complete is at its lowest price of the year when you clip the on-page coupon to take an extra $9 off. Here’s how the Tineco vacuum mop works: There’s a clean water tank and a dirty water tank, and the machine vacuums as a mop roller head uses the clean water to scrub and polish your floor (you can add cleaner if you want, and the Breeze comes with two free bottles of it). The vacuum not only hoovers up dirt, but also sucks up the dirty water left from the mopping process. This is a huge advantage over most wiping robot mops, which scrub well enough but don’t actually remove dirty water. In fact, I was downright alarmed to discover how disgusting my dirty tank became as I cleaned, considering that I do regularly mop my floors and I don’t even have kids or pets tracking dirt around. What I’m about to show is you is one of my greatest shames, but also proof of how well this thing works: I’m now determined to live so that my dirty water tank is merely a slight parchment color, rather than this horrifying SOS. But the Tineco’s mopping is clearly effective, and I was also shocked at how lightweight and maneuverable it is. The self-propelling feature means it’s very easy for most people to use; it never makes my wrist ache or feels heavy to guide around. And although you do need to rinse certain parts after each use, that isn’t laborious or difficult, either (it takes about one whole minute). The Tineco even performs a self-cleaning process on the mop head. I was extremely skeptical about that part of the process, but it left the roller looking like it’d never even been used before. I consider myself a robot mop and vac aficionado, and I was impressed. While this machine may not polish like the sort of professional-grade floor cleaner an industrial custodian might use, or get down into grout lines like a traditional stringy mop, it is effective and clearly great for regular or daily use. Its cordless design and lightweight maneuverability mean mopping doesn’t even feel like a chore, anyway. It’s actually pretty fun (I now think of it as my ongoing Dirty Water Tank Challenge). Tineco does offer more expensive and feature-packed models, but the iFloor Breeze 3 has a run time of about 20 minutes per charge, and I found I could clean all my hard floors before I needed to plug the Breeze back in. Paying more wasn’t worth it for my needs, though you can also grab the Floor ONE S3 that has a runtime of 35 minutes. This is the lowest list price we’ve seen all year, so grab it before the coupon goes away."
"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/unrwa-halt-aid-deliveries-main-gaza-crossing_n_674c3b9ce4b08cdfa53b3174",2024-12-01,"wafaa shurafa, samy magdy , tia goldenberg","UN Halts Aid Shipments Through Gaza's Main Crossing After Looting","DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Sunday it is halting aid deliveries through the main cargo crossing into the war-ravaged Gaza Strip because of the threat of armed gangs who have looted convoys. It blamed the breakdown of law and order in large part on Israeli policies. In Israel, a former defense minister and fierce critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and a hard-liner on the Palestinians — accused the government of ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, where a military offensive continues. The U.N. agency’s decision could worsen Gaza’s humanitarian crisis as a second cold, rainy winter sets in, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in squalid tent camps and reliant on international aid. Experts already warned of famine in the north, which Israeli forces have almost completely isolated since early October. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the main aid provider in Gaza, said the route leading to the Kerem Shalom crossing is too dangerous on the Gaza side. Armed men looted nearly 100 trucks on the route in mid-November. Kerem Shalom is the only crossing between Israel and Gaza that is designed for cargo shipments and has been the main artery for aid since the Rafah crossing with Egypt was shut in May. Last month, nearly two-thirds of aid entering Gaza came through Kerem Shalom, and in previous months it accounted for even more, according to Israeli figures. In an X post, Lazzarini largely blamed Israel for the breakdown of humanitarian operations in Gaza, citing “political decisions to restrict the amounts of aid,” lack of safety on routes and Israel’s targeting of the Hamas-run police force, which previously provided public security. “Yesterday we had assurances aid would be fine. We tried to move five trucks and they were all taken,” Scott Anderson, director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza, told The Associated Press. “So we’ve kind of reached a point where it makes no sense to continue to try to move aid if it’s just gonna be looted.” When asked whether UNRWA has seen evidence supporting Israeli claims that Hamas has been behind aid looting, he emphasized that there’s no systemic diversion of aid in Gaza. A spokesman for UNICEF, Ammar Ammar, confirmed the security situation was “unacceptable” and said it was evaluating its operations at the crossing. The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza said on X that it will continue to work with the international community to increase aid into Gaza through Kerem Shalom and other crossings, and said UNRWA coordinated less than 10% of the aid that entered Gaza in November. The Israeli military accuses UNRWA of having allowed Hamas to infiltrate its ranks — allegations the agency denies — and passed legislation to sever ties with it last month. Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least six people overnight, including two children, ages 6 and 8, in their family’s tent, medical officials said Sunday. The strike in the Muwasi area, a sprawling coastal camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people, also wounded their mother and 8-month-old sister, according to nearby Nasser Hospital. An Associated Press reporter saw the bodies, which were buried in the sand. A separate strike in the southern city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, killed four men, according to hospital records. The Israeli military said it was not aware of strikes in either location. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its daily strikes across Gaza often kill women and children. A former top Israeli general and defense minister accused the government of ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, where the army has sealed off the towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and the Jabaliya refugee camp and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter. Moshe Yaalon, who served as defense minister under Netanyahu before quitting in 2016, said the current far-right government is determined to “occupy, to annex, to ethnically cleanse.” Pressed by a local news outlet on Saturday, Yaalon said: “(They) are actually cleaning the territory of Arabs.” He added Sunday in an interview with Israeli radio: “My issue is not with the soldiers of the Israeli army. On the contrary: I’m speaking on behalf of commanders who are active in northern Gaza and turned to me because they are troubled by what is happening there. They are being placed in life-threatening situations; they are being thrust into moral dilemmas.” Netanyahu’s Likud party criticized his earlier remarks, accusing him of making “false statements” that are “a prize for the International Criminal Court and the camp of Israel haters.” The ICC has issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu, another former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and a Hamas commander, accusing them of crimes against humanity. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations of genocide against Israel. Israel rejects the allegations and says both courts are biased against it. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Some 100 captives are still held inside Gaza, around two-thirds believed to be alive. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 44,429 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has destroyed vast areas of the coastal enclave and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Israel reached a ceasefire with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militants last week that has largely held, but that agreement did not address the war in Gaza. Gaza ceasefire efforts have stalled as Israel rejected Hamas’ demand for a complete withdrawal from the territory. The Biden administration has said it will make another push for a deal. “There are negotiations taking place behind the scenes, and it can be done,” Israel’s mostly ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, said Sunday after meeting with the mother of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, who appeared in a video released Saturday by Hamas. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo and Goldenberg from Tel Aviv, Israel. ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Possibly the most coveted of all hair styling products, the Dyson Airwrap can quite literally do it all from curling to shaping, smoothing, curling and drying — all without the use of damaging extreme heat and using a Dyson-developed reverse airflow technology. This is one luxury eye product from the trusted apothecary-inspired brand Kiehl's that I afford myself again and again simply because of how luscious and nourishing it is. I'm not sure if it's because of its very subtle green hue or the carefully selected inclusion of ingredients, but I find that just a few dots around my eye and orbital bone instantly brighten my skin and makes me look more awake. The ultra-creamy formula contains a rich base of avocado oil, antioxidant-rich beta-carotene and sodium PCA, a humectant derived from amino acids that helps to condition skin. Kiehl's is offering up to 50% off sitewide through Dec. 3. If you're looking to make a big investment in a great hair dryer, then look no further than the cult-fave Dyson Supersonic.

The FlexStyle features a swivel function, which changes the 90-degree positioning of the arm into more of a traditional-shaped hair dryer to help make it less cumbersome for all-over styling and easier for creating multi-directional curls.

Since it first hit the TikTok beauty scene many years ago, the Cosrx snail mucin power essence has been launched into the cult-favorite stratosphere and is probably one of the best-known K-beauty products out there. When I first purchased it, I figured the “snail” designation was beauty-speak for something else, but… no, there’s actually harvested and filtered snail slime in this formula, and for good reason. (Snail mucin has been used in cosmetics since the 1980s, when Chilean snail farmers observed that when their skin was in contact with snails, it was softer, and cuts seemed to heal faster.) I know many people (including myself) whose skin has been completely changed with the consistent use of this incredibly hydrating serum, which addresses dryness and redness and just generally improves the look and feel of skin. When discussing skin care, there's always talk about ingredient penetration and what we can be doing to ensure that our skin is getting the most out of the products we are using. This 5-in-1 facial device —which I happen to own — aims to help with just that, while also offering the myriad benefits of light therapy and sonic massage.I actually look forward to using the UFO, mostly because it feels so good on my face, but also because I've been a big proponent of light therapy. Using the free app, you can choose between eight different full-spectrum and ultraviolet-free light settings, each one aimed at addressing a specific skin concern, from collagen loss to acne and inflammation to dullness. My favorite is the yellow setting which instantly calms my sensitive and perpetually red skin and patches of keratosis plilaris.You can choose from various pre-programmed mask treatments as well as thermo- or cryotherapy settings. Thermo is designed to push skin care ingredients deeper into the epidermis as the heated surface passes across your skin, while the cold treatment claims to depuff, and both feel incredible. Foreo is offering up to 50% on all of the brand's skin care devices through Dec. 3 The Isdin Eryfotona Actinica ultralight emulsion SPF 50+ is a mineral sunscreen formulation that HuffPost beauty editors are very familiar with and adore for its ability to work incredibly well with sensitive and acne-prone skin and appear virtually undetectable on the skin thanks to its white cast-free finish. This Barcelona-based skin care brand’s sunscreen is made with zinc oxide, DNA repair enzymes and vitamin E — so not only is it preventing and addressing existing sun damage, but it’s helping to nourish and repair the skin as well. The formula also includes a blend of peptides, which can help to address fine lines and even promote collagen production, according to dermatologists that we’ve previously spoken to. According to previous guidance from dermatologists, peptides are key for plumping skin, reducing the appearance of fines and addressing loss of firmness.

Merit's hydrating blush balm deposits a creamy and radiant veil of color that lets your natural skin shine through while also conditioning it thanks to the inclusion of antioxidant-rich vitamin E. The soft, lightweight and beginner-friendly formula uses micro-fine pigment powders to avoid a cakey or line-exaggerating finish, and it's available in eight flexible shades like a petal baby pink, poppy red and soft burgundy. Merit is offering 20% off sitewide through Dec. 2, with discounts automatically applied at checkout. This revered natural deodorant promises a sensitive skin-friendly formula that claims to ward off odor for up to 48 hours, without the use of parabens or aluminum.

Instead, this supportive design uses soft wire and a three-dimensional suspension support layer to keep the wearer feeling lifted, shaped and secure, while also eliminating that dreaded side bulge. Find it in several colors and sizes.

Bloom, an erotic audio platform, surveyed 300 adult users about the fantasies they’d want to see more of in porn and erotica. They found these were the top five most popular themes among women (the percentage indicates the number of female respondents who said they’d like to see more of it). 1. Threesomes (77%) 2. Women receiving oral (54%) 3. Romantic sex (52%) 4. Rough sex (52%) 5. Domination (50%) Though we were surprised to see “threesomes” at the top of the list for women, the sex experts we interviewed didn’t necessarily feel the same way. They offered some interesting insights into why some of these tropes are so popular. Our sexual fantasies empower us to “combat feelings of inadequacy or self-doubt,” Los Angeles clinical psychologist Nazanin Moali, host of the “Sexology” podcast, told HuffPost. So they serve a crucial function, especially for women who may have been conditioned to feel shame around their sexuality, she explained. “For instance, in a scenario involving a threesome, one might visualize themselves as not only desirable but also proficient in satisfying multiple partners,” Moali said. “This serves as a counterweight to the self-doubt enforced by societal expectations.” Therapist and sexologist Nicoletta Heidegger, host of the “Sluts and Scholars” podcast, told HuffPost she was not surprised by anything that made it into the top five, as the findings here are in line with similar surveys and research on the topic. (She also pointed out that people who already use an erotic audio platform are not necessarily a representative sample of the general population — an important thing to note when looking at the results.) For sex researcher Justin Lehmiller’s 2018 book, “Tell Me What You Want,” he surveyed more than 4,000 Americans about their fantasies and found that group sex — threesomes in particular — were indeed one of the most common turn-ons. But there was some variation in how likely people were to voice this fantasy, how likely they were to act on it and how likely there were to enjoy the experience if they did. Straight women were the least likely to share their group sex fantasy, the least likely to act on it and have the least positive experience when they do. Women with any degree of same-sex attraction (lesbian, bisexual, queer or pansexual) were more likely to talk about these group sex fantasies, more likely to act on them and more likely to have a positive experience when compared with straight women. Moali said she believes there’s an “intriguing connection” between women’s fondness for romantic intimacy and their appreciation of oral pleasure, which both made the top five. “The depiction of women receiving oral sex has witnessed a surge in various romantic storylines, like ‘Bridgerton,’ possibly portraying it as the ultimate gesture of love and acceptance,” she said. “For numerous women, it goes beyond mere physicality, underscoring the importance of feeling valued and cherished. This narrative resonates with the preference for adult content that accentuates emotional bonds.” And it doesn’t come as a shock that more than half of women showed an interest in seeing more rough sex and domination in porn, both of our experts said. According to Heidegger, there are many reasons these kinds of fantasies are so popular among cis women. For one, many women are in charge of so much at home and at work in their everyday lives that the idea of letting someone else call the shots for a bit is appealing. For others, it’s a chance to reclaim their sexual desires after having negative or unwanted sexual experiences. “If you are a woman, chances are you have experienced some type of non-consensual encounter — unwanted eyes, unwanted comments, unwanted touch,” Heidegger said. “Fantasy is a place for us to re-narrate and take ownership of our desires and stories again. To create a new narrative and a corrective experience in our mind for past painful experiences.” One thing that did surprise Heidegger about the Bloom survey was what was not on the list. “I am surprised, however, that there wasn’t a higher percentage of gay and lesbian themes, as those are usually highly watched for women,” she said. When asked about the differences between what men and women generally want to see in porn, Heidegger explained that it’s “not so binary.” “There are some gender differences, but a lot of science, including Lehmiller’s book ‘Tell Me What You Want’ and other research, says cisgendered men and women fantasize about many similar topics,” she said. “The way they interact with these desires may look different, however.” One of the differences across genders is how much men and women prioritize a narrative in the sexual content they consume. Generally speaking, cis women report caring more about the context, setting and story, Heidegger said. “This may be due to estrogen-driven folks having more responsive desire, as opposed to spontaneous desire,” she said. “This is often why many women turn to audio erotica or erotic content made by women.” Moali agreed that women tend to gravitate toward porn with “narratives that carry emotional depth and context” and “a storyline or character development.” Men, however, have historically been drawn to more “visually explicit content,” Moali said, “like videos showcasing different sexual acts.” “Although the landscape of porn has evolved in the past decade, historically, explicit content has been primarily tailored towards men, lacking emotional depth between characters,” she said. “Fantasy is a place for us to re-narrate and take ownership of our desires and stories again.” Another factor to consider: Women may have underlying safety concerns when it comes to sex, which makes backstory more important to their enjoyment, Moali said. “Those with past sexual trauma might find it triggering to engage without a relational context, with fears for the safety of all involved hindering their experience,” she said. “Contextual pornography can provide a safer avenue for sexual exploration.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Some believe innate gender differences determine what sexual content we’re drawn to, while others acknowledge the role that social and cultural conditioning play “in our beliefs about what is acceptable for us to like,” she said. This “can affect what kinds of content or things we interact with — or give ourselves permission to interact with,” Heidegger said. “In other words, are ‘boys’ just born to love trucks and the color blue? No. Though the research is growing, there is still a greater need for studies that looks at more diverse, cross-cultural LGBTQ+ fantasies and desires.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

They’re really pissed now,” said Carville on his “Politics War Room” podcast with Al Hunt. “The damage that the 2024 campaign has done, the damage that this decade has done to the Democratic brand is almost unfathomable, almost unfathomable.” The Harris campaign spent $1.5 billion during its 15-week run, The New York Times reported last month. That figure has since alarmed several critics, including some who have blasted the campaign for reportedly dropping $900,000 to advertise on the Las Vegas Sphere or for its continued, postelection push for donations. The campaign was roughly $20 million in debt following its election loss, sources told the Politico and NewsNation, although the campaign denies this. Carville, a lead strategist for Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, used a scene from the 1967 film “The Graduate” to offer a swift piece of advice to the Democratic National Committee. “One word, audit,” he said. He later continued, “I would say, policy number one, is we’re going to audit everything. We’re going to audit the campaign, we’re going to audit Future Forward, we’re going to audit the DNC so people can know.” He noted that Future Forward, a Democratic super PAC that supported Harris’ bid, raised over $900 million before predicting that it ended up with $1 billion prior to Election Day. “That’s two and a half frickin’ billion dollars. Do you have any idea where this money went? Does anybody have any idea where that money went?” said Carville while looping in his $1 billion figure to the reported $1.5 billion in spending.

In fact, psychologist and sex therapist Shannon Chavez told HuffPost that it’s “more common than not” for couples to experience a dry spell. And yet sexless marriages are still treated as a taboo subject. Over time, spouses may start feeling more like roommates than sexual partners. And it can become a cycle in which not having sex breeds more sexlessness and makes the thought of doing it more awkward or intimidating. If you’re stuck in a sexual rut or think you might be headed toward a sexless marriage, know that you’re not alone. We asked sex therapists to share the common causes behind sexless marriages so you know what to look out for in your own relationship. In relationships, communication is key, certainly when it comes to the more intimate matters, like sex. Talking about your fantasies, your desires and your insecurities requires vulnerability, which can be uncomfortable for some people. But don’t let that stop you from having these important talks: The more you open up, the easier these conversations will become. “Couples who are not talking about sex end up drifting apart and losing touch with what they want and need in their sexual relationship,” Chavez said. “They are not engaging and growing with the changes in their sexuality and may be out of touch with one another and their own sexual interests.” When you’re stressed, sex may be the last thing on your mind. You’re busy worrying about crippling student loan debt or taking care of the kids — not getting busy. Chronic stress can lead to elevated levels of the hormone cortisol in the body, which can mess with your sex drive. “Whether it’s about children, work or finances, stress can play a huge role in reducing sex drives, reducing desire to have sex, reducing the energy we have to have sex and reducing the time we have available to have sex,” said Jesse Kahn, sex therapist and director at the Gender & Sexuality Therapy Collective. Being overly stressed or fatigued can make sex feel “more like something you have to do rather than a pleasure activity,” Chavez added. During these busy or overwhelming times, consider scheduling sex instead of waiting around for the mood to strike. “Sometimes, sex needs to be planned,” Kahn said. “Which may require us pushing back on the false narrative that sex needs to be spontaneous.” It’s normal for a couple’s sex drive to fluctuate over the course of a relationship, meaning you and your partner may not always be (or ever be) on the exact same page sexually. But if you can talk openly about your different levels of desire and reach a compromise that works for you, mismatched libidos shouldn’t pose a major issue. However, if left unaddressed, tensions may arise and give way to periods of sexlessness. Often, the higher libido partner feels rejected when their advances are denied and he or she may eventually stop initiating. The lower libido partner can feel put-upon by all of the requests or feel inadequate because they think they can’t meet their partner’s needs. “Sometimes [mismatched sex drives] are managed and it’s working for everyone. And sometimes it’s not being managed,” Kahn said. “When the issue goes unmanaged — and I don’t mean ‘solved,’ not all issues need to be or can be solved — we start to avoid the conversation entirely and then avoid the activity as well.” Physical health conditions can impact a person’s sex drive or ability to have sex, but so, too, can mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, past sexual trauma and others. Certain medications can also cause sexual dysfunction. “These concerns can impact desire and need for connection,” Chavez said. “Others include low self-esteem and body image issues. If you are dealing with these concerns, it can dampen desire and your willingness to be sexual with a partner.” When you and your partner are arguing a lot, recovering from infidelity or just feeling disconnected from one another, those issues can spill into the bedroom. “Relationship issues can lead to anger, resentment, disappointment, hurt or betrayal and lead to lack of desire,” Chavez said. “Some of these issues never get resolved or when they do, lead to feeling shut out or more hurt.” Sex therapist Gracie Landes said that while some couples may be able to have sex when they’re angry with each other, many cannot. “Lingering resentments and unresolved arguments erode an otherwise good sexual connection,” she said. Criticism is one of the biggest predictors of divorce, according to relationship researcher John Gottman. Note that criticism is different than offering advice to your spouse or airing a grievance in a measured, constructive way. Hurtful remarks can feel like an attack and cause a rift in the bedroom too, sex therapist Stephen Snyder said. “Relationships thrive on acceptance,” said Snyder, author of “Love Worth Making.” “Sexual relationships especially, since your sexual self is relatively immature and easily hurt. Criticizing your partner, or feeling criticized by them, is kryptonite for your sexual relationship. Avoid these things at all costs.” Sometimes sex is an awesome, orgasm-filled bodily adventure; sometimes it’s just kind of meh. Expecting every sexual experience to blow your mind is setting yourself up for disappointment, which can deter you from even trying. “Unrealistic expectations around sex can build pressure and a performance focus on sex,” Chavez said. “It becomes less about connection and intimate time together and more about performance goals around sex. This leads to low desire and sexual avoidance.” Fears about not being able to perform (getting or maintaining an erection, giving or having an orgasm) can cause so much anxiety leading up to sex that it becomes easier for some couples to just throw in the towel altogether. The misguided thinking is this: If I don’t try, then I can’t fail. “While thinking and talking about sexual anxiety and sexual functioning issues can be difficult and filled with a lot of shame, there are a lot of ways to navigate both and continue to have sex,” Kahn said. “Silence feeds shame and shame feeds anxiety.” According to Landes, a “fear of rocking the boat” can sometimes lead to a dead bedroom. One partner may want to suggest shaking things up to break out of the rut (BDSM, anyone?). But they don’t say anything because they’re worried about how their spouse will react. “Sometimes in long-term relationships, people get into ruts and won’t suggest or try new things because they’re afraid the other person won’t like it, will get upset or distance themselves,” Landes said. “Fear of taking risks sucks the energy out of a sexual partnership.” Early in the relationship, the sex is new so it feels hot and exciting. Over time, though, couples can grow accustomed to the same routine, which may lead to a sexual malaise. But know that your sexuality (and your partner’s) is constantly evolving, and there are always new things to try and discover, Kahn said. “When we stop being curious, stop allowing for growth and start assuming, sex can become mundane,” Kahn said. “Try refocusing on eroticism and ask yourself what turns you on, what makes you feel pleasure, and what makes you feel desired. Exploring ways to increase curiosity, excitement and playfulness in your sexual lives can modify a rigid repertoire.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Try 'Second City' Travel.","As we approach the summer travel season, many people will soon be jetting off to iconic destinations like Rome, Paris, Tokyo and New York City. These cities are popular for a reason ― they’re full of fun attractions, delicious food and picturesque sites. But visitors to such hot spots can also expect massive crowds and peak prices. There is, however, another way to explore exciting destinations without those drawbacks. It’s called “second city” travel. But what exactly is it and how do you take full advantage of this kind of trip? Below, travel experts break it down. “Second-city travel means skipping the most popular city or region in an area and visiting the second-, third-, or fourth- (and so on) most-known spots,” said Phil Dengler, co-founder of The Vacationer. “Ultimately, you are avoiding the traditional and known tourist destinations that are often overcrowded. Instead of visiting Miami, you could visit Fort Lauderdale or Palm Beach.” Although the literal meaning of the term refers to a country’s second most famous or populous city, it has indeed expanded to refer more generally to lesser-known destinations. Over the years, some have also interpreted “second city” travel to mean tacking on one of these less popular destinations to a trip built around a classic spot like Rome. “Often it’s the smaller, lesser known city in a region,” said Laura Lindsay, a travel trends and destinations expert at Skyscanner. “For example, in Southern California, San Diego would be considered a ‘second city’ and Los Angeles a primary city and on the East Coast, Boston would be the ‘second city’ and New York City the primary city.” “Second cities” might not be the most obvious choices for tourists, but these more under-the-radar destinations can still offer enough attractions, food and cultural experiences to make for a wonderful vacation. “Second cities often have fewer crowds, are cheaper, and offer a more authentic experience,” Dengler said. “While places like New York City have a ton to offer, they can often feel hollow and inauthentic with tourist attractions at every corner.” In addition to the affordability and greater sense of calm, second cities can also provide a special charm and more unique travel experience. “The main benefit of second city travel is discovering hidden gems and off-the-beaten path locations,” said Ravi Roth, a travel expert and host of “The Gaycation Travel Show.” “I recently traveled to Italy and Venice, and took an hour train ride to Verona, which offers incredible food, landmarks and hidden gems. The best part was that it wasn’t overly populated.” Visiting a destination that isn’t overrun with tourists allows travelers to better interact with the community that lives there. “These trips can provide opportunities to connect with locals and become immersed in the culture, which leads to a deeper understanding of the city,” said Gordon Gurnik, chief operating officer at Hilton Grand Vacations. Drawing from Skyscanner data, Lindsay noted that smaller island or coastal destinations like Crete, Mallorca and Cancun are attractive options for travelers looking to visit Greece, Spain or Mexico. “Understated second cities definitely don’t stand in the shadows of their more showy neighbors,” she said. “Often packed with local flair, amazing food, great value and a more laid-back pace, second cities are not to be missed.” In this era of overtourism, turning to second city trips also help mitigate the negative impact that the travel industry can have on the environment. “We have seen a rise in people looking for ways to make tourism more sustainable,” said travel blogger Rocky Trifari. “The second cities trend helps reduce the heavy burden on the most frequently visited cities while opening up the possibility for tourists to walk a path (slightly) less traveled!” “When planning a second city trip, I recommend researching the most populous places within driving distance of the top one,” Dengler advised. “Doing that betters your odds of being able to fly into an international airport, which are often cheaper and have better routes than regional ones.” Indeed, a drawback of second cities is that they sometimes require a more expensive or inconvenient combination of planes, trains and automobiles to get there. Be mindful of transportation options as you choose a destination. “The biggest con to second city travel is that the most popular city is the most popular for a reason,” added travel blogger Sean Lau. “Chances are, you might miss some of the most iconic landmarks and attractions of a destination by going to the ‘second city’ instead.” But even if you aren’t seeing a country or state’s classic sites, you can still have a fulfilling and exciting experience in your second city of choice. “Pick a place that has enough things for you to do and consider booking a room at a smaller boutique hotel or bed and breakfast,” Dengler said. Wherever you decide to go, make sure to do your research ahead of time. “‘Second cities’ are sometimes not as developed as the ‘main’ city, especially if you are not in a very developed country,” Lau noted. “This might mean you’ll need to rent your own car to get around, or this might mean you need to avoid certain neighborhoods because they are potentially dangerous. And if you are visiting a foreign country where English is not common, the ‘second city’ might require you to know a little bit of the local language.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clean-suitcase-luggage-travel-hygiene-ano_l_6745e28ee4b0fffc5a46727b",2024-12-01,"caroline bologna","Reminder: You Need To Clean Your Suitcase","The last few years have served as a reminder of the importance of good travel health practices. From frequent hand-washing and sanitizing to face masks, there are many ways people can practice strong hygiene and ward off disease when they’re on the road. But after returning home from vacation, there’s another step many still overlook: cleaning their suitcases. “There are two types of people in this world — one who unpacks as soon as they get back from a trip and one who leaves it sitting there for a few days,” Jamie Adams, the “cleanfluencer” behind Jamie’s Journey, told HuffPost. “But how many people take the time to clean their luggage when they get back?” Experts recommend giving your suitcase a good cleaning between every trip you take. “Your luggage picks up more dirt and germs than you might realize, from conveyor belts to hotel rooms,” said Courtney Landry, a product development manager with Norwex. “The exterior of your suitcase becomes a host to millions of bacteria as it travels, collecting dust, dirt and debris.” Cleaning your luggage when you return home is not just about keeping dirt away but about protecting your health by warding off bacteria and other harmful pathogens. Microbiologist Jason Tetro, aka “The Germ Guy,” emphasized that a piece of luggage can be a vehicle for the spread of infection. “Put it this way ― ask yourself if you have cleaned your hands before you touched your face,” he said. “Most likely the answer is no. What was on that handle that could potentially make you sick? You won’t know. No one can, really. So, it’s best to take the precaution and ensure that you are not putting yourself at risk. Luggage touches everything on the journey, so the best thing to do is keep the surface clean and safe.” Don’t forget that suitcase interiors can also get dirty. “The shoes and clothes we wear can bring in dirt and bacteria ― and in some climates, bugs ― inside the suitcase,” Adams said. “So make sure to add cleaning the inside of your luggage to your post-trip un-packing routine!” In addition to protecting your health, cleaning the inside and outside of your luggage will also keep it fresh and help extend the lifespan of your suitcases. “Luggage is quite an investment, so I want to take care of it,” said Patric Richardson, author of “House Love: A Joyful Guide to Cleaning, Organizing, and Loving the Home You’re In.” “I want the suitcase to last, and it’s just nice to have a clean suitcase,” he added. “It makes going on vacation and getting home more pleasant.” Luggage manufacturers typically offer cleaning guidance for their products, which customers should consult, but if you can’t find specific instructions, the experts who spoke to HuffPost also offered their best practices. “The best way to clean the outside parts of luggage would be to get some soapy water or a multi-purpose cleaner and a scrub brush,” Adams said. She recommended getting a bowl or bucket of water and mixing dish soap like Dawn or any multi-purpose cleaner like Mr. Clean with water. “Then, gently scrub the entire exterior with the soapy water,” Adams advised. “Pay special attention to the handle and wheels! The handle is a main touch point that can harbor a lot of bacteria.” In addition to scrubbing the handle and wheels with soapy water, she also recommended running a disinfecting wipe over those areas, as well as the zipper and any other spots you want to treat. “For the most part, the outside parts are like your hands, except that instead of a sink, you can use the tub,” Tetro said. “Soap and water is really all you need to keep them clean and safe. If you would rather not use the tub, then you can always use a disinfectant. Make sure you leave the product on the surface for a minimum of three minutes.” The soap and water approach works for both hard- and soft-shell luggage, though you might want to use a little less water if your suitcase exterior is made of fabric. “The great thing about suitcase fabrics is they’re really durable,” Richardson said. “I dip a towel into a mixture of dish soap and water, and I just kind of wipe it all down. Then I take another towel with clear water and wipe it down again to rinse it.” Be prepared to use some elbow grease on visible spots that require extra care. “There’s no worse feeling than picking up your suitcase from baggage claim and spotting a big scuff or dark stain,” Landry said. She suggested using multipurpose cleaning solution on a damp microfiber cloth. Cleanfluencer Sharon Garcia is a fan of Fabuloso for tougher stains or dirt buildup. At the end of the process, consider putting your suitcase outside for quick drying if it’s warm out, or just let it air out in your house for a bit before putting it away. Do what you can to keep your luggage clean and fresh until you need it again. “I always store my clean luggage in giant trash bags in the garage to protect it from dust and pests,” Garcia said. “This ensures my luggage remains clean and ready for the next adventure!” “The best way to clean the interior of a suitcase is to first use a blow dryer or a handheld vacuum to get rid of dirt or sand that may be sitting in the bottom of the suitcase,” Adams said. “Then scrub the inside with a damp, soapy microfiber cloth.” As with the exterior, use disinfecting spray or wipe the interior down with a disinfecting cloth. “Nothing beats a disinfectant wipe for this purpose,” Tetro said. “It’s quick, reliable and fast. Just make sure that it is compatible with the fabric. You can also spray rubbing alcohol onto the surfaces and let it dry. Alcohol is a great sanitizer for both hands and fabrics.” If you’ve spilled your travel shampoo or soap, try to attack those spots as well. “I use vinegar and water and spray it thoroughly until it’s very damp,” Richardson said. “Then I wipe it clean with a dry towel. Vinegar can cut through soap. And if there’s a moldy smell or anything from packing your suitcase with damp items, that will help as well.” Don’t forget you can often remove your suitcase inserts and wash and dry those separately as well. Otherwise, leave your luggage open to air-dry and prevent moisture buildup. “One of the biggest issues I’ve encountered with luggage post-travel is the funky smells it can hold,” Landry said. “I’ve made it a routine to unpack everything within 24 hours after returning home from travel, giving my suitcase a chance to breathe.” She recommended using an odor-eliminating spray for extra freshness. As you clean your suitcase, take stock of your travel supplies. Assess whether you need new shoe bags or toiletries, for instance. “Part of the cleaning ritual for me might involve putting in a couple of new toothbrushes and travel-sized toothpaste for the next trip,” Richardson said. “Now if someone calls to whisk me away to somewhere glamorous, I’m refreshed and ready to go.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

No matter where, recipes passed on through generations are central to family gatherings. From callaloo to chicken tikka masala, find out what renowned chefs and food influencers around the world are cooking on Christmas Eve. Martha Ortiz Chapa is the head chef at Tuch de Luna at La Casa de la Playa in Riviera Maya. She was the chef-owner of Dulce Patria, which had been named one of the 50 best restaurants in Latin America and the best restaurant in Mexico City before closing earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic. She has also served as a judge on “Top Chef Mexico,” and in 2020 was named one of the 40 best chefs in the world. Our December traditions begin with the Posadas (a religious festival held from Dec. 16-24), which lead the way to the grand celebration of Christmas Eve. During this time, Mexicans hang seven-point-star piñatas (the peaks representing a different capital sin, including gluttony) made with contrasting colored tissue paper and filled with pieces of sugar cane, tejocotes (a fruit), orange wedges, peanuts, candies and sugar-coated almonds. We blindfold the guests, who take turns hitting the piñata until someone breaks it, in celebration of the predominance of virtue and abundance. On Noche Buena (the night that is good), aka Christmas Eve, I elegantly present these crafts to my guests. I usually use a dark tablecloth as a canvas and decorate it with wooden kitchen utensils, such as grinders, spoons and saucepans, surrounded by colorful flowers. I personalize each guest’s place on their plate with a small piñata, which holds inside a traditional sweet or piece of candy and a message of friendship and love, in the hope that they will take it home with them and, when they break it, the abundance of affection, bonds and the celebration of life will grow. As a proud Mexican, I begin with traditional dishes such as romeritos (tender sprigs of seepweed) with cactus strips, and mole (made with at least 50 ingredients) seasoned with dried shrimp. I serve a salad called Noche Buena, which is prepared with diced jicama, apple, beet, orange wedges and crunchy peanuts. For main, we have pork leg in spicy pulque marinade. I wash it down with my personal favorite, a punch of tejocotes, tamarind, jicama pieces, piloncillo (a raw form of pure cane sugar), guavas and spices and a touch of hard liquor. I add the leftover punch to the mother sauce to prepare a fruity mole and serve it with turkey pieces that have a crackling-like crunchy skin. And, if there’s some left over, I make a delicate cheesecake to remember all the flavor of the Posadas days. With this celebration of classic and modern dishes, I honor my grandmother’s cooking and think about the great wealth of ingredients from Mexico. This is how, surrounded with piñatas and sweet smiles, I wish that each Christmas Eve will become an early memory of tradition, lineage, and my pride of being a female Latin, Mexican chef. Julius “The Chef” Jackson is a professional chef, Olympian boxer, community leader and author of the cookbook “My Modern Caribbean Kitchen: 70 Fresh Takes on Island Favorites.” He currently offers private interactive culinary social events through “The Chef’s Cooking Lab” and is the head chef and manager at the nonprofit My Brother’s Workshop Bakery and Café in St. Thomas. We have such a melting pot of cultures in the Virgin Islands that we have created our unique mashup. You can see this to be true in the way we celebrate the Christmas season. It’s very traditional for us to have callaloo as a starter for the Christmas Eve meal. This stew made from okra, spinach and pork is influenced by African cuisine. My personal favorite is the seafood version, which I make with shrimp, conch, lobster and saltfish. The warm green goodness gives me the feeling of the Christmas season on a tropical island. I also love roasting pork for our Christmas Eve or Christmas Day dinners. This dish came about from our Puerto Rican brothers and sisters that migrated to the U.S. Virgin Islands, and we adapted it within our culture. I generously rub the butt, shoulder or the whole pig down with seasonings and cloves, make incisions into the skin to allow the seasonings to penetrate inside the meat and under the skin. Then, I roast the pork for 5-6 hours until the skin is super crispy. This is one of my all-time favorites dishes because I love the tender and salty meat with the crispy skin. The guavaberry fruit has also become a major part of our tradition here in the Virgin Islands. The slightly sweet- and tart-tasting fruit that looks like red and purple blueberry comes from our West Indian neighbors. During Christmas time, we consume guavaberry rum or incorporate it into desserts, such as homemade guavaberry tart and guavaberry cheesecake. After dinner, we carol calypso/quelbe Christmas tunes at home and around our neighborhood, stopping at homes of friends and family members for snacks and rum. Vikas Khanna is an Indian American chef, restaurateur, cookbook author, filmmaker and humanitarian. He grew up in Amritsar, India, served as a judge on “MasterChef India” and received a Michelin star for six consecutive years for his New York restaurant Junoon. He has authored over two dozen books and directed and produced several films. Christmas Eve is celebrated in India with as much fervor as all other religious festivals, especially more so in the northern state of Punjab, where I hail from. For us Punjabis, it is one more occasion to celebrate and feast on good food. We usually plan an elaborate dinner with near and dear ones (which in Punjab can be a lot of people). My special guests on Christmas Eve are all the elderly grandparents who I look forward to cooking for. Most of the dishes I cook are keeping in mind their palate and preferences, so it’s an Indian-style Christmas dinner. It is also my way of expressing my gratitude towards my grandmother, who was my first culinary teacher. December yields some of the best farm produce, giving me an array of choices of ingredients. The weather in Punjab is cold this time of the year, so the dishes are served warm and spicy. I make several dishes using paneer (Indian cottage cheese), because paneer and Punjabis are made for each other. We are a dairy-rich state! So, I make paneer tikka masala for appetizers, stuffed paneer paratha, paneer and mixed vegetables, and a curry. For the meat eaters, I make a chicken version of the same dishes. Also, instead of the popular regional Punjabi dish, chole bhature, which is served at most festive occasions, I prefer making bo wale kulche, which non-Amritsaris find smelly because the dough is double-fermented, but I find them aromatic and absolutely relish them. Some of these recipes are in my book, “Amritsar — Flavours of the Golden City.” After a hearty dinner and loads of friendly conversations, it’s time for desserts. The one dessert that is mandatory at my Christmas Eve dinner is whipped fruit cream with fresh seasonal fruits. It reminds me of my childhood when my grandparents would take me and my siblings out for this treat. Making the same dish for my special guests feels like completing the circle. The happy faces of my guests, especially the grandparents, fill my heart with joy and energize me for the new year ahead.

The first thing that comes to mind when I think about Christmas Eve is my family. We all live in Provence in the southeastern part of France. I have one son, two sisters and six nephews and nieces. In France, Christmas is a very special time when families come together, forget, forgive and give. We always try to get together on Christmas Eve, taking turns to either host or rent a place in the Alps or in the national park of Queyras. Everyone participates with the Christmas Eve meal planning. The kids help prepare puff pastry treats for appetizers that we cut out in Christmas tree shapes and fill with cheese, nuts, honey and raisins. They also like making tapenade (olive paste that’s popular in Provence) and goat cheese mix. Then, we display everything on the table like a buffet so everyone can taste a bit of everything. Traditionally, we also serve some poultry and several sides. For instance, we would include grilled veggies like glazed carrots and sprouts, pureed parsnips or sweet potatoes with spices. For dessert, we have a tradition to serve two cakes: Black Forest, that I’ve been doing according to my mom’s recipe for years probably since I was 10 years old, and a buche, which is a more traditional recipe often made with chestnut puree and chocolate (or you can make it more exotic with mangoes and coconut). Both of my parents, who come from Vietnamese and Italian origins, my sisters and I, love to cook or bake. So, for Christmas lunch, we prepare Vietnamese fried spring rolls, a recipe my grandfather passed on to my mother when she was a young girl and needed to help prepare the meals for her family of six children. For Christmas Day dinner, we usually make a typical French onion soup made with yellow or white onions, olive oil, vegetable broth and a crust of melted cheese and croutons with herbs like thyme and rosemary. It is very simple, tasty and supposed to help you cleanse your body after a heavy meal. Christmas Eve is not all about eating, though. We like to play some group games, like the Wolf, which is a strategy game opposing wolves and villagers that you play in a circle in dim light, even though my father always falls asleep before the end of the game! We also go for a late walk outside in the little village in the Alps called Aiguilles en Queyras, even if it’s freezing, because you know, we do eat more than usual on that night.

She is author of “A Kitchen in Uganda,” one of the most notable food blogs in the country, and three e-books, one of which received a Gourmand World Cookbook Award. Musoki also produces and hosts the podcast “Our Food Stories” where Ugandans share food stories. For my family, Christmas Eve is a time when everyone arrives at my grandparents’ home in Kasese, in western Uganda, from various parts of the country to end the year together. Their home is situated on the edge of one of the many Rwenzori ranges with a dizzying but scenic view. Banana and coffee tree plantations surround the house, giving it a lush green backdrop for our African Christmas. Christmas Eve is more of a preparation day for me and my family. We have 15-20 people crammed in the small kitchen, which is located about 5 meters away from the main house. Each of us has an assigned task. Older male relatives set up a corner to slaughter a mature goat for the meal, while the female relatives peel potatoes, bananas and yams. In another corner of the kitchen, my cousins, nieces and nephews shell fresh beans to make soup, using beans my aunts bring from either their gardens or the market. I love getting involved in the chopping, cutting, cleaning and slicing of all the condiments like tomatoes, onions, local garlic and garden eggs. While everyone is busy, my grandmother puts on a big pot of green banana and black beans katogo (a stew of starch and a protein pottage) on fire to simmer for the evening meal. On Christmas Eve, we also spend some time selecting cookware, such as heavy cast-iron pots for steaming and clay pots for stewing meat and boiling beans. If we don’t have enough, we either go out to the market and purchase some or borrow from generous neighbors. Aside from cooking, this is also a time for the family to share good news, like the birth of a child, graduation, a wedding anniversary or a baptism. This cheerful atmosphere is filled with children playing hide and seek, which is more fun to do at night and among many people. The adults tell stories of their travels while neighbors drop by occasionally to join in on the conversation. We generally serve visitors fresh fruits. My favorite part of Christmas Eve is the camaraderie of the meal preparation. As we roll into the evening, we leisurely peel, slice and eat fruits like mangoes, sugar cane and jackfruit, which I believe “takes a village” to do. This keeps us occupied until the katogo is served on large shared trays, which is often very late into the night.

The university said it was notified by a family member that Carnesecca died in a hospital on Saturday surrounded by his family. St. John’s said the Hall of Fame coach “endeared himself to generations of New Yorkers with his wit and warmth.” Carnesecca was a treasured figure in New York sports in his day, affection for “Little Looie” never wavering in a city with scant patience for its players, coaches, executives and owners. He coached St. John’s for 24 seasons over two stints — making a postseason tournament each year — and became the face of a university whose campus arena in Queens would eventually carry his name. A statue of him was unveiled before the 2021-22 season. When asked once in a question-and-answer session with the school to describe St. John’s, Carnesecca said: “home.” It was home where he coached St. John’s to 18 seasons of at least 20 wins, and 18 NCAA Tournament appearances. It was home where he finished with a 526-200 record and had 30-win seasons in 1985 and 1986. And it was home where St. John’s became a charter member of the Big East Conference and a pillar of its success. He was the coach of the year three times in a league that began play in 1979 and quickly asserted itself as one of the nation’s best. Among his star players during those early Big East years were Chris Mullin, Mark Jackson and Walter Berry. Carnesecca coached St. John’s to the NIT title in 1989, although by then the tournament had long been a poor cousin to the NCAAs. He entered the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992, the year he retired. “I never scored a basket,” he said at his induction, forgoing a sweater for a crisp suit. “The players did everything. Without players, you can’t have a game.” In Memoriam of Lou Carnesecca (1925-2024) pic.twitter.com/wpSon2v9k2 He was an old-school coach, grounded in fundamentals. And through it all, Carnesecca was a swirling, kinetic presence on the sidelines, arms flailing, legs kicking, shirt tails flying, all 5-foot-6 of him curled in exasperation over a missed shot or agonizing call. But his antics never crossed the line into chair-throwing fury. Carnesecca was simply consumed by his players, a love for a game in his marrow, a lifetime spent in schoolyards, beat-up gyms and big-time arenas. He loved the “smell of the sweat” and the “feel of rubber burning” when sneakers met a varnished floor. He remained the consummate gentleman in a sport populated by outsized egos, fierce recruiting wars and a relentless pursuit of the next contract. Mike Tranghese, a former Big East commissioner, once called him “our soul and our conscience” and “one of the giants of the game.” Carnesecca never took himself too famously. He always believed a rough loss should never get in the way of a glass of Chianti and fettuccini with a Bolognese sauce. He held clinics all over the world, making friends, offering toasts wherever he went. He was there with a kind word as well as a wisecrack in his breathy, raspy voice. His family tree may have gone back to Tuscany, but he could hold his own with the best of Borscht Belt comics. “I don’t know if there’s anybody else in coaching like him,” longtime UConn coach Jim Calhoun once told the Hartford Courant. “Even if people hate the Big East nobody hates Looie. If you like basketball, you like Looie. If you like kids, you like Looie.” Lou Carnesecca's dad wanted him to be a doctor. When Lou said to him that he wanted to be a coach, his dad said he'd be a disgrace!But like everything he did in life, Looie marched to this own beat -- all the way to the Hall of Fame. Feature: pic.twitter.com/qamOVGxaod Luigi P. Carnesecca was born on Jan. 5, 1925, the son of Italian immigrants. He grew up in Manhattan, in East Harlem, living above the grocery store and deli owned by his father. He took his heritage seriously, rooting for such New York Yankees as Tony Lazzeri and Joe DiMaggio. After a stretch in the Coast Guard during World War II, he became the coach at his high school — now the longtime basketball power Archbishop Molloy. In 1958, he took an assistant’s job at St. John’s, his alma mater, where he had played baseball on a team that reached the 1949 College World Series, but not varsity basketball. He worked for eight seasons under Joe Lapchick, the lessons about humility and hard work from the Hall of Fame coach lasting a lifetime. Carnesecca would later pass along to Mullin some advice he got from Lapchick: “A peacock today, a feather duster tomorrow.” “I learned more when Coach Lapchick cleared his throat than I could have at any clinic,” Carnesecca said. He succeeded Lapchick in 1965, the 20-win seasons piling up quickly. But after five years, Carnesecca was not immune to the siren song of the pros. He coached the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association for three years, Rick Barry among his players. Years later, during a 1982-83 season in which his St. John’s team would finish 28-5, Carnesecca reflected on the pressure of college coaching and his time in the ABA. “I lost 50 games coaching professionally — that was pressure,” he said. “I didn’t feel like getting out of bed. My mother could coach this team.” His stay in the pros didn’t last long. Carnesecca knew that was not his natural habitat. He said he could give the same halftime speech only so many times. He returned to St. John’s in 1973. Winning seasons followed in quick succession even though his city was no longer the recruiting magnet of generations past. Top high school players migrated south and west to campuses with gleaming arenas and didn’t need the commercial pull of New York to burnish their brand. When asked why he didn’t expand his base in his search of players and venture beyond his city’s five boroughs, Carnesecca knew he had plenty of talent in his neighborhood. He took a subway token — now a relic from bygone generations — out of his pocket. “That’s my recruiting budget,” he said. By the 1984-85 season, Carnesecca and St. John’s captivated New York, a throwback to a time when schools like City College and NYU mattered not only in the Big Apple but across college basketball. The Redmen — their nickname years later changed to the Red Storm — played tough, pulsating games at a packed Madison Square Garden against Syracuse teams coached by Jim Boeheim, Villanova teams coached by Rollie Massimino and Georgetown teams coached by John Thompson and led by Patrick Ewing. It was then the saga of The Sweater took hold. Over the years, Carnesecca would recount his baffling entry into the world of fashion time and again like an embellished family tale. Essentially, St. John’s was getting ready for a road trip to Pittsburgh in January and Carnesecca was under the weather. The building would be drafty, and his wife thought it would be good if he wore a sweater. He found one that had been given to him by an Italian basketball coach. It was a brown pullover with broad turquoise stripes. It never made it into the pages of GQ. “It is ugly, isn’t it?” Carnesecca said. No matter. Mullin hit a winning shot at the buzzer, and the coach had his lucky charm. He stuck with the sweater. Along the way, St. John’s ended Georgetown’s 29-game winning streak and soared to a No. 1 ranking. But there were also two lopsided losses to Georgetown during the 16-2 run with the sweater. He put it away, his luck exhausted with the pullover. He then went with a tan, snowflake number for the NCAA Tournament. St. John’s defeated Southern, Arkansas and Kentucky before a victory over North Carolina State in the West Regional final sent Carnesecca to the Final Four. “When I’m going to my grave,” he said, “this I’ll remember.” St. John’s headed to Lexington, Kentucky, along with two Big East compatriots — Georgetown and Villanova — and Memphis. St. John’s stuck with Georgetown in the semifinals, down 32-28 at halftime. But the Hoyas pulled away to win 77-59, holding Mullin to eight points. “I think we tried everything,” Carnesecca said of Georgetown, which got upset by Villanova in one the sport’s great finals. After he retired, Carnesecca was succeeded by a parade of coaches at St. John’s, Mullin among them. Even into his 90s, some three decades out of coaching, Carnesecca would make his way to The Garden when the Red Storm were there. His gait may have been tentative but his mind and wit nimble, the crowd roaring when the jumbo screen panned in on him. The coach was at home. “It’s going to be very difficult to put the ball down, but the time has come,” he said at his retirement when he was 67. “There are two reasons, really. I still have half of my marbles and I still have a wonderful taste in my mouth about basketball.” The school said Carnesecca leaves behind his wife of 73 years, Mary, as well as daughter Enes and son-in-law Gerard, a granddaughter, and a niece and nephew in addition to extended family. ___ This story corrects Carnesecca’s record at St. John’s in the fifth paragraph. ___ Fred Lief, a retired Associated Press sports writer, was the principal writer of this obituary.

McCabe, a harsh Trump critic since being fired as acting FBI deputy director in his first term, called Trump’s controversial choice a “terrible development” for those working at the agency and for the country who depends on it to be “highly functioning, professional” and “independent.” “The fact that Kash Patel is profoundly unqualified for this job is not even like a matter for debate,” McCabe said. McCabe’s reaction arrived after Trump tapped Patel — who previously served as chief of staff to acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol — to be his FBI director. Trump’s move follows reports that he considered firing FBI Director Christopher Wray and ending his 10-year term early to replace him with Patel. The choice aligns with the president-elect’s affinity for picking loyalists to serve in his cabinet that could go after his perceived foes. Patel has signaled an interest in upending the FBI and once vowed to shut down the agency’s D.C. headquarters on “day one” to replace it as a museum for the “deep state.” McCabe, in a CNN appearance prior to Trump’s announcement, warned that “no part” of the agency’s mission would be “safe” under Patel should he take on a leadership position there. “If you enter into that position with nothing more than a desire to disrupt and destroy the organization, there is a lot of damage someone like Kash Patel could do,” McCabe told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins at the time. On Saturday, McCabe used Trump’s pick to reflect on J. Edgar Hoover’s controversial tenure as FBI director and noted how the agency — under his leadership — “struck fear in the hearts of Americans across the spectrum.” “[That’s] because the director operated at the direction of presidents to collect political intelligence and to utilize the legal authorities, the investigative authorities of the FBI to terrorize and intimidate Americans,” he said. “So the question is, is that where we’re going back to with this nomination? I would argue that Kash Patel would be the perfect person for Donald Trump to nominate if that’s, in fact, his intent for the FBI.” The next four years will change America forever.

Now the steadfast Trump ally has been tapped to lead the federal law enforcement agency he’s pushed to overhaul. A look at Patel, Trump’s pick to replace Christopher Wray atop the FBI. Patel has for years been a loyal ally to Trump, finding common cause over their shared skepticism of government surveillance and the “deep state” — a pejorative catchall used by Trump to refer to government bureaucracy. He was part of a small group of supporters during Trump’s recent criminal trial in New York who accompanied him to the courthouse, where he told reporters that Trump was the victim of an “unconstitutional circus.” That close bond would depart from the modern-day precedent of FBI directors looking to keep presidents at arm’s length. Former FBI Director James Comey, who was fired by Trump in May 2017, memorably recoiled when Trump asked him during a private dinner to pledge his loyalty to him. And Wray, who had no personal connection to Trump when he was picked to replace Comey, broke with Trump on different hot-button issues and served as FBI director during investigations into Trump that ultimately led to his indictment. Patel has signaled through interviews and public statements a determination to upend the FBI and radically reshape its mission. He’s called for dramatically reducing its footprint and limiting its authority, as well as going after government officials who disclose information to reporters. In an interview earlier this year on the “Shawn Ryan Show,” Patel vowed to sever the FBI’s intelligence-gathering activities from the rest of its mission and said he would “shut down” the bureau’s headquarters building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the ‘deep state.’” “And I’d take the seven thousand employees that work in that building and send them across America to go chase down criminals,” he added. In a separate interview with conservative strategist Steve Bannon, Patel said he and others “will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media.” ”We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” Patel said, referring to the 2020 presidential election in which Biden, the Democratic challenger, defeated Trump. “We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly. We’ll figure that out. But yeah, we’re putting you all on notice.” Patel first came to prominence in Trump’s orbit as an outspoken critic of the FBI’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. As a staffer on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired at the time by Rep. Devin Nunes, a Trump loyalist, Patel helped author a four-page report that detailed what it said were errors the Justice Department made in obtaining a warrant to surveil a former Trump campaign adviser. The document, which came to be colloquially known as the “Nunes memo,” was released over vigorous objections from Wray and Justice Department leaders. A subsequent inspector general report identified significant problems with FBI surveillance during the Russia investigation, but also concluded that the inquiry had been opened for a legitimate purpose and found no evidence that the FBI had acted with partisan motives in conducting the probe. Patel has played a role in several legal investigations into Trump. He appeared in 2022 before the Washington grand jury investigating Trump’s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after receiving immunity for his testimony. He also testified at a Colorado court hearing related to Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the violent Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Patel, who at the time of the riot was chief of staff to the then-acting defense secretary, testified that Trump had pre-emptively authorized 10,000 to 20,000 troops to deploy days before the attack. But a Colorado court later found that Patel was “not a credible witness” on the topic. Shortly after Trump left office, Patel launched Fight with Kash, an organization that funds defamation lawsuits and peddles a wide variety of merchandise, including branded socks and other clothing with the “K$H” logo. Patel has also turned to publishing. He wrote a book called “Government Gangsters,” which is part memoir and part screed against the so-called deep state. Patel teamed with Bannon to release a film version. Patel has also authored children’s books that lionize Trump — “The Plot Against the King” features a thinly veiled Hillary Clinton as the villain going after “King Donald” while Kash plays a wizard who thwarts her plans. Patel has been a pitchman for a variety of products marketed to Trump supporters. One dietary supplement he’s promoted claims to be a COVID vaccine “detoxification system.” Records show that Patel has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from consulting for Trump-related entities, including a political action committee and the company that owns Truth Social. Patel helped produce “And Justice For All,” a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner sung by a group of men incarcerated for their role in the Capitol riot. Patel’s candidacy has won support from prominent Trump supporters, including people who support the president-elect’s agenda at the FBI and Justice Department and the idea of using his electoral win to pursue retaliation against his perceived adversaries.

The selection is in keeping with Trump’s view that the government’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies require a radical transformation and his stated desire for retribution against supposed adversaries. It shows how Trump, still fuming over years of federal investigations that shadowed his first administration and later led to his indictment, is moving to place atop the FBI and Justice Department close allies he believes will protect rather than scrutinize him. Patel “played a pivotal role in uncovering the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, standing as an advocate for truth, accountability, and the Constitution,” Trump wrote Saturday night in a social media post. The announcement means current FBI director Christopher Wray must either resign or be fired after Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Wray had previously been named by Trump and began the 10-year term — a length meant to insulate the agency from the political influence of changing administrations — in 2017, after Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey. The decision sets up what’s likely to be an explosive confirmation battle in the Senate not long after Trump’s first pick to lead the Justice Department, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his nomination amid intense scrutiny over sex trafficking allegations. Patel is a lesser-known figure, but his nomination was still expected to cause shockwaves. He’s embraced Trump’s rhetoric about a “deep state,” called for a “comprehensive housecleaning” of government workers who are disloyal to Trump and has referred to journalists as traitors, promising to try to prosecute some reporters. Trump’s nominees will have allies in what will be a Republican-controlled Senate next year, but his picks are not certain of confirmation. With a slim majority, Republicans can only lose a few defectors in the face of expected unified Democratic opposition — though as vice president, JD Vance would be able to break any tie votes. But the president-elect had also raised the prospect of pushing his selections through without Senate approval using a congressional loophole that allows him to make appointments when the Senate is not in session. Wray fell out of favor with the president and his allies. His removal isn’t unexpected given Trump’s long-running public criticism of him and the FBI, particularly in the aftermath of federal investigations — and an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents two years ago — that resulted in indictments that have evaporated. In his final months in office, Trump unsuccessfully pushed the idea of installing Patel as the deputy director at either the FBI or CIA in an effort to strengthen the president’s control of the intelligence community. William Barr, Trump’s attorney general, wrote in his memoir that he told then-chief of staff Mark Meadows that an appointment to Patel as deputy FBI director would happen “over my dead body.” “Patel had virtually no experience that would qualify him to serve at the highest level of the world’s preeminent law enforcement agency,” Barr wrote. Patel’s past proposals, if carried out, would lead to convulsive change for an agency tasked not only with investigating violations of federal law but also protecting the country from terrorist attacks, foreign espionage and other threats. He’s called for dramatically reducing the agency’s footprint, a perspective that sets him apart from earlier directors who have sought additional resources for the bureau, and has suggested closing down the bureau’s headquarters in Washington and “reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state” — Trump’s pejorative catch-all for the federal bureaucracy. And though the Justice Department in 2021 halted the practice of secretly seizing reporters’ phone records during leak investigations, Patel has said he intends to aggressively hunt down government officials who leak information to reporters and change the law to make it easier to sue journalists. During an interview with Steve Bannon last December, Patel said he and others “will go out and find the conspirators not just in government but in the media.” “We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,” Patel said, referring to the 2020 presidential election in which Biden, the Democratic challenger, defeated Trump. “We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminally or civilly. We’ll figure that out. But yeah, we’re putting you all on notice.” Trump also announced Saturday that he would nominate Sheriff Chad Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, to serve as the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency. He has worked closely with Trump’s choice for attorney general, Pam Bondi. Patel, the child of Indian immigrants and a former public defender, spent several years as a Justice Department prosecutor before catching the Trump administration’s attention as a staffer for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The panel’s then-chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., was a strong Trump ally who tasked Patel with running the committee’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. Patel ultimately helped author what became known as the “Nunes Memo,” a four-page report that detailed how it said the Justice Department had erred in obtaining a warrant to surveil a former Trump campaign volunteer. The memo’s release faced vehement opposition from Wray and the Justice Department, who warned that it would be reckless to disclose sensitive information. A subsequent inspector general report identified significant problems with FBI surveillance during the Russia investigation, but also found no evidence that the FBI had acted with partisan motives in conducting the probe and said there had been a legitimate basis to open the inquiry. The Russia investigation fueled Patel’s suspicions of the FBI, the intelligence community and also the media, which he has called “the most powerful enemy the United States has ever seen.” Seizing on compliance errors in the FBI’s use of a spy program that officials say is vital for national security, Patel has accused the FBI of having “weaponized” its surveillance powers against innocent Americans. Patel parlayed that work into influential administration roles on the National Security Council and later as chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. He continued as a loyal Trump lieutenant even after he left office, accompanying the president-elect into court during his criminal trial in New York and asserting to reporters that Trump was the victim of a “constitutional circus.” And he found himself entangled in Trump’s legal woes, appearing two years ago before a federal grand jury that investigated Trump’s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Typically though not always, presidents retain the director they’ve inherited: Biden, for instance, kept Wray in place even though the director was named by Trump, and former President Barack Obama asked Robert Mueller to stay on an extra two years even though Mueller was tapped by Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush. Trump had openly flirted with firing Wray during his first term, taking issue with Wray’s emphasis on the election interference threat from Russia at a time when Trump was focusing on China. Wray also described antifa, an umbrella term for leftist militants, as an ideology rather than an organization, contradicting Trump, who wants to designate it as a terror group. The low-key FBI director had been determined to bring stability to an institution riven by turbulence following the May 2017 firing of Comey by Trump amid an FBI investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump’s 2016 campaign. Wray sought to turn the page on some of the controversies of Comey’s tenure. The FBI, for instance, fired a lead agent from the Russia investigation who sent derogatory text messages about Trump during the course of the inquiry and sidelined a deputy director under Comey who was a key figure in the probe. Wray also announced dozens of corrective actions meant to prevent some of the surveillance abuses that tainted the Russia investigation. The FBI has aggressively investigated multiple assassination attempts against Trump this year and disrupted an Iranian murder-for-hire plot targeting the president-elect that resulted in recently unsealed criminal charges. But none of that was enough to spare Wray from Trump’s ire. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in New York and Fatima Hussein in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

On Wednesday, Hunter Biden came to Capitol Hill and told Republicans that not only was he qualified for his job with Burisma, but he had a more impressive business background than any of them. “You guys have gone out and said I had no credibility, no ― that there’s no way that I should’ve been serving on the board of Burisma,” Biden said, according to a transcript released Thursday. “I just read you my resume,” he said. “I’d put my resume up against any of you, in terms of my responsibility.” It was one of several combative moments from a seven-hour deposition Republicans held Wednesday as part of their impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden. Republicans have not uncovered any official wrongdoing by the president despite months of searching for bribes and improper participation in his son’s business deals. During questioning, Republicans sought to undercut Hunter Biden’s insistence that he was qualified for the job, and they repeatedly asked him to detail the timeline of his addictions to alcohol and crack cocaine ― something he detailed in a 2021 book that Republicans have apparently never consulted. In response to their questions, Biden suggested Republicans were being hypocritical about their own problems with drugs and alcohol. Biden created an instant controversy when he took a high-paying position on Burisma’s board in 2014, while his father, then the vice president, served as the face of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine. State Department officials privately complained that the job created the appearance of a conflict of interest, and Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to announce an investigation, withholding military aid in an extortion scheme that triggered his first impeachment. Those same officials said, however, that Hunter Biden’s Burisma job had no effect on U.S. policy. Republicans have resurrected Trump’s corruption allegations and made them Exhibit A in their impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, claiming his son was useless to Burisma except as a conduit for bribes to his father. The younger Biden has had it both ways with Burisma. On the one hand, he admitted his last name helped him get the board position, saying high-profile Western board members allowed Burisma to send a defiant message to Vladimir Putin, who had launched an invasion of Ukraine. But he’s also insisted that he was qualified ― and he seemed to relish the chance to say so to Republicans directly, citing his Ivy League degrees and previous positions on corporate and nonprofit boards. “I don’t know anybody that was, at that time, that was teaching the No. 1 rated course at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service in the master’s program in terms of foreign policy and advocacy,” Hunter Biden said. “I literally was on 17 ― like, 12 different boards. I only listed like, you know, 10 of them. And so I had an enormous amount of reasons to be on it.” He repeatedly asked his own questions during the deposition. In response to queries about his father meeting his business associates for dinner, he asked Republicans if they had a problem with Donald Trump’s son-in-law landing a $2 billion deal with the Saudi government shortly after serving as an advisor to the president. “When Jared Kushner flies over to Saudi Arabia, picks up $2 billion, comes back, and puts it in his pocket, OK, and he is running for president of the United States, you guys have any problem with that?” (Democrats claimed that several Republicans nodded in agreement in response to the Kushner remark.) When Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) asked if Biden was on drugs when he was on the Burisma board, Biden asked a loaded question of his own. “Mr. Gaetz, look me in the eye. You really think that’s appropriate to ask me?” “Absolutely,” Gaetz said. “Of all the people sitting around this table, do you think that’s appropriate to ask me?” Biden said, seemingly alluding to allegations of drug use that have swirled around Gaetz. Biden wrote a month-by-month account of his addiction to crack cocaine in his 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things,” which included a chapter specifically about Burisma ― but it seemed as though Republicans had no familiarity with the material. “Yes, I was an addict,” Biden said. “What does that have to do with whether or not you’re going to go forward with an impeachment of my father other than to simply try to embarrass me?” Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) followed Gaetz with more questions about the timeline of his addiction and his work for Burisma, asking if Biden should have disclosed his problems to the company. Biden said that’s not how addiction works. “I can guarantee you, at least 30% of the people that you serve with suffer from alcoholism,” Biden said. “Do you think it’s incumbent upon them, if they suffer from alcoholism, that they immediately resign?” Biden said he had good days and bad days struggling with his addiction, and that his close associates knew about his efforts to recover ― as they themselves have testified in their own interviews with lawmakers. As for his actual board work, Biden said he brought expertise on corporate governance to a company that wanted to elevate its financial standards. “My responsibilities were like any other board member, to attend board meetings, to be aware of what the management was doing to try to strive for, you know, accountability, transparency, openness in terms of the reporting, to go through the financials and make certain that the financials were certified by a [certified public accountant],” Biden said. Republicans have repeatedly held up an anecdote from Devon Archer, a business associate of Biden’s who recruited him to Burisma’s board, as evidence that Biden got his father to help the company. Archer told lawmakers in a transcribed interview last year that he witnessed Burisma executives ask Biden to “call D.C.” in December 2015 and that he thought he might have called his father, though Archer admitted he did not witness such a call. House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) has suggested the call resulted in Joe Biden pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was supposedly investigating Burisma. But Hunter Biden said there was no such call. “I know there was never a phone call to my father. I can say that under oath,” he said. (Separately, Hunter Biden testified that he did help Burisma connect with a Democratic consulting firm that helped the company’s executives with visa and other issues.) Biden initially refused to sit for a closed-door deposition when Republicans sent him a subpoena last year, insisting instead on public testimony, before changing his mind and sitting for Wednesday’s interview. House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) said this week that he still wants to have a public hearing, but it’s not clear if Biden remains willing. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, noted in a statement after the deposition that the source of a key bribery allegation has been charged with fabricating the claim and lying to the FBI. Bribes had supposedly been paid by the head of Burisma to both Hunter and Joe Biden, and Republicans had touted the informant’s dubious claim as their very best piece of evidence.

Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who both sit on the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the White House must demand accountability after the mass deaths and ensure aid can reach those starving in Gaza as soon as possible. “People are starving in Gaza. And civilians are dying every day — including in this horrific incident in Gaza City today,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “This has gone on for far too long without sufficient action.” Gaza officials and Israel have traded blame for the death toll. The Gaza Health Ministry said Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd gathered near a convoy of aid trucks on Thursday. Officials described the gunfire as a “massacre,” saying more than 100 had died and more than 760 were injured as desperate Palestinians struggled to get food. It was the first major aid delivery to the area in a month. My statement on the path forward after today’s horrific events in Gaza. I want a negotiated longer term cessation of hostilities to get the hostages out, but right now Israel needs to pause military operations in order to get this humanitarian nightmare under control. pic.twitter.com/iQxY9wc4Di Israel admitted that its troops had fired warning shots but claimed troops fired only on people who approached the trucks in a threatening way. Israel instead attributed many of the deaths to a stampede. “We didn’t open fire on those seeking aid,” the chief military spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told The Associated Press. “Contrary to the accusations, we didn’t open fire on a humanitarian aid convoy, not from the air and not from land. We secured it so it could reach northern Gaza.” The episode quickly prompted international condemnation. Biden said Thursday that any negotiations for a cease-fire will be further complicated, expanding his timeline for any eventual deal. And State Department officials said they were looking into “exactly what took place” in Gaza. But the senators on Thursday urged the White House to act with haste after the mass deaths. Murphy added that the deaths Thursday were the result of “the complete breakdown in social order in Gaza,” saying the situation was “spiraling out of control” without humanitarian aid and a negotiated cease-fire. “To be clear, Hamas started this war and could end it tomorrow by releasing the hostages and surrendering those responsible for the October 7th attacks,” Murphy said. “However, the appalling scenes from Gaza City today and the staggering civilian death toll that has already occurred in Gaza are not in Israel’s nor the United States’ interest.” Murphy said Biden should use “all available leverage” to see Israel and Hamas reach a longer-term cease-fire. Van Hollen added Thursday that “enough is enough.” “America cannot be complicit in this ongoing humanitarian catastrophe,” he wrote. “We know what must be done, now we must do it.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

In a letter penned to the state’s legislature on Wednesday, more than 300 advocacy and LGBTQ organizations, including Freedom Oklahoma, GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, alleged that Ryan Walters, the state’s superintendent of public instruction, is “responsible for fostering a culture of violence and hate against the 2SLGBTQI+ community in Oklahoma schools.” They argued that Walters created a hostile environment at Oklahoma schools which contributed to the death of 16-year-old Nex Benedict, who was assaulted in a school bathroom earlier this month. Benedict had been bullied since last year, the Independent reported, shortly after Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) signed a law requiring students to use bathrooms that match the sex listed on their birth certificate. “Superintendent Walters’ reprehensible conduct shows a willful rejection of his duty to protect the health and welfare of the children in Oklahoma’s public schools and instead has created an environment that allows for hostility and harm for youth like Nex,” the letter stated. “We are outraged that a climate of hate and bigotry has been not only allowed to thrive, but encouraged by the person who is responsible for education in the state of Oklahoma. State officials must be held accountable for bringing the politics of hate into Oklahoma’s schools and making our most vulnerable youth pay the price.” Walters has faced calls for his ouster before. Last month, he faced backlash for passing an emergency rule to bar students from changing the gender marker listed on their school files. He also appointed Chaya Raichik, the creator of the far-right social media account Libs of TikTok, to a seat on Oklahoma’s library review committee earlier this year. Last year, Libs of TiKTok made a post targeting a librarian at an Oklahoma school, NBC News reported. The school district received bomb threats a day after Walters retweeted the Libs of TikTok post, prompting Oklahoma Democrats to push for an impeachment probe of the superintendent. Walters has also been scrutinized for his campaign’s affiliation with Ron “The Real Ron Ron” Causby, a far-right podcaster who has called for violence against transgender people. Walters reportedly participated in a fundraiser event at the influencer’s residence in 2022, according to Media Matters. In a statement sent to HuffPost, Walters dismissed the organizations’ recent call for his removal as a “standard tactic of the radical left” that will “stop at nothing to destroy the country and our state.” “Their woke desperate political game has led them to exploit the death of a young Oklahoman,” Walters said. “I will never stop fighting, I will not play woke gender games, and I will not back down to a woke mob.” Since Benedict’s death, other young people have come forward about the harassment faced by LGBTQ students in Oklahoma, the letter claims. LGBTQ youth mental health organizations have also reported a major increase in crisis calls since the incident, with many callers citing instances of bullying and harassment, the Advocate reported. So far this year, Oklahoma has introduced 54 anti-LGBTQ bills, according to the ACLU, including bans on gender-affirming care and restrictions on what pronouns teachers can use for their students.

Authorities arrested four men and three women in connection to the murder of Mahogany Jaquise Jackson, Birmingham police announced on Wednesday. According to a local Alabama outlet, Jackson was reported missing on Sunday after her mother and sister received a message from her on Facebook messenger. “She sent me a text message that said she was being held hostage and sent her location,’’ Gail Maddox, Jackson’s mother, said. The location Jackson sent was at Serenity Apartments in Birmingham’s Powderly community, but she was nowhere to be found when police arrived, according to the outlet. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Birmingham Police Chief Scott Thurmon said investigators were able to locate Jackson’s body on the side of a road with help from the public. Police located her body around 2:19 a.m. Monday and “determined she had been shot.” Police believe Jackson and all seven suspects knew each other. “I would say all these individuals were acquaintances, they were not strangers to one another,” Thurmon said. Giovonnie Clapp, 23; Blair Green, 25; and Si’nya McCall, 23; were charged with felony murder, kidnapping in the first degree, and sodomy in the first degree. Jeremiah McDowell, 18; Brandon Pope, 24; and Francis Harris, 25; were charged with capital murder/sodomy in the first degree and capital murder/kidnapping in the first degree. Teja Lewis, 25, was also charged with felony murder and assault in the second degree with injury/weapon. Clapp also faces assault charges. All suspects are being held without bond. Thurmon declined to release specific details about Jackson’s kidnapping but mentioned she was taken to several different locations, and the suspects recorded the sexual assault. “It was absolutely disgusting,” Thurmond told reporters.

In a new interview with CNN Thursday, Zendaya shared that meeting Butler — who dons transparent skin, black teeth and an eyebrow-less face for his role as the merciless villain Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen — during her first day on set in Budapest was “quite jarring.” “I was like, ‘Well, this is one way to get to know someone!’” she said of being introduced to Butler in-costume. Feyd-Rautha was previously played by musician Sting in David Lynch’s 1985 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel. “It was also funny because once you get to know Austin, you see that he’s obviously very warm and very kind. From just five seconds ago, being this terrifying creature, and then being like, ‘Hey, how are you? Good to see you!’” she told CNN. Leading man Chalamet echoed having a similarly “crazy” reaction to seeing Butler’s drastic transformation. The “Bones and All” star recalled being nervous when he met Butler in a stunt warehouse to rehearse one of their fight scenes, considering the two had to be “pretty aggressive” with each other “right off the bat.” “(It was) a lot of rehearsal. A lot of practice in LA, before even getting over to Hungary,” Chalamet said. “But it was a dream.” Earlier this week, Butler spoke about how he approached playing the “demonic” character. “The thing with a villainous character — I’d never played a character quite like it, and I didn’t want to judge him,” he said on “The Tonight Show.” He added: “It was a lot of imagining what his childhood was like, and thankfully seeing the first film, Stellan Skarsgard’s character, the Baron, he’s amazing... I just imagined what it would be like growing up with him as my father.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon is set to hold a hearing on the timing of the trial on Friday. If she agrees to Smith’s timeline, the former president would be forced to defend himself just before the Republican National Convention begins and the party officially selects its presidential nominee. The RNC will be held from July 15 to 18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. BREAKING: Jack Smith proposes a new Florida trial date of *July 8* pic.twitter.com/LTKwprj0T5 Trump’s attorneys rejected Smith’s timeline in a filing of their own Thursday, saying the former president would not receive a fair trial while he was simultaneously campaigning for the presidency. He pushed for the trial, to be held in Florida, to begin after the 2024 presidential election, but also offered up Aug. 12 as an alternative start date. “As the leading candidate in the 2024 election, President Trump strongly asserts that a fair trial cannot be conducted this year in a manner consistent with the Constitution, which affords President Trump a Sixth Amendment right to be present and to participate in these proceeding,” his lawyers wrote. “Consistent with the Introduction and reiterating the position that a fair trial cannot be held until after the 2024 Presidential election is concluded.” Trump was indicted last June over his handling of classified documents after he left the White House. Smith’s team has accused the former president of hoarding the files at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida and resisting government efforts to see them returned. The charges include counts of willful retention of documents, making false statements and obstruction of justice, among others. Trump has been charged with 40 counts in total.

Smith’s team this week rebuffed Trump’s claims that he had been unfairly targeted, saying there has “never been a case in American history in which a former official has engaged in conduct remotely similar to Trump’s.” But the former president has regularly lambasted the indictment — and the three others now pending against him — as political witch hunts. His attorneys have pushed claims that he is protected from prosecution, leaning on unprecedentedly broad interpretations of presidential immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court said it would hear arguments on some of those immunity claims in relation to the federal charges he faces related to the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.

On Wednesday, WeightWatchers confirmed that Winfrey would not be standing for reelection on its board of directors in May, thus concluding her nine-year tenure with the company. In a statement on WeightWatchers’ website, Winfrey said she planned to donate her shares in the company to the National Museum of African American History and Culture while remaining “a vocal advocate in advancing [the] conversation” around weight management. “I look forward to continuing to advise and collaborate with WeightWatchers and CEO Sima Sistani in elevating the conversation around recognizing obesity as a chronic condition, working to reduce stigma, and advocating for health equity,” she said. Thilo Semmelbauer, who is WeightWatchers’ chairman of the board, called Winfrey “an inspiring presence and passionate advocate” for all of the company’s members, adding: “What I know for sure, we will dearly miss her presence on the Board.” Winfrey bought a 10% stake in WeightWatchers and joined its board in 2015. Since then, she’s been one of the company’s most prominent celebrity spokespeople and appeared in a number of ad campaigns. By 2017, she’d reportedly lost 42 pounds while on the program. In December, however, Winfrey confirmed that she’d begun taking weight loss medication as a “maintenance tool” after consulting with her doctor. “The fact that there’s a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for,” she told People. “I’m absolutely done with the shaming from other people and particularly myself.” Winfrey notably did not specify which weight loss drug she’d taken, and WeightWatchers has recently begun evolving its program to account for those taking prescription medications as a method to shed weight.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fat-joe-donald-trump-sneakers_n_65e0c47fe4b0d2a2475872b8","Rapper Fat Joe Criticized For Getting A Pair Of Donald Trump-Branded Sneakers","kimberley richards","2024-02-29","Rapper Fat Joe has received backlash on social media after announcing that he owns a pair of golden high-tops from former President Donald Trump’s panned sneaker brand. The Bronx, New York, native showed off one of the shoes in an Instagram Live video that was later posted to his account Monday. The “Lean Back” rapper defended his decision to obtain the shoes, saying that he only did so because he is a sneaker collector. “Me, as a sneaker collector, I had to get my hand on the Trumps,” he said in the video, comparing sneaker collectors to art collectors who may not support or be aware of an artist’s politics. “Listen, I have thousands and thousands and thousands of sneakers,” he said, before someone off camera held a Trump-branded shoe box in front of Fat Joe’s face. The rapper, born Joseph Antonio Cartagena, said in the Instagram Live video that despite having the shoes, he’s a “die-hard Democrat” and not a fan of Trump. “I’m not a Trumper, I dislike Trump, I’m not voting for him — not now, not never,” said Fat Joe, who then held one of the sneakers up to the camera. “But I’m a sneaker collector into the art, so I had to find these.” The rapper later insisted that he didn’t pay for the shoes, saying that he was given a pair because he’s “the biggest in the game.” Fat Joe has previously voiced his support for Democrats Joe Biden and Barack Obama. Prior to Trump’s election in 2016, he told MSNBC that the country “can’t have that guy in office.” A representative for Fat Joe did not immediately return a request for comment. Fat Joe explains why he bought Donald Trump’s new sneakers. pic.twitter.com/L3kUDGUCzw People on X, formerly Twitter, criticized the Bronx rapper this week, with some accusing him of “promoting” the shoes linked to Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential ticket. “We know he a sneaker head but he didn’t have to promote them,” one X user wrote, adding that “he could have put them away in silence.” Meanwhile, an Instagram user suggested under Fat Joe’s post that the Bronx native was essentially supporting Trump’s campaign as it seeks to attract voters of color. “Don’t support his campaign!!! So you can collect a freakin sneaker???” the Instagram user wrote. “So dumb. It literally the dumb shit they think about us. And you proved it true. #disappointed.” Trump launched the golden sneakers, named “The Never Surrender High-Tops,” for $399 — a day after a judge in New York found that he lied about his wealth for years. He was ordered to pay $355 million in penalties in the civil fraud verdict. The former president publicly unveiled the shoes at Sneaker Con in Philadelphia earlier this month. Despite Trump promoting the shoes, a website selling the sneakers says in small print that they “are not designed, manufactured, distributed or sold by Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.” Trump’s shiny shoes were mocked on “Saturday Night Live” last weekend. Host Shane Gillis acted as a man who gains the ability to make people believe his shameless lies after he is gifted the Trump-branded sneakers. (Check out the full “SNL” sketch below.)

James Lankford (R-Okla.) is using a sports metaphor to describe what happened to him when his fellow Republicans, with the urging of former President Donald Trump, rejected a carefully negotiated border security and foreign aid bill in early February. “When I called the play as the quarterback that day, and my own line turned around and sacked me, that was definitely a surprise to me. Because everybody was fully aware what the play call was,” Lankford said in an appearance this week before the conservative Ripon Society in Washington, D.C. Lankford was one of three main negotiators on the bill, along with Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.). After Republicans in September rejected sending more weapons to Ukraine to defend itself against a Russian invasion, and instead demanded that any aid be tied to border security changes, the trio started writing a bill of their own. The final product would have enhanced the president’s ability to shut down the U.S. border in certain circumstances, and would have provided about $60 billion in aid to Ukraine. But many Republicans said it did not go far enough, and some openly worried it would give President Joe Biden a political win in an election year. Trump publicly urged Republicans not to agree to the proposed deal, saying it would benefit Democrats and Biden. House Leader Mike Johnson (R-La.) obliged, saying that even if the bill passed the Senate, he would not bring it up for a vote in the House. “Please, blame it on me,” Trump said in a Las Vegas appearance. Some senators said they were shocked by the bill’s provisions, including the circumstances under which a border shutdown would be allowed. “This is worse than bad negotiation. It’s betrayal,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called the bill “INSANE” in a social media post. But Lankford said Tuesday that none of the Republican senators could honestly claim surprise at the bill’s provisions, because he had briefed them on it well in advance. “I met personally with every single Republican, sat down with him, talked him through all the details, five weeks before it came out, as we’re finalizing text,” Lankford said. “We went through every section of it — the good, the bad and the ugly, both the salad and the steak.” “Everyone knew what was in that bill,” he said. “Everybody knew what was in it.” In the end, only three other Republicans besides Lankford voted to advance the compromise: Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Mitt Romney (Utah). The Senate later passed — with 70 votes — a bill to send aid to Ukraine without any border provisions, but it has not been taken up in the House yet. Ukrainian forces have since lost the strategic eastern town of Avdiivka, a loss attributed to having to ration ammunition and artillery. The next four years will change America forever.

Lankford said what happened with the border bill reflected a party base that increasingly prefers getting nothing over having to compromise to get something. “For me, the challenge that we have right now is this sense of an activist base that says ‘I want everything or I want nothing, and nothing is better than something.’ [That] does not not align with many people across the country,” he said. “Because many people across the country are saying, ‘These are hard problems.

There may be more distinguished members of this body throughout our history, but I doubt there were any with any more admiration for the Senate.” To describe McConnell as an institutionalist, however, is to give him an incredibly short shrift. No single man has done more to shape modern American politics, and the modern Senate, than McConnell. He helped create the era of big-money politics; shaped the Supreme Court’s archconservative majority; and ratcheted up Senate obstruction to new levels. All of those came together to define his relationship with former President Donald Trump, the man who would ultimately take over the GOP McConnell built. McConnell’s disdain for Trump — and for the business mogul’s isolationist and protectionist policies — has been obvious at times, but he continued to justify working with him to achieve broader conservative goals, even as Trump brought American democracy to the brink. He rarely backed up his tough talk about opposing Trump with hard actions, and is now stepping aside as Trump is poised to seize control of the GOP yet again. McConnell’s defenders have long portrayed him as holding up the grandest traditions of the upper chamber. But even his longstanding opposition to weakening the filibuster could not stand once it got in the way of an otherwise attainable bit of political power. Well before McConnell was a household name, his name was on a 2003 lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission seeking to overturn the McCain-Feingold reform law, which put restrictions on campaign financing. He had led multiple filibusters against it before its final passage. McConnell’s opposition to the campaign finance reform law flowed from his work raising money for the Republican Party in the 1990s. As momentum built towards reform following the 1996 presidential campaign, McConnell promised, “That will not happen.” But the reform bill did pass in 2002, and was reluctantly signed by President George W. Bush. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld most of the law. But dissents from the conservative justices laid the groundwork for Citizens United vs. FEC. That case and others led to the super PAC era in American politics, in which donors can give infinite sums — sometimes even anonymously — to PACs that support their chosen candidate. McConnell does not deserve sole credit here. Democrats, eager to gain fundraising advantages, also contributed: The California Democratic Party, for instance, also sued to overturn parts of McCain-Feingold. But Americans for Tax Reform head Grover Norquist credited McConnell for essentially waging a solo battle against campaign finance reform in the 1990s and 2000s. “Mitch McConnell changed the direction of the world,” the conservative political activist wrote on social media. “He stopped the destruction of the Republican Party by opposing, delaying and weakening and ultimately defeating the drive for ‘campaign finance reform’ that would have left union bosses as the sole power in America.” That battle, along with McConnell’s own prowess at raising campaign money, helped solidify his support among his GOP colleagues as he sought to lead the caucus. McConnell became the GOP’s Senate leader in 2006, but most Americans first saw his impact in 2009, when Obama entered the presidency amid lofty rhetoric about bipartisanship. McConnell ensured that rhetoric would not become reality. He made the GOP’s main strategy one of obstruction, pressuring Republican senators not to break off and support Obama administration policies — even if some would later go on to support bipartisan deals on immigration and gun control during Obama’s second term. The use of the filibuster — a procedural hurdle requiring bills to receive 60 votes instead of 50 to pass — went from a tactic to an expectation. He put it bluntly in an interview in October 2010: “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.” His obstructionist goals culminated in 2016, when he refused to meet with or consider Obama’s nomination of then-D.C. Court of Appeals Judge Merrick Garland to serve on the Supreme Court (more on this later). Once Trump became president, however, the reputation McConnell had earned as a master tactician faltered. His long-hyped, long-awaited attempt to repeal Obamacare went down with the late Sen. John McCain’s thumbs-down “no” vote in July 2017. “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!” Trump tweeted. But Trump and McConnell’s efforts to stop Democrats’ expansion of health insurance had permanently failed. Republicans successfully passed tax cuts favoring corporations and the wealthy — the GOP equivalent of low-hanging fruit — later in 2017, but that was the last of their legislative accomplishments. Arguably, McConnell’s most lasting legacy is how he reshaped the nation’s courts — and blew up Senate norms to put as many conservatives into lifetime federal judgeships as possible. He will forever be remembered for denying a Supreme Court seat to President Barack Obama. In February 2016, barely an hour after Justice Antonin Scalia had died, McConnell made the unprecedented announcement that he would block any Obama nominee to fill the vacancy, saying voters should first choose the next president in November and allow the winner to appoint the next justice. Trump won in November, and when Democrats filibustered his appointment of Neil Gorsuch, McConnell used the Senate’s rarely invoked “nuclear option” and eliminated the filibuster — an institution he had long defended — for Supreme Court nominees. Thanks entirely to that change, Republicans were able to confirm Gorsuch. Three years later, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September 2020, McConnell ignored his own precedent and raced to fill the vacancy with Amy Coney Barrett just weeks before Joe Biden was elected. McConnell delivered both of those vacancies to Trump, who reliably filled them, along with a 2018 vacancy, with conservative picks. Without McConnell, Trump would have filled just one seat, and today’s Supreme Court wouldn’t have its current 6-3 conservative supermajority — responsible for the court’s most stunning decisions in recent years, including the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Asked Wednesday to name McConnell’s greatest accomplishment, Senate Republicans said the same thing again and again: his hand in reshaping the Supreme Court. “Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Coney Barrett,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told HuffPost. “For sure.” McConnell is also how Trump was able to put more than 230 people into lifetime federal court seats, a massive number of judges to confirm in a single presidential term. McConnell made judicial confirmations his top priority as Senate majority leader, and he worked closely with Trump’s White House and the Federalist Society to keep the pipeline of district and appeals court nominees flowing. Virtually all were male, white right-wing ideologues. By the end of Trump’s term, he had filled almost every vacancy on a U.S. appeals court. Nearly one in every three U.S. appeals court judges was a Trump pick by the end of 2020. “Mitch’s tenure has had many legacies, but no legacy is more consequential than the nomination and confirmation of hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a member of the Judiciary Committee who has butted heads with McConnell, told HuffPost Wednesday. “That is a lasting benefit to the American people, for which I’m deeply grateful.” McConnell had to do business with Trump to win the courts. The relationship between the two Republican leaders was always rocky. Trump ran in the 2016 GOP primaries as a hard-right insurgent against the party elite, including McConnell. His victory forced longtime party leaders to find common ground where they could. For McConnell, that meant blunting Trump’s populist and anti-internationalist instincts while getting what he could out of him. Trump appointed McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, to be his Transportation Secretary, a conciliatory move following Trump’s election-year attacks on the Senate leader. McConnell, meanwhile, covered for Trump’s most inflammatory conduct, brushing off the continued operation of his business as it received millions from foreign governments and claiming ignorance of Trump’s bizarre tweets. After their legislative ups and downs, the relationship between the two Republicans became increasingly frosty, until it ultimately fractured with Trump’s 2020 re-election loss to Biden. When Trump lied and claimed that he had won, McConnell humored him, stating that Trump was “100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.” Then came the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. As Trump directed a mob of supporters to march on the Capitol as electoral votes were being counted, McConnell and the rest of Congress were forced to flee from the violent assault. In a speech from the floor of the Senate after the insurrectionists were cleared, a furious McConnell said that the Senate would not “bow to lawlessness or intimidation” from “thugs, mobs or threats.” The next day, McConnell reportedly told journalist Jonathan Martin that he was “exhilarated” by the fact that Trump had “finally, totally discredited himself.” “He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger,” McConnell told Martin, according to his book, “This Will Not Pass.” But Trump had not discredited himself — not in the eyes of his followers, nor in the eyes of the conservative media that relies on those followers to profit. All Trump had done was to load the metaphorical gun and leave it for McConnell to pull the trigger. McConnell refused. Trump’s second impeachment trial in the Senate, this time for incitement of insurrection, would be the first impeachment of a president who’d already left office. This bit of unprecedented procedure gave McConnell an excuse to let Trump slide. Seven Republicans joined the entire Democratic Party caucus to vote to convict Trump — 10 votes short of the total needed for conviction. McConnell was not among them. “There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day,” McConnell said afterwards. “The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.” But McConnell claimed that a post-office impeachment was unconstitutional. This proved highly consequential: Had Trump been convicted, the Senate could have banned him from seeking office in the future, preventing him from running for president again. And then Trump announced he would run again in 2024. His third presidential campaign would focus on valorizing the insurrection he inspired on Jan. 6 and getting revenge on all his enemies — real or imagined, Democrat or Republican. And yet McConnell is in talks to endorse Trump, whom he has labeled as “despicable” and “practically and morally responsible” for Jan. 6. McConnell’s relationship with Trump, in all its ups and downs, shows what lies at the heart of the soon-to-be-departing Republican leader’s career: Personal humiliations, policy losses and threats to the constitutional order were all part of the price he paid for Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

On the same day McConnell announced his forthcoming retirement as leader, the Supreme Court said it would hear arguments on April 22 on Trump’s absurd claim of “absolute immunity” from prosecution for his actions surrounding Jan. 6. The decision to take up the case for arguments could fatally delay Trump’s prosecution, helping him win re-election, whereby he could become immune from prosecution or even pardon himself.

The show takes a group of reality stars and famous folks and places them in a castle in Scotland to compete for a prize fund. The twist is that among the main cast are “traitors,” deceitful players manipulating non-traitors, or “faithfuls.” That in itself is enough to sell me on watching the show, but one cast member had me hooked week after week. This show, which airs on Peacock, was made for Phaedra Parks. For 10 episodes, Parks has masterfully played the game and reminded viewers why we love seeing her on our screens so much. The former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star has, hands down, been the best traitor Season 2 has seen. And though she doesn’t win it all this season, I make a case on this week’s episode of “I Know That’s Right” for why she should’ve come out on top. For weeks, each time a contestant made an argument for Parks — who’s also a new cast member on Bravo’s “Married to Medicine” — being a traitor, she showed them why it’s not smart to go toe-to-toe with her. That was proved when fellow traitors ― “Big Brother” winner Dan Gheesling and “Survivor” star Parvati Shallow ― at risk of banishment, turned on Parks. They were both voted out. Then it was proved again most recently when “The Bachelor” star Peter Weber, known as “King of the Faithfuls,” organized a campaign to rally the remaining house members to vote Parks out of the castle. Parks walked Weber’s accusations down like the lawyer she is — and she cut every opponent with razor-sharp one-liners and comebacks. Parks maintained her cool the entire game and managed to talk her way out of elimination until right before the finale.

In a statement shared with HuffPost on Friday, the sheriff’s office said the body of Madeline Soto was located in a wooded area about 4:30 p.m. local time and that her family has been notified. Speaking at a news conference earlier Friday, Sheriff John Mina had said authorities were “confident” Madeline was dead after they reviewed disturbing video evidence that appeared to show her mother’s boyfriend, 37-year-old Stephan Sterns, throwing items into a dumpster behind their apartment building in Kissimmee. Madeline’s mother, Jenn Soto, told police she thought Sterns was taking her daughter to school but later found out that the girl never arrived there and she reported her missing. Police had previously said Sterns had dropped Madeline off near her school, but they later learned he never dropped her off at all, Mina said. Video footage appears to show that when Sterns returned to the apartment complex, Madeline was in the car. Police say they think she was already dead at that time. According to Mina, investigators searching the dumpster found Madeline’s backpack and her school-issued laptop. Stern was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of sexual battery and possession of child sexual abuse material. According to an emergency arrest warrant shared with HuffPost, police alleged that Sterns was in possession of several images that were criminal and sexual in nature and videos that depicted an underaged girl. It’s unclear whether the girl in the videos was Madeline, but authorities said in an earlier news release that the “crimes were committed at the family home in Kissimmee.” Madeline’s mother is not considered a suspect in the investigation.

Attorneys for Trump and other co-defendants accused Willis of corruption, saying she improperly hired attorney Nathan Wade as one of three special prosecutors in the sprawling racketeering suit. Willis and Wade admitted to having a past romantic relationship in February after it was unearthed in January. “I think it’s been very much made clear by the argument made today that there are several legal issues to sort through, several factual determinations I have to make, and those aren’t ones I can make at this moment,” Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee said Friday after listening to closing arguments from both sides. “And so I will be taking the time to make sure that I give this case the full consideration it’s due.” Willis has forcefully defended herself from accusations of impropriety. John Merchant, an attorney for co-defendant Michael Roman, argued that the district attorney hired “her boyfriend” and paid him with public funds; thus when the pair had taken trips together, Merchant suggested it had been on the public’s dime. “She put her boyfriend in the spot, paid him, and then reaped the benefits of it,” Merchant said Friday. Roman is a Republican opposition researcher who worked on Trump’s failed 2020 presidential campaign. Willis maintained that she and Wade split costs evenly throughout their relationship, which she said began in the spring of 2022 — after she’d hired Wade, in November 2021. (The relationship ended last summer, Willis said.) When the relationship started has been a main source of contention, as defendants’ attorneys claim that it began in 2019, long before Willis hired Wade. “They knew it was wrong, they hid it, and even when they were called out on it they tried to create an excuse for it by saying it happened after the fact,” Merchant said. McAfee hinted at the questions he considers to be outstanding during an exchange with Fulton County Chief Deputy District Attorney Adam Abbate. “The original and the core financial allegations — there is a relationship, and money has changed hands. There is maybe still an open question of where the ledger stands, but I think it was conceded that the balance could run in the district attorney’s favor,” McAfee told Abbate. “It’s no longer just a theory that money changed hands, it’s no longer just speculation and conjecture,” the judge added. Abbate responded to say that “whether the money had any financial benefit or gain to the district attorney that is all speculation and conjecture.” “Absolutely all speculation and conjecture,” Abbate emphasized. The defendants’ attorneys argued before the judge that a former college friend of Willis vouched for the idea the Willis-Wade relationship began earlier than admitted. Ashleigh Merchant, an attorney for Roman who is married to John Merchant, alleged that a text message from Wade’s former law partner, Terrence Bradley, further proved that point. But Bradley only proved to be an ineffective witness. He evaded questions on the stand earlier this week, saying that he had just been “speculating” in the text message when he said he “absolutely” thought Willis began dating Wade before she hired him. “There’s absolutely no evidence that contradicts that the relationship did not begin around March 2022,” Abbate told the judge Friday.

As of Friday afternoon, Animal Haven in Manhattan received nearly $50,000 in memory of Dipper, who was adopted by Stewart and his family from the shelter over a decade ago, said Animal Haven Executive Director Tiffany Lacey. “In Jon’s message, he never said, ‘Donate to Animal Haven.’ And literally almost minutes after that aired, the donations started coming in,” Lacey told HuffPost of Stewart’s on-air tribute. “I think that it’s a testament to the fact that so many people have lost animals. He touched a nerve that everybody knows the feeling of.” On Monday’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Dipper was memorialized by Stewart as “the best” canine companion after he and his children met the pooch during a fundraiser for the shelter. “They put the dog in my lap, and we left that day feeling really good. We’d helped this great organization, and we also left with this 1-ish-year-old brindle pitbull,” he said while choking back tears. “We named him Dipper, and in a world of good boys, he was the best.” “My wish for you,” he told viewers, “is that one day you find that dog, that one dog. It’s just, it’s the best.” Lacey said the on-air tribute came as a “total surprise” to everyone at the shelter. “We didn’t know that Jon was going to mention us,” she said. In addition to a wave of financial donations following the “Daily Show” episode, the shelter has seen an increase in adoption inquiries and purchases from its online wish lists, she said. “At this time we are overcapacity like so many other shelters, and have well over 100,” Lacey said, tallying the dogs and cats now at Animal Haven. “The money will go directly to care for our current 60 dogs, puppies looking for a home, via vet care, training, food, medicine, treats and love.” In honor of Dipper, the shelter said that it is reducing its adoption fees by $100 for all dogs through March. The hope, the organization said in an online statement, is “that we can fulfill Jon’s wish of helping you find ‘that one dog.’” “Everything kind of surges when something like this starts to happen so I’m hoping the end result, when we look back after a couple of weeks, [is that] our adoption numbers will be up,” Lacey said.

The woman’s stepmother told officers that the victim “was being held against her will” at a motel, and detectives found her at the Evergreen Motel in Inkster, a western suburb of Detroit, according to the police announcement. According to police, officers heard the woman screaming and crying from inside a motel room before they rescued her. The unidentified woman, who is in her 30s, was taken to a hospital for a medical evaluation before being reunited with her family. Investigators who searched the motel seized drugs, cellphones and a firearm, according to the news release. A suspect was also identified in the case, but no one was taken into custody. Detectives are trying to determine if human trafficking was involved, according to the news release. “This may turn out just to be a domestic violence type of deal. This may turn out to be a big human trafficking thing. And it may turn out to be that she finally decided she wanted to go home and just called her stepmom,” Michigan State Police Lt. Mike Shaw told WDIV-TV in Detroit. Investigators are also working to determine what happened when the woman disappeared seven years ago, Shaw told WWJ-TV in Detroit. “It may take us nowhere. It may not be something that we can charge criminally, but at least we got her out of the situation,” he said.

Click here to subscribe. With royal rumors swirling this week, it seems like most internet users’ preferred form of exercise is jumping to conclusions. Folks have been playing a game of “Where’s Waldo” with Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales. On Jan. 16, the palace informed the public that Kate had undergone a “planned” abdominal surgery, as detailed by HuffPost senior reporter Carly Ledbetter. In a statement, the palace said that “based on the current medical advice,” Kate probably won’t return to public duties until after Easter. But people riding the two horsemen of the online apocalypse — X, formerly known as Twitter, and TikTok — have dismissed the official story, instead producing a deluge of memes and theories about Kate’s absence. “yeh so basically Kate Middleton hasn’t been seen in months like she’s actually missing. word on the conspiracy street is that she’s doing 1 of many things - gone for a BBL, growing out her bangs, lost at the Wonka experience. also she’s possibly banksy x” pic.twitter.com/IP20NIKgGl The Kate Middleton reveal on Masked Singer is going to make all of us look silly. BREAKING: Kate Middleton has been spotted at the Willy Wonka experience in Glasgow pic.twitter.com/R4Nf8HMCrP kate middleton’s bbl, rhinoplasty, and facelift is healing. i will not entertain any other conspiracy theory until (if) she reappears. everyone’s speculating on why kate middleton and king charles are out of the public eye i think the answer is obvious ..they got freaky fridayed The speculation comes after news that King Charles had been diagnosed with cancer on Feb. 5. In January, the king underwent surgery after seeking “treatment for an enlarged prostate” earlier that month. (Kate was also receiving her operation at that same hospital.) Although the palace has not disclosed the precise nature of Charles’ illness, they have confirmed it is not prostate cancer. Some folks online have pointed out the contrast between the British press’ dedication to preserving Kate’s privacy and their treatment of Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex — recalling the racist vitriol that myriad tabloids directed toward the duchess. I remember very well when the British press and public demanded to know every detail about Meghan’s childbirth. But when the white duchess goes into hiding for over 2 months they stay mute and claim she deserves privacy and peace. #KateMiddleton pic.twitter.com/EmYOFyIrvT I have no problem with Kate Middleton taking time to recover from whatever is going on with her. I think it’s wonderful, because every day that she enjoys privacy & respect regarding whatever ails her, is further proof that Meghan Markle was intentionally bullied & abused. It needs to be said that the British press’s respect and deference shown to Kate Middleton would have *never* been extended to Meghan in a million years. To all the people vehemently defending Kate Middleton’s privacy, do Meghan Markle next… pic.twitter.com/6jeUNT8wub In December 2021, Meghan won a legal battle against the Daily Mail, claiming that the publication “violated her privacy” by publishing a letter she sent to her father in 2018. Moreover, in December, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, was awarded $180,000 in a lawsuit against tabloid conglomerate Mirror Group Newspapers, alleging that they hacked his phone. Nonetheless, on Thursday, the palace sought to put to bed the rumors regarding Kate’s status.

Lisa Murkowski And Susan Collins Back Nikki Haley In GOP Presidential Race","igor bobic","2024-03-01","WASHINGTON ― Nikki Haley got her first Senate endorsement on Friday from Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski, a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump. “America needs someone with the right values, vigor, and judgment to serve as our next President — and in this race, there is no one better than her,” Murkowski said in a statement ahead of the Alaska GOP primary on Tuesday. “Nikki will be a strong leader and uphold the ideals of the Republican Party while serving as a President for all Americans,” the senator added. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) swiftly followed, telling the Bangor Daily News that she considered Haley to be “extremely well-qualified.” “She has the energy, intellect, and temperament that we need to lead our country in these very tumultuous times,” Collins told the outlet. Both Murkowski and Collins voted to convict Trump in his Jan. 6 impeachment trial. Collins has offered only mild criticism of the former president in recent months, and spoke out against Maine’s decision to leave him off the GOP primary ballot. Murkowski, meanwhile, has been sharply critical of the former president’s tone and conduct, saying recently that his rhetoric is “poisoning our country.” She and Collins are only Haley’s second and third congressional endorsements so far. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) is the lone House member backing her 2024 campaign. Republicans who oppose Trump are on an island in their party right now. Trump swept all four early GOP presidential nominating states and he has the backing of more than 130 Republicans in the House and over 30 Republicans in the Senate, despite facing 91 criminal charges across several jurisdictions. Haley acknowledged earlier this week it’s “very possible” the GOP has fully become the party of Trump. The next four years will change America forever.

The “Cruel Intentions” star has officially parted ways with her agents at Creative Artists Agency (CAA), as well as with her publicity team at Narrative PR, according to reports from Deadline and inside sources who confirmed the news Friday to The Hollywood Reporter. Blair has apparently also dropped Troy Nankin as her manager and parted with attorney Cheryl Snow, as suggested by changes Thursday to her official profile on IMDb Pro. Her newly listed representatives — manager Ben Gaynor and attorneys Berlandi Nussbaum and Joshua Reitzas — did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Blair, who signed with CAA in 2021, made these changes after facing severe backlash for her comment. The actor deleted and apologized for remarks under an Instagram video that slammed Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) for voting against a bill that purportedly would prevent immigration into the U.S. by people who “facilitated” the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Gaza-based Hamas militants. Tlaib said the bill was “unnecessary” and “redundant with already existing federal law.” “Deport all these terrorist supporting goons,” wrote Blair in the since-deleted comment. “Islam has destroyed Muslim countries and then they come here and destroy minds. They know they are liars. Twisted justifications. May they meet their fate.” Many social media users were outraged by the statement. Since the Oct. 7 surprise attack by Hamas, in which an estimated 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage, the Israeli military has killed more than 30,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Much of northern Gaza has been bombarded, and evacuees jammed into the southern areas face starvation as aid deliveries are blocked. The next four years will change America forever.

President Joe Biden on Friday approved humanitarian air drops into Gaza. “In my comment, I mistakenly and inadvertently conflated Muslims with Radical Islamists and fundamentalists, a terrible err in my words, and resulted in hurting countless people I never meant to, and I deeply regret this,” Blair wrote on Instagram on Feb. 13. The actor was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2018 and recently joined Biden at a ceremony for the 33rd anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heath-ledger-death-director-stephen-gaghan_n_65e21440e4b013678e152525","Director Who Was Working With Heath Ledger Reveals New Details About Actor's Death","curtis m. wong","2024-03-01","Writer-director Stephen Gaghan is sharing new details about a movie he was planning to make with Heath Ledger at the time of the “Brokeback Mountain” actor’s death. Appearing on author Malcolm Gladwell’s “Revisionist History” podcast this week, Gaghan recalled his experience developing a film adaptation of Gladwell’s 2005 book, “Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,” with Leonardo DiCaprio in mind for the starring role. While working on the “Blink” script, Gaghan was introduced to Ledger, and ultimately decided that he was better suited for the part. “I’d just had a real connection with him that was kind of unusual and really special to me,” he explained. “I had a feeling that I just love this guy, and I was going to make a bunch of movies with him.” Sadly, those plans came to a halt when Gaghan received a phone call from Ledger’s father and one of the actor’s close friends, who informed him that Ledger had been found dead in New York. “I got a phone call, they were on speakerphone, and it was Heath Ledger’s father, who I had never met,” he told Gladwell. “The dad and the guy who was closest to him in his professional life, they were there with the body. Our script was in bed with him and your book was on the bedside table.” He went on to note: “I think my number was on the script. These guys are, as you can imagine, in shock, and they dialed that number.” Ledger died Jan. 22, 2008, of an accidental overdose that involved several prescription medications. At the time of his death, the 28-year-old had recently completed filming on “The Dark Knight,” and would later posthumously receive an Academy Award for his portrayal of the Joker. Gaghan, whose Hollywood credits include 2000’s “Traffic” and 2005’s “Syriana,” said that he’d never spoken publicly about Ledger’s death prior to his chat with Gladwell. At the time of the phone call, Gaghan and his wife, Minnie Mortimer, were traveling through an airport. “I literally just collapse. It’s never happened to me before or since,” he said. “My feet went out from under me. I just literally sat down because I was like: ‘What? What?’ ... My wife was looking at me. I remember her face and I was just speechless. I just listened and listened and listened. It was just really, really sad. And it’s still sad.” Though the “Blink” adaptation fell by the wayside after Ledger’s death, Gaghan said that he reread the film’s script in advance of his podcast interview, and hinted that it might someday be worth revisiting.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/court-rules-against-sentence-booster-in-jan-6-cases_n_65e2328be4b0d2a2475954c7","Court Rules Against Provision Used To Beef Up Sentences For Jan. 6 Attackers","jonathan nicholson","2024-03-01","A Washington, D.C., court said Friday that a lower court was wrong to apply a provision boosting the punishment for a Texas man convicted in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol — a ruling that could raise questions about many other Jan. 6 defendants’ sentences. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the so-called sentencing enhancement did not apply to one of Larry Brock’s six convictions for his participation in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Brock was briefly on the Senate floor during his 38 minutes in the U.S. Capitol during the attack — which the lower court found was enough to be considered “substantial interference with the administration of justice,” making him eligible for a harsher sentence. The appeals court disagreed. “We hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes,” said Judge Patricia Millett in a written opinion. The case may be significant because that enhancement has been used by federal prosecutors in many other cases involving Jan. 6 insurrectionists. The Washington Post reported it could mean more than 100 could have to be resentenced. The court sent Brock’s case back to district court so the sentence for his felony conviction for obstructing an official proceeding could be reassessed, this time without the enhancement. His initial sentence on that charge was 24 months in prison. But the court left intact Brock’s five other convictions, with concurrent sentences of six to 12 months each and 24 months of probation. Millett wrote in her opinion that the electoral certification process that the Jan. 6 rioters sought to interrupt was not the same as a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding whose disruption would could be seen as obstructing justice, and thus Brock did not qualify for enhanced penalties. “The multi-step process of certifying electoral college votes—as important to our democratic system of government as it is—bears little resemblance to the traditional understanding of the administration of justice as the judicial or quasi-judicial investigation or determination of individual rights,” she wrote. “To the extent that law enforcement is present, it is there to protect the lawmakers and their process, not to investigate individuals’ rights or to enforce Congress’s certification decision. After all, law enforcement is present for security purposes for a broad variety of governmental proceedings that do not involve the ‘administration of justice’—presidential inaugurations, for example, and the pardoning of the Thanksgiving Turkey.” Former president Donald Trump has said the Jan. 6 convicts have been mistreated, likening them to “political prisoners,” and a cottage industry has sprung up in right-wing circles portraying the convicts as victims of political oppression. Brock is one of the highest-profile Jan. 6 insurrectionists, having been caught on camera as one of the older attackers in the Senate chamber wearing a combat-style helmet and a tactical vest. The appeals court said Brock, one of many former military personnel who participated in the attack, told other rioters to “calm down” and not to sit in the Senate president’s chair because it would be disrespectful. But the court also noted that before the attack, Brock called the 2020 election stolen and fraudulent on social media, and told a fellow veteran there needed to be a “plan of action” if Trump was not certified the 2020 winner.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-hunter-biden_n_65e2123fe4b005b858343f93","Nudes For Nothing: Marjorie Taylor Greene Doesn't Ask Hunter Biden About Alleged Sex Crimes","arthur delaney","2024-03-01","WASHINGTON ― Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) passed up her chance to ask Hunter Biden about the compromising photos she had showed during committee hearings. Greene attended an hourslong deposition with President Joe Biden’s son on Wednesday but was among many lawmakers who asked no substantive questions, according to a transcript released Thursday evening. One of Hunter Biden’s vocal antagonists on Capitol Hill, Greene has repeatedly used her time during committee hearings to display images of him apparently engaged in sex acts with prostitutes. Greene said the photos showed that the younger Biden had committed crimes — namely, violations of the Mann Act, a federal law that forbids transporting a person across state lines for illegal sexual activity. “This is showing Hunter Biden paying for a victim’s United flight,” Greene stated during a July hearing, saying that the flight went from Los Angeles to the Washington area. She held up posters with censored images of a naked Biden with unnamed women alongside images of documents that she said indicated he had paid them for sex. “I believe this is a violation of the Mann Act. This is Hunter Biden’s, this is his proof that he bought the ticket. He bought it for this woman right here,” Greene said. The accusation has nothing to do with the corruption allegations that Republicans have chased in their impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden. But Greene claimed that she’s trying to expose the double standards of a Justice Department that had not prosecuted an obvious crime and had failed to “vindicate the rights of these women.” When the House oversight committee in January voted to recommend holding Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress for refusing to sit for a deposition, Greene displayed the pictures again. “This is important evidence of human trafficking, Mann Act violations that we had questions for the president’s son about,” Greene said. The images came from Hunter Biden’s hard drive when he was in the depths of an addiction to crack cocaine while earning millions of dollars from a Ukrainian energy company and other foreign sources. Republicans have claimed that a Ukrainian oligarch used the younger Biden to influence his father, though their main bribery allegation collapsed last month when the Justice Department said that an FBI informant had made it up. In his memoir, Hunter Biden acknowledged that he had perused ads for escort services, though he claimed that he was only looking for drugs. During Wednesday’s deposition, it was Biden who first asked a question of Greene, challenging her to say whether she trusted certain FBI agents and informants involved in his case. The transcript suggests there was some cross-talk before Biden and Greene had a sarcastic exchange that went nowhere. “Are you a businessman, or are you involved in government, Mr. Biden?” Greene asked. “Here’s what I am,” Biden said. “I’m both an attorney, a businessman, and a concerned citizen, Ms. Greene. That’s what I am.” “Just an average citizen,” Greene said. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the House Judiciary Committee chair, then cut them off and directed a staff attorney to ask a question. Greene later chimed in during a round of questions from Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), prompting Biden to say, “Come forward, Ms Greene.” Gaetz then resumed his questioning. Other Republicans asked Biden about his past drug addiction, but nobody brought up his use of escort services. Biden conceded that he’s “made mistakes” but said that they had nothing to do with his father. He said he’s been sober since 2019. Investigatory material obtained and released by Republicans shows that the Justice Department did consider prosecuting Biden for Mann Act violations. He has since been charged with failing to pay his taxes on time and illegally owning a firearm. It’s possible he will face more charges. Hunter Biden has said that he believes Joe Biden’s enemies are trying to humiliate him into a relapse to destroy his father’s presidency. The next four years will change America forever.

CVS and Walgreens both confirmed Friday that they’ve completed the Food and Drug Administration’s certification process to start filling prescriptions for the pills, which can be used to terminate some pregnancies in the first trimester and account for more than half of abortions in the U.S. Walgreens “expects to begin dispensing within a week, consistent with federal and state laws,” said the pharmacy, which operates more than 8,000 locations across the country. Its rollout will begin in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California, and Illinois ― all states that have protected access to abortion in the wake of Roe v. Wade falling in 2022. CVS said it’s starting with a smaller rollout on a slightly later timeline. “We’ll begin filling prescriptions for the medication in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the weeks ahead and will expand to additional states, where allowed by law, on a rolling basis,” said the company, which operates more than 9,000 pharmacies nationwide. The New York Times was the first to report the news. Neither pharmacy will offer mifepristone by mail. That practice has been a source of debate in recent years, though a recent study found that using telehealth to obtain abortion pills through the mail is as safe and effective as seeing a doctor in person for the same purpose. President Joe Biden praised CVS and Walgreens for their announcements Friday and encouraged more pharmacies to seek the certification. “Today is an important milestone in ensuring access to mifepristone, a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for more than 20 years,” he said in a statement. “With major retail pharmacy chains newly certified to dispense medication abortion, many women will soon have the option to pick up their prescription at a local, certified pharmacy—just as they would for any other medication. I encourage all pharmacies that want to pursue this option to seek certification.” More than a dozen states have successfully outlawed abortion following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in 2022 removing federal protections for the procedure. Several other states are enforcing bans on abortion after just a few weeks into pregnancy, leaving the procedure accessible in about just of half of the states. Mifepristone is one half of the two-drug combination usually used in medication abortions, along with misoprostol. But mifepristone has been targeted more intensely for restriction, and even in states where mifepristone remains legal, political maneuvering has stymied access.

After Walgreens announced last year that it would seek certification to sell it in pharmacies, a group of 20 attorneys general from conservative states threatened legal action against the pharmacy if they proceeded with distribution in their states. That included four states where mifepristone is legal: Alaska, Iowa, Kansas and Montana. Walgreens acquiesced to the threat, with a spokesperson calling the matter “a very complex and in flux area of the law.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) chastised Walgreens for bowing to the pressure and canceled a a $54 million contract with the company.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arizona-republicans-legalize-murder_n_65e22084e4b0d2a247594783","Arizona Republicans Push Law That Critics Say Legalizes Murder","roque planas","2024-03-01","Arizona Republicans are rallying behind a proposed law that critics say would amount to legalizing murder. House Bill 2843 would expand the “Castle Doctrine,” which gives people the right to use deadly force when threatened by home intruders, to include trespassers. State Rep. Justin Heap (R) filed the bill to give people living in the border state wider latitude to use force against unauthorized migrants who cut through private property on their way into the United States. “It’s horrifying that Republicans want to allow people to legally shoot and kill migrants,” state Rep. Analise Ortiz (D) told HuffPost. “Especially when so many folks are seeking their legal right to seek asylum in the United States. It’s just wrong.” The bill stems from a decadeslong trend in conservative state legislatures to expand the right of individuals to protect themselves with firearms. Such “stand your ground” laws typically remove the obligation for people to retreat to safety when they feel threatened, and extend immunity to prosecution for those who commit a homicide in cases where they believe they face an attack. Heap said at a Judiciary Committee hearing last month that he filed the bill over concerns brought by local prosecutors who were “having issues in the case where you have farmers and ranchers who want to trespass someone from their property,” by which he meant “remove someone from their property.” He noted concerns about migrants and human traffickers specifically. But Heap’s proposal is more unique than that description suggests, according to Lindsay Nichols, policy director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Castle Doctrine laws, including Arizona’s, have not historically applied to areas outside a person’s home. “It’s a particularly alarming instance of this trend,” Nichols said. “The prospect of a world in which you can be executed without due process for accidentally stepping onto someone’s property is terrifying.” Dustin Williamson, the regional legal director at Everytown for Gun Safety, said Arizona’s expansive gun laws would make the proposal even more dangerous. “Arizona already has a dangerous Shoot First law on the books that allows people to shoot and kill others even if they know they can easily and safely walk away from a confrontation,” Williamson wrote in an email. “To prevent senseless acts of gun violence, lawmakers in the state should reject any attempt to broaden its self-defense laws to further encourage armed vigilantism.” The Arizona House of Representatives passed the bill last week on partisan lines and it has favorable odds in the Senate. Republicans control both houses of the Arizona legislature with slim majorities. The bill is unlikely to become law. Observers expect the state’s Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, to veto the bill if both bodies pass it. Hobbs’ office did not respond to a request for comment. Still, opponents say the proposal harnesses hostility over the hot-button issue of immigration to legalize activity that today constitutes murder. The real-life example of rancher George Alan Kelly is playing out in state court as Heap’s bill moves through the legislature. Heap did not cite the case specifically when explaining his proposal, but Kelly has made headlines for allegedly shooting into a group of unauthorized migrants traveling across his ranch. Prosecutors portray Kelly’s case as far from one of self-defense, however. Kelly, 75, has contended that a man within a group of migrants traveling along his property wielded a semi-automatic rifle. But the criminal complaint against Kelly says that no one within the group possessed a weapon and that Kelly fired without warning from a hidden position. Kelly changed his story about why he opened fire several times. He told sheriff’s deputies that he did not know how Gabriel Cuen Butimea, 48, died and had backed away from the body when he found it, according to court records. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

But the rich economies cumulatively responsible for much of the carbon in the atmosphere saw their average emissions drop down to 1973 levels, driven largely by a transition away from fossil fuel power plants. For the first time in history, zero-carbon sources of energy generated half the total electricity in the world’s advanced economies, according to new data from the Paris-based energy watchdog. Renewables like wind and solar accounted for an “unprecedented” 34% share of power generation. Nuclear power, which a separate IEA report last month forecast would hit record global production next year, made up the rest. Nearly two-thirds of the decline came from the electricity sector. Emissions fell even as the overall gross domestic product of the world’s advanced economies grew by nearly 2%, making 2023’s drop in greenhouse gas the largest percentage decrease outside of an economic recession. Despite a resurgence in countries like Germany that shut down their nuclear power stations, meanwhile, coal’s share of the electricity mix across the rich world plummeted to what the IEA called “an historic low” of 17%. Outside of the Great Depression, demand for coal fell to its lowest level since 1900. The new IEA data came out a day after the Biden administration announced plans to loosen forthcoming rules on planet-heating pollution from power plants, providing a carve-out for existing natural gas-burning facilities, which now generate the bulk of U.S. electricity. The Environmental Protection Agency promised to pursue a “stronger, more durable approach” with a different regulation. Electricity demand in the U.S. is growing for the first time since the 1990s, as the grid takes on powering not just electric cars and appliances, but data centers as well. The landmark climate laws President Joe Biden passed in 2022 are funneling billions toward renewables, new transmission lines, and battery factories. The first climate legislation likely to pass Congress this year, meanwhile, is a bill to make permitting and building new types of nuclear reactors easier.

Michael Meyden, 57, is facing three counts of causing another to ingest a controlled substance, application of a Schedule 4 controlled substance to another, and delivery of a controlled substance to a minor after detectives determined he allegedly exposed his daughter’s friends to a prescription drug, police said. Staff at a local hospital had notified police on Aug. 26, 2023, of three 12-year-old girls whose bloodstreams contained the drug. Meyden pleaded not guilty to all charges at his arraignment on Wednesday, according to The Oregonian. Police alleged that Meyden had laced mango smoothies with benzodiazepines, depressants that slow the nervous system, and served them to the three girls at his daughter’s sleepover, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by HuffPost. Detectives noted that when they interviewed the girls on the morning after the sleepover, one of them “walked slowly and used the assistance of her mother for balance, her eyelids were heavy, and she spoke slowly.” The girls told police that Meyden had been “very involved with their activities during the sleepover, ” that night and made them smoothies that had “tiny white chunks throughout and sprinkled on top,” the affidavit said. “Mr. Meyden was adamant that the girls drink out of their own cups,” detectives said. One of the girls told police she didn’t like the smoothie, but Meyden allegedly insisted she drink it and made her a second one to try. Police also alleged that after the girls went to bed in the home’s basement, Meyden visited them throughout the night to check if they were awake by waving his hands or putting his finger under their noses. One girl recounted that Meyden moved her body, but she “remained awake in fear that Mr. Meyden was going to do something. When Meyden left the room, one girl sent a text to her mom for help at around 1:43 a.m. “Mom please pick me up and say I had a family emergency. I don’t feel safe. I might not respond but please come get me (crying emoji), Please. Please pick up. Please. PLEASE!!” the message read. One girl called and texted several friends requesting a ride, police said in the affidavit. And one girl texted a family friend that “she felt unsafe because of her friend’s dad.” She wrote that she was “scared” and that the father “kept moving us away from each other but kept doing tests to make sure we weren’t awake.” She added that one friend woke up “for like 2 seconds,” but “kept her eyes closed and didn’t talk.” The family friend agreed to pick the girl up. It was not clear from the affidavit whether all the requests for help were sent by the same girl, or if multiple girls were texting for help. Meyden allegedly returned to the basement to check if the girls were asleep several times. The family friend who had received the message came to pick her up in the middle of the night. When the family friend arrived, she was greeted by Meyden, who she later told police “seemed drunk” after noticing his speech was slurred, according to the affidavit. The family friend told Meyden the girl had a family emergency and he allowed her to leave. The family friend drove the girl home, where she woke up the child’s parents so they could contact the other parents and tell them to pick the girls up. When the other parents arrived at Meyden’s home, they were met with resistance from the host when told they were taking the girls home, according to the document. Meyden allegedly said the girls were asleep and “insisted” the parents come back later. In an email to HuffPost on Friday, defense attorney Mark Cogan emphasized that Meyden is “presumed innocent,” adding, “We have not seen the evidence.” According to Cogan, the grand jury that indicted Meyden “convened in secret without a judge or defense counsel present.” “We ask everyone to withhold judgment until all the facts are known,” Cogan stated in the email.

The moment I can sense spring on the horizon, my mood gets better and my shopping cart fills up with warm-weather outfits. This year is no exception, and my hyperfixation clothing item is one that has seemed to captivate the internet, as well: The Snug Crop Tank from Old Navy. I’ve seen this top all over my TikTok For You Page ― and I totally understand the hype now that I have two of my own. And lucky for you, they’re on sale right now at a shockingly affordable price. This tank features a high, crewcut neckline and ribbed fabric. It’s form-fitting without being suffocating. If you hate crop tops, don’t let the name fool you: This isn’t a midriff bearing shirt. It skims the top of your waistband for an effortless look, but its stretchy fabric also allows you to tuck it in if you want to appear more polished. It works perfectly as a layering piece, but it’s high-quality enough to wear alone. Talk about versatility. Best of all, like most of Old Navy’s clothing items, it comes in a range of sizes and lengths. This tank starts at an XS and goes up to a XXL; it also comes in petite and tall. I’m 6 feet tall and take a size large normally, and a large tall worked perfectly for me. I’m a neutral girl, so I own it in black and white, but they also come in a bunch of other colors like olive, peach, red and more.

The “Pose” star and his sister, Mary Martha Ford, shared their loss Thursday on Instagram with a tribute. While the post included a carousel of happy family photos, it acknowledged just how devastated the siblings are at losing their mom at 79. “With heavy hearts we announce the passing of our loving mother, Cloerinda Jean Johnson Porter-Ford,” it read. “We were right behind her when she took her last breath, wrapped in our arms. Mommy lived life to the fullest despite physical limitations pressed upon her.” “She was the personification of true Christianity and her unconditional love is a template that the world could benefit from employing,” the post, which both siblings shared on their individual Instagram pages, continued. “Her example is what we continue to strive for.” Porter shared in his memoir “Unprotected” (2021) that his mother “was born with a degenerative neurological condition” that “no doctor or specialist has been able to name.” She initially relied on a walker but was relegated to a wheelchair in her later years. “We are heartbroken she is no longer here with us, but find solace that her suffering has ended,” he wrote Thursday. “Her fight was long and hard—she did it with grace and integrity. Mommy will remain forever in our hearts as she continues to guide us from above.” Porter was very close to his mother but had a difficult childhood. He told The Hollywood Reporter in 2021 that he was sexually abused by his stepfather as a child and came out as gay at 16 “in the middle of the AIDS crisis” — which wasn’t easy for him or his religious mom.

The president announced the move after at least 115 Palestinians were killed and more than 750 others were injured, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, on Thursday when witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire as huge crowds raced to pull goods off an aid convoy. Biden said the airdrops would begin soon and that the United States was looking into additional ways to facilitate getting badly needed aid into the war-battered territory to ease the suffering of Palestinians. “In the coming days we’re going to join with our friends in Jordan and others who are providing airdrops of additional food and supplies” and will “seek to open up other avenues in, including possibly a marine corridor,” Biden said. I condemn Thursday’s incident in Gaza in which more than 100 people were reportedly killed or injured while seeking life-saving aid.The desperate civilians in Gaza need urgent help, including those in the north where the @UN has not been able to deliver aid in more than a week. Access to food is a human right.As the hostilities in Gaza continue to escalate - access to food is scarce with reports of children starving to death.Humanitarian organizations must have unhindered access to people in need wherever they are. pic.twitter.com/2ZPdaqHRrg The president twice referred to airdrops to help Ukraine, but White House officials clarified that he was referring to Gaza. Israel said many of the dead were trampled in a stampede linked to the chaos and that its troops fired at some in the crowd who they believed moved toward them in a threatening way. The Israeli government has said it is investigating the matter. The head of a Gaza City hospital that treated some of those wounded said Friday that more than 80% had been struck by gunfire. Biden made his announcement while hosting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White house. “Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough,” Biden said. “Now, it’s nowhere nearly enough. Innocent lives are on the line and children’s lives are on the line. We won’t stand by until we get more aid in there. We should be getting hundreds of trucks in, not just several.” The White House, State Department and Pentagon had been weighing the merits of U.S. military airdrops of assistance for several months, but had held off due to concerns that the method is inefficient, has no way of ensuring the aid gets to civilians in need and cannot make up for overland aid deliveries. I spoke with Amir Al-Thani of Qatar and President Al-Sisi of Egypt regarding the conflict in Gaza and our effort to secure the release of hostages.We also discussed today's loss of civilian life, and the importance of expanding the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza in… pic.twitter.com/zmnOZwqzHt Administration officials said their preference was to further increase overland aid deliveries through the Rafah and Kerem Shalom border points and to try to get Israel to open the Erez Crossing into northern Gaza. The incident on Thursday appeared to tip the balance and push Biden to approve airdrops. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said that airdrops are difficult operations, but the acute need for aid in Gaza informed the president’s decision. He stressed that ground routes will be continued to be used to get aid into Gaza, and that the airdrops are a supplemental effort. “It’s not the kind of thing you want to do in a heartbeat. you want to think it through carefully,” Kirby said. He added, “There’s few military operations that are more complicated than humanitarian assistance airdrops” Pressure has been mounting for Biden to move more aggressively to ease Palestinian suffering, including from lawmakers of Biden’s Democratic Party. Even before Thursday’s deaths, Sen. Jack Reed, chairman of the Senate’s Armed Services Committee, wrote Biden this week to urge that the administration deploy a military hospital ship and support units to help treat Gaza’s wounded and open a sea route to Gaza for delivery of humanitarian aid. “Yesterday’s event, I think, underscores the need to find more creative ways of getting assistance in faster and at greater scale,” Kirby said. Egypt, France, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have already used airdrops to get aid into Gaza since the conflict started in October. Biden in his visit with Meloni at the White House also sought to assure European leaders that the U.S. remains behind Ukraine even as he’s been unable to win passage of a supplemental foreign aid package that includes $60 billion for Ukraine in addition to $35 billion for Israel and Taiwan. The legislation has passed the Senate, but Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to put it up for a vote in the House. Ahead of Meloni’s visit, White House officials said they don’t have good answers for allies about finding an end to the impasse with House Republicans and reopening the American spigot of aid to Kyiv that’s badly needed as Ukraine tries to fend off Russia’s invasion. Biden, along with top Democrats and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, strongly urged Johnson during a White House meeting this week to take up the foreign aid package, but Johnson responded by saying that Congress “must take care of America’s needs first.” The leaders also discussed efforts by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar to broker an extended cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, Italy’s priorities for a G7 presidency, migrant flows into Italy from North Africa, and their countries’ China policies. Biden said earlier this week that a cease-fire deal could be reached by Monday, before tempering his optimism after Thursday’s incident. But on Friday, Biden said he still held hope that a deal can be struck, possibly before Muslims around the globe begin observing the holy month of Ramadan that is expected to begin on March 10. “I’m still hoping so,” Biden told reporters on Friday evening before departing the White House for the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland. “We’re still working real hard at it. We’re not there yet.” Meloni said solving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza was Italy’s top priority. “We need to coordinate our actions to avoid an escalation, and this regard we fully support the U.S. mediation efforts,” she said. ___ Associated Press writers Colleen Barry in Milan, Seung Min Kim, Ellen Knickmeyer and Will Weissert contributed reporting.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-supreme-court-jan-6-trial_n_65e1ef59e4b013678e150311","‘Bush v. Gore 2.0’: Fears Grow Supreme Court Will Bail Donald Trump Out","igor bobic","2024-03-01","WASHINGTON ― The Supreme Court’s decision this week to hear arguments over Donald Trump’s claims for immunity from prosecution is fanning fears that the former president won’t go to trial before the November presidential election and could escape accountability for his efforts to overturn his loss in the last one. The 6-3 conservative high court could have simply declined Trump’s request for a hearing, letting stand a prior unanimous D.C. appeals court decision that flatly rejected his argument that everything he did related to Jan. 6, 2021 he did as an “official act” as president. Instead, the justices agreed to take up the case and set oral arguments for April 22 ― a two-month delay that will prevent Trump’s trial from starting in May, as had been previously scheduled. How long the court takes to reach a verdict after that hearing and whether it decides it needs to hear more information from the appeals court could delay the start of Trump’s trial even further. The delays in the case are starting to add up, unnerving Trump critics who fear that if his federal prosecutions stretch past November’s election and he manages to win another White House term, he could order the Department of Justice to put them on hold or simply dismiss them. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) called the case “a ginormous self-test” for the Supreme Court, invoking its controversial Bush v. Gore decision that ensured George W. Bush’s victory in the 2000 presidential election over then-Vice President Al Gore. “If they quickly rule 9-0 that there is not the kind of presidential immunity that Trump asserts, then it will be all to the good,” Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told HuffPost. “If not, then it stands to be Bush v Gore 2.0 with them inserting themselves into a presidential race.” “Delaying the January 6 trial suppresses critical evidence that Americans deserve to hear,” former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) wrote Friday on X, formerly Twitter. “Donald Trump attempted to overturn an election and seize power. Our justice system must be able to bring him to trial before the next election. SCOTUS should decide this case promptly.” “The hope of a trial in the Jan 6 case before the election is fading fast. Very fast,” former U.S. attorney and CNN commentator Preet Bharara added. Of course, the Supreme Court may move more quickly than expected. A ruling affirming the appeals court decision in May, for example, would allow jury selection for Trump’s trial in D.C. to begin sometime in the fall. It’s not clear, however, that a trial would conclude before the Nov. 5 presidential election or even January 2025, when the winner of the 2024 presidential election is due to be sworn in. The justices also have yet to rule in a separate case seeking to take Trump off the ballot in the state of Colorado due to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The oral arguments over that question, which the court is very likely to reject, took place nearly a month ago. “By not expediting this case, the MAGA Supreme Court once again proves they’re not there to defend the law—they’re there to protect Trump,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote Friday of the Jan. 6 election subversion case. “The Court has sped up trials when it wants—but not in this case,” he added. Trump appointed three justices to the court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Comey Barrett. Two other justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, are also reliable conservative votes who have ruled in his favor in past cases. Thomas has rejected calls to recuse himself in the Jan. 6 case — even though his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, was involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Republicans are counting on the court to side with Trump and make the whole thing go away. “This is an abuse of power and a persecution of President Trump, and I very much hope the Supreme Court puts a stop to it,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said during a NewsNation interview this week. Trump is charged with conspiring to defraud the United States; obstructing an official proceeding; conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiring to deprive millions of Americans the right to have their votes counted. If convicted, he could face decades in prison. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith on Thursday proposed a July 8 trial start date in a separate federal criminal case over former President Trump’s handling of classified documents. But the former president’s attorneys argued that “a fair trial cannot be held until after the 2024 Presidential election is concluded.” However, the DOJ said Friday that Trump’s criminal trials could take place near the election and that they would not be in violation of a rule that prevents the department from engaging in activities that could influence an election 60 days before it takes place. The government told U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge who is presiding over his classified documents case in Florida, that the rule doesn’t apply to cases that have already been brought.

(Watch the video below.) The high court decided to rule on Trump’s assertion that, as president, he was exempt from prosecution for his actions around the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. The court set arguments for late April, delaying the federal trial until at least summer. “Some people are blaming the Supreme Court for dragging it out on purpose to help Trump,” the “Tonight Show” host said. Then, Fallon imagined how the justices would respond. The speed of the reactions suspiciously corresponded to whether the judge was considered liberal or conservative. According to Fallon, Obama-nominated Justice Elena Kagan said, “We should be acting faster to move this along.” On the other end, Trump-nominated Neil Gorsuch said, “We... are ... going ... as ... fast .. as ... we c .... a.... n.” Check out the rest of the bit at 2:05: We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The February immersive event, “Willy’s Chocolate Experience,” took place in Glasgow, Scotland. It was supposedly inspired by Roald Dahl’s 1964 novel “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” which features the oddball chocolatier Willy Wonka. The event promised “captivating” live performances, “extraordinary props, oversized lollipops, and a paradise of sweet treats and interactive experiences,” according to the event’s website. Last weekend’s attendees got anything but that. Instead of the 45-minutes-to-an-hour experience promised on the website, Stuart Sinclair, a father who brought his children to the event, said it “took two minutes to get through to then see a queue of people surrounding the guy running it complaining,” according to his Facebook post. Instead of “a paradise of sweet treats and interactive experiences,” families and children said they got a mostly empty warehouse with scattered decorations and the scarce offerings of a quarter-cup of lemonade. Some attendees were so unhappy that they called the police. The Willy Wonka actors themselves have since said they got “AI-generated gibberish” scripts, and that they feel “really embarrassed” by the jobs they were hired for. Since the event, a Facebook group called “House of Illuminati Scam” has been created for disappointed participants seeking a refund. In a since-deleted social media statement, the event company House of Illuminati, which organized the Chocolate Experience, said it would “be giving full refunds to each and every person that purchased tickets.” Hopefully, you will never have to pay £35, or about $44, for your child to reportedly get three jelly beans from a disenchanted Oompa Loompa actor. But at some point in your life, you very well might buy tickets for an event that ends up being wildly different from what it advertised. Here are the warning signs that the event you bought tickets for might not be what it claims ― and what you need to prove so you can fight for a refund. On the Willy’s Chocolate Experience website, there are missing apostrophes and garbled terms like “cartchy tuns” and “catgacating.” Most organizations take the time to proofread what they advertise. “Scammers often have poorly designed websites, numerous spelling errors, or a lack of social media presence, which seemed to be a red flag for the Wonka experience,” said Mike Lemberger, Visa’s regional risk officer for North America. Bad actors take advantage of your enthusiasm for the popular movie or artist you want to see, so that you don’t look more closely at the details. The House of Illuminati event acknowledged on its website that its event was “in no way related to the Wonka franchise,” which in hindsight feels like a bad sign. If the event is not an authorized retailer for merchandise or is not officially associated with the franchise, that should set off alarm bells, said Melanie McGovern, director of public relations and social media for Better Business Bureau, a nonprofit that tracks bad advertisements and customer complaints in North America. “You don’t know what to expect if it’s not affiliated with the company that licenses and owns that image,” McGovern said. “You might not be getting what you think you’re getting. So that is definitely a red flag, and it’s very important for people to scroll to the bottom of a lot of websites to see all the information to make sure that it is what it says.” Lemberger said few or zero reviews can be a sign that the event is a scam. If you still want to buy tickets from a business that has little social media presence and is a first-time organizer of the event, call the organizer and the promotional company about your concerns, McGovern suggested. “Reputable companies will always answer your questions,” McGovern said. “They’ll work hard to earn your trust.” Try to find out if there have been any other complaints about events that the company has run. “If you see the same complaint over and over again, that could give you a pause to maybe say ‘I might not want to do this,’ or ‘I’m going to do it anyway,’” McGovern said. And double-check the name of the event and the organizers behind it. McGovern cited the example of how consumers complained to Better Business Bureau in 2021 about buying tickets for “Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience” ― an event that used virtual reality headsets ― thinking it was “Immersive Van Gogh,” a large-scale projected installation. When you buy a ticket for an event, you want to know what will happen if the venue suddenly changes, if weather conditions shift, or if a performer drops out. The terms and conditions on the event’s website will typically outline that information. “If the event details are vague, or if the organizer cannot provide specific information about the venue, performers, or event schedule, it might be a scam,” Lemberger said. It’s frustrating to have an underwhelming time at an event you paid significant money for. But there’s a difference between a disappointing experience and a potentially misleading one that can get you a refund. For Lemberger, the difference is that a disappointing experience still delivered its product or service as promised by the organizer. “On the other hand, a scam is something that is intentionally misleading in an effort to make money,” he said. If you believe you’re dealing with the latter category, here are actions you can take: “You should always reach out to the company where you made the purchase,” Lemberger said. “They may have policies in place to handle such situations and can handle it for you directly.” If the company refuses to provide a refund, you can dispute the charge with your bank. Save any receipts as proof of purchase and attendance, and take screenshots of what you believe the organizer sold as false advertisement to help your claim. “Customers will need to provide documentation they have around the situation, including all receipts, emails, photos and screenshots related to the purchase,” Lemberger said. “When you dispute something with your bank, your bank [will] work with the merchant’s bank to investigate the situation and side with the appropriate party.” But if you bought the tickets with cash or a debit card, you might be out of luck. Unless the event’s refund policy states otherwise, you probably will not be able to get your money back with cash or a debit card, McGovern said. If you’re in the U.S. or Canada, you can use Better Business Bureau to help you escalate your complaint and present it to the company on your behalf. “Then the company would come back with, ‘OK, we’ll refund your money,’ or ‘According to our terms and conditions, there are no refunds,’ and then we would go back to the consumer,” McGovern said. You can also file a consumer complaint to your local attorney general’s office. Ultimately, it takes extra homework and research to avoid getting fooled. Lemberger noted that in the case of the Willy Wonka-themed event, the illustrations that appear AI-generated created a false impression of what the event would be like.

The talk show co-host revealed during a segment of “The View” on Thursday that she has purposefully shared false stories in the past to see who was gossiping. Following a discussion about gossip, co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin had mentioned the method of planting false information to expose a gossiper when Goldberg chimed in that she was all too familiar with that approach. “We have done that, we have done that,” she said while looking at fellow veteran co-host Joy Behar. “We did that to see who was talking.” Behar, who initially looked confused by Goldberg’s remarks, appeared to recall the situation moments later. “Oh,” she said, seemingly trying to keep a straight face. Goldberg and Behar didn’t divulge further, and it’s unclear whether the EGOT winner was talking about a former on-set member, ex co-host or someone who currently works on the show. Behar said she was “sworn to secrecy” when Farah Griffin and another co-host, Sunny Hostin, pressed the two to spill more details. (See a clip of the entire discussion below.) Some of “The View” co-hosts have played coy about spilling the tea in another recent episode. Last month, Hostin and Behar were apparently passing notes to each other while taping the talk show. Goldberg was discussing a story about a wedding when she abruptly paused and glanced at her colleagues. “You guys are passing notes on television?” Farah Griffin asked. Goldberg then suggested that the two share their notes “with the rest of the class,” but they refused. Hostin admitted that her conversations with Behar are often “inappropriate.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The outspoken Oscar winner recently appeared in “The Greatest Love Story Never Told,” a documentary about Lopez making her latest album, “This Is Me…Now,” and its accompanying music film. Fonda shared “concern” about Lopez’s rekindled relationship with Ben Affleck. The newlyweds famously dated previously in the early 2000s, but endured so much tabloid fodder and attention that “Bennifer” broke off their engagement in 2004. Fonda, who starred opposite Lopez in “Monster-in-Law” (2005), is now worried about a potential repeat. “First of all, I want you to know that — I don’t entirely know why — but I feel invested in you and Ben, and I really, really, really want this to work,” she tells Lopez over the phone in a scene from the documentary, which premiered Tuesday on Prime Video. “However, this is my concern,” Fonda says. “Like, it feels too much like you’re trying to prove something instead of just living it. You know, every other photograph is the two of you kissing, the two of you hugging.” While Lopez argues they’re just “living our life,” the film does probe their contrasting views on the spotlight. It reveals Affleck gifted her a book for Christmas in 2021 of every letter and email they ever exchanged, only for Lopez to reportedly share them with others. Affleck had titled the book, “The Greatest Love Story Never Told,” inspiring the name of the film. “I had a very firm sense of boundaries initially around the press, while Jen I don’t think objected to it in the way I did,” he says in the film. “I very much did object to it. Getting back together, I said, ‘Listen, one of the things I don’t want is a relationship on social media.’” “Then I sort of realized it’s not a fair thing to ask,” Affleck continues. “It’s sort of like, you’re gonna marry a boat captain and you go, ‘Well, I don’t like the water.’ We’re just two people with different kinds of approaches trying to learn to compromise.” Lopez, who recently clarified what caused their first relationship to falter, rekindled their romance in April 2021. The couple got engaged one year later and eloped in July 2022, but held a more traditional wedding in Georgia at the end of that summer. Lopez explained in a new Apple Music interview with Zane Lowe that “it didn’t feel like we were going to make it” the first time around — and they simply weren’t “mature” enough at the time.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cdc-drops-5-day-isolation-time-for-covid-19_n_65e21988e4b0d2a24759403f","CDC Officially Drops 5-Day Isolation Time For COVID-19","mike stobbe","2024-03-01","NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who test positive for COVID-19 no longer need to stay in isolation for five days, U.S. health officials announced Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its longstanding guidance, saying that people can return to work or regular activities if their symptoms are mild and improving and it’s been a day since they’ve had a fever. The change comes at a time when COVID-19 is no longer the public health menace it once was. It dropped from being the nation’s third leading cause of death early in the pandemic to 10th last year. Most people have some degree of immunity to the coronavirus from past vaccinations or from infections. And many people are not following the five-day isolation guidance anyway, some experts say. “Our goal here is to continue to protect those at risk for severe illness while also reassuring folks that these recommendation are simple, clear, easy to understand, and can be followed,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the CDC’s director. However, some experts worry that the change may increase the risk of infection for those people who are more vulnerable to developing severe illness. WHY ARE THE GUIDELINES CHANGING? COVID-19 is not causing as many hospitalizations and deaths as it did in the first years of the pandemic. The change is an effort to streamline recommendations so they are similar to longstanding recommendations for flu and other respiratory viruses. Many people with a runny nose, cough or other symptoms aren’t testing to distinguish whether it’s COVID-19, flu, or something else, officials say. This may not be as stringent, but also emphasizes that all people with respiratory symptoms should stay home while they are sick, said Dr. David Margolius, the head of Cleveland’s health department. There’s been no recent change in the science of how long people with COVID-19 are likely contagious, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. “What has changed is how much COVID is harming us as a population,” Nuzzo said. WHAT ARE THE NEW GUIDELINES? If you have symptoms, stay home until your symptoms are mild and improving and it’s been a day since you’ve had a fever. But then you can remain cautious by wearing a mask and keeping a distance from others. There is no change to guidelines for nursing homes and health care facilities, however. The agency is emphasizing that people should still try to prevent infections in the first place, by getting vaccinated, washing their hands, and taking steps to bring in more outdoor fresh air. CDC recommends adults ages 65 years and over receive an additional updated 2023-2024 #COVID19 vaccine dose, which can provide additional protection to older adults, who are at highest risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Read the full release here: https://t.co/9x0OvqbHhl pic.twitter.com/9fki2Y606Z IS THERE OPPOSITION TO THIS CHANGE? Yes, and even some who understand the rationale for the change have concerns. “My biggest worry in all of this is that employers will take this change in guidance to require employees to come back to work ... before they are ready to, before they feel well enough, and before they are not likely to pose harm to their co-workers,” Nuzzo said. IS THIS THE FIRST CHANGE FOR COVID-19 ISOLATION GUIDELINES? No. The CDC originally advised 10 days of isolation, but in late 2021 cut it to five days for Americans who catch the coronavirus and have no symptoms or only brief illnesses. Under that guidance, isolation only ends if a person has been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications and if other symptoms are resolving. At the time, agency officials said the changes were in keeping with evidence that people with the coronavirus were most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alexander-smirnov-biden-impeachment_n_65e1f193e4b005b858341e98","Republicans Say FBI ‘Motivated By Politics’ In Case Of Lying Informant","arthur delaney","2024-03-01","WASHINGTON ― Republicans in Congress want answers from the FBI after basing their impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden largely on faulty information from an FBI informant. In a letter to FBI director Christopher Wray on Friday, Republicans asked for documents showing how they vetted the informant and how much they paid him ― and suggested the Justice Department arrested him to protect the Biden family. Federal prosecutors revealed the informant to be a dual U.S.-Irsaeli citizen named Alexander Smirnov last month when it announced charges against him for fabricating a bribery allegation against the president. Republicans publicized Smirnov’s bribery allegation despite Justice Department warnings that the raw material had not been vetted. Still, the department vouched for Smirnov, saying he’d been a trusted informant on the FBI payroll for years. “Only after Mr. Smirnov reported that President Joe Biden accepted a bribe from a Ukrainian energy company in exchange for using his official position to oust the Ukrainian Prosecutor General did the FBI apparently take a hard look at this CHS,” House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said in a letter to Wray. “This episode is just another example of how the FBI is motivated by politics,” Comer and Jordan wrote. Senior U.S. diplomatic officials have maintained for years that when Biden was vice president, his push for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor reflected U.S. policy and had not been done as a favor to his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Smirnov’s bribe claim, memorialized in an FBI document known as an FD-1023 form, reinvigorated Republican allegations that ousting the prosecutor reflected corruption by the Bidens. The revelation that Smirnov made it up dealt a death blow to their impeachment inquiry. The indictment revealed that investigators figured out Smirnov was lying when they checked his story after Republicans made his bribe bluff public. Prosecutors said he made up this allegation in 2020 because he opposed Biden’s bid for the presidency. Comer and Jordan insinuated the Justice Department was protecting the Biden family and demanded information about Smirnov as part of their impeachment inquiry.

In a photo first uncovered by the Anti-Defamation League in 2022, McClanahan can be seen standing next to a robed member of the KKK in a 2019 photo, giving a Nazi salute with the member while a cross burns behind them. McClanahan, who has attempted to run for multiple seats of office including a failed bid for U.S. Senate, said in a failed lawsuit against the ADL last year that the cross-burning was instead a “Christian Identity Cross lighting ceremony,” the Riverfront Times reported. The lawsuit added that McClanahan is not a full member of the KKK, but instead has been “provided an Honorary 1-year membership” to the group. In its statement, the Missouri GOP said they “condemn any association with hate groups and are taking immediate action to rectify this situation.” In a post on X, McClanahan said the “Missouri GOP knew exactly who I am” and called them a “bunch of Anti-White hypocrites.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The “Interstellar” actor let her social media followers in on a hilarious encounter with designer Donatella Versace last week, when Hathaway attended the luxury fashion label’s Fall/Winter 2024 show last week. For the occasion, the “Princess Diaries” star donned a skintight red leather Versace dress.

I’m fine, I’m fine,” Hathaway insisted, as she gamely struggled to pose. “It’s for Donatella! I’m so happy. Thank you for having me to Milan.” Hathaway poked fun at the moment by posting a video of the incident in a carousel of photos and videos last week. “Breathing? 😎 Sitting? 🙃 😂 love you @donatella_versace,” she captioned the post. It looks like Hathaway was eventually able to find a way to sit down, at least according to photos from the Versace show: While at the show, Hathaway encountered Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue and the reported inspiration for Meryl Streep’s menacing, complicated character in “The Devil Wears Prada,” which Hathaway also starred in.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Water flossers are a popular dental hygiene tool for many — and Waterpik is one of the most recognizable names in the game. The brand’s American Dental Association-approved tools are beloved by reviewers for their powerful plaque-busting abilities, but some of the more heavy-duty models can occupy more real estate, making them inconvenient for smaller bathrooms and unfeasible for traveling. Luckily, there’s a streamlined option available at Amazon right now — Waterpik’s cordless “Pearl” model — for less than $50, which is almost 30% off its typical price of $69.99. It has a 4.4-star rating on Amazon and 8,751 reviewers have given the device five stars. While most of Waterpik’s cordless water flosser are created fairly equal, this pared-down option makes a really smart buy for anyone who wants Waterpik’s powerful pressurized cleaning stream but doesn’t need a lot of bells and whistles. Based on the comparison chart on Waterpik’s website, the Pearl’s main difference from the brand’s normally twice-as-expensive “Advanced” model is that it lacks an LED charging light and isn’t safe for use in the shower, which don’t feel like dealbreakers to us. The Advanced offers three setting as opposed to the Pearl’s dual settings, but the Pearl pumps out 1,450 pulses per minute, which is more than the Advanced. (If any of these are dealbreakers, know that the Advanced model is priced at about $80 on Amazon right now.) What the Pearl does offer is a promise to banish 99.99% percent of plaque bacteria from your — ahem — pearly whites with an effectiveness rate double that of dental floss. It comes with four interchangeable tips and a 7-ounce water reservoir for up to 45 seconds of continuous cleaning, and the higher-capacity battery life will power the device for a maximum of 36 minutes. It also has global voltage compatibility and a compact 3-inch footprint, so you can whisk it in into your suitcase on your next trip without a second thought (as many of the reviewers below have done). See what some Amazon reviewers had to say about this compact device, or just scroll all the way down to get one for yourself during this dazzling sale. “My dentist recommended this product and I’m glad I purchased it. Works well, easy to use, and doesn’t take up too much room in my suitcase when I travel.” — Amazon Customer “I have braces and at times even with orthodontic flossers, it is hard to get in between my teeth or the brackets. This water flosser does the trick. The lowest setting is perfect for cleaning all of the small seeds or other food debris that gets caught in my brackets or between my teeth. It’s portable and cordless and the charge lasts a long time. I just fill it with warm water and it does a great job. One cycle will usually get all the debris loose but on occasion, I fill the reservoir again and give my mouth a second cleaning before brushing. Highly recommend.” — Patti Mcclure “My teeth are very close together which makes standard flossing difficult. I love this water pick as it is easy to use and does a good job.” — Clarence Thistle “This waterpik is made for travel. It only holds 45 seconds of flossing water. You have to refill water chamber if you need more flossing. Its easy to hold and use. It has 2 power levels for the water floss. Effective.” — Rachel “Having owned three previous non-waterpic dental water cleaners that ultimately failed, I can highly recommend the genuine Waterpic as the best and most durable, and the highest quality.” — natca1“My wife and I are dependent on the waterpik in our bathroom. We are pleased to be able to use a travel version. We are very happy with this product.” — Peter Keim By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

(Watch the video below.) In a chat posted to the Oscars’ YouTube channel on Friday, the conversation got around to superheroes and “The Dark Knight,” triggering Eilish’s revelation about the film’s Batman-playing star. “A couple years ago, I had a dream about Christian Bale, and it was in a little cafe in the sunlight, and it made me realize I had to break up with my boyfriend at the time,” she said. Her brother Finneas O’Connell laughed. “No, like, genuinely. I woke up and I was like [gasps] and I came to my senses,” Eilish continued. The clip cut to another segment featuring the siblings and host Amelia Dimoldenberg, so we got no further information. But pop culture blog Uproxx guessed by the timing it could be former beau Matthew Tyler Vorce who got the heave-ho. This we cannot confirm. Eilish recently revealed that she is attracted to women. The “bad guy” singer and her brother, who won a best-song Oscar in 2022 for “No Time To Die,” are nominated again for best original song, “What Was I Made For?” from “Barbie.” The two are scheduled to perform the song at the March 10 ceremony.

First, though, he exchanged some heated words with U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden. The judge admonished Brandon Fellows, a 29-year-old chimney repairman and tree cutter from Schenectady, reportedly saying he had never seen a defendant so contemptuous. “You have repeatedly made a mockery of these proceedings,” McFadden told Fellows on Thursday amid repeated interruptions, WUSA9 News reported. “There is no grand conspiracy here against you,” McFadden said, per The Washington Post. “It’s time for you to grow up!” Fellows reportedly displayed no remorse at his August trial, where he represented himself and claimed McFadden was running a “Nazi court.” His antics so alarmed the jury that they sent a note to the judge during deliberations to confirm Fellows did not have any of their personal identifying information. Fellows was convicted on one felony count and four misdemeanors relating to his participation in the riot. He continued to lash out at McFadden even after the trial, calling him a “modern day Nazi judge” in one court filing, which he signed as “your favorite Political prisoner.” Prosecutors displayed images for the jury of Fellows leaning back in a chair in the office of Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) to smoke marijuana, wearing sunglasses and a fake beard made of yarn as he propped his feet on a piece of furniture. He was caught on camera climbing into the Capitol building through a broken window shortly before 3 p.m. He went on to parade a “Trump 2020” flag through the doors to the Senate Wing. His path brought him to Merkley’s office, then to the Capitol crypt, before he exited the same way he came, harassing two U.S. Capitol Police officers on his way out, according to prosecutors. He then gave an interview to CNN right outside the building. Days after the incident, prosecutors said, Fellows made social media posts indicating he was proud to have taken part in the riot. “Brought my heart joy to see these members terrified for their lives,” he wrote in one post, according to prosecutors. “For what they have done and are doing to this country I hope they live in constant fear.” In an interview with Bloomberg the week after the riot, Fellows said he believed that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former President Donald Trump, and said he had “no regrets.” (No evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election has been found.) Fellows said he got most of his news from YouTube commentators like Ben Shapiro and right-wing outlets like Newsmax, which amplified the “stolen election” conspiracy theory. His stepfather told Bloomberg that Fellows’ mind was made up: “You can’t really change it with any kind of reality.” The next four years will change America forever.

Into Hard Truth About Trump","josephine harvey","2024-03-01","Fox News’ Jessica Tarlov swiftly cleared things up for her co-hosts on “The Five” after they accused Democrats of subverting democracy. “I love days when you guys think that you’re describing Joe Biden, but you’re actually describing Donald Trump,” the liberal commentator said. She went on: “So the person who didn’t want the American people to be able to speak in 2020 was Donald Trump. And he had his team of crackpot lawyers fan out across the country to bring forward frivolous lawsuits, when there had been recount after recount, to make sure that the American public was disenfranchised.” Jessica: I love days when you guys think that you are describing Joe Biden but you are actually describing Donald Trump. So the person who didn't want the American people to be able to speak in 2020 was Donald Trump… pic.twitter.com/vghpl2EEiF She was responding to her conservative colleagues, who had spent minutes bashing Democrats and the media for criticizing the Supreme Court’s decision to review Trump’s presidential immunity claims, thereby delaying the former president’s federal election interference trial by at least several months. If the federal prosecutions against Trump are delayed beyond the November election, and Trump wins, he could order the Justice Department to drop the cases. Tarlov’s co-hosts had also slammed an Illinois judge for ruling that Trump is ineligible to appear on the state’s primary ballots under the U.S. Constitution’s so-called insurrection clause. “I mean, these people, I’m so sick of their saying he’s a threat to democracy, when everything they do is a threat to democracy,” Jeanine Pirro had said. Greg Gutfeld said the political left is trying to “compromise an election.” Jesse Watters claimed Democrats and the media were upset about the Supreme Court news because they’re “realizing that the judges of the Supreme Court aren’t on their schedule. And so they’re realizing that Joe Biden might have to win this himself.” “That’s what you saw last night, them realizing that this is going to be a free and fair election, to a certain extent,” he said. Trump is being prosecuted federally and in Georgia for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. He’s also been criminally indicted in two other cases. With his media and political allies dutifully in tow, he has cast the prosecutions as politically motivated and accused Democrats and President Joe Biden of weaponizing the justice system against him.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elsbeth-quirky-good-wife-carrie-preston_n_65e13e5ee4b0d2a24758b7dc","‘Elsbeth’ Has So Much Potential — If The Quirkiness Doesn’t Get Too Out Of Control","sarah hunter simanson","2024-03-01","“Would you consider an Elsbeth spinoff?” HuffPost first asked Carrie Preston in a 2013 interview. At the time, Preston’s recurring role as Elsbeth Tascioni on “The Good Wife” was a fan favorite, and it earned her that year’s Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Her response to the question was, “Of course, of course. I mean, no one is asking, but of course, I would say yes if they were.” Now, more than a decade later, the show premiered on CBS Thursday night. You probably already know this because ads for CBS’ newest procedural “Elsbeth” are everywhere, and the trailer makes it clear that while Elsbeth is still her lovably quirky self, she is stepping into a new role (and bringing her many patterned tote bags with her.) Instead of being Chicago’s lawyer savant, Elsbeth has moved to New York City to serve as an outside observer of the NYPD, fulfilling the consent decree requirement in a wrongful arrest lawsuit. Basically, her job is to observe the NYPD as the NYPD investigates crimes. But anyone who watched her guest star in 14 episodes of “The Good Wife” or five episodes of “The Good Fight” knows that Elsbeth is incapable of being a silent observer because she talks a lot and sees too much. Elsbeth’s ability to appear easily distracted by what’s around her (jewelry, bookcases, dresses, wallpaper, pictures of penguins) and her unusual way of speaking and trailing off mid-thought often leads people to underestimate her, to think she’s scatter-brained or “easily confused” or “easily entertained.” She isn’t someone willing to settle for the easy answer or a convenient criminal. In Elsbeth’s second episode of “The Good Wife” in Season 1, a character asks her, “How are you ahead of the police on this?” Elsbeth replies, “They’re not looking.” Even if they were looking, they wouldn’t see the world Elsbeth does, but is that enough to carry a show? But can Elsbeth pull it off? Can she make the transition from beloved guest star to titular lead character? Elsbeth’s ability to interpret what no one else around her sees is what viewers should expect of her character in the spinoff. They should also prepare for her unique perspective to create problems, especially with Captain C.W. Wagner (Wendell Pierce) and Detective Smullen (Danny Mastrogiorgio), and for her quirkiness to obfuscate her genius, at least temporarily. At a crime scene, Elsbeth’s “weird, savant stuff” reminds me of Adrian Monk or Shawn Spencer, the lead characters in some of USA Network’s most beloved, character-driven procedurals. Like them, I expect for her brilliance and quirkiness to drive the show. Also, her legal background gives the show’s writers even more dimensions to explore, which is why “Elsbeth” has the potential to become an inspired mash-up of “Psych,” “Monk” and “Suits.” Perhaps the series might also fill the void for everyone who binged or rewatched “Suits” in 2023 and is looking for their new show (especially for those in Robert Zane withdrawal because Pierce makes an excellent NYPD captain). Elsbeth’s quirkiness — a uniqueness Preston has referred to as “cayenne pepper” — adds spice and levity to “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight.” Her character usually appears when the situation is dire — when the lawyers need a lawyer or “The Firm” needs a lawyer — and her creative problem-solving elevates the game the lawyers are always playing in such a delightful and surprising way that viewers want more. This dynamic is also incredibly successful because, in addition to Preston’s phenomenal acting, Elsbeth is the polar opposite of the lawyers around her. The seriousness of Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) and practicality of Will Gardner (Josh Charles) and graceful grit of Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) balance her in scenes and storylines. But, when Preston is leading the show, will viewers begin to want less — less moments spent obsessing about New York as if she’s never been there (long-time fans remember the antisemitic bear in Season 5 of “The Good Wife”), less scenes in which she’s obsessing over objects or violating social norms, less time spent pondering theories out loud in an incomprehensible way? Preston is an incredible actor, so I think the real question is if the material she’s working with gives Elsbeth room to be a whole person instead of a quirky cliché. This line is hard to balance, but shows such as “Monk” and “Psych” did pull it off. This gives me hope that the confines of the procedural as a genre will provide enough structure to balance Elsbeth’s zaniness. But, based on the pilot’s many moments in which Elsbeth’s idiosyncrasies feel unnatural, I think the writers have more work to do to ensure that the spinoff is not chipping away at the full character the “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” worked so hard to develop. The secondary characters also need to be strong enough to hold this line, which, right now, it appears only Pierce is able to do. Elsbeth has to have cases interesting enough to showcase her intellectual thought processes, which I don’t think the pilot’s predictable first case gives her. The episode opens with the crime, which is a confusing choice for a pilot — at one point I paused the show to make sure I was actually watching “Elsbeth” (she doesn’t appear until six minutes into the episode) — but it is a style characteristic of procedurals. In this case, it’s not a question of “who did it.” The conflict is if Elsbeth — the only one who suspects foul play in a wealthy college student’s death — will be able to find the proof to prove it. There’s also the question of if she’s even allowed to assist in the investigation because she’s supposed to be an observer. But, as fans of Elsbeth know, she is capable of twisting definitions (and legalities) to justify her means. The difference in “Elsbeth” is the ends. “You’re not a defense lawyer anymore. The truth means putting people in jail,” Elsbeth is told at one point during the pilot. Earlier in the episode, she tells Captain Wagner that she took this job because after 30 years as a lawyer, she was tired of representing clients who she sometimes knew were guilty: “My work could be all about finding the truth and not just some better way of telling a lie for someone I was defending.” The consistently great part of Elsbeth’s appearances in both previous shows was her ability to tell better lies, to concoct better stories, to keep the people she’s representing out of legal trouble. What will her life look like when she does the opposite? How will she handle the nuances of knowing someone is guilty but finding that person likable? How will it feel when she’s responsible for putting someone in jail instead of keeping them out?

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jennifer-dulos-michelle-troconis-verdict_n_65de2542e4b005b85831e4b4","Michelle Troconis Found Guilty In Jennifer Dulos Murder Conspiracy","drusilla moorhouse","2024-03-01","A jury Friday found a Connecticut woman guilty of conspiring with her boyfriend to kill his estranged wife, a mother of five who disappeared in 2019. Michelle Troconis, 49, was also found guilty on five other counts of tampering with physical evidence and hindering prosecution connected to Fotis Dulos’ presumed killing of Jennifer Dulos, who was last seen dropping off their five children at school on the morning of March 24, 2019. The Duloses had been in the middle of a contentious two-year divorce battle and custody dispute, which placed strict restrictions on when and how Fotis Dulos could see the couple’s children. The six-member jury deliberated for three days after hearing more than seven weeks of testimony before finding that Troconis helped Dulos create an alibi for the time of the killing, and later helped him clean up and dispose of evidence of the crime. Troconis faces up to 50 years in prison, according to the Stamford Advocate, citing Connecticut state statute. Jennifer Dulos’ body has never been found, but she was declared officially dead by a state judge in October. Fotis Dulos was facing capital murder and kidnapping charges when he died by suicide in January 2020. Troconis could be heard audibly crying as the verdicts were read, leaning against her attorney Jon Schoenhorn. After he whispered that she could sit, she put her head on the table and sobbed, with attorney Audrey Felsen rubbing her back as the jury was polled. Connecticut Superior Court Judge Kevin Randolph set a bond of $6 million, denying her defense’s request that she remain free on her original bond of $2.1 million. Troconis was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. Jennifer Dulos’ family called the ruling a “crucial attribution of accountability” for “an unconscionable series of crimes” but emphasized that it is “not a victory” in a statement shared with HuffPost. “There can be no victory when five children are growing up without their mother,” said Carrie Luft, a close friend of Jennifer Dulos’ and the family’s spokesperson. Despite the “immense body of evidence” presented at trial, Luft pointed out that Jennifer Dulos’ body still hasn’t been found and expressed the family’s hope that the publicity from the trial will generate new leads. “In the meantime, Jennifer’s grace, goodness, and light live on through her children and through the honor of her memory,” Luft said. “This is not the trial of Fotis Dulos; this is the trial of Michelle Troconis,” Schoenhorn said in his closing argument Tuesday. But prosecutors first had to establish Fotis Dulos’ guilt to make the case that Troconis conspired with him in a murder — when the body of the victim has never been found. Randolph dealt an early blow to the prosecution when he excluded testimony of the chief medical examiner, who had previously said that Jennifer Dulos had suffered “non-survivable injuries.” Without a body to examine, Dr. James Gill based his conclusion on evidence provided by investigators, including blood in Jennifer Dulos’ garage and bloody clothes that matched her DNA. Ultimately, Randolph ruled, “the jury has heard more than Dr. Gill could testify to.” And Schoenhorn questioned whether prosecutors had proved that Dulos killed his wife. “It’s still unclear what happened,” he told jurors. “And unfortunately, this trial will not solve that puzzle. It will remain a mystery, an unfinished puzzle.” Prosecutors presented hundreds of puzzle pieces to jurors over the course of 25 days of testimony and more than 150 exhibits. On Tuesday, they had just one hour to assemble the pieces for the jury in closing arguments, which they did in two parts, before and after Schoenhorn argued for the defense. (There were no opening statements, in accordance with Connecticut state law.) Fotis Dulos’ alleged scheme required careful planning, multiple vehicles and hours of driving. Prosecutors said he drove 70 miles south from his Farmington home (where he also operated his luxury real estate development company) to Jennifer Dulos’ house in New Canaan, back up to Farmington (where he spent the afternoon at a property he was selling) and finally 10 miles to Hartford, this time driving his Ford Raptor with Troconis in the passenger seat. Based on a search warrant of Fotis’ phone, investigators were able to use location data to trace his movements that night and requested surveillance footage for the area, which was shown at trial. In the bed of the four-door pickup were numerous full black plastic garbage bags, whose numbers dwindled as he tossed them in various garbage bins along the way. Police said they were able to recover some of those bags and found inside a number of items linked to Jennifer Dulos and the crime, which were shown in court. The grim findings included a woman’s Vineyard Vines shirt and bra, both sliced down the middle and soaked in blood — later identified as Jennifer Dulos’ — a box cutter, two rain ponchos, a towel, four long zip ties, gloves and cleaning supplies that all appeared to be stained with blood. Troconis claimed that she rode with Dulos specifically to go to Starbucks and wasn’t paying attention because it was not unusual for him to dump trash from their construction projects. At one stop, surveillance footage showed both Fotis and Troconis opening their doors. While Dulos walks around the truck and places a garbage bag in the bin, Troconis is seen opening the passenger door and reaching down to the sidewalk. He then approaches her and slides what appears to be a large envelope into a sewer grate under her open door. Investigators later recovered the envelope and found inside two Connecticut license plates that had been altered with tape. The plates had been used on a car registered to Fotis. Cameras also captured him removing a “large, rigid object” consistent with a missing cargo liner from Jennifer’s Suburban and leaning it up against a building. It was never recovered. Authorities believe that Fotis Dulos was lying in wait and attacked Jennifer Dulos in her own garage in New Canaan when she returned from the school just after 8 a.m. on March 24. To get there, police believe he drove his employee Pawel Gumienny’s Toyota Tacoma pickup, with his own bicycle in the back, parked it near Waveny Park, and cycled to the New Canaan mansion. After killing her, he drove her body in her own Chevy Surburban back to the park, leaving her SUV for searchers to find later while he returned to Farmington in Gumienny’s pickup, investigators said. The murder conspiracy charge against Troconis relates to what she was doing that morning. According to prosecutors, she agreed to answer a prearranged call from Dulos’ friend in Greece to Dulos’ phone ― which he left in their home office ― but also to avoid having his movements tracked. Initially, Troconis and Dulos’ friend Kent Mawhinney (who is himself awaiting trial on a murder conspiracy charge in the case) said Dulos was with them in the office that morning. She also originally told police that she had woken up beside Dulos that morning, showered with him and had sex, but in a later interview admitted she had not seen him at all. Prosecutors said Troconis and Dulos were following what investigators referred to as “alibi scripts” — a term they were barred from using during the trial — to account for their movements that day. Schoenhorn said that Troconis’ inconsistent statements were a result of aggressive police tactics that affected her memory and confusion because English is not her native language. (She is originally from Venezuela.) Her police interviews were all conducted in English, but she used a Spanish interpreter throughout the trial. Jurors were shown video of her three police interviews in their entirety, hours of footage filmed at Jennifer Dulos’ house, and traffic and security video of the various vehicles driven by Dulos, Troconis and Gumienny on May 24. Troconis’ movements that afternoon were of particular interest to investigators and highlighted by prosecutors in their closing arguments. She made five trips back and forth from the home and office she shared with Dulos on Jefferson Crossing, to the empty property he was preparing to sell on Mountain Spring Road, two miles away. Dulos stayed there the entire time, close to 3 1/2 hours. During that time, prosecutors said, there were three different “fire events” at Jefferson Crossing. Based on a neighbor’s security video of smoke billowing from the chimney — and its absence — prosecutors alleged that Troconis was burning evidence. Although Schoenhorn countered that Troconis enjoyed having fires in the fireplace year-round, the prosecution emphasized that this was the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, a warm day and an odd time to light several different fires. Meanwhile, prosecutors said Dulos was cleaning Gumienny’s Tacoma, which he allegedly used to transport his wife’s body, and bagging up the evidence. When Gumienny showed up unannounced at the Mountain Spring Road property to pick up his truck, Troconis took his keys to dissuade him from taking it. He insisted, however, because he needed it to transport his dirt bike home. Gumienny was a key witness for the prosecution and was granted immunity to testify. When he returned to Farmington with his Tacoma after Memorial Day weekend, Gumienny testified that Dulos and Troconis took it without his knowledge or consent to a car wash to have it cleaned and fully detailed — twice. Then Gumienny said Dulos repeatedly urged him to replace the Tacoma’s seats, which he eventually did, but held on to the original ones. Ultimately he handed them over to investigators, who said they found evidence of Jennifer Dulos’ DNA on the passenger seat. Dulos might have had an additional sinister intent when he borrowed Gumienny’s truck. Just before Jennifer Dulos’ disappearance, Fotis Dulos shaved his head — a deliberate attempt, investigators believed, to mislead any witnesses into thinking he was Gumienny, who had a similar hairstyle. Gumienny said he even made a joke about it when he found Dulos and Troconis at a property they claimed to be cleaning the afternoon Jennifer Dulos disappeared. “You shaved your head. You’re wearing dirty old work clothes. You trying to be as handsome as me?” Gumienny testified he told Dulos. Troconis had a greater motive than just helping her boyfriend, prosecutors said. She hated Jennifer Dulos, Supervisory Assistant State’s Attorney Michelle Manning said Tuesday, and wanted to end the “two years of torture” she endured, including being barred from her home during Dulos’ visitations with his children. “The frustration turned to anger and hatred,” Manning said, quoting Troconis’ own interviews when she described Jennifer Dulos as “manipulating,” “angry” and “toxic.” In one of the most dramatic moments of the seven-week trial, Gumienny recounted what Troconis said when Jennifer Dulos refused to allow their children to say goodbye to the ill family dog before Fotis Dulos had him put to sleep in the spring of 2019. “That bitch should be buried next to the dog,” Gumienny testified. In the final closing argument, Assistant State’s Attorney Sean McGuinness repeated Troconis’ derogatory comment but said this case was about “a mother’s worst nightmare.” “It is about a mother being taken away from her children, in life or in death,” he said. It is about Dulos’ children, “who went to bed on May 24 not knowing where their mother was, and she has still not arrived.” In a statement shared with HuffPost, Schoenhorn said he is “extremely disappointed in the outcome” of the trial and reiterated his previous contention that Troconis’ inconsistent accounts were partly the result of her police interviews being conducted in English without a Spanish interpreter, saying that “played a major role in the verdict.” “I think it was unfortunate that the interrogations were conducted in a manner and in a language that led her to contradict herself, and I understand how that would be used against her,” he said, blaming “hindsight bias” for the jury’s finding that Troconis knew in advance that Fotis Dulos would kill his wife. Paul J. Ferencek, state’s attorney for the Stamford/Norwalk Judicial District, commended the jury and offered condolences to Dulos’ family in a press release after the verdict, promising that their work on the case isn’t over.

I assure you the State of Connecticut and this office will never stop looking,” Ferencek said. Troconis also faces a contempt hearing on March 5. During the trial, a friend of Jennifer Dulos told prosecutors that a sealed report related to the Duloses’ custody battle had been displayed on Troconis’ laptop in a very large font that could be read by people in the courtroom. In response, Judge Randolph restricted the use of computers in the courtroom to attorneys. Troconis is scheduled to be sentenced on May 31. The court clerk originally proposed May 24, which Schoenhorn suggested would be “inappropriate” — it marks the fifth anniversary of Jennifer Dulos’ death.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-mass-deportation-local-police_n_65e1df88e4b013678e14f39f","Donald Trump Says Local Police Will Play Key Role In His Mass Deportation Plan","marita vlachou","2024-03-01","Former President Donald Trump on Thursday suggested that local police will play a key role in delivering his campaign pledge of carrying out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants if he wins re-election this November. “Look, we have to deport a lot of people, and they have to start immediately,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity Thursday in an interview held near the U.S.-Mexico border, where the former president made a campaign stop. Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary contest, said he would give local police officers immunity to carry out his plan. “They understand who these migrants are. They know them by their first name, their last name, they know where they come from,” Trump said. “It’s going to be the local police are going to turn them over and we’re going to have to move them back to their country.” Trump has made immigration a major focus of his 2024 presidential campaign, using tough rhetoric and pledging to bring “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history” if he returns to the White House. His allies, including Steve Bannon, have also been pushing the extreme measure. “Mass deportations are going to start, if you don’t like that, then don’t vote for President Trump,” Bannon said Thursday on his “War Room” podcast. Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge David Ezra on Thursday blocked a Texas law, originally set to take effect next week, which would allow police to arrest those who cross into the country illegally and would also enable local judges to order their deportation. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has appealed the ruling. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who joined Trump Thursday at his visit to the U.S. southern border, said he will continue fighting to protect his state from what he described as President Joe “Biden’s migrant crisis.” “Texas has the right to defend itself because of President Biden’s ongoing failure to fulfill his duty to protect our state from the invasion at our southern border,” Abbott said. “Even from the bench, this District Judge acknowledged that this case will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.” Texas has the constitutional right to defend itself because of President Biden's ongoing failure to fulfill his duty.We will not back down in our fight to protect Texas.This case will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. pic.twitter.com/o7ugwxViMU Abbott has endorsed Trump and the former president said he is considering the governor as a potential running mate. Biden visited the border Thursday as well hoping to score a win on the issue after Trump encouraged his party’s congressional lawmakers to block a bipartisan bill, which would have imposed the toughest border enforcement measures in decades, by, among other things, making it harder for people to claim asylum.

Trump, however, failed to mention his role in the legislation getting tossed out, claiming instead that “the United States is being overrun by Biden migrant crime.” Trump has falsely stated that illegal immigrants are responsible for the majority of crimes committed in the U.S. despite studies showing undocumented immigrants are responsible for less murders than American citizens.

(AP) — A man who fatally shot a 20-year-old woman after the SUV she was riding in mistakenly drove into his rural driveway in upstate New York was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in prison. Kevin Monahan, 66, was convicted of second-degree murder in the death last April of Kaylin Gillis. She was riding in a caravan of two cars and a motorcycle that was trying to leave after pulling into Monahan’s long, winding driveway while looking for a party at another person’s house in the town of Hebron. “I think it’s important for people to know that it’s not OK to shoot people and have them killed for turning down your driveway,” Judge Adam Michelini said. Apart from the wider deterrent effect, Michelini said it’s important that Monahan remain behind bars rather than be free to harm more people. The judge added up to 4 more years for tampering with the murder weapon, and scolded Monahan for showing no remorse. “You murdered Kaylin Gillis. You shot at a car full of people and you didn’t care what would happen and you repeatedly lied about it. You deserve to spend the maximum time in prison allowable under the law,” the judge said. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum. The defense asked for leniency. Monahan declined an opportunity to speak. And then he was led away, to applause and a shout of “coward” from the gallery. Gillis’ death drew attention far beyond upstate New York. It came days after the shooting of 16-year-old Ralph Yarl in Kansas City. Yarl, who is Black, was wounded by an 84-year-old white man after he went to the wrong door while trying to pick up his younger brothers. On the night of Gillis’ death, the group of friends had realized their error and had turned around when Monahan fired a second shot, striking Gillis in the neck as she sat in the front passenger seat of an SUV driven by her boyfriend. Monahan maintained the fatal shot was an accident and that the shotgun was defective. He also said he believed the house about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Albany was “under siege” by intruders, and said he came out to fire a warning shot to try to scare the group away while his wife hid inside. Prosecutors argued that Monahan was motivated by an irrational rage toward trespassers. A jury deliberated for less then two hours before returning guilty verdicts in January against Monahan for murder, reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence. Gillis’ father, Andrew Gillis, has described his daughter as someone who loved animals and had dreams of becoming a marine biologist or a veterinarian.

We will never see her beautiful face, hear her laughter,” Gillis said in court Friday before Monahan’s sentence was announced.

Although Twitter has rebranded to X, the humor lives on. Every week, we round up the most hilarious quips from parents on the social media platform to spread the joy. Scroll down to read the latest batch, and follow @HuffPostParents for more! My 6yo is chanting all the words that rhyme with sucker and this is going to end badly in about 3 seconds When I was growing up, water was the only approved drink between meals. Yesterday my son asked for milk after playing outside at my parents' and my dad poured his grandson a giant cup of CHOCOLATE milk.🧐IT WAS NOT EVEN ANYONE'S BIRTHDAY OR ANYTHING. Apparently my 9yo daughter's imaginary friend is the ghost of an 8yo girl named Rose who died of the bubonic plague 200 years ago and I’m sure this is a completely normal developmental stage........ Sorry kids I missed your childhood, I was busy trying to catch up on emails from your school I was going through an old keepsakes box of mine and found a 4 colored pen. I asked my 6 year old if she’d like to have the cool pen I used when I was a kid. Her eyes lit up, then I gave it to her and she frowned. “Oh, I thought it was going to be one of those feathers,” she said “Do you think in heaven you can pee anywhere you want?” My daughter, asking the big questions Be warned that if you buy your 5 year old a watch, you are going to get minute by minute updates on what the current time is Forgot about the 12-20 months stage of having a baby where your house is just littered with random objects they picked up, carried around, and dropped for no reason like you live inside a claw machine. I forgot to tell my 4yo that today is Leap Day before she left for school and squandered an opportunity to make a big deal out of nothing Young children sneeze with the intent of destroying the world I called to my son from another room and he yelled “just text me” and that’s all you need to know about parenting teens. My daughter asked if babies come from Walmart and I was like pretty much. Me: “Come here” is spelled C-O-M-E not C-U-MMy kid: Does it really matter how I spell it?Me: Yes! 11yo: Do you know where my sunglasses are?Me: The car?11yo: No, I looked. Two days later, while driving my kid to school. 11yo: My sunglasses! My kids are playing doctor’s office and the receptionist just said, “the doctor will see you in five seconds” and this is the least realistic game I’ve ever seen. The aggressiveness of my teenager sitting down on the couch is equal to him being dropped on it from 4,000 feet in the air. Like why. just an update my kids are on their 99th cold this winter “I like mommy’s car better”-My daughter in the backseat of my truck having to use a Home Depot receipt to wipe her nose. Parents: If you ever need a reminder about the power of peer pressure, my 13 year-old son went from never eating vegetables to now eating literal dried seaweed because his friend told them all that seaweed will help grow a moustache.

Trump, who is the current Republican front-runner, also faces a federal indictment in Florida related to his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House. His attorneys said they want that trial pushed back until after the election. Haley said Trump has the right to defend himself, but that the cases should not be drawn out and must be addressed quickly. “I think voters are going to want to know what they’re walking into, and if they’re walking into a president who’s still going to have to be in court or if they’re walking into a presidency where he can get rid of a court case. Voters are going to want to know that,” Hayley said. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

While Hayley added that no president should be legally immune to anything, and they must “live under laws too,” she has previously said that it would be bad if Trump winds up “sitting in a jail cell.” “For me, the last thing we need is an 80-year-old president sitting in jail because that’s just going to further divide our country,” she told CNN back in January. “This is no longer about whether he’s innocent or guilty. This is about the fact: How do we bring the country back together?” She added that that does not mean she would preemptively pardon Trump, like President Gerald Ford did for Richard Nixon.

Beginning this week, the IRS will start sending out noncompliance letters to more than 25,000 people who earn more than $1 million per year and 100,000 people with incomes between $400,000 and $1 million who failed to pay their taxes between 2017 and 2021. The campaign announced Thursday is part of the agency’s ongoing effort to pursue high wealth tax cheats — mandated in part by funding provided through Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act passed into law in 2022 and a directive from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to IRS leadership not to increase audit rates on people making less than $400,000 a year annually. “When people don’t file a tax return they’re required to, it’s not fair to those hardworking taxpayers who responsibly do their civic duty under the laws of our nation,” IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel told reporters Thursday morning. “And when people don’t file their taxes, they need to know there’s a consequence.” The IRS in recent months has announced a slew of new campaigns aimed at targeting high-wealth individuals who misuse the tax system or fail to pay their obligations. For instance, last week IRS leadership said the agency will start up dozens of audits on businesses’ private jets and how they are used personally by executives and written off as a tax deduction. And earlier this year, the agency announced it had collected roughly half a billion dollars in overdue taxes from delinquent millionaires. The next four years will change America forever.

Ron DeSantis Is Trying To Clean Up His Book-Banning History","michael arceneaux","2024-03-01","Tempting as it is to want to completely ignore the charmless curmudgeon that is Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, we should not ignore his slight omission that his “book ban” campaign has gone too far. DeSantis, at a Feb. 15 news conference, supported a state House proposal designed to limit what he called “bad-faith objections” to various school library books and instructional materials. He said these objections were an abuse of the process, performed to “score cheap political points.” “We obviously have to give parents the ability to be able to ensure that this smut doesn’t get into their schools,” the Republican governor said. But he noted: “Although we like people wanting to be involved in what’s going on, to just show up and object to every single book under the sun, that is not an appropriate situation here, and we have seen that occasionally.” Florida reportedly logged 1,218 book objections during the 2022-2023 fiscal year, resulting in the removal of 386 books ― often titles that are very Black, hella gay, pro-trans, and/or anti-slavery and anti-segregation. Despite his call for the Florida Legislature to “fine-tune the process” to prevent what he described as activists saddling school districts with unnecessary work, he continued to argue that the mashup of bills and state education department policy that effectively allowed for the banning of books was not a book ban bill ― saying that was a “false narrative.” “A lot of the things that people say in the media that were, quote, ‘objected to’ were actually on the summer reading list of the Florida Department of Education, so this is all a big fraud,” DeSantis claimed at the news conference. He added, “No district in Florida has removed any dictionaries or thesauruses.” That’s not true, though. It is unsurprising that a man who launched a 2024 presidential campaign built on the theme that God directly called on him to run can’t admit fault, but nonetheless, these comments are an acknowledgment that his bill, HB 1069, in its original form is not working. This tacit admission from DeSantis is likely rooted in his ongoing delusions of one day becoming president. As reported by ABC News days before DeSantis spoke out, a source close to him confirmed that he had privately expressed interest in running for president again as early as 2028. And multiple other people close to him added that he plans to keep a small political team around him. How much money will DeSantis waste on consultants to lie to him that he still has a shot at becoming president of the United States someday before he ultimately accepts that the only DeSantis in his house with any shot at moving into the White House to launch their white Christian nationalist remix of the Kennedy dynasty is his wife? Who knows, but while I’m not often in the habit of saving boring bigots money, I have some free game for the failed presidential contender: You cannot run away from your own policies that easily. After all, it was only in 2022 when DeSantis, along with his political adviser Christopher Rufo, best known for launching a campaign against the teaching of “critical race theory” in public schools (spoiler: it never has been), were already exploiting LGBTQ biases when they decided to pivot and exploit racial animus for political gain next with legislation like the “Stop WOKE Act.” Much like the made-up beef about critical race theory to limit discussion of racial history and identity in schools and workplaces, DeSantis, Rufo and other conservative activists like them stoked fear about queer and trans people under the false pretense of parental control. As The New Yorker’s Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote in “The Political Strategy of Ron DeSantis’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Bill” at the time: “In American politics, ideology is often a smoke screen for individual ambition.” DeSantis wanted to usurp former President Donald Trump as the leader of the Republican Party and used Black history and LGBTQ people as his answer to Trump’s racist ramblings about Mexicans coming across the border to be predators. With DeSantis, queer and trans people were the predators — purposely maligning them as “groomers” and repeatedly arguing that parents “should be protected from schools using classroom instruction to sexualize their kids as young as 5 years old.” In the small minds of men like Ron DeSantis, you can’t discuss a non-heterosexual person without immediately thinking of their sexual acts. But let him tell it, and anyone who didn’t support his homophobic and transphobic legislation based on that dumb, creepy premise were alleged to be complicit in pedophilia. It’s exactly how he maligned Disney over its objections to all of his anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and legislation before then punishing them from the Governor’s Mansion. His campaign was pretty homophobic in tone at times, too. None of these stunts resulted in the same level of success for DeSantis as Trump achieved in 2016, but while DeSantis may want to forget a lot about the last two years of his life ― chasing what proved to be a humiliating defeat in the GOP primary, dropping out on Jan. 21 ― the rest of us should not let him. Whereas DeSantis failed in the primary, he succeeded in inspiring the entire Republican Party to not only target minority authors but also teachers, librarians and others who promote literacy without biased restrictions. Take West Virginia, where the House of Delegates just voted on a bill to allow the prosecution of librarians. But now, as he apparently considers another presidential run, Ron DeSantis wants to act like the level-headed man behind the mess he’s responsible for making. It doesn’t work that way, Meatball. His book ban bill is not a “false narrative” but an accurate description of a despicable policy that should hang around his neck for the rest of his life.",-0.0691995830216503,0.242132662897074

In a lawsuit filed at San Francisco Superior Court, billionaire Musk said that when he bankrolled OpenAI’s creation, he secured an agreement with Altman and Greg Brockman, the president, to keep the AI company as a non-profit that would develop technology for the benefit of the public. Under its founding agreement, OpenAI would also make its code open to the public instead of walling it off for any private company’s gains, the lawsuit says. However, by embracing a close relationship with Microsoft, OpenAI and its top executives have set that pact “aflame” and are “perverting” the company’s mission, Musk alleges in the lawsuit. “OpenAI, Inc. has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft,” the lawsuit filed Thursday says. “Under its new Board, it is not just developing but is actually refining an AGI to maximize profits for Microsoft, rather than for the benefit of humanity.” AGI refers to artificial general intelligence, which are general purpose AI systems that can perform just as well as — or even better than — humans in a wide variety of tasks. Musk is suing over breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and unfair business practices. He also wants an injunction to prevent anyone, including Microsoft, from benefiting from OpenAI’s technology.

Instead, Dellinger — one of the few thousand people who showed up to a Donald Trump rally the day before the South Carolina primary — believes Democrats may swap Biden for Vice President Kamala Harris, who Dellinger says is “not even a little bit qualified” to be president. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they tried to remove him and put in Kamala Harris and have her run,” she said. Talk to almost any Republican at a grassroots event and you’ll hear some version of this theory: that Democrats will end up nominating someone besides Biden at their August national convention. Some believe there’s even a nominee-in-waiting to replace the 81-year-old president — who hasn’t suggested he intends to step aside, despite mounting concerns about his age and health. Their predictions for who this person might be range from the plausible — California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who many see as a likely candidate in 2028 — to the totally ridiculous, like former President Barack Obama. This conspiracy, though, has some grounding in the real concerns that Democrats whisper about in private, and the grim warnings beginning to surface in polls of the election eight months away. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll released Thursday found Trump beating Biden in seven key swing states that helped Biden defeat Trump in 2020. Respondents largely found Biden to be too old, while many considered Trump, the likely GOP nominee, to be dangerous. Trump has helped to legitimize the notion that he won’t be facing Biden in November, even as polls show the former president gaining on Biden, which should be enough of a reason for Trump to hope the election is a repeat of 2020. “I personally don’t think he makes it,” Trump told Sean Hannity during a Fox News town hall back in December. Since then, Biden’s possible replacement has become the subject of wild speculation on the right. Organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) surveyed attendees at its annual confab last weekend about who they think will be the eventual Democratic nominee. A majority named former first lady Michelle Obama, who famously hates politicking in all its forms. Others cited Harris, Newsom and ex-Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Michelle Obama’s name kept coming up in conversations at Trump’s rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, last Friday. Trump supporters who spoke with HuffPost feared Democrats would tap Obama because she’d make a better candidate than Biden. (Despite her dislike of politics, Obama is one of America’s most popular political figures.) “I believe if she does it, she’ll win because society is just more about looks and no substance. We just look at popularity more than anything else,” said Doug Smith, a postal worker from Rock Hill. CPAC even dedicated a panel — with the deranged title “Cat Fight? Michelle vs. Kamala” — to dissecting the imaginary political rivalry between two of the party’s most prominent Black women. Radio host Monica Crowley warned Republicans to be ready for Obama to swoop in and clinch the nomination: “Michelle Obama is the worst-case scenario because she poses the most threatening challenge to Trump,” she said. Biden’s campaign, in an email to HuffPost, called this theory “bizarre” and said it was “happy to confirm that’s not the case.” Republicans, however, may be taking some of their cues from real election influencers who are slowly beginning to question the wisdom of another Biden run and suggesting a way that Democrats might coalesce behind someone else. This month, The New York Times’ Ezra Klein, one of the paper’s most prominent liberal columnists, argued it’s time for Biden’s inner circle to intervene and convince the president to allow delegates to get behind another nominee. Election analyst Nate Silver also wrote this month that Biden needs to campaign more aggressively or “stand down.” This week’s Michigan primary revealed warning signs for both Biden and Trump. Biden lost 13% of the Democratic primary vote to “uncommitted” voters protesting his Middle East policy and another almost 6% to Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson. Trump, meanwhile, lost 30% of the GOP primary vote to former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. The Trump supporters who spoke with HuffPost recently regarded the potential for another Democratic nominee with a mix of glee and also fear over whom Democrats might find to run, though some of their predictions would not be remotely possible. A South Carolina woman who would only identify herself as Debbie because she was afraid of online backlash from her remarks, believes that it’s really Barack Obama who’s eyeing a return to office for a third term, which is not allowed under the Constitution. In his speeches “he talks about a third term. He talks about controlling. He talks about all those things,” she said. Even though it’s illegal, she said she wouldn’t put such a scheme past Democrats, who are “sneaky little bastards.” She also touched on another theme that’s widespread on the right — that Biden isn’t even in charge at the White House. “Is he even running? I just think it’s all a sham. I think they’re trying to figure out what is going on and how people are going to react.” Joe Schaub, a 67-year-old from Columbia, South Carolina, said it’s clear that Biden is simply too old now to do the job. “He was a schmuck senator,” Schaub said. “Now he’s old and dumb. That’s a bad combination. You just can’t replace old.” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

After Al-Nassr defeated Riyadh rival Al-Shabab 3-2 on Sunday, video footage appeared to show Ronaldo cupping his ear and repeatedly thrusting his hand forward near his pelvis, in a gesture that seemed to be aimed at Al-Shabab fans. Background chants of “Messi,” referencing Ronaldo’s longstanding soccer rival Lionel Messi, could be heard. The Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation (SAFF) committee announced the ban on social media early Thursday morning local time. Al-Nassr’s next league game is at home to Al-Hazm on Thursday. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United star will also have to pay a fine of 20,000 Saudi Riyals ( $5,333) to Al-Shabab, to cover the costs of the club filing the complaint, and half of that amount to the federation. The committee said that the decision was not open to appeal. While the incident was not captured by television cameras, the actions of Ronaldo, who scored a first-half penalty in the game, were widely criticized in Saudi Arabia by former players and commentators.

It is not the first time that the Portuguese forward has been at the center of controversy since joining Al-Nassr. Last April, upon leaving the field after a game against Al-Hilal, Ronaldo appeared to grab his genitals as fans chanted Messi’s name. On that occasion, Al-Nassr said that the forward had sustained a groin injury in the match. Ronaldo, who moved to the Riyadh-based club in December 2022, has a league-leading 22 goals. His scored the opener against Al Shabab, a first-half penalty. Al Nassr is also in the quarterfinals of the Asian Champions League, a tournament it has never won.

Police records show that Thompson had physically abused Gonzalez several times throughout their relationship, including when she was pregnant. Thompson strangled Gonzalez and “recklessly caused bodily injury” in a December 2022 incident, according to court records. She told her family she wanted to leave him, but she was terrified. “He was so angry that she wanted to get away from him,” Mileny Rubio, Gonzalez’s sister, told a local Dallas outlet. “She would always tell me that she wanted to leave, but that she couldn’t.” Gonzalez knew she couldn’t continue the pregnancy because she did not want to be tied to her abuser for the rest of her life. But she lived in Dallas, Texas, where by last spring, abortion had been banned for nearly a year. So she drove to Colorado ― at least an 18-hour journey there and back ― to get an abortion. The day after Gonzalez returned, Thompson found out about the abortion and confronted her in a gas station parking lot. Surveillance video, described in a police report, shows Thompson put Gonzalez in a chokehold before she was able to shrug him off. That’s when Thompson pulled out a gun and shot Gonzalez in the head. The video shows Thompson firing several more bullets into Gonzalez’s body before fleeing. He was charged with murder and is awaiting trial. Gonzalez, like so many other domestic violence victims in Texas, faced an increased risk of violence from her abusive partner and a higher likelihood he would kill her because of the state’s decision to loosen gun laws and completely restrict access to abortion. Her story reflects the three systemic crises converging in Texas that are creating a deadly new normal for women. Each has resulted from a deliberate policy created by right-wing state lawmakers. The leading cause of death among pregnant and postpartum women in the U.S. is homicide, most often by an abusive partner with a gun. Pregnant and postpartum women are more than twice as likely to be murdered than to die from sepsis, hypertensive disorders or hemorrhage. “Pregnant and postpartum women are more than twice as likely to be murdered than to die from sepsis, hypertensive disorders or hemorrhage.” Experts tell HuffPost other states with abortion bans are also seeing an increase in domestic violence, but Texas stands out for a few reasons. The state was the first to severely restrict abortion in 2021, forcing women to stay pregnant nearly a year before Roe fell and exposing domestic violence victims to more violence with fewer ways to escape. At the same time, the Lone Star state has the largest rate of gun sales in the country and continues to have lax firearm restrictions. The state is so firearm friendly that gun rights groups chose it as the testing ground for a Supreme Court case that will determine if domestic abusers get to keep their guns. In the last decade, the amount of women shot and killed by an abuser has nearly doubled in Texas. Even though Gonzalez was able to get an abortion, her abuser still had access to a firearm. Women who travel more than 150 miles to get an abortion are more likely to experience physical violence from an abuser than those traveling less than 50 miles. Gonzalez, who leaves behind three young children, traveled at least 500 miles on the last trip of her life. HuffPost spoke with a dozen people working in advocacy services in the state ― ranging from abortion funds and family attorneys, to shelter directors and hotline staff ― who believe that the state’s abortion bans coupled with its lax gun laws are fueling intimate partner violence. Survivors and advocacy workers are terrified that this new normal will lead to more dead women in Texas: The state has made it easier for a man to obtain a gun to kill his partner than it is for a woman to access abortion care. For Holly Bowles, a sexual assault victim advocate working in Texas, the hardest part of her job is telling someone they’re pregnant. Bowles and her colleagues at SAFE Alliance, which is based in Austin, normally see people in the immediate aftermath of an assault. They serve around 6,000 Texans every year who have experienced emotionally and physically devastating violence. The nonprofit works with survivors of child abuse, human trafficking, intimate partner violence and sexual assault. Their hotline, which hears from around 2,000 callers a month, connects people to housing assistance, legal services — or to advocates like Bowles, who can support a victim through a rape kit exam or legal trial. Around half of the survivors Bowles supports have experienced intimate partner violence, or are still in active situations. Most of the victims she sees can take emergency contraception after they finish the forensic exam, but for women in abusive relationships, some may already be pregnant from a prior assault by their partner. And they might not know it. Recently, a staff member on Bowles’ team was sitting with a woman during a rape kit exam when the advocate had to tell her she was pregnant. “This was actually the fifth time I believe that her partner had gotten her pregnant intentionally so that she would stay,” said Bowles, who works as the director of SAFE’s sexual assault victim advocacy program. Before Roe v. Wade fell in 2022, Bowles could connect victims with abortion clinics or even schedule an appointment for them. Now with a total abortion ban in effect in Texas, as well as a law criminalizing those who help people seeking care, Bowles has to tread extremely carefully. “It’s very difficult to think about, in that immediate moment, what we can and can’t talk about,” she said. “We’re very limited in the things that we can do if someone does find themselves in that situation because of the laws in Texas.” Since the Supreme Court repealed Roe, calls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline about reproductive coercion ― an umbrella term that includes when an abusive partner controls pregnancy outcomes, coerces someone into unprotected sex or tampers with birth control methods ― have doubled across the country. Pregnant women were already more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner in states where abortion was restricted before Dobbs, according to a new study published in the Journal of American College of Surgeons. With 21 states now severely restricting or banning abortion altogether, “This problem is only going to be exponentially worse,” said senior author of the study Dr. Justin Cirone, a trauma surgeon and assistant professor of surgery at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Millions of Texans are dealing with the repercussions of these bans, but victims of domestic violence are particularly vulnerable. An estimated 324,000 pregnant people are abused each year by an intimate partner, and research suggests that abortion access plays a critical role in reducing intimate partner violence. For some victims, pregnancy can mean an increase in the severity of violence. For others it can actually initiate abuse in a relationship that was not violent beforehand often because of the financial and emotional stress pregnancy can create. In Texas, specifically, calls citing firearms in situations of intimate partner violence have increased dramatically (47%) between 2022 and 2023. Adding a firearm into the mix increases the likelihood that the victim dies: Women are five times more likely to be killed in a situation of intimate partner violence if a gun is present. The Supreme Court could make it even easier for domestic abusers to access firearms legally sometime this year. Following SCOTUS’ unprecedented reinterpretation of the Second Amendment in 2022, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a conviction of a Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, who was found with several firearms despite a previous arrest for domestic violence. Under federal law, the protective order for domestic abuse against Rahimi stripped him of his right to possess the guns found in his home. The court of appeals overturned Rahimi’s conviction, ruling that the federal law violates people’s constitutional right to bear arms. The Supreme Court is set to make a decision in the case later this year. Gun reform advocates and anti-domestic violence groups have worked tirelessly to close what many refer to as the “boyfriend loophole” ― a statute in the Violence Against Women Act that has allowed unmarried partners who are convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence to buy or own firearms. The Biden administration narrowed the loophole but did not fully close it, though many states have their own laws banning convicted domestic abusers from owning guns. If SCOTUS sides with Rahimi, the consequences for victims of intimate partner violence will be deadly. “This [case] is essentially putting firearms into the hands of abusive partners and that equation means lethality for survivors,” Crystal Justice, the chief external affairs officer at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, told HuffPost. “Lives will be lost if the wrong decision is made in the Rahimi case.” Recently, Marta Peláez started noticing more and more pregnant women and mothers with newborns seeking services at her San Antonio organization, the Battered Women and Children’s Shelter. She kept hearing from staff that more women were coming in with babies, and they needed help getting necessities like diapers and formula. When Peláez looked at the intake data, there was a 12% increase in pregnant women or women with a baby under 12 months seeking services from 2022 to 2023. “To me, there is a big chance that this is because of their impossibility to get an abortion, plus the dynamics of how pregnancy plays a role in domestic violence,” she said. Peláez is witnessing firsthand what statisticians are finding in their research. Birth rates in states with abortion bans have increased since Roe fell, according to the Institute of Labor Economics. Texas had the largest birth rate increase in the country in 2023, in part because the state is so large and there are longer travel times to the nearest abortion clinics. The year before, Texas had nearly 10,000 more births than expected in the last nine months of 2022 ― correlating to the state enacting the six-week ban in 2021. When victims of intimate partner violence are forced to stay pregnant, they are likely to face more violence from their abusive partner and a heightened lethality of violence. Even if a survivor makes it through pregnancy and the postpartum period, and even if she’s able to escape at some later date, she’ll always be linked to her abuser through their child. Research suggests that abortion access helps reduce domestic violence. The Turnaway Study, landmark research published in 2020, followed 1,000 women over the course of 10 years and analyzed the long-term impact of abortion access. The study found that after 2 1/2 years, the women who were denied abortions were more likely to experience violence from the men involved in the pregnancies because they have ongoing contact with them, even if they are no longer in a romantic relationship. “You can’t trust your partner, you can’t ask someone for help, your neighbors are now hunting you ― it makes the entire world unsafe,” Lisa Pous, a survivor of intimate partner violence whose pronouns are she/they, told HuffPost. “How are we supposed to leave [our abusers]? What is the point of leaving?” “To me, these laws say that my government doesn’t care if I die, the same way my partner didn’t.” Pous was able to escape a 13-year abusive relationship in 2006 with the support of SAFE. Now, she’s the founder and director of the organization’s Survivor Peer Support program which offers emotional support and other resources to victims of intimate partner violence. The program works with 300 survivors every year, with a small but mighty staff of five, including Pous. Their time is spent speaking with people in active domestic violence situations as well as survivors who are trying to get back on their feet. When the state passed the six-week abortion ban in 2021, survivors were confused and scared. Pous and her staff organized several talking groups so that people could ask questions and discuss their feelings about the law. “We can’t tell the difference anymore between who’s harming us,” Pous said, referring to the Texas government and abusers. “To me, these laws say that my government doesn’t care if I die, the same way my partner didn’t.” Pregnant people who have the resources are traveling out of Texas to get abortion care. But victims of intimate partner violence don’t have the money or freedom to travel; financial abuse is present in 99% of domestic violence relationships. Those who try to find resources and travel support through abortion funds are taking tremendous safety risks if their abuser finds out. “The amount of times I’ve heard from clients who say, ‘He can’t know I had an abortion,’ or ‘I can’t have this child because I’ll be tied to this person forever,’ or ‘The last time I was pregnant, that’s when it was the worst.’ It was all the time,” said Anna Rupani, executive director at Fund Texas Choice, an abortion fund that offers travel support. It’s routine, Rupani said, to ask if it’s safe to call clients because so many are experiencing domestic violence. Cathy Torres told HuffPost sometimes her staff at the Frontera Fund will field calls where the client is whispering over the phone because her abuser is in the next room. The majority of Torres’ clients at Frontera Fund, an abortion fund based in the Rio Grande Valley, are undocumented, which brings its own set of barriers. “If someone is undocumented, abusers will say, ‘OK, I’ll call ICE on you or I’ll call customs,’” Torres said. “That has always been the case, always. But now they’re just emboldened.” Time and time again, interpretations of state law very rarely end up supporting the pregnant person. Last year, a Texas man used the state’s six-week abortion ban to bring a $1 million wrongful death suit against three women for allegedly helping his ex-wife self-manage an abortion. The husband was emotionally abusive, according to court documents, and routinely threatened the wife including promising to drop the lawsuit if she had sex with him. The three friends who helped the woman get abortion pills wrote in a countersuit that the ex-husband “did not file this lawsuit because he is interested in ‘protecting life’... Instead, he wanted to control a life.” Many victim advocates in Texas are now experiencing the same dreadful reality physicians are facing when it comes to abortion care: turn patients away, or give the standard of care and risk legal ramifications or the loss of funding. All of the people working in advocacy services that HuffPost spoke with were afraid of Texas law enforcement, and deeply concerned about confidentiality. “The biggest priority we have all the time is privacy and confidentiality,” one Texas advocacy worker, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid repercussions from the state, told HuffPost. “Now we’re being even more careful, we’re telling staff members: ‘Do you know about tracking devices on your phone?’ Because just the way we counsel people to be safe around their abusers, I feel like as an agency we have to do the same thing with our government now.” Dr. Leila Wood, a professor at the Center for Violence Prevention and School of Nursing at the University of Texas Medical Branch, said physicians and advocates are at risk of experiencing a concept called “moral injury.” “I see providers talking about the same thing in all of these pockets, which is the idea of: ‘I’m having to do something that is counter to my protective caring instincts with this vulnerable population’ or ‘I have to risk my own safety and security,’ and it’s a decision that people make differently,” said Wood, who has led statewide research on intimate partner violence in Texas. Bowles, the sexual assault advocate with SAFE, has a hard time getting victims to be forthcoming in those initial conversations after she tells them they’re pregnant from intimate partner rape. She’s always worried that the detailed medical records the forensic exam nurses take could be turned over to law enforcement for investigation if a pregnant rape victim contemplates abortion. Now, Bowles asks nurses to step out of the room before discussing next steps. “We’re not violating [Texas’ abortion ban] or S.B. 8 in those conversations, but we put so much more thought and caution into how we give information to survivors because of that risk,” Bowles said. Conversations with victims about reproductive health care could threaten an entire organization’s ability to help other victims. Many of the groups HuffPost spoke with don’t just provide anti-domestic violence services, they offer other critical community needs like housing and legal services for immigration or child custody disputes. “Our programs receive state and federal dollars. Drawing attention to these issues is not necessarily super safe for us,” said a former employee of a large anti-domestic violence nonprofit in Texas. Pous, the survivor of domestic violence who is now at SAFE, said many of the victims she works with feel trapped ― first by their abuser and now by their home state. She said it feels like a repetition of their entire life, working so hard to escape an abuser just to be met with more violence once they’re back on their feet. She’s proud of the work she’s doing, and she will continue to support survivors as best as she can, but she’s exhausted and worries for the future. “A lot of us really thought we were finding ways out of violence,” she said. “When the laws changed, we realized… we may never make it out.”",-0.128526170576569,0.294742135931388

The goats roamed the streets of Arlington after escaping from the enclosure in the Crystal Canyon Natural Area, a park where the city brought them to “help clear underbrush and other invasive plants” to reduce fire danger in the area, according to the Arlington Police Department. Body camera footage shared by police shows officers helping to wrangle the herd as goats evade them and head down the street in one neighborhood. “Oh, it’s a mess,” said one officer in the video as the herd darts off the road and onto grass past a police vehicle. “Go, goats, go back to where you came from, please. Who knew we were goat wranglers, now?” The goats trot down another road before being led off the street. The herd was eventually guided back to their enclosure, police said. Officials believed that “a runner or a jogger” may have let the goats go, KTVT reported. The herd is in the park as part of a partnership between the city and Open Space Development, a Texas company that says the goats “work exceptionally well in eradicating invasive species” in herds “professionally and humanely managed by a dedicated team.” The next four years will change America forever.

Trump’s past written comments about his “hands-on” approach to running his businesses and his frugality will be among four dozen quotes introduced as evidence against him, ABC News reported on Thursday. Prosecutors will use them to show how Trump wasn’t a hands-off executive who didn’t really know the finer details of his companies, said Weissmann. The case centers on payoffs that were made to porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal before the 2016 election to keep quiet over alleged sexual encounters with the then-reality TV personality. “What they want to show is he is a hands-on boss, that he is frugal, he watches every dime, that’s going to be theory of their case.

She Won't Talk To Me — What Can I Do?","judith sebesta","2024-03-01","I have always been fascinated by forgiveness. For something so fundamentally crucial to us flawed humans, understanding it seems daunting — a concept both complicated and nebulous. I’m also fascinated by “Sex and the City” (like so many other 40- to 50-somethings, I suspect). The series sometimes foregrounded forgiveness, as did the 2008 “SATC” film, in which both Carrie and Miranda face betrayal by their respective partners. Later in the film, Carrie discovers that Miranda withheld information from her about Big’s betrayal, and she — in current terms — ghosts Miranda. Soon after, Miranda confronts Carrie and begs for forgiveness. Carrie responds, “You badger me to forgive you in three days — and you won’t even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago.” When Miranda protests that it is not the same thing, Carrie counters simply, “It’s forgiveness.” But is it that simple? I always assumed so. I’ve also (upon reflection, somewhat self-righteously) prided myself on how freely I forgive, believing that doing so helps the offended as much as the offender. But then, I haven’t been on the side of needing forgiveness until recently, when I became responsible for the death of my sister’s beloved dog. My sister and her husband live three hours north of me. When they needed to attend a funeral in a city two hours south of me, I offered to watch their dog, Peggy Sue. She was recovering from an injury and needed more care than my sister’s pet sitter could give. I did not know Peggy Sue well, as she was a relatively recent addition to their family; extremely shy and timid, she rarely interacted with me when I visited. But I have always considered myself a huge dog lover, as well as an experienced dog guardian/sitter. In fact, when my sister and I were teens, we ran an informal neighborhood business, J&J Pet Sitting. And I have been a “dog mom” to multiple dogs in my adulthood, including my current golden retriever, Hudson. My sister and brother-in-law arrived on a Monday to drop off Peggy Sue. This was the first time that they visited my present home, but I had described my small yard and “see-through” iron fence — the bars of which were strong but vertical, spaced about 4 inches apart. My sister expressed some concerns about the fence, suggesting that I would need to keep her dog on a leash, and I agreed. However, upon arriving at my home, she reversed this advice, as it seemed physically impossible for Peggy Sue to squeeze through the bars. I imagine you can guess what happened. About two hours after my sister and her husband departed, I took Peggy Sue, sans leash, into my yard, staying close by her. My neighbor Fernando, walking by, stopped to ask if I had gotten a new dog after the passing, at the ripe old age of 18, of my second dog, Dinah, in April last year. As I began to answer, Peggy Sue shot through the bars of the fence — and was gone. My neighbor and I looked at each other, equally astonished. I felt rooted to the spot, horrified, but quick-acting Fernando took off after my sister’s dog. To try to defend the seemingly indefensible, I should point out that Dinah, who had been exactly the same size as Peggy Sue, never escaped the yard herself; in fact, none of the dogs I have had or cared for was an “escape artist.” I was unaware at the time that Peggy Sue was, or how desperately she would want to escape and, I assume, find my sister. The next two hours are a blur to me. I joined Fernando in chasing after Peggy Sue, who was faster and more elusive than I ever could have imagined possible. We saw the little dog run as far as a commuter train station across from my neighborhood, and an expansive parking lot between, before disappearing into an apartment complex to the east. For a time, she kept coming into view, eventually running back into my community and even, multiple times, near my house. But each time she darted away again. As word — both verbally and through social media — quickly got around my close-knit, very dog-friendly community, kind neighbors helped search, occasionally reporting sightings of her in and around the area, but they were unable to catch her. Crying by that time, I called my brother and sister-in-law, who live a few miles away, to assist in the search. However, as the sun began to set, reports of sightings dissipated and soon ended altogether. My heart sinking, I knew it was time to call my sister, who by that time had arrived at her destination with her husband. After our difficult conversation, they decided to return to my house, arriving just before midnight. I apologized profusely for what happened, and the next 48 hours were a frantic whirlwind of searching, posting on social media, and contacting shelters and rescues. I made flyers and hand-delivered them to veterinarians in the area, in case someone found Peggy Sue and brought her in to check for her microchip. When my sister, her husband and I were back at my house, we barely interacted. I sensed that it was best to give them privacy in the guest room downstairs; I was unsure how my sister felt about me and the part I played in this. But as I sat, alone and despondent, in the living room upstairs, her heartbreaking, hysterical crying left no doubt in my mind how she felt about losing her dog. I hated causing her such pain. By Wednesday morning, with no signs of Peggy Sue, my sister and her husband returned home. I was unsure what the plan moving forward was; we did not speak before they left. I continued to search the area and check social media. Then, late that afternoon, a neighbor messaged me on Discord. He saw what he thought was Peggy Sue’s body on the service road of a nearby highway. He warned me that “it was a very difficult image to see” and that “I would maybe call professionals to identify/recover due to her condition.” Ignoring his advice, I rushed to the area. If you had told me before that week that I would soon be recovering the body of a dog from a busy road — and then driving it for three hours to deliver it to my grieving sister — I would have told you that I was incapable. But it’s amazing what we discover we can do when we have to. I will spare you the details of identifying Peggy Sue’s body, of getting it into the back of my SUV, of finding a way to store it until I could leave the next day to take it to my sister. I knew that my only path to possible redemption was returning the body to my sister and giving her closure. So much that week felt out of control, so I turned to controlling the few things I could, as difficult as they were. When I arrived at my sister’s house, my brother-in-law was outside alone to meet me. He thanked me for bringing the body home — and asked me not to contact them. So I have honored that request. I have disappeared from my sister’s life, and she from mine. As the weeks turn into months, my hopes of reconciliation — of forgiveness — diminish. But isn’t there a difference between committing an act intentionally and doing something accidentally, as I did? Isn’t the latter worthy of forgiveness? Or, since the tragic result is the same, do I not deserve it? As I contemplate this possibility, I find myself considering just what forgiveness is, and what we do when it eludes us. The Mayo Clinic defines “forgiveness” as “an intentional decision to let go of resentment and anger,” adding: “Forgiveness means different things to different people. ... The act that hurt or offended you might always be with you. But working on forgiveness can lessen that act’s grip on you.” But this is entirely from the perspective of the offended. What about the offender, the unforgiven — like me? Could I lessen my act’s grip on me? A quick search online suggests that a therapist or spiritual adviser would urge anyone seeking forgiveness to review the situation, admit responsibility, apologize, forgive themselves, and have patience. These are things that you can control, and I have done all of them. Would I have done anything differently? Not in the aftermath of Peggy Sue’s escape — I was careful to ensure that I would have no regrets about my actions then — but before, I sure wish I had erred on the side of caution and kept Peggy Sue on her leash in my yard. But I can no longer control that. Coincidentally, soon after these events, the Amazon Prime Video series “Expats” dropped. I watched the first episode unaware of the focus of the show. The opening depicts snapshots of a doctor, three pilots and a 12-year-old boy, who are all responsible for accidental but fatal tragedies. The narrator intones: “These stories always focus on the victim. The person responsible for the calamity is never mentioned. ... But I want to know about the perpetrators. I want to know about the people who caused the tragedies. People like me. Are they ever forgiven?” Now I was “people like me.” I cried through the episode. I worry about how this is affecting other family members, namely my brother, my sister-in-law and especially my elderly father (my mom passed away in 2022) — if they feel caught in the middle. Thankfully we do talk, if not about my sister and the death of her dog, and our relationships seem undamaged. I think what I have been feeling is akin to grief. I think I have been experiencing some of its classic stages, including denial, anger and depression. I know that due to my culpability, I will not be afforded the kind of sympathy reserved for those not responsible for the cause of their grief. Still, I grieve. I grieve the loss of that sweet little dog, never again to enjoy my sister’s love and the pleasures of this life. A few well-meaning family members and friends have tried to console me with “it was just a dog” or “dogs are lost/hit by cars all the time.” But that logic fails to work on this dog lover, who as an adult has grieved the deaths of four of her own canine companions, albeit all in relatively old age. I grieve the loss of my sister, which perhaps I feel all the more keenly with my mom’s recent passing. Not quite “Irish twins” but still only 19 months apart, my sister and I have always had a special bond; besides our parents, one of whom now is gone, no one has known me as long, and she always seemed there to protect me. And I grieve the loss of who I was: someone who felt secure in the knowledge that I had never knowingly caused anyone grief. One of my favorite phrases is “it is what it is.” And so, unwillingly, I guess I must face the final stage of grief: acceptance. But as the character Red in one of my favorite films, “The Shawshank Redemption,” argues: “Hope is a good thing, maybe even the best of things. And good things never die.” I admit that I hope my sister sees this essay and it convinces her to forgive me or, at the very least, reach out to try to begin to repair our broken relationship. If nothing else, this essay has helped me process what happened and move through the stages of grief. But I also hope that, if others out there reading this have been through something similar and are silently suffering, they might feel less alone because of it.

Greg Abbott As Potential VP Pick","marita vlachou","2024-03-01","Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, said on Thursday that he is considering Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) as a potential running mate. In a joint interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump said the governor is “absolutely” included on his vice presidential shortlist. “Certainly, he would be somebody that I would very much consider,” Trump said in a joint appearance with Abbott. Trump praised Abbott as a “spectacular man,” adding that he was honored to receive his endorsement this past November. Abbott, though, told CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday that he remains focused on Texas and helping Trump win re-election in his current position as governor. “That means helping him find the right vice presidential candidate who will help President Trump get elected and then help him be successful when he does get elected,” Abbott said. “I think there’s so many people other than myself who are best situated for that.” Abbott also told CBS Wednesday he intends to run for re-election as his current term is set to expire in 2026. Asked who else is part of his VP shortlist, Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who withdrew from the GOP presidential race last year and has since campaigned with him, was another contender. “I mean, he was OK as a candidate, but he didn’t want to talk about himself. He’s a very good man,” Trump said, according to The Hill. “For me, he’s unbelievable. He’s a surrogate.” In a Fox News town hall earlier this month, Trump acknowledged Scott, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds (R), South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic presidential candidate who has since left the party, were all “solid” choices for him to consider. The next four years will change America forever.

Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) on Thursday dismissed House Republicans who have “tried and tried and tried and failed” to smear President Joe Biden ― especially when, Garcia said, the Trumps are “the real White House crime family.” Garcia criticized GOP lawmakers for their “political stunt” and “joke” impeachment inquiry against the president just one day after Hunter Biden’s closed-door deposition on his business dealings, which he said his father was not engaged in. Garcia –– who said Republicans have “zero evidence” tying Hunter Biden to any such dealings with his father –– delivered a message to GOP lawmakers as he spoke on the House floor next to a picture of Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, who both served as advisers in the Trump administration. “I want to remind everyone about the real White House crime family,” Garcia said of Kushner, former President Donald Trump’s son-in-law. He continued: “Why did Saudi Arabia give Jared Kushner $2 billion –– billion with a B –– just months after he left the Trump White House? And why did the Saudis spend hundreds of thousands of dollars at Trump properties while he was still the president?” Garcia has previously commented on the Saudi-backed private equity fund that gave $2 billion to Kushner’s investment firm six months after he left the White House. He continued: “We also know that Jared Kushner used his cushy White House job to secure a $100 billion arms deal for Saudi Arabia, and did other favors as well.

Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) should have charged a two-drink minimum for his roasting of Donald Trump while he questioned Hunter Biden in the impeachment inquiry this week. The congressman clearly wasn’t buying into House Republicans’ muddled efforts to prove that President Joe Biden illegally benefited from Hunter Biden’s business dealings when he was vice president. So Swalwell had some fun with it in the closed-door deposition. He skewered the previous White House occupant for nepotism, reported profiting off foreign governments while in office, and business deals that a court ruled were shady ― and worthy of hundreds of millions in fines. Here’s Swalwell’s exchange with Hunter Biden, according to the transcript released Thursday. SWALWELL: Any time your father was in government, prior to the Presidency or before, did he ever operate a hotel? BIDEN: No, he has never operated a hotel. SWALWELL: So he’s never operated a hotel where foreign nationals spent millions at that hotel while he was in office? BIDEN: No, he has not. SWALWELL: Did your father ever employ in the Oval Office any direct family member to also work in the Oval Office? BIDEN: My father has never employed any direct family members, to my knowledge. SWALWELL: While your father was President, did anyone in the family receive 41 trademarks from China? BIDEN: No. SWALWELL: As President and the leader of the party, has your father ever tried to install as the chairperson of the party a daughter-in-law or anyone else in the family? BIDEN: No. And I don’t think that anyone in my family would be crazy enough to want to be the chairperson of the DNC. SWALWELL: Has your father ever in his time as an adult been fined $355 million by any State that he worked in? BIDEN: No, he has not, thank God.

Navalny was buried at a cemetery in the snowy southeastern outskirts of the capital after a short Russian Orthodox ceremony, with vast crowds waiting outside the church and then streaming to the fresh grave of President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critic with flowers and anti-government chants. Although riot police set up barricades at both the church and cemetery, no detentions were reported. Navalny’s widow, Yulia, who was not seen at the funeral, thanked him for “26 years of absolute happiness.” “I don’t know how to live without you, but I will try to do it in a way that you up there are proud of me and happy for me,” she wrote on Instagram. The service followed a battle with authorities over the release of his body. His team said several Moscow churches refused to hold the funeral for the man who crusaded against official corruption and organized massive protests. Many Western leaders blamed the death on the Russian leader, an accusation the Kremlin angrily rejected. Navalny’s team eventually got permission from the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God Soothe My Sorrows, which was surrounded by crowd-control barriers. As his coffin was removed from the hearse and taken inside the church, the crowd waiting outside broke into respectful applause and then chanted: “Navalny! Navalny!” Some also shouted, “You weren’t afraid, neither are we!” and later “No to war!” “Russia without Putin!” and “Russia will be free!” Western diplomats, including U.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, were among those who attended, along with presidential hopefuls Boris Nadezhdin and Yekaterina Duntsova. Both wanted to run against Putin in the upcoming presidential elections and opposed his war in Ukraine; neither was allowed on the ballot. Images from inside the church showed an open casket with Navalny’s body covered with red and white flowers, and his parents, Lyudmila and Anatoly, sitting beside it. Navalny’s closest associates live outside Russia and made comments in a livestream of the funeral on his YouTube channel, their voices occasionally cracking with emotion. “Those people who follow what is happening, it is of course obvious to them that this man is a hero of our country, whom we will not forget,” said Nadezhda Ivanova of Kaliningrad, who was outside the church with other supporters. “What was done to him is incredibly difficult to accept and get through it.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged those gathering in Moscow and other places not to break the law, saying any “unauthorized (mass) gatherings” are violations. After the short church service, thousands marched to the nearby Borisovskoye Cemetery, where the police were also out in force. With the casket open, Navalny’s mother and father stroked and kissed his head. A large crowd gathered at the cemetery’s gates, chanting: “Let us in to say goodbye!” The coffin was then lowered into the ground. In keeping with his irreverent sense of humor, music from the “The Terminator 2” was played, a movie his allies said he considered “the best in the world.” Mourners streamed by his open grave, tossing handfuls of soil onto the coffin as a large crowd waited at the cemetery’s entrance. As dusk fell, workers shoveled dirt into the grave while Lyudmila Navalnaya watched. A mound of flowers, funeral wreaths, candles and a portrait of Navalny sat nearby. She had spent eight days trying to get authorities to release her son’s body following his Feb. 16 death at Penal Colony No. 3 in the town of Kharp, in the Yamalo-Nenets region about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscow. Even on Friday, the morgue where the body was being held delayed its release, according to Ivan Zhdanov, Navalny’s close ally and director of his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Authorities originally said they couldn’t turn over the body because they needed to conduct post-mortem tests. Navalnaya made a video appeal to Putin to release it so she could bury her son with dignity. Russian authorities still haven’t announced the cause of death for Navalny, who was 47. His team cited paperwork Lyudmila Navalnaya saw that listed “natural causes.” At least one funeral director said he had been “forbidden” to work with Navalny’s supporters, his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on social media. They also struggled to find a hearse. “Unknown people are calling up people and threatening them not to take Alexei’s body anywhere,” Yarmysh said Thursday. Navalny had been jailed since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow to face certain arrest after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. His Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his regional offices were designated as “extremist organizations” by the Russian government that same year. Yulia Navalnaya accused Putin and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin of trying to block a public funeral. “We don’t want any special treatment — just to give people the opportunity to say farewell to Alexei in a normal way,” she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Moscow authorities refused permission for a separate memorial event for Navalny and slain opposition leader Boris Nemtsov on Friday, citing COVID-19 restrictions, according to former presidential hopeful Duntsova. Nemtsov, a 55-year-old former deputy prime minister, was shot to death as he walked on a bridge adjacent to the Kremlin on the night of Feb. 27, 2015. Yarmysh also urged Navalny’s supporters around the world to lay flowers in his honor Friday. “Everyone who knew Alexei says what a cheerful, courageous and honest person he was,” Yarmysh said Thursday. “But the greater truth is that even if you never met Alexei, you knew what he was like, too. You shared his investigations, you went to rallies with him, you read his posts from prison. His example showed many people what to do when even when things were scary and difficult.” ___ More AP coverage of Alexei Navalny: https://apnews.com/hub/alexei-navalny By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/georgia-fani-willis-trump-case_n_65e1b213e4b013678e14da07","Legal Arguments To Begin Over Fani Willis' Future In Trump Case","kate brumback","2024-03-01","ATLANTA (AP) — After several days of extraordinary testimony, the judge in the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump is set to hear arguments Friday over whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be removed from the prosecution over a romantic relationship. Lawyers for Trump and other defendants in the election case argue Willis’ romance with a special prosecutor she hired creates a conflict of interest. They say Willis paid outside lawyer Nathan Wade large sums for his work and then improperly benefited when he paid for vacations for the two of them. Willis and Wade have acknowledged the relationship, which they said ended last summer, but they have argued it does not create any sort of conflict and has no bearing on the case. The pair said they didn’t begin dating until the spring of 2022, after Wade was hired, and that they split travel expenses. Since the relationship was revealed in early January, the subject dominating the court’s time and the public’s attention has not been the crimes prosecutors allege Trump and his allies committed while trying to overturn the election, but rather the intimate details of Willis and Wade’s relationship. The hearings have at times wandered into surreal territory: Atlanta’s mayor watching from the gallery as a former Georgia governor testified, Willis’ father talking about keeping stashes of cash around the house and details of romantic getaways. Willis’ removal would throw the most sprawling of the four criminal cases against Trump into question as the former president seeks a return to the White House. But it wouldn’t necessarily mean the charges against him and 14 others would be dropped. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee heard details of Willis and Wade’s personal lives and conflicting accounts of when they started dating, but it remains unclear whether he will find the relationship caused a conflict of interest that merits removing the prosecutors from the case. At a hearing preceding testimony, McAfee noted that under the law, “disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.” He said he wanted testimony to explore “whether a relationship existed, whether that relationship was romantic or non-romantic in nature, when it formed and whether it continues.” Those questions were only relevant “in combination with the question of the existence and extent of any personal benefit conveyed as a result of the relationship,” McAfee said. Georgia State University law professor Anthony Michael Kreis, who has followed the case closely, said a lot will depend on which standard McAfee uses: an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict. “The standard I think that’s applicable is an actual conflict of interest where the evidence produced shows that Fani Willis profited off the investigation and the charging decisions that she brought against the 2020 election interference defendants,” he said. Because Willis and Wade said the relationship ended before they sought an indictment in the election interference case, it’s hard to argue the due process rights of Trump and his co-defendants were violated, Kreis said. But if McAfee applies an “appearance of conflict” standard, that could mean trouble for Willis and Wade “because the shadow has been cast over the whole thing,” he said. If Willis and her office are disqualified, a nonpartisan council supporting prosecuting attorneys in Georgia would be tasked with finding a new attorney to take over. That person could either proceed with some or all of the charges against Trump and others, or drop the case altogether. Even if a new lawyer moved forward on the path charted by Willis, the inevitable delay would seem likely to lessen the probability of the case getting to trial before November’s presidential election when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee. A Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others in August on charges related to efforts to keep the Republican incumbent in power even though he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors, while Trump and 14 others have pleaded not guilty. Willis and Wade’s relationship was first exposed in a motion filed by an attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman that sought to have the indictment dismissed and to bar Willis and Wade and their offices from continuing to prosecute the case.

Lawyers for Roman, Trump and some of the other defendants in the election case repeatedly tried during last month’s hearing to prove the prosecutors were not being truthful about when their relationship began. Robin Yeartie, Willis’ former friend and employee, testified she saw the pair hugging and kissing long before Willis hired Wade. But Wade’s former law partner and onetime divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley, expected to be a key witness for lawyers trying to disqualify Willis, was at times evasive during testimony, saying he had “no direct knowledge of when the relationship started.” Trump’s attorneys filed an analysis of location data from Wade’s cellphone that they say supports the assertion Willis and Wade began dating before he was hired. An investigator’s statement says Wade’s phone was in the neighborhood south of Atlanta where Willis was living at least 35 times in the first 11 months of 2021. Wade had testified he visited Willis’ condo fewer than 10 times before his hiring.

Brown shared the “crazy story” with Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” Thursday. The “Stranger Things” star announced her engagement to Bongiovi, the son of musician Jon Bon Jovi, in April last year. Brown said she and Bongiovi had bonded over diving and got their diving licenses together, prompting his decision to propose to her under the sea. “We were on vacation and he was like ‘Mill, you gotta be up at 8 a.m., we’re going on a dive,’” she said. “So we go under, and we’re like many meters down, and he ... gives me like a shell, and I like turn it over, and it’s a ring,” she went on. Unable to speak underwater, Brown said she struggled to communicate that she was saying yes. He put the ring on her finger, and she tried to show it to him on her hand. “As I go to show him, the ring falls off my finger. Plummets, like so fast. It was like a cinematic movie,” she continued. She said Bongiovi “threw himself” into the deep in pursuit. “The diver was like, ‘You can’t do that,’ like your ears ― you literally, your brain will explode,” she said. “He does a cinematic, like, grab, opens, and he saved the ring,” she added. She said she felt the moment was a reflection of who he is, “and I feel like we’re always gonna have each other’s back, and if anyone drops the ball, we got it.” When they surfaced, Brown said, her fiancé explained that he had asked for her mom’s ring, but Brown’s mom had said “absolutely not,” predicting he would drop it. He gave her that ring above the surface. Watch the interview below.

But one look at the staggering (and growing) list of banned books will give you a sense of what those messages are: 1982’s “The Color Purple” by Alice Walker, a sprawling novel about a queer Black girl who overcomes decades-long physical and sexual abuse through the love and support of Black women. 2019’s “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe, an illustrated story of a young protagonist exploring their identity outside the binary. 2009’s “Tricks” by Ellen Hopkins, the tale of a group of teenagers who fall prey to drug use and turn to sex work. 2017’s “Dear Martin” by Nic Stone, the story of a Black teenage boy who’s wrongfully arrested and grapples with racial injustice and Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy. 2006’s “Sold” by Patricia McCormack, a story about a young girl who is sold into slavery in India. These narratives are not completely unrelated to many young readers’ real-life experiences — and a quick glance at the news or reading the words of young people themselves could confirm that. In “The ABCs of Book Banning,” the Oscar-nominated short documentary from directors Sheila Nevins, Trish Adlesic and Nazenet Habtezghi, young people reveal their frustrations with the draconian concept of restricting their access to literature. The argument from the adult side has often been that book bans, or rulings like the British Board of Film Classification’s recent decision to increase the rating of the 1964 family film “Mary Poppins″ from “U” for Universal to PG due to “discriminatory language,” are necessary to protect kids. But are either of these tactics effective in a world where many adults, including some parents and politicians like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, want to restrict knowledge of some aspects of history entirely? As evident in “The ABCs of Book Banning,” children are more aware of — and, in many cases, more directly impacted by — the world around them than they’re given credit for. Racial profiling, gender identity and LGBTQ rights are all themes of which they are already painfully aware. The film makes it increasingly clear that many children and teens can actually handle conversations about these topics. Some adults, though, are unwilling to have them, whether a movie comes with a “parental guidance” suggestion or not. Opponents of the bans, like teachers and authors, have railed against them, fearing they serve to limit the facts from young people and “control the narrative.” In February, the Washington Post reported that managers of an Asheville, North Carolina, bookstore took in eight tons of picture books restricted by the laws in Florida, which has the highest number of banned books in the U.S. They also managed to send some books to people in the Sunshine State who requested them. In “The ABCs of Book Banning,” Ridley, a 9-year-old student in Jacksonville, struggles to understand the decision to ban “And Tango Makes Three,” Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell’s 2005 illustrated book about two male penguins who welcome a child through another penguin’s egg. “It’s about two penguins that are gay with each other and, even though they have their differences from the other penguins, they could still have a child, take care of it,” Ridley said. “They could do pretty much everything but lay an egg. They’re still human.” What’s especially critical here is that Ridley is able to note the universality and humanity of an illustrated story that centers animals. “Everyone deserves these beautiful books; to read, to learn, etcetera,” Ridley continues. “They teach them about culture, what they can be. They should be able to be what they want to be. But they can’t be without knowing what it means.” Kierran, 15, reckons with what it means to ban author Art Spiegelman’s 1986 graphic novel, “Maus,” detailing a character’s experience in the Holocaust. “I feel like if you’re trying to ban this book, you’re trying to ban Jewish history,” Kierran says plainly. “That’s like saying, ‘Well, this didn’t happen,’ which will probably just eventually lead to the same thing happening again because people don’t know it even happened in the first place.” Then the teen gets right to the meat of the issue: “Because you’re stealing knowledge. Why would you want to steal knowledge?” Kierran’s final question, to which there’s no response, lingers long after the film ends. If adolescents are able to properly discern queer themes, concentration camps and the potential of history repeating itself, they might be open to a dialogue around why, say, “hottentots” is a prejudicial term. That’s the word young “Mary Poppins” viewers encounter twice in the Disney film, and for a long time it was deemed entirely acceptable by a racist white Hollywood. It’s a racial slur historically targeting the Khoekhoe, an Indigenous people from South Africa. The word is uttered by Admiral Boom (Reginald Owen), a supporting character. To be fair, the movie’s increased rating is deserved. It also creates a vital opportunity for adults to talk to young people about why the term is so harmful. Leshu Torchin, a senior lecturer of film studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, recently told The New York Times that the new rating indicates that “children could watch a film, and if not with their parents to help contextualize things, could come away either thinking certain language is OK, or come away from it feeling harmed by what they’ve just seen.” That makes sense, in theory. But considering many adults’ efforts to outright restrict children and teens from learning history (or even present-day events) as depicted accurately in books, it’s hard to feel confident that those conversations will happen in many homes. Poet and author Nikki Giovanni, who appears in “The ABCs of Book Banning,” believes no book or hateful term should be restricted at all. That includes her own, 2005’s “Rosa,” a children’s picture book about activist Rosa Parks that has been subject to bans. “To ban it is to give it power over you,” she says. “There’s no word that should have power over you. If it’s a word, you can use it. Everyone may not like it. Everybody may not want to hear it. But you can’t give a word a power. Words have to be free.” Giovanni then puts the onus on the consumers: “We’re the ones that have to decide what to do with the words that we’re hearing and the words that we’re saying.” There’s woefully been no consensus around what that decision should be. It feels like every year now in our evolving social climate adults keep bumping into new ways to contend with or simply erase these issues, particularly when it comes to art for kids and teens. In 2021, Disney+ made the conscious choice to add a disclaimer to 18 episodes of “The Muppet Show” that contain culturally insensitive images. So the streamer maintains the episodes and its TV-G rating that suggests it’s suitable for all audiences, but encourages essential dialogue for educational purposes. Part of that warning reads as follows: “Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.” That seems more effective, assuming adults go on to have those conversations, than, say, revising inappropriate text and imagery, as the late Roald Dahl’s estate did with his children’s books just last year. As Kierran said, attempts to erase history are counterproductive. You can confront it, discuss it and try to prevent it from happening again. Because what’s to stop kids from learning and using offensive terms on their own if 1) they don’t know they’re offensive or 2) don’t understand their historical context? And what message does it send to kids when many books that are considered problematic — among a staggering 3,362 cases, according to PEN America last year — are usually ones that don’t center white, cisgender, and/or straight characters and storylines? Their themes might be uncomfortable for some. But that’s not the same as being harmful. And that lack of distinction could have a detrimental impact on young readers. “By putting restrictions on who gets to claim shelf space, school boards are telling marginalized kids — especially those who are LGBTQ+ and/or kids of color — that their very existence is invalid,” Pooja Makhijan reported in Parents magazine last year. “That’s exactly what these book bans are meant to imply.” At a time when media literacy is devastatingly low, we should be bolstered by the fact that many children and teens are hungry for information, historical narratives and stories from people who both share and don’t share their experiences. The more they learn, the more inquisitive and vocal they are. That should be encouraged and engaged with, not dismissed, which would only result in a new generation of ignorance. “If you were the person who helped ban this book, why?” Yeye, 9, asks about “Rosa” in “The ABCs of Book Banning.” “Do you feel like Rosa Parks is a bad person? Do you think that people should not know about her legacy? Why do you choose to do this?

Her husband, Michael, works at an IT firm. Annual household income: $230,000 Monthly household take-home pay: $9,700 Monthly child care costs: $4,000 for the nanny, plus $1,600 for two weeks of summer camp, and $160 per month for membership to an infant gym where kids can be dropped off.

I’m checking my computer at least until 7:40 p.m. And that’s an improvement, whereas last year, I was working till 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. two to three times a week. “When people want you to go back into the office, it’s also, ‘Well, do you expect me to stay in the office those hours?’ The type of job that I work, people can be done trading, but my books or my risk assessment-type tasks are not done. The traders or the salespeople are gone, [but] we still need to clean and tidy and prepare for the next day. So it’s definitely a balance.” Her husband’s hours are shorter. “I’m required to work probably eight to nine hours a day. He only has to work seven, and then three days out of those five he only has to work six. He can also flex his time. In his industry, he’s not required [to do] overtime or stay late.

It’s a give and take to just make sure it’s balanced for our kids or us, because it is a lot to manage.” Child care arrangements: “We have a full-time nanny right now, which is just amazing.” Maloney’s husband leaves early for work, and Maloney is with the kids from around 6 a.m. - 9 a.m., when the nanny arrives. The nanny stays with the children until 3 or 3:30 p.m., when their father returns from work. The family has only had the nanny since Maloney returned to work from her maternity leave after having the twins. When they had their first child, “My girlfriend was pregnant at the same time, and her abuela watched our son. We loved that.” He ended up at a nearby Montessori school, and his younger brother followed him there after a brief stint in a day care center. “When Josie [their eldest daughter] came home [from the hospital] and I was on maternity leave, I was like, ‘Look, let’s just bring [the boys] home. We can save money.’ And I was actually debating quitting and just becoming a stay-at-home mom. I think the reason I went back [was] because Josie was born in 2020 and she was a COVID baby. So when I went back [to work], there was no talk of me having to go into the office, and I was like, ‘This is amazing. We’ll just make that work.’ I worked from home with them, with some help here and there, but mostly it was me and them for a year to maybe two years.” Maloney described what this period of working from home looked like: “I baby-wear, I breastfeed, I have a standing desk, and we raised our children to be independent but not unattended. I would be baby-wearing while on a call, and I could make my kids breakfast. We would do home-school in the morning and then they would go out. I also had neighbors’ support, so like the neighbor [might] help and take them for a walk. Then my husband came home early, because he didn’t take his full paternity leave. He would be home at noon, so I was really only working for four or five hours by myself. That was the first year. Then from there, the kids and I and Josie, we all had just like a schedule and it actually worked really well for us.” Given the circumstances, her managers were supportive. “It’s not like people didn’t know that they were home. It was in the midst of COVID. Our baby was born with several heart problems. She would be more susceptible to have a severe reaction to COVID, so my managers were all aware. I was like, ‘Look, they’re home because it’s not safe. And that’s that.’” Eventually, Maloney sent her daughter to the same Montessori school her sons had attended. “She really liked it.” “When I had the twins, I did the same thing. I was like, ‘OK, I’m done. I’m staying home.’ It’s actually a running joke. Every time I have a kid, I’m like, ‘All right, I’m not going back to work, not doing it.’ At the end of my maternity leave, I was like, ‘Hey, let’s try just a little bit.’” Maloney had imagined she’d feel comfortable stepping away from her job once she had accumulated six figures in her retirement account, a goal she has now surpassed, but the family had just purchased a home that needed much more renovating than they initially anticipated, so going back to work seemed to make sense. While she pays the nanny more than she takes home with her paycheck, Maloney saves “aggressively” and uses FSA and HSA accounts. The family’s insurance also comes through her job. While the dollars don’t seem to add up, her financial contribution to the family remains substantial. For now, she said, “I’m just gonna keep working and just manage expectations on what our dream life would be.” Maloney’s husband had a stay-at-home mom, but “I didn’t grew up in a household like that. My mom, my dad — my grandmother worked until she was 70. The idea of not working, to me, is baffling.” Yet she can still imagine a point in the future where she cares for the children full time and runs “hobby businesses ― business that we’re not dependent on, but I’ll still have something to structure my mind.” Then again, when she imagines the future costs of her kids’ braces and their college education, it’s difficult to imagine making do with less income. “Sometimes like when I’m having a bad day or I’m like, ‘What am I doing?’ I just need to remember, I’m a mom that’s working. I’m not a working mom.” Her kids have always been the first priority. When she returned to work after having her first, she negotiated being able to leave the office at 3 p.m. in order to pick up her son, completing the rest of her work from home. “I was able to just go in, work till 3, get most of my structured reports done, and then pick my son up, or have my husband pick my son up, and still be a part of dinner and bedtime.” “I know that my priorities are always going to be my family. It’s just being able to say to someone, ‘This is not healthy or worth the struggle. The chokehold of this job is not worth my family’s dynamic of what we value and what we need.’” Maloney’s leave with the twins coincided with summer, so the family spent time last year vacationing and camping together. She decided not to pay her daughter’s preschool tuition again that fall, and all the children have been at home ever since. (The older two boys are home-schooled.) When her husband’s paternity leave ended in October of 2023, they hired the nanny. While the nanny enables her to work, Maloney said, “I’m still a mom while working. It’s not like when I’m home I’m not participating. I’m the default parent in a lot of aspects. I’m the rule setter, I’m the home-school planner. I am that parent. To some extent, I feel like mentally it’s about the same as if I was at home with three kids. And to some people, that’s probably crazy.” It was a bit easier during the lockdown, when others were understanding of small, child-related interruptions in the workday. Maloney says she has noticed that there is less patience for these now. It’s harder to pretend that she doesn’t hear the conversation happening right outside the door to her home office. “When people understood that I was processing two conversations it was much easier to be like, ‘OK, one minute. Let me just talk to this [person] and handle that, and I’ll be with you.’ It was a lot more grace and understanding, and just flexibility.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

People just say the most inappropriate things to us, it’s crazy.” Once, a stranger asked her husband if he was sure the children were all his. Others have insinuated that the family must rely on government assistance. “I feel like a lot of people don’t see when you have large families, the sacrifices you make at the beginning of your marriage before you even have those kids. Most of our friends still have student loans. There’s a lot of debt going on. They don’t rearrange their entire life to just be debt free. That’s a lot of freaking work.” Maloney and her husband did that work, and now, she says, “When our kid needs ear tubes put in or another kid who grows like a freaking weed [and] needs to buy new shoes, or cleats — all of that stuff.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. For those who have them, ingrown toenails need little introduction. They occur when the corner of the nail grows and curves into the skin, the result of too-tight shoes, incorrect trimming or injury to the nail. They cause inflammation that is notoriously uncomfortable: Ingrown nails can make it painful to simply wear shoes, and even cause pain when the affected nail so much as brushes against bedsheets. Discomfort from ingrowns can permeate even banal aspects of everyday life, and as a result, many folks with ingrown toenails learn to simply live with this inflammation and pain. I spent years hoping-slash-deluding myself into believing that my own ingrown big toenails, caused by years of too-tight cleats and heels, were not that disruptive to my life and would eventually improve on their own. Yet one day last year, I brushed one of my ingrowns against my carpeted floor and found myself doubled over in pain. I was forced to acknowledge that my ingrowns were not sustainable, and they were not going to get better by themselves. I combed the internet for the best home treatment for ingrowns, and found the CurveCorrect ingrown toenail treatment kit on Amazon. I’m protective over my money and was wary of spending $45 for the kit, but after reading through testimonials from reviewers who, too, were initially skeptical but were ultimately “gobsmacked” and “delighted” at its results, deeming it “worthy every penny,” I decided to take the plunge — and I’m so happy that I did. The kit is designed to treat and correct the root of the problem: a nail that is literally growing and curving incorrectly. It works by using thin tension braces, which act like springs, to slowly and gently straighten the nail. The brace also relieves pressure from the ingrown, helping ease discomfort within days, according to CurveCorrect and the experience of myself and many reviewers. The brace attaches to the affected nail using a high-bond adhesive. “For a simple, non-infected toenail that tends to become ingrown near where the nail grows out beyond the nail bed, this type of product could be helpful,” Dr. Howard E. Friedman, a podiatrist at Suffern Podiatry in New York State, told HuffPost. Of course, it’s always a good idea to visit a podiatrist if you’re experiencing pain from an ingrown toenail. If your ingrown is particularly severe, it will require surgery or an in-office procedure in order to correct it. You should not opt for home treatment if your ingrown shows signs of an infection, fungus or open wound, or if your nail has extreme curvature (greater than 180 degrees). In addition, folks with limited mobility may benefit from a second person’s help to apply the brace. The kit is not suitable for children under 8 years old. For more information, check out CurveCorrect’s website. For my purposes, I found the CurveCorrect brace to be a game-changer. Within a week of applying the brace, my ingrowns had noticeably improved and flattened. A year later, after having worn the braces for several months, I still can’t quite believe how much better my nails feel and look. Both my big toes are now even and flat, and they don’t hurt anymore, which feels like something of a miracle. Before applying the brace, I — and many reviewers — recommend that you read and re-read the instructions. The home treatment is simple enough, but should be done carefully. The main thing to keep in mind is not to push your nail to correct too quickly, so you should err on applying the brace toward the wider end of your toenail to start, where the brace will be longer and thus hold less tension. Very slight discomfort is normal when you first apply the brace, but pain is not normal. If pain does occur, take the brace off immediately. Then, if you want to continue, apply the brace with less tension — cut it longer — and apply it further down your nail, towards the wider end of the nail. As for preventing future ingrowns? “The best prevention is to allow the corners of the nails to extend beyond the nail fold and cut the nail straight across. Most ingrown nails that I see are due to people who cut the nail too short,” said Friedman over email. “Only ballerinas and sprinters need short toe nails.” Check out what reviewers have to say about the CurveCorrect kit, or grab your CurveCorrect kit now from Amazon. “I wish I’d taken a ‘before’ picture...these strips works exactly as I hoped (but doubted) they’d work! They take a little practice to get on just right. You need a steady hand, a bright light, and a gentle squeeze on the glue bottle so you don’t apply too much glue. If you get the strip applied properly, it’ll last a week or two before it comes off. They do stay a little “catchy” on the ends, even with filing, so I apply a bandaid over the strip to make sure my socks don’t catch and encourage the strip to come loose. My big toes had such a tight curl at the end that the corners were nearly meeting in the middle. After wearing for only a few days there was a noticeable change. After a week or week and a half, the nail has a very natural gentle curve at the end. I’ll wear the strip/brace until it reaches the end of the nail. I may reapply another strip closer to the nail bed to encourage correct growth until I feel certain that my nails won’t revert back to the curve. The strips don’t hurt to wear and have relieved any pain from the nails biting into my toes. I can’t be any happier with this product!!!” — Michelle  “I don’t gush about products, and am hesitant to believe gushy, exclamation point laden reviews. But this darned little system worked for mr, almost instantly. Advice - read the various reviews that go into detail re what to expect and best way to succeed. I am elderly, stiff of joint, too much belly, and can’t see worth beans. I read reviews, read through the instructions twice, and set up a sort of dry run to see where I might run into trouble. If you can possibly find one, get a helper. BUT, it can be done alone if you follow the directions. When placing the first glue laden end of the brace strip, I advise starting with the side of your toenail that is more difficult to see and reach. My ingrown nail on the big toe hurt a lot at each corner where the nail was digging in as well as on the bottom of the toe. In less than an hour after the brace was glued into place, nothing hurt. I kept poking and squeezing, not quite willing to believe. This was a toe that was so sore that even the sheet on it would increase the pain. Shoes were limited to thongs and clogs. Three days after I applied the little strip, I went for a pedicure, fully expecting the brace strip to fall off in the swirling foot bath. Nope. The tech filed down the blunt ends a bit then treated the nail like the other nine. 52 hours later and all is well.” — Stephanie L. “I highly recommend this product. I learned about it online and had only other reviews to convince me if it works or not. I took the chance and I am so glad I did. My guess is you will be, too, but they have a satisfaction guarantee so it’s really no risk. I always thought the shape of my toes was just one of those things that I couldn’t change about myself and that occasional pain & pressure from my toenails getting longer was inevitable. I put these braces on two days ago. Within 2 hours on the first day I could already feel tremendous relief on my left foot- like the edge of my toenail was being gently lifted away from my toe...not at all painfully the way it feels when something is beneath the nail pushing it up. I wore socks and shoes yesterday and the braces didn’t snag or feel uncomfortable. I didn’t know if I got the edges all the way glued down so I was worried, but they were fine. Today I can feel the differences on both feet, and my left foot already seems like I have a whole different toenail shape. It used to start wide at the base and then get narrower toward the tip but now it’s the same width all the way up and I am 100% PAIN FREE for the first time in probably 10 years.The difference is so noticeable that I’ve come to realize my former version of “normal” was actually barely tolerable and I’d simply grown accustomed to it. I hate that it took me this long to find a product that could help. But I also LOVE that this product exists.” — Julie H. “I was very dubious about this product initially. I’ve had ingrown toenails on both big toes for around 15 years and I’ve tried everything in the past including removing both nails, seeing podiatrists etc, all whom have said the only way to fix permanently was to have the ingrown part surgically removed to stop that area of the nail growing back. Whilst this may seem like a good option for some, I just didn’t want to have narrow big toenails, so I declined each time and carried on with my severely curved nails. As the ingrown part did not hurt I guess I just put up with it! Last year my nails also started to grow ridged and very thick, which was awful for me and I needed to come up with another plan. After researching loads of products/tools/creams/remedies etc I came across this product and thought I’d give it a go. I was not disappointed. In fact I was shocked at how good it has worked. I’ve needed to use 3 times (on both toes), but after just the first time i could see huge improvements in just a couple of weeks. The strips stayed on for around 4-5 weeks each time, and now I can say for the first time in years and years, I finally have semi-flat big toe nails and I’m DELIGHTED with this product. I had to pay for shipping to the UK as the product is not available here, but it was worth every penny. I just wish I had found it years ago. Be patient with the process, follow the instructions VERY CAREFULLY, in fact read them over and over before you start and it will make sure the application works and fits first time. Don’t hesitate, this product has changed everything for me, I can now wear pretty open toed shoes and sandals without embarasment for the first time in over a decade. Very Happy.” — Mrs P By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Exercise is good for many different reasons. It directly affects all of the factors that go into a long, healthy life — mobility, heart health, brain health, muscle strength and more, said Jonathan Zins, a physical therapist at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. Exercise also contributes to the cycle of healthy aging. And, according to experts, there are a few types you should do if you are hoping to boost your longevity. Here’s what they are: Cardiovascular exercise — like running, biking, dancing, boxing and more — is full of benefits that can help you age well. Cardiovascular activity focuses on strengthening your heart. “Nothing else really can strengthen it better than a cardio workout,” said Sandra Corcione, a personal trainer at FITloft Gym in New Jersey. Specifically, aerobic exercise can lower your risk for heart disease (which is the No. 1 killer of American adults). It also helps lower blood pressure and your risk of diabetes, which are two heart disease risk factors. Beyond this, cardiovascular exercise also is good for brain health, Zins said. “The brain responds very quickly to exercise. Just three hours of aerobic exercise a week can greatly increase brain perfusion — so, getting more blood supply up to the brain and reducing inflammation.” Working out may even help prevent some cases of dementia, Zins noted. In fact, according to the U.K.-based Alzheimer’s Society, you can reduce your risk of dementia by roughly 28% by doing regular exercise. When doing aerobic exercise, you want to be out of breath, Zins added. Your heart rate should be at 60% to 80% of your heart rate max, which can be calculated online or through a fitness tracker. For example, if your max heart rate is 185 beats per minute, a heart rate of 111 to 148 would put you in that 60% to 80% target. Or you can do the “talk test” to determine where your heart rate is. “If you’re having difficulty having a conversation because you have to take lots of breaths to get your oxygen supply up, that’s a good sign that you’re working at a moderate to vigorous intensity. But if you’re able to have a conversation... you know the intensity is really not high enough,” Zins said. “Weightlifting helps you maintain bone mass, bone density and muscle mass,” according to Corcione, which are three areas known to deteriorate as you age. What’s more, strength training can help with falls, which are an unfortunate reality for many older people. “The reason why falls are so bad is because we can get broken bones,” Zins explained. “An 80-year-old is estimated to have about 40% of the muscle strength as a 20-year-old, but that’s not just because our muscles magically disappear when we get older. A lot of that is because we stop moving when we get older, and we stop using our muscles.” “There’s a very well-established body of evidence saying that progressive resistance training is safe and effective in older adults,” he continued. If you’ve never lifted weights before, he suggests working with a health care professional to get started safely. Additionally, you can look into strength training classes in your community. Experts can help you determine the right weight for you to lift. Something too light won’t challenge you, while something too heavy could lead to injury. “Falls are the greatest cause of [injury-related] death in folks over 65 and 1 in 3 older adults are going to fall every single year,” Zins said. Falls can also lead to impaired mobility in older folks, “and when we’re not mobile, we’re not able to live our lives how we want to,” he added. “Mobility is essential for living a good life.” Exercise helps keep you mobile and, specifically, balance training can be an effective way to avoid falls. Balance training is varied but can include activities like tennis, standing on one leg and tai chi, Zins said. However, it’s important that you don’t dive into balance training if you are older or feel like your balance is already off. “I would say go to a physical therapist, where they can give you an individualized plan, and then follow that up with just a community exercise class that works specifically on balance,” Zins explained. “Because nobody wants to be fearful of losing their balance when they’re in the comfort of their own home.” Social connection is a major part of aging well and living a long life, Zins stressed. When compared to people who live with family or in a community, people who live alone live shorter lives. If you can join an exercise class in your community, you’ll benefit not only from the exercise, but from social connection, too. In reality, many folks don’t like certain workouts — whether it’s strength training or balance work or aerobic exercise — and don’t do exercise at all as a result.

Whatever activity keeps you moving regularly and consistently is the workout you should prioritize. Don’t let a distaste for strength training keep you from exercising altogether. If you like dancing, do that. Or if you are a fan of running, do that. No matter what you decide to do, it’s important to commit to enough exercise each week. “Our catchphrase is 150 plus two, so 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise, plus two days of strength training is going to be the recommendation,” Zins said. “The key here is to stay consistent with that activity ... the gains happen when you consistently do something for years and throughout your life, even as you get older,” Corcione noted.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/beauty-influencers-transparent-costs-of-procedures_l_65dcdcebe4b0e4346d53575b","These Beauty Influencers Are Getting Real About The Costs Of All Their Procedures","brittany wong","2024-03-01","Last month, a video went viral showing aesthetician nurse Miranda Wilson pointing out every cosmetic procedure she had done in 2023. In the clip, the 30-year-old beauty influencer says she had Botox twice last year ($1,000 total), masseter Botox once to achieve a more defined jawline ($1,200), two lip flips ($100 each) and traptox ― or Barbie Botox, as it’s been called ― once ($1,600), for shoulder slimming and tension relief. Wilson then moves on to injectables: She gets Volbella lip injections once a year to maintain her lip shape ($650) and two vials of Sculptra injected to restore volume in her face ($1,600 total). Lastly, to rejuvenate her skin, three or four times a year she gets vampire facials, which involve taking a sample of your own blood, extracting the plasma and then injecting it back in your face with microneedling. (The treatment, less frighteningly called microneedling with PRP, runs anywhere from $500 to $1,300 per session.) The video received more than 1 million views ― and a wide range of reactions. Though some applauded Wilson for her transparency, others said they found the endless upkeep inherent in such a beauty regimen to be “incredibly sad.” “This woman (absolutely gorgeous) is the perfect example of when men say a woman is ‘naturally beautiful’ but really they’ve had all of these procedures,” one person wrote of the clip on X (formerly Twitter). This woman (absolutely gorgeous), is the perfect example of when men say a woman is “naturally beautiful” but really they’ve had all of these procedures. pic.twitter.com/c2nB5UjaGr Wilson isn’t the only one lifting the veil on costly med-spa procedures. Along with influencers, celebrities including Kylie Jenner and Ariana Grande all fessed up to lip fillers and Botox in the last year. (Jenner doing so after years of vehemently denying she’d ever touched her face.) Though the admissions are relatively small ― no one is admitting to a Brazilian butt lift (BBL), a BBL reversal (yes, they have those now) or a face-lift ― it’s a welcome relief after years of celebrities either denying having work done or chalking their youthful appearances up to a skin care product they’re promoting or upping their water consumption. (Or, in Olivia Munn’s case, lots of water and Japanese potatoes.) Dawn Montieth is among the influencers getting frank about her noninvasive cosmetic procedures. An aesthetic injector in Southern California with more than 78,000 followers on TikTok, Montieth said she created her “What I’ve Had Done” video because she didn’t want to gatekeep procedures. Being honest with her followers also felt more ethical than pretending her perfect skin and taut jawline were simply the results of miracle beauty products you could find at Sephora. “When you’re on social media, it’s easy to get caught up in the allure of flawless influencers, but it’s crucial to remember that what we see is often just the highlights and not the full picture,” she said. Many influencers who undergo treatments stay quiet about them to preserve the lucrative deals they have with beauty brands; if you mention that you just got $600 worth of Restylane lip filler and then hawk a $30 “plumping” lip gloss the next day, you might as well kiss any future brand deals or sponsorships goodbye. But Montieth thinks most influencers ― and celebrities ― who are tight-lipped are just self-conscious and worry about the judgment they’ll receive if they’re frank about cosmetic work. “That’s why I wanted to create a safe and honest space to openly share my experiences,” she said. “By shedding light on these topics, I want to empower others to make informed choices about their own beauty journeys.” (Of course, given her line of work, it’s also good for business to promote such procedures.) Sabryna Salmon, a 30-year-old content creator from Los Angeles, created a two-part series pointing out the procedures she had done before turning 30: Kybella under her chin and knees cost $500 or $600, but it was worth it, she says in one clip. Sculptra to get a rounder butt was definitely not worth it, since it requires around 10 sessions at $900 a pop. Salmon sees her videos as part of the de-influencing trend on TikTok: Since last year, many influencers have started creating videos in which they dissuade their followers from buying certain cult-favorite products they personally find subpar. “Some of these procedures can be expensive!” Salmon told HuffPost. “I’d hate to see anyone waste their hard-earned money.” She added, “I’m certainly not promoting anything, just lifting the veil on the reality of beauty procedures; at my heart I’m just a girl’s girl and happy to share.” #cosmeticprocedures #ipllaser #fillersinjection #botox Penny Gsell, a 27-year-old from Philadelphia, spends around $600 a year on procedures. In her “What I’ve Had Done” video, she rated the treatments on a scale of 1 to 10. At 9/10, lip filler is “a must.” “They’ve completely changed my confidence,” she says in her clip. Septorhinoplasty to straighten her nose and improve nasal breathing got a mere 5/10. Gsell said her goal is to remind young girls that what they see on their Instagram feeds can be just as deceptive as what she’d see in Teen Vogue and Cosmo when she was growing up and impressionable: Size 1 or 2 models whose photos were edited to the nth degree, even though they didn’t need it. “When I grew up and learned about cosmetic procedures, I knew that if I was to ever get anything done that I would never want a little girl to look at me and think, ‘I’ll never look like her’ or compare herself to me without knowing that I’ve had work done,” she told HuffPost. “I always like to add the disclaimer that what I speak about only pertains to me and work I’ve had done. Everyone is beautiful, and no one needs to have work done.” Gsell also wants to dispel the idea that people who get work done are “fake” or insecure. “You live one life in one body,” she said. “I believe if you want to get something done to your one body to make yourself feel the best you can in your one life, then you should absolutely be able to do so without judgment.” We are all about transparency so let me know what questions you have! #cosmeticprocedures #honestreviews #greenscreen Briana Merriweather, a 30-year-old from Alabama, made a video on her procedures for the same reasons as Gsell. (She told HuffPost she spent about $8,000 on various procedures last year.) “I used to compare myself to women on Instagram and feel so inadequate,” she said. “I’m committed to making sure my presence doesn’t make others feel inferior.” Her hope is that her honesty will inspire more influencers to be candid about their own cosmetic procedures. “Even those who may not appear to have had any work done are likely utilizing treatments like Botox,” she said. #greenscreen #fyp #beauty #beautytok #2023 #beautyprocedures #cosmeticprocedure #cosmetic #aestheticprocedures #girls #filler #veeners #teethehitening #viral #beforeandafter #tiktokshop An argument could be made that these videos are largely positive, helping to reset people’s ideas of reality so they’re not fooled by every Instagram model they see: These influencers are naturally beautiful, yes, but thousands of dollars worth of treatment certainly helps, too. There’s a reason those collages featuring pics of celebrities before and after plastic surgery are so popular: “You’re not ugly, you’re just poor,” the caption dependably reads ― this generation’s “maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s Maybelline.” People want reassurance that the 10s they see online are genetically gifted, just not that genetically gifted. But a case could also be made that influencers are normalizing these kinds of intensive treatments, setting already sky-high beauty standards even higher with each new viral procedure: fox eye lifts, buccal fat removal, Barbie Botox, lip flips ― the list of Instagram Face micro-adjustments you can get, with a Groupon discount, no less, grows by the day. In light of the “growing social acceptance” of such noninvasive procedures, plastic surgeons say demand for such treatments are at an all-time high; there was an increase of 26.2 million nonsurgical procedures, like lip fillers and Botox, performed in the United States last year alone. “There are definitely two sides to this trend,” said Charlotte H. Markey, the director of the Health Sciences Center at Rutgers University, Camden, and the author of “The Body Image Book for Girls.” “On the one hand, it can be helpful for people to see that the beauty they see online is not natural, that it’s a result of procedures,” she told HuffPost. “On the other hand, it can easily lead people, especially vulnerable people, to feel like their bodies are projects and that there’s a never-ending list of things they need to ‘fix.’” Because these procedures are priced more reasonably than, say, breast enhancements or liposuction, the allure of getting one (or five) is even stronger. In some ways, it levels the playing field, said Jess Sprengle, a licensed professional therapist who specializes in treating eating disorders. The mysteries of poreless skin, perfect facial balance and perfect teeth aren’t such mysteries when one influencer has unpacked the procedures she’s had done to achieve the look: Fraxel laser treatment, rhinoplasty, dermal fillers, veneers and the rest of it. “You might see a perfect-looking photo of someone and think, ‘Oh, I remember that X said they get procedures done, and it seems like this is common. I’m not going to look that way because I’m not getting those procedures,’” Sprengle said. “Of course, in the photo, they could also be using a filter.” Still, Sprengle wishes that as a culture, we could explore our obsession with youth and aesthetic perfection rather than skipping ahead to normalizing these procedures, especially for young people. “It’s not so dissimilar to the recent discourse around Ozempic and other weight loss drugs,” she said. “We’re seeing people talk at length about the negative side effects of the meds, and there’s increased normalization of very adverse symptoms because, well, the person got to be thin at the end of it, so it must be worth it!” Transferred to this topic, Sprengle said, there’s a strong message that the influencer “looks like this now and they’re beautiful and thriving!” None of the negatives, such as body image issues or obsession with youth, seem to matter as much.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-drinks-for-sleep_l_65d6485be4b007e3eb73f7ca","Do You Have Issues Sleeping? These Foods And Drinks Could Be To Blame.","emily laurence","2024-03-01","If you’re one of the millions of Americans who struggle with sleep, you’ve likely tried all the most-talked-about remedies. Maybe there’s chamomile tea in your pantry and melatonin supplements in your bathroom cabinet. You already know it’s not a good idea to consume caffeine in the late afternoon and that even though that glass of wine may help you initially drift off to sleep, you’re going to wake up in the middle of the night regretting it. Still struggling? You could be unknowingly consuming something that’s to blame. According to sleep doctors, there are more foods and drinks that can mess with sleep than people realize. Rounded up here are seven foods and drinks that sleep doctors recommend steering clear of if you struggle with sleep. Plus, they offer guidance on which foods will work for you, not against you. Digging into some hot chicken wings or curry at dinner could cause sleep problems when you head to bed. Dr. Abhinav Singh, a board-certified sleep medicine and internal medicine doctor, is medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center and a medical reviewer for Sleep Foundation. He told HuffPost that eating food that’s spicer than you’re used to can increase acidity in the stomach, which can cause acid reflux that can make sleeping difficult. Singh explained that gastric acid is already naturally higher at night, and if it continues to rise, it can disrupt sleep. Dr. Ruchir P. Patel, a sleep medicine doctor and medical director of The Insomnia and Sleep Institute of Arizona, agreed. “Eating spicy food close to going to bed can cause acid reflux, which can trigger the brain to wake up excessively.” In addition to triggering acid reflux, Singh said, spicy food can make people feel hotter, which can also disrupt sleep. Patel said many people don’t realize that tomato sauce can be an acid reflux trigger, which can disrupt sleep similarly to the effect of spicy food. That means having pizza or spaghetti for dinner could keep you up. In general, Patel said, it’s best to avoid eating food that’s high in sodium and saturated fat (like pizza, especially if it has pepperoni) three hours before bed because it takes longer to digest, which can then cause sleep problems. Like greasy pizza, burgers are another food that takes the body longer to digest. For this reason, Singh said, eating a big, juicy burger too close to bedtime could keep you up, especially if it has ketchup on it, which, again, can trigger sleep-disrupting acid reflux. If you want a burger that will help with sleep rather than disrupt it, choose a plant-based burger made with lentils, which Singh said are easier to digest, or, if you are going to have beef, go for as lean a cut as possible. You might want to resist having a bowl of ice cream for dessert if you’re dealing with sleep issues. Dr. Raj Dasgupta, the chief medical adviser for Sleep Advisor, told HuffPost that foods high in sugar, such as ice cream, can keep you up. “The high sugar content can cause fluctuations in your blood sugar, cause stomach issues and keep you alert at bedtime, preventing you from relaxing and falling asleep,” he said. Singh also said that chocolate ice cream in particular can keep you up. “Many people don’t know that chocolate has caffeine,” Singh said, adding that dark chocolate has more caffeine than milk chocolate. Singh explained that the high fat, high sugar and high caffeine in chocolate ice cream is a triple whammy in terms of disrupting sleep. In movies, TV shows and children’s books, kids are often given a glass of milk before bedtime. But in real life, Patel said, this can make falling asleep harder. “Milk can trigger acid reflux,” he said, adding that this can happen to both children and adults. Patel explained that the lactose in milk can be problematic. If you are prone to acid reflux but want to have milk in the evening, his advice is to choose a plant-based milk, which is lactose-free and shouldn’t cause symptoms. Though most people know that caffeine can disrupt sleep, Patel revealed that not everyone realizes they’re consuming something with caffeine in it. “Some fancy water brands, like vitaminwater, can have up to 50 milligrams of caffeine,” he said. Singh added that some electrolyte drinks or powders can also contain caffeine. Sucking on a peppermint after dinner or sipping peppermint tea seems pretty innocuous. But Singh said that this can cause sleep problems for some people. Why? Like many other foods on this list, he said that peppermint can trigger acid reflux, a link most people aren’t aware of. Now that we know greasy foods, spicy foods and ice cream are off the menu, what can you eat that will work in your favor? All three sleep doctors recommend eating a dinner that includes complex carbs, fiber and lean protein. Examples of complex carbs high in fiber are most vegetables, brown rice, lentils, beans, whole wheat bread and quinoa. Examples of lean protein are poultry and fish.

Log in to hide these messages. Dasgupta explained that these types of food support healthy digestion, which in turn is good for sleep. Scientific research backs this up, showing that a diet high in fiber, complex carbs, protein and unsaturated fats is connected with good sleep. Singh says that meal timing matters, too. If you are going to eat close to bedtime or want a nighttime snack, he recommends keeping the portion small, under 300 calories. “A handful of nuts is a good nighttime snack because it has fiber and unsaturated fats,” he said. What we eat and drink has a powerful effect on the body, including how well (or not) we sleep. If you have trouble falling or staying asleep, avoid the seven foods and drinks on this list to see if it makes a difference. Soon you might not need that melatonin after all.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/food-cities-vacation-chefs_l_65c4f457e4b069b665de795a","Chefs Reveal The 9 Destinations You Need To Visit If You Love To Eat","jillian wilson","2024-03-01","For many people, bookmarking restaurants and bars is a beloved part of trip planning. And if you’re someone who considers dining and drinking an experience more than a necessity, then you may want to plan your entire vacation around destinations with unbelievable fare. But while viral TikTok videos and skewed restaurant reviews can sometimes lead you astray, there’s one group of people who certainly know where to go: chefs. These experts aren’t just pros at their craft, but they know their way around a menu, whether it’s a fine dining meal, huge food market or a street food cart. We asked chefs from across the country for their favorite places to travel to for good food (aside from the town where their restaurants are located) that they feel are attainable and affordable. Here’s what they said: Amanda Shulman, the chef and owner of Philadelphia’s Her Place Supper Club and co-owner of Philadelphia’s My Loup, recently returned from her honeymoon in Thailand where she said the food was incredible. She recommended “any single street food cart that serves plump Thai pork sausages stuffed with vermicelli noodles — a sour fermented pork sausage, grilled over charcoal until it is swollen and glistening, nearly popping out of its casing.” “Fatty and tangy and incredible, I grabbed them whenever I could,” Shulman said. “In Chiang Mai, there’s a roadside restaurant called Neng’s Earthen Jar Roast Pork filled with clay barrels rendering fat pork bellies until the skins are shatteringly crisp,” Shulman continued. In Northern Thailand, laarb, which is “finely minced pork dressed in fish sauce, chilis, herbs and rice powder,” and khao soi, a rich curry noodle soup, are mainstays on many menus. Shulman recommended Aroon Rai, a small restaurant in Chiang Mai for these items. In Bangkok, Shulman said “Sorn was one of the best fine dining experiences I’ve ever had. Every bite was unabashedly delicious, the technique was evident and tight, and I’ll be dreaming of swiping warm roti into beef curry maybe forever.” “The modern London dining scene is, I think, the most exciting dining scene anywhere in the world,” said Ed Szymanski, the chef and owner of Dame and Lord’s in New York City. London has restaurants that feature high-quality produce coming from France, Spain and Italy, as well as seafood from the northern parts of the U.K. “All of these things come together to create this very diverse dining scene,” Szymanski said. Many restaurants serve modern British cuisine, including Planque, St. JOHN and Noble Rot, but the city’s food options don’t stop at British food. You can find great Pakistani, Indian, Spanish, Italian food, and more. Or, for an all-in-one spot for local food and drinks, visit Borough Market where “you walk around and get some snacks, and you can have oysters shucked right in front of you, have a glass of champagne, and then go and have a sausage roll after that,” he said. An oft-overlooked cuisine is Guatemalan food, which is known for its stews, and all things corn and beans, like corn tortillas, tostadas, tamales, empanadas, and pupusas loaded with cheese and beans, said Sofia Deleon, the owner of El Merkury in Philadelphia and the Guatemalan rum brand Tenango Rum. She added that the cuisine naturally has lots of gluten-free and vegetarian options, too. “One of my favorite places to go when I visit is Mercado Central, the central market, because it’s a one-stop shop for everything [in Guatemala City],” Deleon said. Here you can find produce stands, meat purveyors and vendors selling handwoven items, in addition to food stands selling fresh tostadas loaded with avocado, parsley and cheese, and traditional Guatemalan desserts like a condensed milk treat known as canillita de leche. Ceviche used to be a popular food throughout Guatemala but has since decreased in popularity. In Antigua, though, (which is about 1.5 hours from Guatemala City), she recommends you order ceviche at Hugo’s Ceviches. The restaurant “has been around forever, and it’s the one place that still maintains their standard and is really good,” she noted, adding Hugo’s Ceviches is also known for their micheladas made with Gallo, Guatemala’s local beer, along with the regular fixings like chilis and Worcestershire sauce. Also in Antigua is La Cuevita de Los Urquizú, which comes highly recommended by Deleon as well. “What’s nice about this place is ... it’s almost like a buffet where you can buy things by the pound, and they have 50 to 75 varieties of very traditional foods that you would otherwise not get to try if you went anywhere else,” she said. For traditional sweets, visit Doña María Gordillo in Antigua, which has been around since the 1800s. “Originally, based on Spanish-style sweets, but then it was adapted to Guatemalan flavors, so they have everything from the tamarind balls to chilacayote en dulce, which is like a type of Guatemalan pumpkin” in addition to tasty egg tarts. New Orleans has some of “the most diverse and delicious food experiences — there’s not enough stomach space to devour all the good the city has to offer,” Shulman said. The city is beloved for its food culture, which comprises Southern, Creole, Cajun and French cooking — think jambalaya, gumbo, beignets, and more. One affordable item on menus across the city are po’boys, a sandwich that’s traditionally made with fried shrimp, roast beef or fried oysters, and served on crusty bread. For a good po’boy, followed by lemon Hubig’s Pies (a sweet New Orleans hand pie), Shulman recommends Frady’s One Stop. For the New Orleans’ classic muffuletta (an Italian sandwich made with an olive salad, cured meat, cheese on a round roll) visit Central Grocery, according to Shulman. Additionally, she suggests Cane & Table, a seasonally-focused restaurant that specializes in Caribbean and Cuban food, and Dakar, which serves Senegalese food. Or for something more special, try Mosquito Supper Club, which is Shulman’s “crush of a restaurant — sitting at the bar and eating pickled shrimp and other small bites was a magical experience.” Cape Town, South Africa, is a destination that’s full of complex local flavors along with fresh produce, and lots and lots of great wine, said Deleon. Plus, it’s relatively inexpensive and totally beautiful, she noted. Specifically, the region is known for its Chenin Blanc wines, a type of white wine that is light and crisp. One of Deleon’s favorite places to drink South African wine is Babylonstoren Wine Estate, a winery where everything is grown in-house, from the olives for the olive oil to the grapes for the wines. In addition to wine, Deleon said Cape Town is known for its Cape Malay food, “which is a mix of Malaysian and Indian and South African flavors.” You’ll find curry on many menus throughout the city, she said, and you’d be remiss not to try it. One spot for curry she recommends is Curry Club, where you can choose from a menu of chicken curries, lamb curries and veggie curries, ranging from mild to spicy. Mexico City is another great place to eat, according to Szymanski. “There’s an unending list of places to go in Mexico City.” “Mexico City is one of the largest and most eclectic cities in the world, and the rich tapestry of street vendors, markets, high-end restaurants and mezcal bars means there’s always a fun discovery around the corner,” said Szymanski. Mexico City is known for a range of food, including its fresh tacos, making taquerias a must, according to Szymanski. Among his taqueria recommendations is El Torito, where they serve two kinds: suadero (which is like a beef brisket) and tripa (tripe) or a mix of both. The area is also known for its barbacoa (slow-cooked lamb). And mezcal, a Mexican liquor made from agave, is worth being sought out, too. Additionally, you should just “follow your nose and eat the street tacos that look good, eat the quesadilla, go to a market in Mexico and eat the thing that looks good. You have to trust your instincts and wait in line if there is a line because there’s a good chance someone else knows something that you don’t.” “Mexican cuisine is such a huge part of American cuisine that I am always drawn to Mexico,” Gregory Gourdet, chef and founder of Kann and Sousòl in Portland, Oregon, told HuffPost via email. “I was blown away by my first trip to Oaxaca in 2021. The history and culture is so rich.” In Oaxaca, you’ll find foods such as moles, which is a traditional Mexican sauce, barbacoa, tlayudas (a traditional Oaxacan dish made of a crunchy tortilla topped with things like beans, meat, veggies and cheese), and tamales, in addition to the local fruits and vegetables that are grown there, said Gourdet. As far as where specifically to go in the city, Gourdet said, “Criollo and Alfonsina are both incredible restaurants.” You can also visit the Zapotec village of Teotitlan del Valle to take part in traditional cooking classes at El Sabor Zapoteco, he noted. Additionally, the city is home to sprawling food markets that are must-visits during any trip. And beyond this, it’s a good destination for those with certain allergies, too. “My dietary distinctions include being gluten and dairy-free, and corn-based Oaxacan cuisine is extremely accommodating. I was often told I was missing out by not indulging in the legendary local cheese, however,” Gourdet said. “I can almost guarantee you that nobody will have chosen the place that I was going to propose speaking about which is Corsica. Specifically, the northern half of Corsica, which is referred to as Haute Corse,” said Tyler Akin, the chef-partner of Le Cavalier in Wilmington, Delaware, and Bastia, a coming soon coastal Mediterranean restaurant in Philadelphia. Corsica is an island, so it’s natural to think that seafood is the focal point. And while you can find great options (Akin suggests stopping in the town of Centuri for spiny lobster and sea urchin), the food here centers on cooking traditions from the mountainous region. “Unlike Sardinia to the south, you see these alpine cheese traditions and more land-animal-driven cuisine than seafood-driven cuisine,” Akin said. This includes high-quality charcuterie products, chestnuts and mushrooms. Akin said it’s best to go to Corsica during the offseason. “It’s really cool to be one of very few people there anytime but [specifically] May through October because you have an opportunity to really connect with the people.” “One of the highlights there for me was the charcuterie that was produced,” said Akin, who added that a favorite producer of his was Les Delices de Castellu, which has “these incredibly natural products, wild boar salamis, and the signature sausage of Corsica which is figatellu.” Additionally, he said you should try migliacciu, which are pancakes stuffed with a ricotta-like cheese known as brocciu. Another must-visit? Patrimonio, which is Corsica’s wine region where natural, organic wines are the focal point. In the university town of Corte, seek out baked goods from Casanova Patisserie, which makes a little cheesecake called falculelle and fresh fruit ice cream, and Fritelle Curtinese for the best beignets on the island and a herb pie made with lard, maquis herbs and maquis herbs. When you think of Austin, you likely think of tacos and barbecue — and that’s for good reason. These foods are woven into the history of the area and can be found all throughout the neighborhoods of the city. Andrew Taylor, the chef/owner of Big Tree Hospitality in Portland, Maine, which operates Eventide Oyster Co., the Honey Paw and Hugo’s, along with some artisan food markets, said Austin is the place that’s stood out to him most when it comes to food destinations. ”[I’m] just really impressed with the food ... it actually reminded me a little bit of Portland in that it’s not a huge town but it felt like the quality of restaurants, the breadth of the restaurant scene was exceptional and punched way above its weight,” Taylor stated. There are barbecue institutions like Franklin Barbecue and la Barbecue in Austin itself, in addition to options outside of town, too. He added that it’s hard to find a bad meal in Austin, but if you are looking for places to dine, he has a few tips. “We took a little trip out like 45 minutes from Austin [to] Lockhart, Texas ... and the barbecue there was just the best I’ve ever had in my life. We went to Kreuz Market, which was just outrageous, Smitty’s and Terry Blacks, were just all incredible,” he said. For tacos, he recommends Nixta where everything, from the tortillas to the braises, are handmade, and Veracruz, which is a food truck vibe. And there is much more than tacos and barbecue in Austin. Taylor noted that he tried great Japanese food, Mexican food, Caribbean fare, and more.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-diplomat-spying-cuba_n_65e1ae38e4b005b85833f304","Career U.S. Diplomat Abruptly Admits To Spying For Communist Cuba For Decades","joshua goodman , jim mustian","2024-03-01","MIAMI (AP) — A former career U.S. diplomat told a federal judge Thursday he will plead guilty to charges of working for decades as a secret agent for communist Cuba, an unexpectedly swift resolution to a case prosecutors called one of the most brazen betrayals in the history of the U.S. foreign service. Manuel Rocha’s stunning fall from grace could culminate in a lengthy prison term after the 73-year-old said he would admit to federal counts of conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government. Prosecutors and Rocha’s attorney indicated the plea deal includes an agreed-upon sentence but they did not disclose details at a hearing Thursday. He is due back in court April 12, when he is scheduled to formalize his guilty plea and be sentenced. “I am in agreement,” said Rocha, shackled at the hands and ankles, when asked by U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom if he wished to change his plea to guilty. Prosecutors, in exchange, agreed to drop 13 counts including wire fraud and making false statements. The brief hearing shed no new light on the question that has proved elusive since Rocha’s arrest in December: What exactly did he do to help Cuba while working at the State Department for two decades? That included stints as ambassador to Bolivia and top posts in Argentina, Mexico, the White House and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. “Ambassador Rocha,” as he preferred to be called, was well known among Miami’s elite for his aristocratic, almost regal, bearing befitting his Ivy League background. His post-government career included time as a special adviser to the commander of the U.S. Southern Command and more recently as a tough-talking Donald Trump supporter and Cuba hardliner, a persona friends and prosecutors say Rocha adopted to hide his true allegiances. Peter Lapp, who oversaw FBI counterintelligence against Cuba between 1998 and 2005, said the fast resolution of the case benefits not only the elderly Rocha but also the government, which stands to learn a lot about Cuba’s penetration of U.S. foreign policy circles. Typically in counterintelligence cases, the defendant is charged with espionage. But Rocha was accused of the lesser crimes of acting as a foreign agent, which carry maximum terms of between five and 10 years in prison, making it easier for prosecutors and Rocha to reach an agreement. “It’s a win-win for both sides,” said Lapp, who led the investigation into Ana Montes, the highest-level U.S. official ever convicted of spying for Cuba. “He gets a significant payoff and the chance to see his family again, and the U.S. will be able to conduct a full damage assessment that it wouldn’t be able to do without his cooperation.” “There are details that can really only come from the defendant,” he added. But the abrupt deal drew criticism in the Cuban exile community, with some legal observers worrying it amounted to a slap on the wrist. “Any sentence that allows him to see the light of day again would not be justice,” said Carlos Trujillo, a Miami attorney who served as U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States during the Trump administration. “He’s a spy for a foreign adversary who put American lives at risk.” A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Rocha was arrested by the FBI at his Miami home on allegations he had engaged in “clandestine activity” on Cuba’s behalf since at least 1981 — the year he joined the U.S. foreign service — including by meeting with Cuban intelligence operatives and providing false information to U.S. government officials about his contacts. Rocha made a series of recorded admissions to an undercover FBI agent who posed as a Cuban intelligence operative who reached out to Rocha on WhatsApp, calling himself “Miguel” and saying he had a message “from your friends in Havana.” Rocha praised the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro as “Comandante,” branded the U.S. the “enemy” and bragged about his service for more than 40 years as a Cuban mole in the heart of U.S. foreign policy circles, prosecutors said in court records. “What we have done … it’s enormous … more than a Grand Slam,” he was quoted as saying. Federal authorities have said little about what Rocha actually did to aid Cuba, and FBI and State Department investigators have been conducting a confidential intelligence damage assessment that could take years. But a recent Associated Press investigation found there were plenty of missed red flags over the years. Those included a tip that a longtime CIA operative received warning in 2006 that Rocha was working as a double agent. It was never pursued. And separate intelligence revealed that the CIA had been aware as early as 1987 that Castro had a “super mole” burrowed deep inside the U.S. government, and some officials suspected it could have been Rocha. Lawrence Gumbiner, a retired career diplomat, said the fact that Rocha went undetected for so many years underscores the sophistication of Cuba’s intelligence services. “It’s a day for reflection for all of us who knew and worked with him,” said Gumbiner, who served as acting U.S. ambassador to Cuba in 2017 and 2018. “Although the full extent of the damage he caused isn’t yet revealed, it’s hard to believe he didn’t pass along some very serious information that compromised our intelligence services and our own efforts against the Castro regime.” ___ Mustian reported from New York. ___ Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/ By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Trump is accused of illegally retaining classified documents after leaving the White House. He denies the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. Trump’s attorneys noted in a filing that the trial would be taking place during the RNC, which is being held July 15-18 in Milwaukee. Despite his legal woes, Trump remains the clear favorite to win the GOP nomination and take on President Joe Biden in November. The next four years will change America forever.

U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon is due to hold a hearing on the trial’s possible start date on Friday. Collins asked Yoshino if Cannon should consider Trump’s campaigning when making a decision. “I think in an ideal world, she should not,” Yoshino replied. “I mean, no one is above the law. This is a criminal proceeding. She should just set the dates as it were.

The late-night host noted how Republican 2024 front-runner Trump needs to “come up with the full $454 million penalty or a bond to cover it” if he wants to appeal his civil fraud ruling in New York. “In other words, a man who became famous for never paying anyone back has to convince a bonding company he will definitely pay them back, and it’s not happening,” said Kimmel. “He owes like a whole Powerball Lottery jackpot,” he continued. “He may very well have to sell off his properties to cover it. But that’s a worst-case scenario.” So, Trump’s “first move is to see how much he can get for Eric on Craigslist,” joked Kimmel. “He has him listed in the ‘Tools’ section.” Kimmel later proposed another way forward for the four-times-indicted Trump. “Wouldn’t it be great if Trump has to sell Mar-a-Lago to some billionaire liberal?” he asked. “Maybe Oprah-Lago would be a solution?” Watch the video here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Republican 2024 front-runner repeated his usual fear-mongering rhetoric when he claimed, without offering any evidence to back up his assertion, “They’re coming from jails, and they’re coming from prisons, and they’re coming from mental institutions, and they’re coming from insane asylums, and they’re terrorists. They’re being let into our country, and it’s horrible.” Trump then focused on what he considered a highly important issue: The languages talked by those who go to the U.S. Trump, confused: We have people who don’t speak languages. We have nobody that even speaks those languages. Nobody speaks them pic.twitter.com/5OfQU9xIAb “Nobody can explain to me how allowing millions of people from places unknown, from countries unknown, who don’t speak languages,” he confusingly railed. “We have languages coming into our country. We have nobody that even speaks those languages. They’re truly foreign languages. Nobody speaks them, and they’re pouring into our country, and they’re bringing with them tremendous problems, including medical problems, as you know.” CNN’s fact-checking reporter Daniel Dale told anchor Kaitlan Collins that Trump has made a similar claim “about people arriving speaking languages that no one‘s ever heard.” Dale recalled, “He said in a previous, recent speech, ‘We didn‘t even have one translator who could understand this language. I‘ve looked into this, seems to be just conjured out of thin air. It‘s nonsense.” “Conjured out of thin air.” CNN cuts out of Trump’s speech after he tells “several lies”. They have their fact-checker, Daniel Dale, standing by, who immediately goes to work. CNN has finally wised up. Every single network must do this when Trump is speaking. (Video: CNN) pic.twitter.com/9GAOnygmMe Critics on X (formerly Twitter) scratched their heads over Trump’s “don’t speak languages” logic. If no one speaks these languages, how does he know about them? Wait what? Languages that no one speaks? Are they speaking in tongues? Maybe he got confused between the border and his meeting with the Christian Nationalists right beforehand.That must be it! The next four years will change America forever.

The “Late Show” host noted that special counsel Jack Smith “begged” the Supreme Court to rule on the issue “in a timely manner” back in December. He added that SCOTUS “didn’t say jack” for over two weeks, as well, after a federal appeals court rejected Trump’s claim that he’s immune from prosecution for alleged criminal acts he committed while in office. “That makes it a total of 19 weeks of delays,” Colbert said of the trial. “These proceedings have been frozen for so long, they legally count as children in Alabama.” He later questioned if justices realize “just how damaging” they are to the court’s legacy for stalling “over this urgent threat to our democracy.” Colbert pointed to a 2022 survey that found “just 18%” of Americans who said they “have a great deal of confidence in the court,” The Associated Press reported. He mentioned that the Supreme Court gains its legitimacy and power from public approval before issuing his announcement. “They don’t have an army or a police force or apparently an HR department, they have to rely on moral authority, but they have abdicated that moral authority, which is why, tonight, using the power vested in me as a late night host, I am hereby declaring the Supreme Court unconstitutional,” he said.

We did much better in 2020 than we ever even thought about doing in 2016,” Trump said during an address on immigration from Eagle Pass, Texas. “And very bad things happened and from that moment, it was a whole different ballgame in Texas and all over,” he added, appearing to nod to his baseless stolen election claims. Cavuto interrupted the feed. “We’re continuing to monitor this,” said Cavuto, who in the past has not shied away from criticizing Trump or Republicans, unlike other personalities on the conservative network.

The actor, who made his return to the World Wrestling Entertainment ring last month, shared a touching tribute to his father on Instagram on Friday, writing that he was “delivering flowers to heaven to my old man.” “My regret in this life is that I never had a chance to say goodbye to him, because he died suddenly,” he wrote in the caption of the post. “I regret not reconciling our complicated father/son s**t before I lost him. Raised me with tough fatherly love and an even tougher hand. The more I live life, the more grateful I am for it.” Johnson’s post featured an old video clip of his father in the wrestling ring, with a little Rock seated in the audience, watching. Rocky “Soul Man” Johnson and fellow wrestler Tony Atlas became the first Black World Tag Team champions in 1983, back when the WWE was called the World Wrestling Federation. In his tribute on Instagram, Dwayne Johnson, who made his own debut in the wrestling ring in the 1990s, celebrated his dad as a trailblazer. “He came up the hard way, and trail-blazed for all of us men of color — in any sport & level of entertainment,” he wrote. “But it was also very important to him to pave the way for all men, any color - it didn’t matter.” In 2020, the “Jumanji” actor shared a video on Instagram of the eulogy he delivered at his father’s funeral. He said his father broke into pro-wrestling in the mid-1960s and into the ’70s, when the country’s “racial tension and divide was very strong.” The Instagram post also featured a letter he dedicated to his father, in which he wrote that the late wrestling Hall of Famer was “taken too fast.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

(AP) — Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Friday shortened the prison sentence of former Kansas City Chiefs assistant coach Britt Reid for a drunken driving crash that seriously injured a 5-year-old girl. Parson’s commutation converted the remainder of Reid’s three-year prison sentence to house arrest, subject to several conditions. Reid had been sentenced in November 2022 after pleading guilty to driving while intoxicated causing serious bodily injury. He is the son of Chiefs coach Andy Reid. Parson is a longtime Chiefs season ticket-holder holder who celebrated with the team at its recent Super Bowl victory parade in Kansas City. A Parson spokesman said the governor considered several factors when making his commutation decision. “Reid had completed his alcohol abuse treatment program and has served more prison time than most individuals convicted of similar offenses,” Parson spokesman Johnathan Shiflett said. Reid’s house arrest will continue until Oct. 31, 2025, with requirements for weekly meetings with a parole officer and peer support sponsor and attendance at behavioral counseling. He also will be required to work at least 30 hours a week and complete 10 hours a month of community service, among other things. The Chiefs declined to comment about Parson’s commutation of Reid. Prosecutors said Reid was intoxicated and driving about 84 mph (135 kph) in a 65 mph zone when his Dodge truck hit the cars on an entrance ramp to Interstate 435 near Arrowhead Stadium on Feb. 4, 2021. A girl inside one of the cars, Ariel Young, suffered a traumatic brain injury. A total of six people, including Reid, were injured. One of the vehicles he hit had stalled because of a dead battery, and the second was owned by Ariel’s mother, who had arrived to help. Reid had a blood-alcohol level of 0.113% two hours after the crash, police said. The legal limit is 0.08%. The Chiefs reached a confidential agreement with Ariel’s family to pay for her ongoing medical treatment and other expenses. An attorney who represented Ariel’s family did not immediately respond to messages Friday. Reid’s sentencing reprieve was one of three commutations and 36 pardons announced Friday by Parson, who also denied 63 clemency requests. Parson, a former sheriff, has now granted clemency to more than 760 people since 2020 — more than any Missouri governor since the 1940s. Parson has been been working to clear a backlog of nearly 3,700 clemency applications he inherited when taking over as governor in 2018, but he also has considered some new requests. Many of those granted clemency by Parson were convicted decades ago of drug crimes, theft or burglary and had completed their prison sentences long ago. But two notable exceptions were Mark and Patricia McCloskey. The St. Louis couple who gained national attention for waving guns at racial injustice protesters were pardoned by Parson on July 30, 2021, just six weeks after Mark McCloskey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and Patricia McCloskey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment.

The Feb. 22 judgment came after the Justice Department reportedly sued the “Empire” star in 2022 for failing to pay $578,000 in income taxes between 2010 and 2019. According to court documents cited by multiple news outlets, Howard told a Justice Department attorney that it’s “immoral for the United States government to charge taxes to the descendants of slaves.” “Four hundred years of forced labor and never receiving any compensation for it,” Howard was quoted as saying in a November voicemail. “Now you have the gall to try and prosecute and charge taxes to the descendants of a broken people that you are responsible for causing the breakage.” The recording cut off at this point, but Howard called back to continue his message. “In truth, the entire United States should, by default, become the property of the descendants of slaves,” he reportedly said. “But since you do not have the ability [or] the courage to do it, let’s try this in court. … We’re gonna bring you down.” Representatives for Howard did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Howard had allegedly attempted to avoid being served with the Justice Department lawsuit. Prosecutors said that the government first tried to find him at a motel in Jackson, Mississippi, before further attempts were made at properties in Philadelphia, Chicago and La Habra, California.

But the actor allegedly failed to cooperate with the Justice Department or appear at hearings, resulting in last week’s default judgment against him. Howard has been in legal trouble before. In 2015, he acknowledged in a Rolling Stone interview that he had “slapped” his wife in 2001, an incident that led to a guilty plea for disorderly conduct. Howard was also once accused of assaulting a flight attendant, though the charge against him was later dropped. The Oscar-nominated actor notably appeared in the 2008 film “Iron Man” but was replaced for “Iron Man 2,” with Howard suggesting that salary issues were to blame.

Lauren Boebert, whose three-year tenure representing Coloradans has been marred by allegations of hypocrisy. Writing on his website Truth Social, the former president called Boebert “a Proven Conservative and Effective Leader” and a “trusted America First Fighter” who has his “Complete and Total Endorsement.” Boebert was first elected in 2020 to represent Colorado’s 3rd congressional district, encompassing the western half of the state. She rose to right-wing fame by touting her love for guns and Trump’s MAGA movement while capitalizing on conservative anger over COVID-19 health restrictions as the owner of a restaurant that has since shuttered. After a narrow re-election win in 2022, Boebert decided to run to represent the state’s 4th congressional district in 2024 instead — a large swath of eastern Colorado that draws more consistently Republican votes. She also has sought to position herself in a softer light in recent months. Last summer, set on her mission to impeach President Joe Biden, Boebert’s tense relationship with fellow Trump Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) sparked an ugly scene on the House floor in which Greene called Boebert a “little bitch.” Then in September, Boebert suffered a spectacular fall from grace when she was forcibly removed from a stage production of “Beetlejuice” at a Denver performing arts theater. The congresswoman and her date were caught on video kissing, groping and vaping during what was billed as a family-friendly show. The next four years will change America forever.

For an elected official who has championed “family values” and baselessly accused members of the LGBTQ+ community of sexually inappropriate behavior around children, the incident was embarrassing, and Boebert later apologized.

Earlier this week, her eldest son, 18-year-old Tyler Boebert, was arrested on felony charges; he allegedly robbed a woman with a brain tumor of her last $75, police said.

International mediators have been working for weeks to broker a deal to pause the fighting before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins around March 10. A deal likely would allow aid to reach hundreds of thousands of desperate Palestinians in northern Gaza who aid officials worry are under threat of famine. The Israelis “have more or less accepted” the proposal, which includes the six-week cease-fire as well as the release by Hamas of hostages considered vulnerable, which includes the sick, the wounded, the elderly and women, said the official. “Right now, the ball is in the court of Hamas and we are continuing to push this as hard as we possibly can,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House to brief reporters. Officials from Israel and from Hamas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A senior Egyptian official said mediators Egypt and Qatar are expected to receive a response from Hamas during the Cairo talks scheduled to start Sunday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not publicly authorized to discuss the talks. There is increasing criticism over the hundreds of thousands struggling to survive in northern Gaza, which has borne the brunt of the conflict that began when the Hamas militant group attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seizing around 250 hostages. U.S. military planes began the first airdrops of thousands of meals into Gaza, and the militaries of Jordan and Egypt said they also conducted airdrops. The European Union’s diplomatic service said many of the dozens of Palestinians killed or wounded in the chaos surrounding an aid convoy on Thursday were hit by Israeli army fire and urged an international investigation. It said responsibility for the crisis lay with “restrictions imposed by the Israeli army and obstructions by violent extremist(s) to the supply of humanitarian aid.” Israel’s chief military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Israel organized Thursday’s humanitarian convoy, “and claims that we attacked the convoy intentionally and that we harmed people intentionally are baseless.” Residents in northern Gaza say they are searching rubble and garbage for anything to feed their children, who barely eat one meal a day. Many families have begun mixing animal and bird food with grain to bake bread. International aid officials say they have encountered catastrophic hunger. “We’re dying from starvation,” said Soad Abu Hussein, a widow and mother of five who shelters in a school in the Jabaliya refugee camp. At least 10 children have starved to death, according to hospital records in Gaza, the World Health Organization said. Gaza’s Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll from the war has climbed to 30,320. The ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures, but says women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed. In Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah, where more than half of the territory’s people now seek refuge, an Israeli airstrike on Saturday struck tents outside the Emirati hospital, killing 11 people and wounding about 50, including health workers, the Health Ministry said. Israel’s air, sea and ground offensive has reduced much of densely populated northern Gaza to rubble. The military told Palestinians to move south, but as many as 300,000 people are believed to have remained. Roughly one in six children under 2 in the north suffer from acute malnutrition and wasting, “the worst level of child malnutrition anywhere in the world,” Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the World Food Program, said this week. “If nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza.” People have overwhelmed trucks delivering food aid and grabbed what they can, Skau said, forcing the WFP to suspend deliveries to the north. In the violence Thursday, hundreds of people rushed about 30 trucks bringing a predawn delivery to the north. Palestinians said nearby Israeli troops shot into the crowds. Israel said they fired warning shots toward the crowd and insisted many of the dead were trampled. Doctors at hospitals in Gaza and a U.N. team that visited a hospital said large numbers of the wounded had been shot. The Health Ministry said two more bodies were recovered Saturday from the scene, raising the death toll to 118. It said the wounded remained at 760. Ahmed Abdel Karim, being treated for gunshot wounds in his feet, said he had spent two days waiting for aid trucks to arrive. “Everyone attacked and advanced on these trucks. Because of the large number, I could not get flour,” he said. He was shot by Israeli troops, he said. Radwan Abdel-Hai, a father of four young children, heard a rumor late Wednesday that an aid convoy was on its way. He and five others took a donkey cart and found a “sea of people” waiting. “Tanks started firing at us,” he said. “As I ran back, I heard tank shells and gunfire. I heard people screaming. I saw people falling to the ground, some motionless.” Abdel-Hai took shelter in a nearby building. When the shooting stopped, many dead were on the ground, he said. “Many were shot in their back,” he said. Abu Hussein, the widow, said more than 5,000 people — mostly women and children — living with her in the Jabaliya school have not received aid for more than four weeks. A group of people went to the shore to try to fish, but three were killed and two were wounded by gunfire from Israeli ships, she said. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mansour Hamed, a 32-year-old former aid worker living with more than 50 relatives in a Gaza City house, said some are eating tree leaves and animal food. It has become normal to find a child emerging from the rubble with a rotten piece of bread, he said. Acknowledging the extreme need for food, U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. would look for other ways of delivery “including possibly a marine corridor.” Also Saturday, Israel said three soldiers were killed and 14 injured Friday when they inadvertently triggered explosives in a booby-trapped building outside Khan Younis in southern Gaza. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-wins-missouri-caucuses_n_65e37073e4b013678e156f2d","Trump Wins Caucuses In Missouri And Idaho, Sweeps Michigan GOP Convention","jonathan j. cooper","2024-03-02","COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — Former President Donald Trump continued his march toward the GOP nomination on Saturday, winning caucuses in Idaho and Missouri and sweeping the delegate haul at a party convention in Michigan. Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador who is his last major rival, was still searching for her first election-year win. The next event on the Republican calendar is Sunday in the District of Columbia. Two days later is Super Tuesday, when 16 states will hold primaries on what will be the largest day of voting of the year outside of the November election. Trump is on track to lock up the nomination days later. The steep odds facing Haley were on display in Columbia, Missouri, where Republicans gathered at a church to caucus. Seth Christensen stood on stage and called on them to vote for Haley. He wasn’t well received. Another caucusgoer shouted out from the audience: “Are you a Republican?” An organizer quieted the crowd and Christensen finished his speech. Haley went on to win just 37 of the 263 Republicans in attendance in Boone County. Michigan Republicans at their convention in Grand Rapids began allocating 39 of the state’s 55 GOP presidential delegates. Trump won all 39 delegates allocated. But a significant portion of the party’s grassroots force was skipping the gathering because of the lingering effects of a monthslong dispute over the party’s leadership. Trump handily won Michigan’s primary this past Tuesday with 68% of the vote compared with Haley’s 27%. Michigan Republicans were forced to split their delegate allocation into two parts after Democrats, who control the state government, moved Michigan into the early primary states, violating the national Republican Party’s rules. Voters lined up outside a church in Columbia, home to the University of Missouri, before the doors opened for the caucuses. Once they got inside, they heard appeals from supporters of the candidates. “Every 100 days, we’re spending $1 trillion, with money going all over the world. Illegals are running across the border,” Tom Mendenall, an elector for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said to the crowd. He later added: “You know where Donald Trump stands on a lot of these issues.” Christensen, a 31-year-old from Columbia who came to the caucus with his wife and three children age 7, 5, and 2, then urged Republicans to go in a new direction. “I don’t need to hear about Mr. Trump’s dalliances with people of unsavory character, nor do my children,” Christensen said to the room. “And if we put that man in the office, that’s what we’re going to hear about all the time. And I’m through with it.” Supporters quickly moved to one side of the room or the other, depending on whether they favored Trump or Haley. There was little discussion between caucusgoers after they chose a side. This year was the first test of the new system, which is almost entirely run by volunteers on the Republican side. The caucuses were organized after GOP Gov. Mike Parson signed a 2022 law that, among other things, canceled the planned March 12 presidential primary. Lawmakers failed to reinstate the primary despite calls to do so by both state Republican and Democratic party leaders. Democrats will hold a party-run primary on March 23. Trump prevailed twice under Missouri’s old presidential primary system. Last year, Idaho lawmakers passed cost-cutting legislation that was intended to move all the state’s primaries to the same date in May. But the bill inadvertently eliminated the presidential primaries entirely. The Republican-led Legislature considered holding a special session to reinstate the presidential primaries but failed to agree on a proposal in time, leaving both parties with presidential caucuses as the only option. “I think there’s been a lot of confusion because most people don’t realize that our Legislature actually voted in a flawed bill,” said Jessie Bryant, who volunteered at a caucus site near downtown Boise. “So the caucus is really just the best-case scenario to actually get an opportunity to vote for a presidential candidate and nominate them for the GOP.” One of those voters was John Graves, a fire protection engineer from Boise. He said the caucus was fast and easy, not much different from Idaho’s usual Republican primary. He anticipated the win would go to Trump. “It’s a very conservative state, so I would think that Trump will probably carry it quite easily,” Graves said. “And I like that.” The Democratic caucuses aren’t until May 23. The last GOP caucuses in Idaho were in 2012, when about 40,000 of the state’s nearly 200,000 registered Republican voters showed up to select their preferred candidate. ___ Cooper reported from Phoenix.

Jackie, a female, and Shadow, a male, are bald eagle mates who share a nest in Southern California’s San Bernardino Mountains. The nest is about 145 feet up in a pine tree with a view of Big Bear Lake. Since 2015, the nonprofit Friends of Big Bear Valley has had a webcam providing a livestream of the goings-on inside the nest ― and lately, things have gotten especially interesting. Jackie laid three eggs in January, and The Associated Press reported Thursday that the chicks could hatch soon. On early Saturday afternoon, nearly 20,000 viewers were tuned in to a YouTube livestream, participating in what multiple news outlets are calling “hatch watch.” The Saturday stream showed one of the eagles dutifully incubating the eggs as rain and wind buffeted the nest, but the parents-to-be are no strangers to inclement weather. Last month, the two were seen protecting the eggs in shifts amid a fierce snowstorm. At one point, Jackie stayed atop the eggs without a break for just under 62 hours.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) isn’t biting his tongue concerning U.S. policy toward Israel. The progressive senator has continued to support President Joe Biden on his campaign for re-election, but made an impassioned appearance Friday on “Alex Wagner Tonight” — and slammed the “absurd” policy of funding what Sanders called “an unprecedented disaster.” The ongoing conflict erupted when Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and abducted around 200 others on Oct. 7. Conditions in Gaza have worsened into a humanitarian catastrophe since: Gaza’s health ministry says over 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children. Sanders said Friday that the hunger and death in the region “makes my stomach turn.” “We are talking about hundreds of thousands of children facing starvation,” he told Wagner. “We’re talking about Israeli bombs making it impossible for humanitarian aid to get to places that it is needed, that the borders are being blockaded and aid is unable to get through.” Biden approved airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza Friday, after more than 100 Palestinians were killed and 750 others were injured when Israeli troops fired at civilians scrambling for goods from an aid convoy. The first 38,000 airdropped meals arrived Saturday. “So I think what the president is doing is an important step forward, but we need to do more,” Sanders told Wagner of the aid. “We need to tell Netanyahu and his right-wing government that they’re gonna have to open those borders.” Israel has barred the entry of food, water and medicine into Gaza since the latest hostilities began, save for scarce aid pallets entering from Egypt at the Rafah crossing in the south. The United Nations says a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are now facing starvation. The next four years will change America forever.

In survey results released Saturday by The New York Times and Siena College, 47% of 980 registered voters said that they “strongly disapprove” of Biden’s handling of his job, the highest figure for this rate in any Times/Siena poll during his presidency. The national poll, conducted in February, also shows Biden’s 43% of support trailing behind Trump’s 48%, a potential warning sign for the Democratic president. At 81, Biden has faced criticism for being the oldest sitting president in U.S. history. He has also received pushback for his handling of the current conflict in Gaza, where health officials say that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s assault since October. Meanwhile, 77-year-old Trump has more successfully unified support within his party as he seeks to retake the White House, despite his recent legal losses and upcoming trials.

The ruling came just one day after PFLAG National went to court to try to stop Paxton’s office from getting the information. Travis County District Court Judge Maria Cantú Hexsel said in an order that providing the information would harm PFLAG and its members in several ways, including violating their rights of free speech, association and protection from unreasonable searches. Additionally, the judge said, it would be a “gross invasion” of privacy. A hearing was scheduled for March 25 to give the attorney general’s office a chance to make the case for why Friday’s order shouldn’t continue. This round of litigation stems from a request Paxton’s office made in February for “documents and communications” about PFLAG CEO Brian Bond’s statement to court last year that members were setting up contingency plans after the state imposed a sweeping ban on gender-affirming care for minors. In a statement Thursday, Paxton’s office said the information is highly relevant to investigations into whether medical providers are committing insurance fraud to circumvent the ban. The ACLU, which is representing FPLAG in court, said it will seek a permanent block on Paxton’s demand “so that PFLAG can continue supporting its Texas members with transgender youth in doing what all loving parents do: supporting and caring for their children.” The next four years will change America forever.

Michael Sparks, 46, of Kentucky, jumped through a shattered window moments after another rioter smashed it with a stolen riot shield. Sparks then joined other rioters in chasing a police officer up flights of stairs, one of the most harrowing images from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. A federal jury in Washington, D.C., convicted Sparks of all six charges that he faced, including two felonies. Sparks didn’t testify at his weeklong trial. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly is scheduled to sentence him on July 9. Sparks was the “tip of the spear” and breached the Capitol building less than a minute before senators recessed to evacuate the chamber and escape from the mob, Justice Department prosecutor Emily Allen said during the trial’s closing arguments. “The defendant was ready for a civil war. Not just ready for a civil war. He wanted it,” Allen told jurors. Defense attorney Scott Wendelsdorf conceded that Sparks is guilty of the four misdemeanor counts, including trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. But he urged the jury to acquit him of the felony charges — civil disorder and obstruction of an official proceeding. Wendelsdorf accused prosecutors of trying to unfairly blame Sparks for the violence and destruction perpetrated by other rioters around him. The lawyer said Sparks immediately left the Capitol when he realized that Vice President Mike Pence wouldn’t succumb to pressure from then-President Donald Trump to overturn Biden’s victory. “Michael Sparks may have started the game, according to the government, but he was out of the game on the sidelines before the first quarter was over,” the defense attorney told jurors. Sparks traveled to Washington with a group of co-workers from an electronics and components plant in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. They attended Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House on Jan. 6. After the rally, Sparks and a co-worker, Joseph Howe, joined a crowd in marching to the Capitol. A cameraman’s video captured Howe saying, “We’re getting in that building,” before Sparks added that if Pence “does his job today, he does the right thing by the Constitution, Trump’s our president four more years.” Sparks and Howe, both wearing tactical vests, made their way to the front of the mob as outnumbered police officers retreated. “Michael Sparks was more prepared for battle than some of the police officers he encountered that day,” Allen said. Sparks was the first rioter to enter the building after Dominic Pezzola, a member of the Proud Boys extremist group, used a police shield to break the window next to the Senate Wing Door. Other rioters yelled at Sparks not to enter the building. “He jumped in anyway,” Allen said. A police officer pepper sprayed Sparks in the face as he leaped through the broken window. Undeterred, Sparks joined other rioters in chasing Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman as he retreated up the stairs and found backup from other officers near the Senate chamber. Sparks ignored commands to leave and yelled, “This is our America! This is our America!” Sparks believed that he was defending the Constitution on Trump’s behalf and that Pence had a duty to invalidate the election results, according to his attorney. “His belief was wrong, but it was sincere,” Wendelsdorf said. Allen said Sparks knew that he broke the law but wasn’t remorseful. “I’ll go again given the opportunity,” Sparks texted his mother a day after the riot. Sparks and his co-workers returned to Kentucky on Jan. 7, 2021. By then, images of him storming the Capitol had spread online. On his way home, Sparks called the Metropolitan Police Department and offered to turn himself in, according to prosecutors. He was arrested a few days later. Sparks and Howe were charged together in a November 2022 indictment. Howe pleaded guilty to assault and obstruction charges and was sentenced in October to four years and two months in prison.

Kanchha Sherpa, 91, was among the 35 members in the team that put New Zealander Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay atop the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) peak on May 29, 1953. “It would be better for the mountain to reduce the number of climbers,” Kanchha said in an interview in Kathmandu on Saturday, “Right now there is always a big crowd of people at the summit.” Since the first conquest, the peak has been climbed thousands of times, and it gets more crowded every year. During the spring climbing season in 2023, 667 climbers scaled the peak, but that brought in thousands of support staff to the base camp between the months of March and May. There have been concerns about the number of people living on the mountain for months on end, generating trash and waste, but authorities have no plans to cut down on the number of permits they issue to climbers. There are rules that require climbers to bring down their own trash, equipment and everything they carry to the mountain or risk losing their deposit, but monitoring has not been very effective. “It is very dirty now. People throw tins and wrappings after eating food. Who is going to pick them up now?” Kanchha said. “Some climbers just dump their trash in the crevasse, which would be hidden at that time but eventually it will flow down to base camp as the snow melts and carries them downward.” For the Sherpas, Everest is Qomolangma or goddess mother of the world, and is revered by their community. They generally perform religious rituals before climbing the peak. “They should not be dirtying the mountain. It is our biggest god and they should not be dirtying the gods,” he said “Qomolangma is the biggest god for the Sherpas but people smoke and eat meat and throw them on the mountain.” Kanchha was just a young man when he joined the Hillary-Tenzing expedition. He was among the three Sherpas to go to the last camp on Everest along with Hillary and Tenzing. They could not go any further because they did not have a permit. They first heard of the successful ascent on the radio, and then were reunited with the summit duo at Camp 2. The next four years will change America forever.

Only the section from the base camp to Camp 1 over the unstable Khumbu Icefall changes every year. Kanchha has four children, eight grandchildren and a 20-month-old great-granddaughter. He lives with family in Namche village in the foothills of Mount Everest, where the family runs a small hotel catering to trekkers and climbers.

(AP) — A powerful blizzard raged overnight into Saturday in the Sierra Nevada as the biggest storm of the season shut down a long stretch of Interstate-80 in California and gusty winds and heavy rain hit lower elevations, leaving tens of thousands of customers without power. Up to 10 feet (3 meters) of snow is expected in some areas. The National Weather Service said early Saturday that widespread blowing snow was creating “extremely dangerous to impossible travel conditions.” The combination of snow and high winds was most intense in the Sierra Nevada, with more than 3 inches (7 centimeters) of snow falling per hour and wind gusts over 100 mph (161 kph). “High to extreme avalanche danger” is expected in the backcountry through Sunday evening throughout the central Sierra, including the greater Lake Tahoe area, the weather service said. California authorities on Friday shut down 100 miles (160 kilometers) of I-80 due to “spin outs, high winds, and low visibility.” They had no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border just west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California. Pacific Gas & Electric reported around 7 a.m. Saturday that 27,000 households and businesses were without power. A tornado touched down Friday afternoon in Madera County and caused some damage to an elementary school, said Andy Bollenbacher, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Hanford. Some of the ski resorts that shut down Friday said they planned to remain closed on Saturday to dig out with an eye on reopening Sunday, but most said they would wait to provide updates Saturday morning. Palisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of Tahoe and site of the 1960 Winter Olympics, closed all chairlifts Saturday due to snow, wind and low visibility. The storm began barreling into the region on Thursday. A blizzard warning through Sunday morning covers a 300-mile (482-kilometer) stretch of the mountains. Some ski lovers raced up to the mountains ahead of the storm. Daniel Lavely, an avid skier who works at a Reno-area home/construction supply store, was not one of them. He said Friday that he wouldn’t have considered making the hour-drive to ski on his season pass at a Tahoe resort because of the gale-force winds. But most of his customers Friday seemed to think the storm wouldn’t be as bad as predicted, he said. “I had one person ask me for a shovel,” Lavely said. “Nobody asked me about a snowblower, which we sold out the last storm about two weeks ago.” Meteorologists predict as much as 10 feet (3 meters) of snow is possible in the mountains around Lake Tahoe by the weekend, with 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 meters) in the communities on the lake’s shores and more than a foot (30 centimeters) possible in the valleys on the Sierra’s eastern front, including Reno.

Ayesha Curry, a cookbook author and restaurateur, announced that she’s pregnant Friday in the latest issue of a magazine published by her lifestyle brand, Sweet July. She said in the cover story that she and the Golden State Warriors star had not previously planned to expand their family, but that they changed their minds about wanting more children last year. “For me, the decision came from always finding myself looking around and feeling like somebody was missing,” she said. “It started to turn my brain a little bit. Maybe somebody was missing. So we set out on this journey, knowing that this would complete our family.” She later shared how she’s approaching pregnancy differently this time around, saying that she’s “protecting my peace.” “This is such a sacred time in life that I know I’m never going to get back so I’m being a little selfish,” she said. “I’m keeping some things to myself.” Ayesha and Stephen Curry already have three children: daughters Riley, 11, and Ryan, 8; and son Canon, 5. The couple, who wed in 2011, have talked about their parenting journey on several occasions. In 2016, Stephen Curry told Parents magazine in a video interview that he’d learned to be prepared for “anything” as a dad. “You’re going to be thrown a lot of curveballs,” he said at the time.

Three planes from Air Forces Central dropped 66 bundles containing about 38,000 meals into Gaza at 8:30 a.m. EST, according to two of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity before a public announcement. The airdrop is expected to be the first of many announced by President Joe Biden on Friday. The aid will be coordinated with Jordan, which has also conducted airdrops to deliver food to Gaza. At least 115 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more wounded in the Thursday attack as they scrambled for aid, the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said. Israel says many of the dead were trampled in a chaotic crush for the food aid, and its troops fired warning shots after the crowd moved toward them in a threatening way. In the coming days, the United States will carry out airdrops of aid to Gaza, redouble our efforts to open a maritime corridor, and expand deliveries by land.The aid flowing into Gaza is nowhere near enough.We all need to do more. And the United States will do more. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Friday that the airdrops were being planned to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance in a safe way to people on the ground. The C-130 cargo plane is a widely used military aircraft to deliver aid to remote places due to its ability to land in austere environments and cargo capacity. A C-130 can airlift as much as 42,000 pounds of cargo and its crews know how to rig the cargo, which sometimes can include even vehicles, onto massive pallets can be safely dropped out of the back of the aircraft. Air Force loadmasters secure the bundles onto pallets with netting that is rigged for release in the back of a C-130, and then crews release it with a parachute when the aircraft reaches the intended delivery zone. The Air Force’s C-130 has been used in years past to air drop humanitarian into Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti and other locations and the airframe is used in an annual multi-national “Operation Christmas Drop” that air drops pallets of toys, supplies, nonperishable food and fishing supplies to remote locations in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau. Since the war began on Oct. 7, Israel has barred entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies, except for a trickle of aid entering the south from Egypt at the Rafah crossing and Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing. The United Nations says a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people face starvation. Aid officials have said that airdrops are not an efficient means of distributing aid and are a measure of last resort.

The sinking of the Rubymar comes as shipping through the crucial waterway for cargo and energy shipments moving from Asia and the Middle East to Europe has been affected by the Houthi attacks. Already, many ships have turned away from the route. The sinking could see further detours and higher insurance rates put on vessels plying the waterway — potentially driving up global inflation and affecting aid shipments to the region. The Belize-flagged Rubymar had been drifting northward after being struck by a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile on Feb. 18 in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a crucial waterway linking the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Yemen’s internationally recognized government, as well as a regional military official, confirmed the ship sank. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as no authorization was given to speak to journalists about the incident. The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, which watches over Mideast waterways, separately acknowledged the Rubymar’s sinking Saturday afternoon. The Rubymar’s Beirut-based manager could not be immediately reached for comment. Yemen’s exiled government, which has been backed by a Saudi-led coalition since 2015, said the Rubymar sank late Friday as stormy weather took hold over the Red Sea. The vessel had been abandoned for 12 days after the attack, though plans had been made to try and tow the ship to a safe port. The Iran-backed Houthis, who had falsely claimed the ship sank almost instantly after the attack, did not immediately acknowledge the ship’s sinking. The U.S. military’s Central Command previously warned the vessel’s cargo of fertilizer, as well as fuel leaking from the ship, could cause ecological damage to the Red Sea. Ahmed Awad Bin Mubarak, the prime minister of Yemen’s internationally recognized government, called the ship’s sinking “an unprecedented environmental disaster.” “It’s a new disaster for our country and our people,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Every day, we pay for the Houthi militia’s adventures, which were not stopped at plunging Yemen into the coup disaster and war.” The Houthis have held Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, since 2014, expelling the government. It’s fought a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 in a stalemated war. Satellite pictures analyzed by The Associated Press from Planet Labs PBC showed smaller boats alongside the Rubymar on Wednesday. It wasn’t immediately clear whose vessels those were. The images showed the Rubymar’s stern sinking into the Red Sea but still afloat, mirroring earlier video taken of the vessel. The private security firm Ambrey separately reported Friday about a mysterious incident involving the Rubymar. “A number of Yemenis were reportedly harmed during a security incident which took place” on Friday, Ambrey said. It did not elaborate on what that incident involved and no party involved in Yemen’s yearslong war claimed any new attack on the vessel. A satellite image taken Friday from Maxar Technologies showed new blast damage on the Rubymar not previously seen, with no other vessels around it. Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters over the Israel-Hamas war. Those vessels have included at least one with cargo bound for Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, and an aid ship later bound for Houthi-controlled territory. Despite over a month of U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi rebels remain capable of launching significant attacks. That includes the attack on the Rubymar and the downing of an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars. The Houthis insist their attacks will continue until Israel stops its combat operations in the Gaza Strip, which have enraged the wider Arab world and seen the Houthis gain international recognition.

(AP) — A movie director who was shot by Alec Baldwin during a movie rehearsal — and survived — testified Friday at trial that he was approaching the cinematographer when he heard a loud bang and felt the bullet’s impact. “It felt like someone had taken a baseball bat to my shoulder,” said Joel Souza, who was wounded by the same bullet that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the New Mexico set for the upcoming Western movie “Rust” on Oct. 21, 2021. Souza never filed a complaint but was called to testify as prosecutors pursue charges of involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence against movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who maintains her innocence. Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer on “Rust,” was separately indicted by a grand jury last month. He has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is scheduled for July. Prosecutors are reconstructing a complex chain of events that culminated in gunfire on a film set where live ammunition is expressly prohibited. Souza said his workday began before dawn with the realization that six camera-crew members had walked off set. Hutchins put out urgent calls for replacements, and filming was back underway by late-morning in an outdoor scene involving horses and wagons. Work after lunch started with positioning a camera in preparation for an extreme close-up take of Baldwin drawing a gun from a holster inside a makeshift church. Souza said he moved in behind Hutchins for a closer look at the camera angle but never saw the gun that shot him. “I got up behind her just to try to see on the monitor, and there was an incredibly loud bang,” Souza said. “This was deafening.” Baldwin and his handling of firearms on set are coming under special scrutiny in questioning by prosecutor and defense attorneys. On Thursday, prosecutors played video footage of Baldwin pressuring the movie armorer to hurry up as she reloads guns between scenes. “One more, let’s reload right away,” Baldwin says at the close of a scene. “Here we go, come on. We should have had two guns and both were reloading.” Gutierrez-Reed can be seen quickly loading a revolver. Expert witness Bryan Carpenter, a Mississippi-based specialist in firearms safety on film sets, said Baldwin’s commands infringed on basic industry safety protocols and responsibilities of the armorer. “He’s basically instructing the armorer on how to do their job ... ‘Hurry up, give it to me fast,’” Carpenter said. “Rushing with firearms and telling someone to rush with firearms is not — not normal or accepted.” On Friday, defense attorney Jason Bowles pressed Souza to remember whether the script explicitly called for Baldwin to point the gun toward the camera, where he and Hutchins were standing. “And do you know whether, from the script, whether that firearm was supposed to be pointed towards the camera?” Bowles inquired. “It’s not a matter of the script, really. For that specific shot, it was literally supposed to be the gun being pulled out sideways,” Souza said. Prosecutors say Gutierrez-Reed is to blame for unwittingly bringing live ammunition on set and that she flouted basic safety protocols for weapons — partly by leaving the church rehearsal while a gun still was in use. Defense attorneys say it wasn’t Gutierrez-Reed’s decision to leave. Souza said he only recalled seeing Gutierrez-Reed inside the church after he was shot. “I remember at one point looking up and her standing there ... distraught,” Souza said. “I remember her saying, ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Joel.’ And I remember somebody just screaming at her, and they just ushered her out.’” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dad-daughter-letters-writer-addiction_n_65d53b67e4b007e3eb7373e0","My Dad Disappeared When I Was A Kid. Years Later, I Got A Letter That Changed Both Our Lives.","geralyn broder murray","2024-03-02","During the summer I turned 14, I came home to a typewritten letter waiting for me on my bedspread. My dad had entered a drug treatment program — part of his rehabilitation was writing to his family about what he’d been through, and to apologize if necessary. Apologies were necessary. My father had disappeared five or six years before, after a custody battle and then a failure to pay child support. Since then, we’d moved away, and my mother remarried and had a second child. The few memories I had of my father were mostly of a swimming pool that made my eyes bloodshot, animals that I loved and an awful skin rash I picked up when he’d taken me to Hawaii without telling my mother. In that first letter, he explained his addiction and the consequences it had on his life, and how when trouble descended, he’d been incapable of dealing with it, so he’d stayed loaded. Now finished with an 28-day rehab program, he planned to remain in Monterey, California — a city with a historically calming effect on him since his stint at Fort Ord when he was 18. He closed the letter: “There will be a new twist to what I do, how I do it and who I choose to do it with. I am feeling stronger every day, but I didn’t get sick in one day and I don’t think I’ll get well in one month either. Would like to hear from you. Hope you understand.” I was 14. I didn’t understand. But I had a father that wanted to hear from me, so I wrote back. And then he did. And then I did. For 17 years. His letters gave me what I’d been missing during the first 14 years of my life. Every typewritten page, every piece of personal stationery with his left-handed scrawl, managed to fill another gaping hole in my heart with something like love. When I began writing for my high school newspaper and sent him my clippings, my dad, an aspiring writer with a deep wish for a published work of his own, was over the moon with praise. When I was 16, he wrote: “I enjoyed your articles and I think you show great promise.” At 17, a note from him arrived that read, “Another excellent piece! You have found your calling. I am impressed.” When I was not quite 18, he wrote to me and shared that the fun of writing had left him. He explained he was trying to remember the simple joy of getting words down on the page. “I consider you a writer,” his typewritten words on thin vellum paper proclaimed, “and any suggestions you might care to share on this or other subjects would be most welcome.” He considered me a writer. More than anything, he considered me. When my graduation from high school coincided with my mother’s second divorce, there was no money to spare for college tuition. My father — who’d finally begun paying my mother that back child support — offered to send it straight to me. This made going to college possible, eventually making me the first in my family to graduate with a degree from higher education. At 19, he bought me my first car, a used 1981 Honda Prelude. He laid out the agreement in another letter: “If you are going to drink, you may not drive under any circumstances. Wearing the Dad hat is still awkward and I am falling all over myself, please try and understand. I love you and respect you, all I want to know is how we can continue to improve our relationship.” Every letter ended the same: Much love, Dad. I used the car to get to school and work and to fulfill the requirements for my major in journalism, the choice of which was greatly influenced by my father. Once, when I mentioned changing my major to psychology, citing my love of people and desire to help them, he countered that my gift for writing was something that would help many people — and that it was a gift not everyone had to give. Plus, he was paying, so journalism it was. When I got caught up with my social life in college, ending up with average (or below average) grades, a letter arrived promptly, reminding me what I was in school to do. “If being average is OK with you at this point, you might as well french fry your hair and get over to Burger King! No one ever set out to be average!” he wrote. “The world has become an average planet and has just about sealed its fate with average people doing average work. We need excellence and we need it from you. It will take people like you — young people with original ideas — to take charge.” Reader, my grades improved, if only slightly. During college and after, I drove the Prelude from my apartment in Los Angeles to his house in Monterey so often, the car could almost find its way there without me. Dad, his wife Karen and I stayed up too late watching movies and, after Karen went to bed, Dad and I sat by the fireplace for hours and talked about the world, about writing, about life. What he didn’t share fireside arrived by mail. “It’s 2 a.m. and I feel like running. I don’t mean jogging either,” one letter read. “Sometimes, I just want to cut and run. That was my pattern. It didn’t matter if things were going well or poorly, the feeling would come over me and splitting was the only thing I could think of. I’ve simply run out of places to run so now I’m running in place.” In another letter he wrote, “I’m wrapped in the summer fog. It’s wet and heavy and is holding me inside and away from the beach and pool. Possibly, I’ll be able to write today. This is the way it always begins.” After college, I worked as an advertising copywriter. I was 26 and making $26,000 a year writing jingles. Yet, from my father’s letters, you’d think I’d won a Pulitzer. “I want you to know that I am proud of you and pleased that you are becoming what I’ve only dreamed of becoming, a writer,” he wrote. “At least one of us is going to make it.” I knew writing commercials for Subway sandwiches and Lee jeans didn’t make me special, but the words he’d sent me from his Smith-Corona did. Like every other twenty-something, I questioned the government and policy and the world. He had thoughts on all of it. Once he fished me out of a terrible relationship in person; for almost everything else, he counseled me by snail mail and eventually, email. “I know you are afraid,” he wrote, “which is not entirely a bad thing. A little reservation, concern, awareness and appreciation of the subtleties can add to your grace of movement and decision-making abilities. Go with your strength — writing, observing, making sense of disorder and assisting others by this very talent.” He added, “In your search for something positive, look in the corners. The true leaders are often anonymous. You have inherited a mixed bag of blessings and bombs. Pick your spot, dig in and make your mark.” By the time he met my now-husband, my father was already in a dark depression, yet he emerged long enough to be elated at my choice of mate. He was 57, struggling financially and trying to reinvent himself professionally. The last Christmas we spent together, December 2000, he hand-delivered what I didn’t know would be his last letter. He wrote about a new musician he’d recently discovered — Eva Cassidy — and how she’d reminded him that some moments capture our attention in a way we never forget, like the first time you hear the crack of a bat or taste fresh crab or see a shooting star. He hoped Eva would inspire me, that she would remind me how the arts hold the power to do this for us. Six months later, my father took his life.  After he died, everyone asked whether he had left a note. None had been found, but then I remembered: Yes, he had left a note. He’d left 48 of them.  Twenty-two years later, thanks to those letters, my father is still very much alive in my heart my life and the lives of my two children. If there comes a day I forget about his love for the Dodgers, Hunter S. Thompson or Miles Davis, if his passion for swimming in the ocean or remaining curious slips my mind, all I have to do is get out the yellow file with the 48 priceless pages on which his words remain, and I know they will bring him back to me, again and again.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-timing-trump-jan-6-trial-october_n_65e25845e4b005b858346cbf","Supreme Court Schedule Could Put Trump On Trial All Through Campaign’s Final Month","s.v. date","2024-03-02","WASHINGTON ― With the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to take up Donald Trump’s claim that he is immune from prosecution for his coup attempt, the former president ― and near certain Republican presidential nominee ― could be spending every weekday of the campaign’s final month sitting in a Washington, D.C., courtroom. Instead of visiting key states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, where his efforts to regain the White House will likely be decided, Trump might instead be sitting before U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, listening to his former aides testify about his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss. Instead of long speeches at rallies, Trump’s campaigning could primarily consist of his signature rants about “election interference” and a “witch hunt” as he stands outside the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Court House ― just blocks from the U.S. Capitol, which a mob of his followers attacked on Jan. 6, 2021, as part of his last-ditch attempt to retain power. “You’re going to have the spectacle of his former officials, one after the other, day after day, testifying about what he did,” said George Conway, a conservative lawyer who worked on the civil lawsuit that led to former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment and, more recently, helped writer E. Jean Carroll sue Trump for sexually abusing and defaming her. Whether such a scenario would help Trump or hurt him is unclear. Trump’s campaign aides did not respond to HuffPost queries, but much of his 2024 campaign has already been based on his supposed victimhood at the hands of the “deep state,” and it has let him glide toward winning the nomination over a field of rivals. And whether the October trial scenario comes to pass depends entirely on how quickly the Supreme Court justices issue their ruling after the scheduled oral arguments on April 22. The high court historically has moved quickly on questions about the presidency. In 1974, just 16 days after hearing oral arguments, justices ruled unanimously that President Richard Nixon had to turn over recordings he had made in the White House. Those tapes revealed he was aware of the cover-up in the Watergate scandal, and Nixon wound up resigning days after the tapes were made public. In December 2000, the Supreme Court ruled just one day after oral arguments that Florida could not conduct a statewide hand recount of presidential ballots, thereby giving the presidency to Texas Gov. George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore. If the Supreme Court rules in a similar fashion in Trump’s appeal, the case could be back in Chutkan’s hands by early May. She has previously said she would not penalize Trump’s legal team for appealing the immunity question and would give them the three months they had remaining in early December before the trial was to have started. The resulting early August trial date potentially means it would be wrapped up and a verdict issued by Election Day on Nov. 5. “This case can still go to trial if the Supreme Court moves quickly, and they should,” said Norm Eisen, a former White House lawyer in the Obama administration who worked with House Democrats in the first Trump impeachment in 2020. If, however, the court does not rule until the very end of its term in late June or early July, Chutkan’s three-month clock would push a trial start date to late September or early October. At that point, Trump’s lawyers would be out of legal arguments to delay the case any further but are almost certain to continue their political argument: claiming that it would be unfair to proceed so close to the election. Some legal experts worry that in a presidential contest, those arguments would be difficult for Chutkan to resist. “No judge is going to start a trial four weeks before the election, especially with the possibility trial might extend beyond Election Day,” said Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. To date, however, Chutkan has indicated that she will not treat Trump differently than any other criminal defendant coming before her. “The fact that he’s running a political campaign currently has to yield to the orderly administration of justice,” Chutkan said at a hearing last August. “Regardless of what is going on with his, I hate to say, his day job, this is a criminal case…. I cannot and I will not factor into my decisions the influence it will have on a political campaign on either side.” That a federal trial on the election conspiracy charges will happen at all is based on the assumption ― shared by many if not most legal experts ― that the high court will uphold a February appellate court ruling that Trump does not have immunity from prosecution over his actions while president. That it could start before the election is largely based on the presumption that justices will not send the case back to Chutkan with a demand that she hold a fact-finding hearing. Eisen said the wording of the Supreme Court’s order Wednesday accepting the case suggests that its decision will be based on the assumption that the accusations in the Jan. 6 indictment are true. “They talk about making the determination based on allegations,” he said. “That’s a reference to making the determination based on the indictment.” Conway, though, said that even if the court does send the case back to Chutkan to determine, for example, whether his attempts to overturn the election were “official” presidential duties or not, she could hold a hearing on that specific question relatively quickly over the summer, bringing in the same witnesses who will later appear at the trial. “It would be a mini-trial,” Conway said, which would have the same effect of bringing forward incriminating testimony just as the campaign season heats up. “That’s probably not going to be good for him.” The next four years will change America forever.

A New York state indictment, meanwhile, accuses him of falsifying business records to hide payments made ahead of the 2016 election to silence accusations of extramarital affairs.

So I became curious and asked the BuzzFeed Community: “Teachers, what are the automatic tell-tale signs that a parent or kid’s behavior exhibits ‘red flags’ parenting styles?” Hundreds of teachers provided their expertise and experience on the matter. Here’s what they had to say below: ""'We don't believe in bedtimes.' That's great, but your kid is massively sleep-deprived. 'We don't believe in limiting junk food.' That's great, but your kid is constipated from a steady diet of Goldfish crackers and nothing else. 'We believe in only using natural products.' That's great, but your kid's diaper rash isn't responding to your all-natural organic cream, and you need to see a doctor. It's great to have parenting ideals, but your child's needs have to come first."" —lobsterlemonlime —Natalie, 2nd grade teacher, Oklahoma ""Watching his interactions with his mom and siblings during our conference, it finally dawned on me that he was just not getting any positive attention or affection at home. And I suddenly felt so sad for him. He was really into video games, and I noticed he always wanted to talk to me about them at school. So, I started making it a point to be interested in this any time he wanted to talk. We also continued with his behavior chart, and soon, the tantrums stopped completely. I was able to develop a close and trusting relationship with him just by observing that his parents couldn’t give him the attention he needed."" —Julie, Elementary Teacher, Arizona —Sarah —savithri1189 —lameshurbay By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The sound is great for price paid. Way better than raw tv alone. The base is just enough to feel like a small personal theater placed under the bed. It’s perfect.” — Ozark “My LG Surround finally gave up at the beginning of a movie yesterday. So I went out and bought this Vizio 5.1 Surround system and All I can say is Wow. I am pleasantly surprised at the sound I get at this price point. I love that the surround speakers don’t have to be connected to the Bar under the TV. I have them behind the couch along with the Sub. The surround sound fills the room quite nicely and the sub allows us to “feel” the movie on the couch. The dialog feature is great too. It allows you to boost the voice without it being drowned by the rest of the sound. It’s plenty loud in our lil 500sq ft living room. My daughter says it’s clearly loud enough as she heard it even outside. It took about 15 minutes to get going and hooked it to the optical digital audio on the TV and adjusted the a offset and we were good to go. It has a true theater experience in our living room. We are completely satisfied with the purchase.” — Wolfy “I like the sound of this speaker system. The bass is deep enough to rattle the room when we’re watching movies or listening to music. I don’t like the fact that tha surround speakers are wired. When I purchased this system, I thought it was all wireless.” — DEEKEEBEE “I should have gotten this surround sound much sooner. Good things does come in small packages. Clear audio and this small subwoofer hits hard. It does make one feel like they are in a theater. If you’re looking to purchase one, I recommend this. Don’t waste your money on much expensive surround sound, this little facka will suffice.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/drug-recriminalization-oregon_n_65e299c5e4b013678e155b92","Oregon Lawmakers Pass Bill To Recriminalize Drug Possession","ap","2024-03-01","SALEM, Ore. (AP) — A bill recriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs was passed by the Oregon Legislature on Friday, undoing a key part of the state’s first-in-the-nation drug decriminalization law as governments struggle to respond to the deadliest overdose crisis in U.S. history. The state Senate approved House Bill 4002 in a 21-8 vote after the House passed it 51-7 on Thursday. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. Tina Kotek, who said in January that she is open to signing a bill that would roll back decriminalization, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. “With this bill, we are doubling down on our commitment to make sure Oregonians have access to the treatment and care that they need,” said Democratic Senate Majority Leader Kate Lieber, of Portland, one of the bill’s authors, adding that its passage will “be the start of real and transformative change for our justice system.” The measure makes the possession of small amounts of drugs such as heroin or methamphetamine a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail. It enables police to confiscate the drugs and crack down on their use on sidewalks and in parks. Drug treatment is to be offered as an alternative to criminal penalties. The bill also aims to make it easier to prosecute people who sell drugs. It increases access to addiction medication, and to obtain and keep housing without facing discrimination for using that medication. Decriminalization of personal-use amounts of drugs, OK’d by voters in 2020 under Ballot Measure 110, was supposed to move hundreds of millions of dollars of marijuana tax revenues into drug treatment and harm reduction programs. That didn’t translate into an improved care network for a state with the second-highest rate of substance use disorder in the nation and ranked 50th for access to treatment, according to an audit report released in 2023. And with Oregon experiencing one of the nation’s largest spikes in overdose deaths, Republican pressure intensified, and a well-funded campaign group called for a ballot measure that would further weaken Measure 110. Researchers have said it was too soon to determine whether the law contributed to the overdose surge, and supporters of the decriminalization measure say the decadeslong approach of arresting people for possessing and using drugs didn’t work. Lawmakers who opposed the bill voiced those concerns. Some called it a return to the war on drugs that disproportionally impacted and imprisoned millions of Black men. Democratic Sen. Lew Frederick, of Portland, one of four Black senators, said the bill had too many flaws and that testimony on the bill heard again and again was that substance use disorder requires primarily a medical response.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obit-iris-apfel_n_65e286c2e4b005b858347510","Iris Apfel, Fashion Icon Known For Her Eye-Catching Style, Dies At 102","beth j. harpaz","2024-03-01","NEW YORK (AP) — Iris Apfel, a textile expert, interior designer and fashion celebrity known for her eccentric style, has died. She was 102. Her death was confirmed by her commercial agent, Lori Sale, who called Apfel “extraordinary.” No cause of death was given. It was also announced on her her verified Instagram page on Friday, which a day earlier had celebrated that Leap Day represented her 102nd-and-a-half birthday. Born Aug. 29, 1921, Apfel was famous for her irreverent, eye-catching outfits, mixing haute couture and oversized costume jewelry. A classic Apfel look would, for instance, pair a feather boa with strands of chunky beads, bangles and a jacket decorated with Native American beadwork. With her big, round, black-rimmed glasses, bright red lipstick and short white hair, she stood out at every fashion show she attended. Her style was the subject of museum exhibits and a documentary film, “Iris,” directed by Albert Maysles. “I’m not pretty, and I’ll never be pretty, but it doesn’t matter,” she once said. “I have something much better. I have style.” Apfel enjoyed late-in-life fame on social media, amassing nearly 3 million followers on Instagram, where her profile declares: “More is more & Less is a Bore.” On TikTok, she drew 215,000 followers as she waxed wise on things fashion and style and promoted recent collaborations. “Being stylish and being fashionable are two entirely different things,” she said in one TikTok video. “You can easily buy your way into being fashionable. Style, I think is in your DNA. It implies originality and courage.” She never retired, telling “Today”: “I think retiring at any age is a fate worse than death. Just because a number comes up doesn’t mean you have to stop.” “Working alongside her was the honor of a lifetime. I will miss her daily calls, always greeted with the familiar question: “What have you got for me today?,” Sale said in a statement. “Testament to her insatiable desire to work. She was a visionary in every sense of the word. She saw the world through a unique lens – one adorned with giant, distinctive spectacles that sat atop her nose.” Apfel was an expert on textiles and antique fabrics. She and her husband Carl owned a textile manufacturing company, Old World Weavers, and specialized in restoration work, including projects at the White House under six different U.S. presidents. Apfel’s celebrity clients included Estee Lauder and Greta Garbo. Apfel’s own fame blew up in 2005 when the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in New York City hosted a show about her called “Rara Avis,” Latin for “rare bird.” The museum described her style as “both witty and exuberantly idiosyncratic. Her originality is typically revealed in her mixing of high and low fashions — Dior haute couture with flea market finds, 19th-century ecclesiastical vestments with Dolce & Gabbana lizard trousers.” The museum said her “layered combinations” defied “aesthetic conventions” and “even at their most extreme and baroque” represented a “boldly graphic modernity.” The Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, was one of several museums around the country that hosted a traveling version of the show. Apfel later decided to donate hundreds of pieces to the Peabody — including couture gowns — to help them build what she termed “a fabulous fashion collection.” The Museum of Fashion & Lifestyle near Apfel’s winter home in Palm Beach, Florida, also plans a gallery dedicated to displaying items from Apfel’s collection. Apfel was born in New York City to Samuel and Sadye Barrel. Her mother owned a boutique. Apfel’s fame in her later years included appearances in ads for brands like M.A.C. cosmetics and Kate Spade. She also designed a line of accessories and jewelry for Home Shopping Network, collaborated with H&M on a sold-out-in-minutes collection of brightly-colored apparel, jewelry and shoes, put out a makeup line with Ciaté London, an eyeglass collection with Zenni and partnered with Ruggable on floor coverings.

In a 2017 interview with AP at age 95, she said her favorite contemporary designers included Ralph Rucci, Isabel Toledo and Naeem Khan, but added: “I have so much, I don’t go looking.” Asked for her fashion advice, she said: “Everybody should find her own way. I’m a great one for individuality. I don’t like trends.

Under the proposed regulation, breaking, damaging or losing wheelchairs or other mobility devices would qualify as a violation of the Air Carrier Access Act, a law that bars airlines from discriminating on the basis of disability. In 2023, airlines mishandled more than 11,000 wheelchairs and scooters, according to the department. The proposed changes would also require airlines to provide annual training for employees who physically assist disabled passengers. “There are millions of Americans with disabilities who do not travel by plane because of inadequate airline practices and inadequate government regulation, but now we are setting out to change that,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement on Thursday. “This new rule would change the way airlines operate to ensure that travelers using wheelchairs can travel safely and with dignity.” The new regulation is among several that the DOT has brought forward in recent years to bolster protections for disabled passengers and make air travel more accessible. In 2022, the DOT published a “bill of rights” for disabled passengers. Last year, the department issued a regulation requiring, among other things, that new single-aisle aircrafts with a minimum of 125 seats have larger, wheelchair-accessible bathrooms with accessibility features. While disability rights advocates are excited to see efforts made to improve air travel, many are worried the new regulations will run up against a deadline that could prevent them from moving forward. Under the Congressional Review Act, executive branch agencies are required to report their rulemaking activities to Congress to give lawmakers a chance to strike down new rules. A provision within the also allows for a new Congress to review and act on rules from the previous session during a specific time period. Mia Ives-Rublee, the director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress, told HuffPost she and others in the disability community are worried that the proposed rules for airlines, as well as pending regulations that have been proposed by the Department of Justice and other agencies to support disabled Americans, could be wiped away if Donald Trump retakes the presidency. “If there is a change in administration for the following year, that administration could just strip all those changes with sort of a stroke of a pen,” Ives-Rublee explained. “So we want to try and get these things done as soon as possible, and that means that we need the… agencies to act as soon as possible so that we aren’t running into that deadline.” In an emailed statement to HuffPost, a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation said that the proposed changes will be published in the Federal Register and will be open to public comment for 60 days. “The Department views this issue as a priority and will work expeditiously to review the public comments and determine how to proceed consistent with federal requirements,” the spokesperson said. Ives-Rublee adds that while she’s happy that the regulations have been proposed, she wants to see the department branch out and address other, more immediate transportation-related concerns of the disability community, such as the shortcomings of paratransit and public transportation systems.

Similarly, paratransit services are specialized, door-to-door transportation for disabled people, but data shows that people experience long wait times, unreliable service and lack of compliance with standards set by federal disability law when using paratransit. “It is important that the airlines fix what they’re doing, and these regulations are important,” Ives-Rublee said. “I’m just saying there are also other regulations that need to be completed, or even just reviewed, to address the concerns of folks who utilize public transportation and paratransit that have significant needs.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), one of the country’s largest LGBTQ+ rights groups, filed complaints with the Department of Education and the Department of Justice following Benedict’s death on Feb. 8. Benedict died one day after a fight with three other Owasso High School students, putting a spotlight on the culture of fear and harassment facing LGBTQ+ students in Oklahoma and beyond. “This letter is to notify you that the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), is opening for investigation the above-referenced complaint that you filed against the Owasso Public Schools (the District),” wrote Karen Mines, the Education Department’s regional director, in a letter to HRC. “Your complaint alleges that the District discriminated against students by failing to respond appropriately to sex-based harassment, of which it had notice, at Owasso High School during the 2023-2024 school year.” The letter also notes that the Office for Civil Rights will investigate whether the district failed to follow Title IX guidelines when responding to sex-based harassment. Current Title IX law includes language that protects transgender students in any school or educational program that receives federal funding. Brock Crawford, a spokesperson for the Owasso Public School District, confirmed by email that the district received a notice of the investigation from the Office for Civil Rights. “The district is committed to cooperating with federal officials and believes the complaint submitted by HRC is not supported by the facts and is without merit,” Crawford said in the email. In the days since news broke about Benedict’s death, dozens of organizations have accused Oklahoma’s state superintendent, Ryan Walters, of creating a hostile environment for LGBTQ+ and two-spirit students. The conservative superintendent has faced backlash for appointing Chaya Raichik, the woman behind the far-right social media account Libs of TikTok, to a voluntary seat on the state’s library review committee. In 2022, Libs of TikTok targeted one of Benedict’s eighth-grade teachers, Tyler Wrynn, prompting them to resign because of the harassment. On Wednesday more than 300 advocacy and LGBTQ+ organizations called for Walters’ immediate removal, stating that his choice to appoint Raichik, as well as his emergency rule to block a trans Oklahoma teen from changing his gender on his school records, have created a “culture where rampant harassment of 2SLGBTQ+ students has been allowed to go unchecked.” The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-republicans-seek-political-cover-behind-useless-ivf-resolutions_n_65e267fae4b0d2a247596cba","House Republicans Seek Political Cover Behind Useless IVF Resolutions","alanna vagianos","2024-03-01","House Republicans are all talk and no action on protecting Americans’ access to in vitro fertilization, after the Alabama Supreme Court granted embryos the same legal status as children last month. Several House Republicans introduced two measures this week following the sweeping court ruling as a way to express strong support for IVF protections. Both resolutions list critical facts about IVF, note the importance of patient access and applaud fertility specialists for the work they do. One of the two even goes on to condemn the judicial ruling out of Alabama. But neither have any legislative power. Resolutions are non-binding statements that primarily serve as tools for political posturing. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) announced her resolution on Thursday, which expresses “support for continued access to fertility care and assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization.” The resolution was co-sponsored by five other House Republicans: Reps. David Schweikert (Ariz.), Anthony D’Esposito (N.Y.), Jeff Van Drew (N.J.), Jen Kiggans (Va.) and Don Bacon (Neb.). Four out of the five co-sponsors represent districts that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, and are likely vulnerable to losing their seat in November. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.) published her resolution, with Republican co-sponsors Reps. Michelle Steel (Calif.) and Juan Ciscomani (Ariz.), on Friday morning. The resolution states that the House “remains committed to commonsense policies that enable families to grow” as well as “recognizes the fundamental truth that life is precious.” “As someone who struggled with infertility and personally witnessed the miracle of IVF, I strongly believe that IVF should remain protected and accessible,” Steel tweeted along with Chavez-DeRemer’s announcement of the non-binding resolution. D’Esposito responded to HuffPost’s request for comment in an emailed statement. “Democrats’ misleading smear campaign cannot distort the fact that I’ve been fighting on Capitol Hill since day one to ensure women are empowered to make their own individual healthcare decisions by opposing any attempt to institute a nationwide abortion ban and advancing legislation that supports women’s access to important fertility resources like IVF treatments,” D’Esposito said. The House Republican took office in January 2023 and voted to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, legislation based on a misleading premise that sought to “interfere with evidence-based medicine,” as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists described it. None of the other eight representatives responded to HuffPost’s request for comment. Republicans have found themselves scrambling to distance themselves from the Alabama ruling in the wake of national public outrage over its sweeping effect. Access to IVF is an issue over 80% of Americans support, including a majority of Republican voters. Campaigning on far-right policies that galvanize a strong but extreme subsection of the GOP base may prove risky for Republicans. Without the guardrails of Roe v. Wade, reproductive health care restrictions that are broadly unpopular can be enacted by GOP-led states. The next four years will change America forever.

Mace, Steel, Schweikert and Bacon were co-sponsors of the 2021 Life at Conception Act, an anti-abortion bill that aimed to grant full legal rights to embryos from “the moment of fertilization.” The Senate version of the bill had a carve-out to protect IVF, but the House version did not. The House bill had 166 Republican co-sponsors when it was first introduced in 2021, and 124 co-sponsors when it was re-introduced in 2023. “House Republicans are flagrant hypocrites who have spent their entire tenure in the majority attacking reproductive rights at every turn,” Courtney Rice, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told HuffPost. “Now, they are hiding behind toothless resolutions and empty public statements because they know their relentless attacks on reproductive freedoms will cost them at the ballot box.” Similar to House Republicans’ approach, Senate Republicans have been reluctant to discuss their support of IVF, particularly after Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) blocked a bill this week that would have protected access to IVF on the federal level. Democrats have a companion measure they are still pushing in the House.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elijah-mcclain-paramedic-sentenced_n_65e26cdee4b005b858346ec5","Paramedic Gets 5 Years In Prison For Elijah McClain’s Death In Rare Case Against Medical Responders","colleen slevin , matthew brown","2024-03-01","DENVER (AP) — A Colorado paramedic was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for the death of Elijah McClain in a rare prosecution of medical responders that has left officials rethinking how they treat people in police custody. The convictions of Peter Cichuniec and a fellow paramedic sent shock waves through the ranks of paramedics across the U.S. and thrust their profession into the acrimonious fight over social justice sparked by the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Cichuniec and Jeremy Cooper were both convicted in December of criminally negligent homicide for administering the sedative ultimately blamed for killing McClain, a 23-year-old Black massage therapist, in 2019. Cichuniec was also convicted the more serious charge of second-degree assault for giving a drug without consent or a legitimate medical purpose. McClain’s mother, Sheneen, raised her fist in the air as she left the courtroom following Friday’s sentencing, as she’s done after previous hearings. Cichuniec had faced up to 16 years in prison on the assault charge, and the five-year sentence was the minimum the judge could have given Cichuniec under sentencing guidelines. Someone from Cichuniec’s family called out, “Love you Pete” as he looked back and waved at them before leaving court in handcuffs. In testimony before the sentence was handed down by Judge Mark Warner, Sheneen McClain said she once dreamed of being a firefighter and considered them heroes “until the day they took my son’s life.” “You are a local hero no more,” she said as Cichuniec sat with his attorneys at a nearby table. “Next time, think for yourself and do not follow the direction of a crowd of cowards.” She added that the other paramedics could have intervened “simply by just saying, ‘Stop hurting my patient.’” Cichuniec — who has been in custody since his conviction and was handcuffed and shackled for the hearing — asked the judge for mercy. He wiped away tears as family members and friends testified as character witnesses on his behalf, and later told the judge he had spent his 18-year career as a firefighter and paramedic putting his own life on the line and putting other lives before his own. “I have never backed down from a call and I’ve had more things happen to me than you can imagine,” he said. “It sickened me when the prosecution said during their closing argument that I showed no remorse for Elijah. ... There was absolutely no intent to cause any harm to Elijah McClain.” Cichuniec’s wife said after the hearing she was “relatively relieved” by the outcome since it was the most lenient sentence her husband could have received. “It’s almost better knowing,” Katy Cichuniec said. Firefighters and officials from their union have criticized the state’s prosecution of Cichuniec and said it was discouraging firefighters from becoming paramedics, decreasing the number of qualified personnel in emergencies and thereby putting lives at risk. “Convicting Pete for the death is not justice. It’s the very definition of a scapegoat,” said former Aurora Fire Lieutenant John Lauder, who recently retired after working with Cichuniec over two decades. “But for the grace of God, it could be us in jail. The result of this decision will have a negative impact on patient care throughout the nation. Will paramedics now be held be held responsible for outcomes beyond their control?” McClain’s death received little attention initially but gained renewed interest as mass protests swept the nation in 2020, with his name becoming a rallying cry for critics of racial injustice in policing. McClain was stopped by police after a 911 caller reported he looked suspicious walking down the street waving his arms and wearing a face mask on Aug. 24, 2019, in the Denver suburb of Aurora. McClain, who had been listening to music with earbuds, seemed caught off guard when an officer put his hands on him within seconds of approaching him. That began a struggle including a neck hold and a restraint that lasted about 20 minutes before McClain was injected with 500 milligrams of ketamine. He suffered cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital and was taken off life support three days later. Experts testified that the sedative ultimately killed McClain, who was already weakened from struggling to breathe while being pinned down after inhaling vomit into his lungs during the struggle with police. Prosecutors said the paramedics did not conduct basic medical checks of McClain, such as taking his pulse, before giving him the ketamine. The dose was too much for someone of his size — 140 pounds (64 kilograms), experts testified. Prosecutors say they also did not monitor McClain immediately after giving him the sedative but instead left him lying on the ground, making it harder to breathe. The case highlighted gaps in medical procedures for sedations of people in police custody that experts said must be addressed so more deaths can be prevented.

Trump is challenging a groundbreaking decision by the Colorado Supreme Court that said he is disqualified from being president again and ineligible for the state’s primary, which is Tuesday. The resolution of the case on Monday, a day before Super Tuesday contests in 16 states, would remove uncertainty about whether votes for Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, will ultimately count. Both sides had requested fast work by the court, which heard arguments less than a month ago, on Feb. 8, The Colorado court was the first to invoke a post-Civil War constitutional provision aimed at preventing those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. Trump also has since been barred from primary ballot in Illinois and Maine, though both decisions, along with Colorado’s, are on hold pending the outcome of the Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court has until now never ruled on the provision, Section 3 of the 14th amendment. The court indicated Sunday there will be at least one case decided Monday, adhering to its custom of not saying which one. But it also departed from its usual practice in some respects, heightening the expectation that it’s the Trump ballot case that will be handed down. Except for when the end of the term nears in late June, the court almost always issues decisions on days when the justices are scheduled to take the bench. But the next scheduled court day isn’t until March 15. And apart from during the coronavirus pandemic when the court was closed, the justices almost always read summaries of their opinions in the courtroom. They won’t be there Monday.

Separately, the justices last week agreed to hear arguments in late April over whether Trump can be criminally prosecuted on election interference charges, including his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The court’s decision to step into the politically charged case, also with little in the way of precedent to guide it, calls into question whether Trump will stand trial before the November election. The former president faces 91 criminal charges in four prosecutions. Of those, the only one with a trial date that seems poised to hold is his state case in New York, where he’s charged with falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to a porn actor. That case is set for trial on March 25, and the judge has signaled his determination to press ahead.

I’m just scrolling, minding my own business, and just saw a headline that had to do with my own family,” she began her video message on Instagram. “The headline basically says there is no more joy in my husband. Now, I can just tell you, that is far from the truth.” She continued, “Stop scaring people to think that once they get a diagnosis of some kind of neurocognitive disease that ‘That’s it. It’s over. Let’s pack it up. Nothing else to see here, we’re done.’ No. It is the complete opposite of that, okay?” Heming Willis said despite experiencing “grief and sadness,” her family’s “new chapter” is filled with love, connection, joy and happiness. She added: “That’s where we are. So stop with these stupid headlines. These stupid clickbaity things that freak people out. Stop doing that. There’s nothing to see here, okay?”. The British model got married to the “Pulp Fiction” actor in 2009 after two years of dating. The pair share two daughters: Mabel Ray Willis, 11, and Evelyn Penn Willis, 9. He’s also a dad to daughters Rumer Glenn Willis, 35; Scout LaRue Willis, 32; and Tallulah Belle Willis, 30; whom he welcomed with ex-wife Demi Moore. Heming Willis’ more than 925k followers showed support for her in the comments section of her post. “Completely unfair. There is so much joy ❤,” one person wrote. Another said, “THIS!! I often told people that my mom and I lived such a full life with her dementia. It is not the end, it’s a NEW CHAPTER so well said.” “There is JOY!!! Thank you for talking about this. I actively try to push against the tragedy narrative every day,” someone else added. Heming Willis doubled down on her request for the media to be “mindful” of how they report about dementia in the caption of her post. “To whom it may concern, please be mindful how you frame your story’s [sic] to the public about dementia and dig deeper.

And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate cease-fire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table” Harris said Sunday in Selma, Alabama. Harris made her appearance at the Edmund Pettus Bridge for a speech on the anniversary of “Bloody Sunday.” “This will get the hostages out and a significant amount of aid in. This would allow us to build something more enduring to ensure Israel is secure and to respect the right of the Palestinian people to dignity, freedom and self-determination,” she added. Harris’ remarks followed President Joe Biden’s recently watered-down optimism for the 6-week cease-fire, as well as his Friday approval of sending humanitarian aid into Gaza. Earlier this week, a White House official said that the Israelis “have more or less accepted” the cease-fire proposal, which both Israel and Hamas militants would need to agree to. Harris’ push for the cease-fire also comes days after Israel Defense Forces killed more than 100 people and injured more than 750 others who gathered outside of food aid trucks for food. “The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses,” said Harris. “As President Joe Biden said on Friday, the United States is committed to urgently get more lifesaving assistance, to innocent Palestinians in need. Yesterday, the Department of Defense carried out its first airdrop of humanitarian assistance. And the United States will continue these airdrops. And we will work on a new route, by sea, to deliver aid,” she added. The current conflict most recently stems from Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in Israel where the Palestinian militant group killed 1,200 people and took approximately 250 others hostage ― but tensions between Israel and Gaza, as well as Israel’s atrocities against the people in the region, began further back. Since Oct. 7, Israel has killed more than 30,200 people and injured more than 71,000 others in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Many more are facing starvation. “Vice President Harris’s push for a temporary cease-fire, or what the administration used to call a humanitarian pause, is half a step forward,” IfNotNow national spokesperson Eva Borgwardt said in a statement emailed to HuffPost.

A veteran of the football world, Mortensen was a two-time Pulitzer Prize nominee and recipient of the Pro Football Writers of America’s Dick McCann Award. ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro reacted to Mortensen’s passing in a statement on Sunday, saying, “Mort was widely respected as an industry pioneer and universally beloved as a supportive, hardworking teammate.” “He covered the NFL with extraordinary skill and passion, and was at the top of his field for decades,” Pitaro continued. “He will truly be missed by colleagues and fans, and our hearts and thoughts are with his loved ones.” Mortensen got his start as a newspaper reporter and made his first appearance on ESPN in 1991. He sparked the NFL’s 2015 “Deflategate” scandal after reporting that the New England Patriots had surreptitiously used underinflated balls during the AFC championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. In 2016, the Torrance, California, native shared that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer. He announced his retirement from ESPN in a post on X, formerly Twitter, in September last year, writing that he wanted to “focus on my health, family and faith.” He is survived by his wife, Micki Mortensen, and their son, Alex Mortensen.

In a letter sent Friday to Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger, Susan DeCarava, president of NewsGuild of New York, said that union-backed journalists who raised concerns about the paper’s approach to covering Gaza were being “targeted for their national origin, ethnicity and race, creating an ominous chilling-effect across the newsroom and effectively silencing necessary and critical internal discussion.” The Times launched an internal leak probe, which was first reported on by Vanity Fair, after The Intercept published an exposé in January revealing that the newspaper’s flagship podcast, “The Daily,” had canceled a planned episode of a Times investigative report alleging Hamas militants “weaponized sexual violence” when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7. According to the exposé, the episode was shelved after the December report could not pass a fact check and had faced questions of credibility from staff and the public. A Times spokesperson denied the allegation to The Intercept after the exposé’s publication and defended the original reporting in statements to other outlets. In response to the exposé, the Times’ leadership launched a weekslong investigation to find the alleged whistleblower who leaked information to The Intercept. In her letter, DeCarava said that guild members “asserted their protected right to union representation” when they were called into meetings with management’s investigators. “What we have learned about these meetings is shocking,” she wrote. “Rather than simple information-gathering, the meetings became a vehicle for the harassment and intimidation of our members.” NewsGuild president Susan DeCarava sent a letter to NYT publisher A.G. Sulzberger today accusing Times management of targeting journalists “for their national origin, ethnicity and race” in the leak investigation pic.twitter.com/BPb7DlW4xZ According to DeCarava, staff who are part of the company’s Middle Eastern and North African employee resource group experienced “particularly hostile questioning” from Times management, including queries related to their involvement in the group as well as their opinions on the paper’s coverage. Management’s investigators reportedly also ordered those employees to provide the names of all active members in the group and demanded copies of personal communications between colleagues about their concerns related to the paper’s Gaza coverage, according to a separate statement sent Friday to guild members. Some of the employees who were called in for questioning “had no connection to the production of The Daily episode, except for the fact that they raised concerns” to standards editors about the original reporting, according to DeCarava’s letter. “These members went above and beyond to follow company policies in bringing feedback internally to Standards, as The Times encourages its journalists to do,” she wrote. Last week, The Intercept published a follow-up story questioning the credibility of the Times’ sexual violence investigation. The story revealed that the Times hired Anat Schwartz to co-author the December report, despite being an Israeli filmmaker with no journalism experience who was found to have engaged with genocidal anti-Palestinian rhetoric on social media. A Times spokesperson told The Daily Beast that Schwartz’s social media activity was “unacceptable” and being reviewed by the company. The Intercept’s follow-up said that while the Times’ editorial process specifically in the sexual violence report has drawn scrutiny, staffers at the legacy paper have long been concerned over the direction of the Times’ Israel-Hamas coverage. “As a union, we do not tolerate harassment and racial targeting of our members,” DeCarava wrote in her letter. “We demand that The Times cease what has become a destructive and racially targeted witch hunt.” The next four years will change America forever.

(Ahem... The word you were looking for was “himbo,” Mr. Skarsgard.) “We didn’t have to be anything but look cute and be silly,” he added. “There’s only one thing that was asked of us and that was, ‘Have fun because if we don’t have fun, it won’t be a film.’” In the film, Skarsgard played one of three men who might be the father of lead character Sophie, played by Amanda Seyfried.

On Thursday, the country singer showed off her new hairdo on Instagram. “Color my hair, do what I dare! 💅,” Twain captioned the photo of herself sporting wavy rose gold strands. While Twain, 58, has never shied away from switching up her hairstyles — including donning neon red hair at last year’s Grammy ceremony — her fans couldn’t help but react to the star’s most recent change, with some claiming they “don’t even recognize” her. One fan wrote, “This look gives me kardashian vibes,” while another added, “I don’t even recognize you.” Someone else said, “Lovely…but…it doesn’t look like you anymore.” Other fans accused the “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” crooner of secretly going under the knife. “I think ya might have done more than color your hair sis😂. Your looking good!!!” someone commented. Another added, “I wish she would [stop] doing work on her face. So unnecessary!” Many of Twain’s more than 2 million followers stepped in to defend her against the negative comments. “Waiting for all the boomers in the comments “I MISS THE OLD SHAINIA” 🙄 mama looks 🔥🔥🔥,” one person wrote. Another said, “SERIOUS QUESTION!! DOES THIS WOMAN AGE?? 🔥.” Reps for Twain didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Though the Canadian singer-songwriter has not publicly addressed the surgery rumors, she previously ruled out the idea of undergoing cosmetic procedures.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/caitlin-clark-breaks-ncaa-scoring-record-basketball_n_65e4cb6ce4b013678e15b5cd","Iowa Basketball Star Caitlin Clark Breaks NCAA Division I Scoring Record","eric olson","2024-03-03","Caitlin Clark stood alone at the free throw line on Sunday and made the foul shots that left her standing alone atop the all-time NCAA Division I scoring chart. The flash and pizzazz of her game have made her the biggest name in all of college basketball. Yet it was two free throws after a technical foul that pushed Clark past the late Pete Maravich’s 54-year-old record in No. 6 Iowa’s 93-83 win over No. 2 Ohio State. Clark entered the game in Iowa City needing 18 points to pass Maravich’s total of 3,667, amassed in just 83 games over three seasons at LSU (1967-70). She finished with 35 to run her total to 3,685 in 130 games. Maravich’s mark fell four days after Clark broke Lynette Woodard’s major college women’s record with 33 points against Minnesota on Wednesday. Best known for her long 3-pointers, Clark was called on to go to the foul line after Cotie McMahon was assessed a technical for giving her a little push during a dead ball with less than a second to go in the first half. Clark had no immediate reaction after the second shot went through, as if it hadn’t sunk in yet. Asked in a television interview at halftime if she was aware of the record when she stepped to the line, Clark said: “Not really. When they announced it and everybody screamed, that’s when I knew.” Then the celebration was on, with Clark jumping around and pumping her fists in the air. She had gotten off to a slow start Sunday. Her first shot was a 3-pointer that bounced off the rim. She missed a layup and from deep on the right wing before making a 3 from the left side for her first basket. After starting 2 for 7, she made 3 of her next 4 shots — including three straight 3s, each deeper than the previous. Woodard was among the attendees at Carver-Hawkeye Arena to help Clark celebrate senior day. Also on hand were basketball great Maya Moore, who was Clark’s favorite player, and Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan. “It’s a great time for women’s basketball,” Woodard said in a television interview. “Caitlin is leading the way. As she was chipping away, I said records are made to be broken. Also, they’re made to be honored. Because of her, my records are being honored. She’s gone beyond that now, she’s gone beyond Pete ... I passed her the baton to go ahead and burst through that ceiling, and I’m so happy for her.” On Thursday, Clark announced she would enter the 2024 WNBA draft and skip the fifth year of eligibility available to athletes who competed during the COVID-19 pandemic. She is projected to be the No. 1 overall pick by the Indiana Fever, and the WNBA already is seeing a rise in ticket sales. Logitix, which researches prices on ticket resale platforms, reported an average sale price of $598 for a ticket to Sunday’s game purchased since Feb. 1. Kiran Nanjappa, who was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and now lives in Denver, said he paid more than $200 for his ticket. “She’s a truly once-in-a-lifetime player,” he said. “I’ve been watching Iowa basketball for 40 years, and I’ve never seen a player like her, men’s or women’s. I’ll just say this — I paid more to see her today than I paid to see Michael Jordan three times at the end of his career. And I never thought I’d say that.” Clark is all but assured of one or two more appearances at the arena in Iowa City. Iowa is projected to be a No. 2 seed for the NCAA Tournament, meaning it would be at home for the first two rounds. Pearl Moore of Francis Marion owns the overall women’s record with 4,061 points from 1975-79 at the small-college level in the AIAW. Moore had 177 points at Anderson Junior College before enrolling at Francis Marion. Clark is 376 points behind Moore, and she has only two to nine more games left in an Iowa uniform depending on how far the Hawkeyes advance in the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments. The fall of Maravich’s record is subject to scrutiny. Maravich’s all-time scoring mark is one of the more remarkable in sports history. There was no shot clock or 3-point line in his era. The 3-point line was adopted in 1986. Maravich averaged 44.2 points per game. He scored more than 60 in a game four times, topping out at 69 against Alabama on Feb. 7, 1970. Clark averages 28.3 points for her career. Her career-best output was 49 points against Michigan on Feb. 15, when she passed Kelsey Plum as the NCAA women’s Division I career scoring leader. Clark has 55 games with at least 30 points, the most of any player in men’s or women’s college basketball over the last 25 years. She has six triple-doubles this season and 17 in her career.

In an interview with People published Saturday, Asghari insisted that he’s not down to “talk badly about each other” post-divorce, despite being the one who ended his and Spears’ relationship. “I’ve always hated people leaving a certain relationship — and at some point they told each other they love each other and they sat at the same table and ate food [together] — so I never understood when people part ways [and] they talk badly about each other,” he said. “That’s something I’m never going to do because I had nothing but an amazing experience and a great life, and that’s always going to be part of my life, a chapter of my life,” he continued. The actor went on to call his former ties to the pop star a “blessing.” “It was a blessing to be able to share life with someone for a long time. And people grow apart and people move on,” Asghari said. Reps for Spears didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Asghari and Spears first started dating in 2016 after he appeared in the music video for her song, “Slumber Party.” The model tied the knot with the “Toxic” singer in June 2022. They ended their marriage 14 months later, after Asghari filed for divorce from Spears in August last year, citing “irreconcilable differences.” In Spears’ bombshell memoir, “The Woman in Me,” which she finished writing before Asghari filed for divorce, she called him a “gift from God.” After news broke of the pair’s divorce, the Grammy-winning artist revealed she was “shocked” by the split on social media.

An Israeli Strike Killed Them Both.","wafaa shurafa , samy magdy","2024-03-03","RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — It took 10 years and three rounds of in vitro fertilization for Rania Abu Anza to become pregnant, and only seconds for her to lose her five-month-old twins, a boy and a girl. An Israeli strike hit the home of her extended family in the southern Gaza city of Rafah late Saturday, killing her children, her husband and 11 other relatives and leaving another nine missing under the rubble, according to survivors and local health officials. She had woken up at around 10 p.m. to breastfeed Naeim, the boy, and went back to sleep with him in one arm and Wissam, the girl, in the other. Her husband was sleeping beside them. The explosion came an hour and a half later. The house collapsed. “I screamed for my children and my husband,” she said Sunday, as she sobbed and cradled a baby’s blanket to her chest. “They were all dead. Their father took them and left me behind.” She closed her eyes, leaned her head against the wall and patted the bundle in a calming gesture that, finally, she’d had the chance to give. (GRAPHIC PHOTO BELOW: Image depicts death) Israeli airstrikes have regularly hit crowded family homes since the start of the war in Gaza, even in Rafah, which Israel declared a safe zone in October but is now the next target of its devastating ground offensive. The strikes often come without warning, usually in the middle of the night. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on the Hamas militant group because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in dense residential areas. But the military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The military did not immediately comment on this strike. Of the 14 people killed in the Abu Anza house, six were children and four were women, according to Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the hospital where the bodies were taken. In addition to her husband and children, Rania also lost a sister, a nephew, a pregnant cousin and other relatives. Farouq Abu Anza, a relative, said about 35 people were staying at the house, some of whom had been displaced from other areas. He said they were all civilians, mostly children, and that there were no militants among them. Rania and her husband, Wissam, both 29, spent a decade trying to get pregnant. Two rounds of IVF had failed, but after a third, she learned she was pregnant early last year. The twins were born on Oct. 13. Her husband, a day laborer, was so proud he insisted on naming the girl after himself, she said. “I didn’t get enough of them,” she said. “I swear I didn’t get enough of them.” Less than a week earlier, Hamas-led militants had stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack, rampaging through communities, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and taking around 250 hostages, including children and a newborn. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. The war has killed over 30,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Around 80% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled their homes, and a quarter of the population faces starvation. The ministry said last month that more than 12,300 Palestinian children and young teens had been killed in the war, about 43% of the overall toll. Women and children together make up three quarters of those killed. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its tallies. Israel claims to have killed over 10,000 Hamas fighters but has not provided evidence. For the children who survive, the war has made life hellish, humanitarian workers say, with some in northern Gaza beyond the reach of care. “The sense of helplessness and despair among parents and doctors in realizing that lifesaving aid, just a few kilometers away, is being kept out of reach, must be unbearable, but worse still are the anguished cries of those babies slowly perishing under the world’s gaze,” UNICEF regional director Adele Khodr said in a statement Sunday. Until Saturday, the Abu Anza family had been relatively fortunate. Rafah has been spared the immense destruction of northern Gaza and the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israeli tanks and ground troops have fought militants block by block after waves of airstrikes. Rafah is also in the shrinking area of Gaza where humanitarian aid can still be delivered. But Israel has said Rafah will be next, and the roughly 1.5 million people who have sought refuge there will be relocated, without saying where. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-bloody-sunday-march_n_65e49b66e4b0d2a24759c0f9","Kamala Harris To Join In Marking 59th Anniversary Of Bloody Sunday","associated press","2024-03-03","SELMA, Ala. (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to be among those marking the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the day Alabama law officers attacked Civil Rights demonstrators on the iconic Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The demonstrators were beaten by officers as they tried to march across Alabama on March 7, 1965, in support of voting rights. A march across the bridge, which is a highlight of the commemoration in Selma every year, is planned for Sunday afternoon. Sunday’s march is among dozens of events during the annual Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee, which began Thursday and culminates Sunday. The events commemorate Bloody Sunday and the signing of the Voting Rights Act. “During her speech, the Vice President will honor the legacy of the civil rights movement, address the ongoing work to achieve justice for all, and encourage Americans to continue the fight for fundamental freedoms that are under attack throughout the country,” the White House said in announcing her visit. Harris joined the march in 2022, calling the site hallowed ground and giving a speech calling on Congress to defend democracy by protecting people’s right to vote. On that anniversary, Harris spoke of marchers whose “peaceful protest was met with crushing violence.” “They were kneeling when the state troopers charged,” she said then. “They were praying when the billy clubs struck.” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland was also expected to participate in Sunday’s events, the Department of Justice announced. Images of the violence at the bridge stunned Americans, which helped galvanize support for passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The law struck down barriers prohibiting Black people from voting. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, a Democrat of South Carolina who is leading a pilgrimage to Selma, said he is seeking to “remind people that we are celebrating an event that started this country on a better road toward a more perfect union,” but the right to vote is still not guaranteed. Clyburn sees Selma as the nexus of the 1960s movement for voting rights, at a time when there currently are efforts to scale back those rights. “The Voting Rights Act of 1965 became a reality in August of 1965 because of what happened on March 7th of 1965,” Clyburn said. “We are at an inflection point in this country,” he added. “And hopefully this year’s march will allow people to take stock of where we are.” Clyburn said he hopes the weekend in Alabama would bring energy and unity to the civil rights movement, as well as benefit the city of Selma. “We need to do something to develop the waterfront, we need to do something that bring the industry back to Selma,” Clyburn said. “We got to do something to make up for them having lost that military installation down there that provided all the jobs. All that goes away, there’s nothing to keep young people engaged in developing their communities.” ___ Associated Press reporters Stephen Groves in Washington, D.C., and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.

Can You Help Me Find Them Using These Clues?","kathryn sheldon","2024-03-03","If there’s one thing a cold, gray, post-holiday January in New York City demands, it’s an escape to a warmer climate (should you be lucky enough to be able to afford it and make it work). After close to 20 years in the city, I’d never been to Puerto Rico — even though it’s just a few hours away by plane — and neither had my boyfriend, Alex, so we decided on San Juan for our first vacation together. On January 8, we took a walk along the Paseo del Morro. It’s a scenic and historic path along the walls of Old San Juan, offering incredible views of the seaside and encounters with the many cats that hide from the sun among the rocks along the water. The path eventually leads up to the Castillo San Felipe del Morro, a large fortress constructed between 1539 and 1790. Desperate to find some relief from the near 90-degree heat, we stopped at the top of a grassy hill overlooking the Atlantic Ocean to let the breeze cool us off. I’m a photographer by trade, and when I travel, I like to use film, so on this particular trip I had only brought my grandmother’s old Pentax K1000. Using film instead of digital is a way for me to slow down, pay attention to what I’m seeing and take the pressure off the need to shoot a high volume of images. I had just brought my camera up to my face to shoot a large ship that was passing by when Alex noticed two people standing at the end of the pier far below us. “Are those people getting engaged? They’re getting engaged!” he said, pointing. I snapped maybe six or eight images in a row as he recorded the moment on his phone. We looked around to see if anyone else was witnessing this serendipitous occasion, but we were the only ones. We let the couple take their time, not wanting to impose on such an intimate moment. When the proposal appeared to be done, we made our way over to them, introduced ourselves, and I told them I had captured their engagement with my camera. They were delighted, so I asked for one of their emails and told them I would send the photos after they’d been developed. I wasn’t entirely sure if the images would even come out, as we had been a fair distance away and my light meter had stopped working, but I assured them if I had gotten anything good, I’d be in touch. We chatted a bit longer and then we congratulated the couple again and parted ways. As Alex and I continued walking, we remarked how thrilling it was to have just witnessed this random couple’s proposal. It made me wonder exactly what it was about seeing two strangers get engaged that felt so exciting. We didn’t have any investment in their lives — knew hardly anything about them, and likely never would. Regardless, it was an incredibly significant moment for them, and to see something that rare and meaningful and unexpected happen right in front of us felt a bit like seeing a shooting star. Extraordinary moments like these feel like a gift, especially in a world where so much is currently going wrong. Seeing two people making a commitment to each other — whatever that looks like for them and however they choose to honor it going forward — is a beautiful thing. It felt like I had been given a little reminder from the universe that despite how bad things can seem, love is real and we should do whatever we can to encourage and respect and celebrate it. Alex and I returned back to New York City and last week, almost two months after our trip, I finally got my film back. Not only did the images of the engagement turn out, but I had one of every part of the proposal: getting down on one knee, their embrace after, all of it. Although the couple was far from where I was shooting, their beautiful experience was perfectly documented in my photos. I couldn’t wait to share what I’d shot with the couple. I opened up my Notes app on my phone to retrieve the email they had given me but it wasn’t there. Somehow their contact info had gotten deleted. I was devastated. “What do we do now?” I asked Alex. We weren’t sure. How could we find two strangers with only a scant amount of information? We didn’t know, but we wanted to try. So... this is us trying. Maybe someone reading this essay might know this couple and can help me get in touch with them so I can share my photos of their special day. Here’s what we know: The couple (we believe they were two women but we didn’t ask about their gender identities, so we can’t be sure) got engaged on the afternoon of January 8, 2024 at the Castillo San Felipe del Morro in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. I think they were from Baltimore, or, if not, somewhere else in the Maryland or D.C. area. One of them was named Melissa. I feel lucky to have been in the right place at the right time to witness this couple’s proposal and I’m hoping a little more luck — and a bit of help from one of you — might finally get my photos to them. If you know these individuals (or you’re the couple featured in the photos), email Noah.Michelson@HuffPost.com and we’ll get you in touch with Kathryn.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pakistan-new-prime-minister-shehbaz-sharif_n_65e4771be4b013678e15a6b7","Shehbaz Sharif Becomes Pakistan's New Prime Minister","munir ahmed","2024-03-03","ISLAMABAD (AP) — Lawmakers in Pakistan’s National Assembly on Sunday elected Shehbaz Sharif as the country’s new prime minister for the second time as allies of imprisoned former premier Imran Khan in parliament shouted in protest, alleging rigging in last month’s election. Khan is currently serving prison terms in multiple cases and has been barred from seeking or holding office. Sharif replaced him as prime minister after his ouster in a no-confidence vote in parliament in April 2022. Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said Sharif secured 201 votes, defeating Omar Ayub of the Sunni Ittehad Council who got 92 votes. The winner only needs 169 votes to get a majority. Ayub was backed by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI, whose candidates could not get enough seats to form a government on their own. The PTI refused to hold talks with its rivals to form a coalition. Following days of negotiations, Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party and his supporters formed an alliance after the Feb. 8 election, which was overshadowed by militant violence, a nationwide mobile phone shutdown, Khan’s exclusion from the vote, and an unusual delay in announcing the result. Authorities said cutting communications was necessary to avoid attacks on candidates and security forces. However, the delay drew criticism from Khan’s party, which insists the vote was rigged to stop it from getting a majority. The party claims it has evidence that its victory “was stolen during the vote count,” a charge the Election Commission denies. Sharif, in his acceptance speech in parliament Sunday, said: “We were subjected to political victimization in the past but never took any revenge.” Without naming Khan, he said the previous ruler jailed many political rivals, including himself and his ally Asif Ali Zardari. He also accused Khan’s supporters of attacking military installations while protesting his ouster in 2022, adding that now parliament and the courts would decide whether those involved in attacking the military installations deserved a pardon. Holding portraits of Khan, some lawmakers stood in front of Sharif when he began his speech, shouting “vote thief” and “shame.” Sharif denounced their actions, saying they were causing chaos in parliament. He also said they should present their evidence of vote rigging to the relevant authorities. Sharif then addressed the opposition saying, “I am offering you reconciliation. Let us sit together to work for the betterment of Pakistan.” But he was greeted with more protests and shouts. The premier also spoke of repairing ties with the United States. Relations between the two countries have been strained after Khan accused the U.S., Sharif and the Pakistani military of conspiring to keep him out of office, following his ouster. Sharif also said his biggest challenge was the economic situation as Pakistan has been relying on foreign loans to run the economy. His government faces multiple issues, including how to respond to a surge in militant attacks, improve relations with the neighboring, Taliban-run Afghanistan, repair crumbling infrastructure, and resolve year-round power outages. It must also maintain political stability as Khan’s party has vowed to continue protests against the alleged vote-rigging. After losing to Sharif, Ayub addressed the parliament, commending “my leader” Khan for his “bravery” while facing the cases against him. He denounced the arrest of “thousands of Khan’s supporters” last year after they took to the streets following his ouster. Ayub repeated the allegations of vote rigging and demanded a probe into last month’s poll. He said PTI votes were tampered with and “votes were stolen” to stop Khan’s party from forming a government. He said Sharif can rule the country but “he cannot win hearts and minds because he came to power through a rigged vote.” Last week, Khan wrote a letter to the International Monetary Fund, urging it to link any talks with Islamabad to an audit of February’s election. Khan’s move, which Sharif criticized in his speech, comes days before the IMF releases a key installment of a bailout loan to Pakistan. Pakistan has been relying on bailouts to prop up its foreign exchange reserves and avoid default, with the IMF and wealthy allies like China and Saudi Arabia financing the country to the tune of billions of dollars. Under his previous term as prime minister, Sharif had to struggle for months to get a $3 billion bailout from the IMF. The new prime minister has said he will seek a new IMF bailout after the end of March when the current one expires. The next four years will change America forever.

Her name is Carbon Monoxide. “But you can call me C. Mo,” she introduces herself in a Bravo-style title card. “As in see mo’ life-threatening health problems.” She’s just one of the noxious cast members on “Hot and Toxic,” a fictional parody invented as part of a new environmental campaign against using natural gas for cooking and heating. The setup is darkly funny. An unsuspecting homeowner moves into the house of her dreams, only to discover the place comes with an intolerable group of unexpected roommates whose astrological signs match the pathological outcome of being around them for too long. “I don’t know, bro,” laments the guitar-strumming jock named after the chemical Benzene. “I guess it’s because I’m a Cancer and I… also cause it.” Another cast member interjects. “Shut up!” she says. “My sign is Cancer.” Amid a collective epiphany, the group says in unison: “We’re all Cancer!” It’s the latest advertisement from the advocacy group Gas Leaks, which makes creative videos aimed at promoting the shift away from fossil fuels. Gas Leaks first shared the new video with HuffPost. The organization ― which is a sponsored project of the Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, through which the billionaire family funnels millions from its 19th century oil fortune into nonprofits calling for the phase out of fossil fuels ― made a splash in October with an ad depicting gas appliances as Halloween horror movie monsters. Now Gas Leaks says it will spend $1 million to promote the video in markets like California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York, where more than half of households use gas for cooking. ″$1 million is a lot for the climate movement, but it’s pennies for the fossil fuel industry,” said James Hadgis, a filmmaker and Gas Leaks’ executive director. “Right now people are overwhelmed by information, there’s so much misinformation and disinformation,” he added. “We thought leaning into comedy is a way to both make people laugh and reveal truth, and send people the message that there’s nothing ‘natural’ about natural gas.” The natural gas that burns blue on stovetops emits tiny particles of nitrogen dioxide, which irritates the respiratory system, and contributes to asthma and cancer-causing pollutants such as benzene. While Consumer Reports found that ventilation helps, reviewers concluded the best way to minimize exposure to dangerous pollutants was to switch to an electric stove. Nearly 70% of American homes already use electric appliances for cooking, federal statistics show. But less than 5% of electric ranges sold in the U.S. use the induction technology touted by chefs as preferable to gas. Cooking with gas generates roughly 0.1% of total U.S. emissions each year, according to an analysis of federal data by the University of California, Davis. But gas stoves leak roughly 1% of the gas they use as unburned methane, a powerful heat-trapping gas. At this rate, yearly leaks from all natural gas stoves in the U.S. take an equivalent toll on the climate as the annual carbon dioxide emissions from 500,000 passenger vehicles, according to a recent peer-reviewed study from researchers at Stanford University and the laboratory PSE Healthy Energy. Gas used for heating, meanwhile, generates between six and 16 times as much planet-heating pollution, and the same pipeline network that feeds furnaces supplies stovetops. Advocates looking for ways to make slashing planet-heating emissions a more visceral concern have played up gas appliances’ toxic air pollutants as a way to increase public support for regulations restricting fossil fuel use.

It can be hard to convince my 4- and 2.5-year-old kids to engage with the tub, so I often resort to gimmicks to make it seem like more of a treat. (Sometimes, these ploys backfire. See: the gorgeous Japanese bath crayons that work a little too well for everyday use and had me scrubbing the sides of my tub with a little more elbow grease than usual.) So naturally, when I was at a local pharmacy with my kids a few weeks ago and the girls spotted a large display of colorful oversized bath bombs, I didn’t think twice about getting them. They were cute and inexpensive, and I appreciated that the jumbo, individually-packaged bombs contained a small treasure (which turned out to be things like necklace charms) — something that I suspected would entice the kids into sitting down and letting me wash their hair or scrub food off their faces without screaming. Turns out I was right. After we did one bomb-accompanied bath time, it was obvious that I’d need to be keeping more on hand for emergencies, tantrums and special occasions, so I hit the internet in search of the ones I’d purchased locally and happily found a treasure trove of them at Target. The bath bombs in question were from Da Bomb, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company that was founded in 2011 by two preteen sisters, ages 10 and 11 at the time, who loved using bath bombs but were disappointed when the bombs had dissolved, so they made sure to include a surprise in each one. Now, the sisters are in college and their wares can be found a host of major retailers. Target offers the affordable tchochkes in a variety of sizes and themes, including ones aimed towards fans of franchises like Spiderman, Barbie and Hot Wheels. There are also some tropically-influenced options and small variety packs that are perfect for moms like myself who are interested in having a bulk stash on hand. Reviews vary, but most of the ones I scoped out on Target had at least 4 stars and glowing reviews numbering in the hundreds. Take a look at what some reviewers had to say about these magical little orbs, or just scroll down to add several to your cart to keep in your bath time arsenal. “I got this for Christmas and the fragrance was amazing. I could smell it in the hallway when I was running my bath. It made the bath yellow which looked like pee. But I loved it, the surprise is great, just wanting to figure out where to enter the code on the surprise inside.” — DT76 “This was in my daughter’s stocking and she loved it. I liked the smell, but not sure what the scent was. I did think that it would change color as it fizzed, but it was really just yellow. It has a colorful plastic heart in the middle which my daughter loved, and she was asking for more bath bombs the next day.” — Katie “My kids love these & they smell good” — JessicaK By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. We love a good coffee shop drink, and enjoy the sweet flavors, latte art and silky foam of a barista-made espresso drink. If you’re looking to level up your at-home coffee game, the good news is you don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars on fancy coffee equipment. If you want to froth up milk for a cappuccino or a latte at home, all you need is an electric whisk — and Walmart has one for less than $13. The Zulay Kitchen milk frother turns milk and cream into foam for coffee and tea drinks. It can also be used to prepare matcha tea (by whisking matcha powder into water), make egg white foam for cocktails and so much more. It’s available in a rainbow of colors, and pricing varies by color; the cheapest option at the moment is a hot pink iteration for $10.99; the most expensive is an all-black version for $24.99. It comes with a simple stand to prop it up on your counter when you’re not using it, but it’s also compact enough to go in a drawer for storage. To clean it, simply dip the stainless steel whisk head into hot, soapy water and rise. With more than 500 5-star reviews, it’s safe to say this milk frother has some fans. Reviewer PioneerWomanfan commented that they use it every day to make their coffee feel special. Reviewer Blackbarbie04 wrote it’s comfortable to hold, lightweight and has a lot of power. And reviewer Lola, who bought the milk frother because it was on sale and wasn’t sure what to expect, was pleasantly surprised. “This milk frother has a lot of power for a little gadget and worked great the first time I used it.” The manufacturer claims that the frother achieves a speed of 12,500 rotations per minute and can make foam in seconds. “It made the foamiest foam I have ever seen,” wrote reviewer aritipbia. “Within like 15-20 seconds.” Pick up the Zulay Kitchen milk frother at Walmart. It requires two AA batteries to work (which aren’t included), so you’ll also want to pick some up if you don’t have any.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lebron-james-40000-career-points_n_65e428e2e4b013678e1599f6","LeBron James Makes NBA History By Extending Career Scoring Record","dan greenspan","2024-03-03","LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James reached 40,000 points Saturday night, still going strong in his 21st NBA season as he tries to put the career scoring record out of reach. James drove past Michael Porter Jr. and hit a layup with 10:39 left in the second quarter of the Los Angeles Lakers’ 124-114 loss to the Denver Nuggets for the historic basket. “Being the first player to do something, it’s pretty cool in this league, just knowing the history, the greats that’s come through the league, and then you see some of the greats on the floor tonight, it was great to compete,” James said. “But for me, the main thing, as always, is to win, and I hated that it had to happen in a defeat.” LeBron James scores the bucket to become the first player in league history to score 40,000 career points 👑DEN-LAL Live on ABC pic.twitter.com/I84Xd5hiWf James did it in 1,475 regular-season games, reaching double-digit points in each of the last 1,205 of them. He has largely avoided major injuries in that time, while also playing another 3 1/2 seasons worth of games in the playoffs en route to four titles in 10 NBA Finals appearances, all with unfathomable pressure placed on him to be the next transcendent player before ever stepping on the court as a professional. “For the first time in a long time, I’ve seen the commercial that was played before my first game,” James said. “I think they mentioned all the greats to ever play the game of basketball, like Big O and Michael and Kareem and Kobe, and forgot who all else was in that commercial. And then it was like, ‘the next one, LeBron James.’ “I didn’t see that commercial when it happened, but when I was watching it today, I was like what the hell? That expectation on an 18-year-old kid like that, that was insane to think about.” Even with those expectations, James put in the work and has now accomplished something that seemed impossible. James’ relentless march saw him pass the previous record of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 38,387 points on Feb. 7, 2023 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. All that scoring happened without James’ necessarily wanting that to be his trademark. He is fourth in career assists with 10,847, picking up another nine against Denver, and his average of 7.35 per game ranks in the top 25. Nuggets coach Michael Malone, who spent five seasons with James as an assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2005-2010, saw an early dedication from James in all areas. It was already a priority for James to keep himself in peak physical condition, even if the run to the scoring title was an unforeseen outcome back them. “I remember being in Cleveland, him being in the weight room with our weight and strength coaches, and there’s no way he’s doing what he’s doing at this stage of his career if he is not putting a ton of time into his body, his diet, his sleep, all those things that really matter,” Malone said before the game. James’ combination of longevity and sustained excellence is what makes it entirely likely he could be the only player to ever reach 40,000 points. To put the feat in perspective, Nuggets center Nikola Jokic will need to average 25 points over his next 1,057 appearances to join James at 40,000 points. That would be nearly 13 full seasons without injuries or any other unforeseen circumstance, all the way past age 41 without a drop in production for the two-time MVP. Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic seems like the most reasonable candidate to make a serious push, as his career average of 28.51 points per game is third in league history behind Michael Jordan (30.12) and Wilt Chamberlain (30.07). But Doncic will need to keep it up for 1,022 more games to match James, a timeline pushing into the 2036-37 season barring interruption. “There’s just certain things that you just don’t think that’s going to happen,” James said. “I guess for years people said Kareem’s record wouldn’t be broken. I was able to eclipse it. But like I said, you have to have some really good luck, you have to play the game at a high level for a long time, and then we see.” As to whether James might ever take up residence in the 50,000-point club, a conservative estimate of 25 points per game from here on out — essentially matching what he has been producing in his 21st professional campaign at 39-years-old — while playing 55 outings each coming season would put him at the doorstep in 2031-32. Malone wouldn’t rule it out. “Really, when you take a step back, you just have to marvel at the longevity. But he’s just not playing at this. He is playing effectively,” Malone said. “I’m sure for him, that’ll be his decision down the road probably in five, six years. ‘Am I still playing effectively?’ And he is.” If anyone would even dare to make a charge at the impossible, it could only be King James. “I come to work and prepare and prep, mentally, physically, spiritually every single night when it’s time to play, and I just try to go out and contribute,” he said. “Been able to do it for 20-plus years, including this year. When I come on the floor and feel pretty good, I feel I can make plays. The next four years will change America forever.

Jost remarked that Trump looks “good behind bars” as another picture flashed onscreen of him behind fencing during his border stop in Eagle Pass, Texas. The “SNL” star went on to mock Trump over what Jost called a “pretty harsh” message for migrants before playing a video of the GOP presidential front-runner waving and pumping his fist at people on the Mexico side of the border. “They like Trump, can you believe it?” Trump said as he waved to the group. “No, I can’t believe it,” Jost said in response to the clip. “The migrants don’t like you, they just walked a thousand miles to get to the edge of this river, and they’re probably thinking, ‘Is that weirdo in a Trump costume waving us into the country?’” You can check out more of “Weekend Update” in the clips below.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-immigration-comments-biden_n_65e3bcc7e4b0d2a24759a980","Trump Escalates Immigration Rhetoric, Claims Biden Is Trying To 'Overthrow' The U.S.","bill barrow , jill colvin","2024-03-02","GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) — Former President Donald Trump on Saturday further escalated his immigration rhetoric and baselessly accused President Joe Biden of waging a “conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America” as he campaigned ahead of Super Tuesday’s primaries. Trump has a long history of trying to turn attack lines back on his rivals in an attempt to diminish their impact. Biden has cast Trump as a threat to democracy, pointing to the former president’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Those efforts culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as his supporters tried to halt the peaceful transition of power. Trump, who has responded by calling Biden “the real threat to democracy” and alleged without proof that Biden is responsible for the indictments he faces, turned to Biden’s border policies on Saturday, charging that “every day Joe Biden is giving aid and comfort to foreign enemies of the United States.” “Biden’s conduct on our border is by any definition a conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America,” he went on to say in Greensboro, North Carolina. “Biden and his accomplices want to collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters and establish a new base of power that gives them control for generations.” Similar arguments have long been made by people who allege Democrats are promoting illegal immigration to weaken the power of white voters — part of a racist conspiracy, once confined to the far right, claiming there is an intentional push by the U.S. liberal establishment to systematically diminish the influence of white people. Trump leaned into the theory again at his rally later in Virginia, saying of the migrants: “They’re trying to sign them up to get them to vote in the next election.” “Once again Trump is projecting in an attempt to distract the American people from the fact he killed the fairest and toughest border security bill in decades because he believed it would help his campaign. Sad,” Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement. Trump’s campaign stops came three days before Super Tuesday, with elections in 16 states, including North Carolina and Virginia, where thousands of enthusiastic supporters gathered for an evening rally in downtown Richmond. The primaries will be the largest day of voting of the year ahead of November’s general election, which is shaping up as a likely rematch of 2020 between Trump and Biden. Nikki Haley, Trump’s last major rival, also campaigned in North Carolina. Speaking to reporters after her event in Raleigh, about 80 miles away, the former U.N. ambassador demurred on her plans after Super Tuesday. “We’re going to keep going and we’re going to keep pushing,” she said, arguing a majority of Americans don’t want either Biden or Trump as the nation’s leader. Much of Trump’s speech in North Carolina focused on the slew of criminal charges he faces. While the former president has successfully harnessed his legal woes into a powerful rallying cry in the primaries, it is unclear how his message of grievance will resonate with the more moderate voters who will likely decide the general election. “I stand before you today not only as your past and hopefully future president, but as a proud political dissident and a public enemy of a rogue regime,” Trump said, railing against what he called an “anti-Democratic machine.” At both rallies, Trump played a recording of “Justice for All,” the version of the Star-Spangled Banner that he collaborated on with a group of defendants jailed over their alleged roles in the January 2021 insurrection, whom he refers to as “hostages.” As he focuses on the general election, Trump has painted an apocalyptic vision of the country under Biden, particularly on the topic of immigration, which was the animating issue of his 2016 campaign and which he has once again seized on as the U.S. has experienced a record influx of migrants at the border. Trump and Biden both visited the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday to highlight their contrasting approaches to the issue. On Saturday, Trump conjured images of Biden turning “public schools into migrant camps” and “the USA into a crime-ridden, disease-ridden dumping ground, which is what they’re doing.” He also spoke at length about the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student whose alleged killer is a Venezuelan man who entered the U.S. illegally and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case. Studies have found native-born U.S. residents are more likely to have been arrested for violent crimes than people in the country illegally, but Trump has seized on several high-profile incidents, including a recent video of a group of migrants brawling with police in Times Square. “Not one more innocent American life should be lost to migrant crime,” Trump said. Trump, who repeatedly attacks Biden’s intelligence and mental acuity, has been sensitive to questions of his own sharpness after he’s mixed up Haley with Nancy Pelosi and Biden with former President Barack Obama at past rallies. Trump has lately sought to inoculate any questions by insisting he interchanges the names intentionally. “I do that because you know that makes a point. Do we understand that, right? Because a lot of people say he’s running the country. I don’t personally think so,” Trump said early into his appearance in Virginia. But more than an hour in to his free-flowing remarks, he seemed to mix up Obama and Biden again, when he said “Putin, you know, has so little respect for Obama that he’s starting to throw around the ‘nuclear’ word.” Beyond their importance on Super Tuesday, North Carolina and Virginia are both states the Trump campaign is focused on for November. Trump won North Carolina twice but watched his margin of victory shrink. Biden’s reelection campaign already has staff on the ground hoping to flip the state for the first time since 2008. Virginia, meanwhile, had once been a swing state but for years has trended blue and Trump lost there twice. But a Trump campaign senior adviser told reporters Saturday that he believes “we could make Virginia competitive.” In North Carolina, a festive atmosphere surrounded the Greensboro Coliseum Complex ahead of Trump’s rally. Supporters stood in a line that snaked through a web of metal barricades and extended hundreds of yards from the arena. License plates from North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee filled the parking lot, where Trump flags flew alongside U.S. and Confederate flags on many vehicles. “We just love Trump,” said, Mary Welborn, who lives in nearby Thomasville and expressed that she was frustrated by the criminal prosecutions and civil judgments against the former president. “The way he’s being treated is insane. No other president has been treated this way,” she said. In Richmond, supporters started lining up Saturday morning for an evening rally at a downtown convention center. The entry lines stretched several blocks by mid-afternoon. Ken Ballos, a retired police officer from nearby Hanover County who said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said he was eager at the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-texas-migrants-arrest_n_65e65f3de4b013678e165cc9","Supreme Court Temporarily Blocks Texas Law That Allows Police To Arrest Migrants","acacia coronado , lindsay whitehurst","2024-03-04","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas’ plan to arrest migrants who enter the U.S. illegally is headed to the Supreme Court in a legal showdown over the federal government’s authority over immigration. The high court on Monday blocked Texas’ immigration law from going into effect until March 13 and asked the state to respond by March 11. The law was set to take effect Saturday, and the court’s decision came just hours after the Justice Department asked it to intervene. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the law in December and for months has unveiled a series of escalating measures on the border that have tested the boundaries of how far a state can go keep migrants from entering the country. The law would allow state officers to arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally. People who are arrested could then agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the country or face a misdemeanor charge for entering the U.S. illegally. Migrants who don’t leave after being ordered to do so could be arrested again and charged with a more serious felony. The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that the law would profoundly alter “the status quo that has existed between the United States and the States in the context of immigration for almost 150 years.” It went on to argue that the law would have “significant and immediate adverse effects” on the country’s relationship with Mexico and “create chaos” in enforcing federal immigration laws in Texas. The federal government cited a 2012 Supreme Court ruling on an Arizona law that would have allowed police to arrest people for federal immigration violations, often referred to by opponents as the “show me your papers” bill. The divided high court found that the impasse in Washington over immigration reform did not justify state intrusion. In a statement Monday, the Texas Attorney General’s Office said the state’s law mirrored federal law and “was adopted to address the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which hurts Texans more than anyone else.” The federal government’s emergency request to the Supreme Court came after a federal appeals court over the weekend stayed U.S. District Judge David Ezra’s sweeping rejection of the law. In a 114-page ruling Thursday, Ezra rebuked Texas’ immigration enforcement and brushed off claims by Republicans about an ongoing “invasion” along the southern border due to record-high illegal crossings. Ezra added that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, conflicts with federal immigration law and could get in the way of U.S. foreign relations and treaty obligations. According to Ezra’s ruling, allowing Texas to supersede federal law due to an “invasion” would “amount to nullification of federal law and authority — a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War.” Republicans who back the law have said it would not target immigrants already living in the U.S. because the two-year statute of limitations on the illegal entry charge would be enforced only along the state’s border with Mexico. Texas has been arresting migrants for years under a different program that is based on criminal trespass arrests. Though Ezra said some might sympathize with Texas officials’ concerns about immigration enforcement by the federal government, he said that was not enough to excuse a violation of the U.S. Constitution. The battle over the Texas immigration law, known as Senate Bill 4, is one of multiple legal disputes between Texas officials and the Biden administration over how far the state can go to patrol the Texas-Mexico border and prevent illegal border crossings. Several Republican governors have backed Abbott’s efforts, saying the federal government is not doing enough to enforce existing immigration laws. The next four years will change America forever.

The six-week investigation, which began after a Boeing 737 Max 9 lost a door panel during a flight in January, found issues with Boeing’s “manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control,” the FAA said in a news release, which didn’t offer more detail. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker addressed the audit’s findings with Boeing’s CEO and other senior leaders in a meeting last week and gave the company 90 days to outline a plan of action, the FAA said. Boeing also must review and address a report released last week by a panel of outside experts that examined safety culture within the company dating back to two 737 Max 8 crashes in 2018 and 2019. To hold Boeing accountable, the FAA said, it has halted the expanded production of the Boeing 737 Max, whose fuselage is built by Spirit AeroSystems. It is also exploring the use of an independent third party to review Boeing’s quality systems. It will also continue to physically monitor Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems’ work with FAA representatives at Boeing facilities in Washington state and Spirit AeroSystems in Kansas. A spokesperson for Boeing told HuffPost on Monday that its president and chief executive officer, Dave Calhoun, had expressed optimism about the road ahead following his meeting with the FAA. “We have a clear picture of what needs to be done,” Calhoun was quoted as saying. “Boeing will develop the comprehensive action plan with measurable criteria that demonstrates the profound change that Administrator Whitaker and the FAA demand. Our Boeing leadership team is totally committed to meeting this challenge.” The next four years will change America forever.

On Sunday, the “Frozen” actor shared a short video of herself singing “Happy Birthday” to “Adele Dazeem” on TikTok. “I just wanted to say happy birthday. I’m sending you so much love and positive energy,” Menzel said in the clip. “I hope you have the best, best day.” Happy 10th birthday, Adele Dazeem! Adele Dazeem first entered the cultural lexicon during the 2014 Academy Awards ceremony, when John Travolta mispronounced Menzel’s name while introducing her performance of “Let It Go” from Disney’s “Frozen.” “Please welcome the wickedly talented, one and only, Adele Dazeem,” said Travolta at the time, alluding to Menzel’s Tony-winning stint as Elphaba in Broadway’s “Wicked.” “Let It Go” went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Song later that night, and Travolta’s flub quickly became a viral moment. Appearing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” a year later, Travolta blamed the mishap on Menzel’s name being spelled phonetically on the Oscars’ teleprompters. “I didn’t rehearse it that way,” he said. Menzel, for her part, poked fun at the incident during the 2015 Academy Awards ceremony by intentionally messing up Travolta’s name when they presented together. Since then, she’s repeatedly made it clear that she holds no ill will toward the “Pulp Fiction” actor.

Just over heard my husband telling the dog that he wants nothing more in life than to pet him, so I guess that was 16 years and three kids well spent We ran into my wife’s close friend on our neighborhood walk which allowed me 45 minutes to stare at a fire hydrant. My husband just referred to the Wonka Experience as ""Fyre Festival for children."" Please don't write happily married in your social media bio. Be realistic. ""I have a spouse and they like me well enough."" It's early in the year but I'm already anxious about my husband getting his Spotify Wrapped and asking me who has been getting high and listening to ""If We Hold On Together"" from ""The Land Before Time"" sung by Diana Ross so many times. My wife has close friends whose husbands are notably worse than me and I highly recommend this arrangement the smug way my wife walks into the kitchen, casually opens a drawer, and pulls out the exact item she needs on the first try Wife: Can you turn on the oven?Me: [starts dancing seductively in front of oven]Wife: why for everything Wife: We need to talkMe, absolutely panicking: WhatWife: We need to start buying the big jars of peanut butter husband: how was your dayme showing him the Twitter research I’ve done on Kate Middleton’s whereabouts since December of last year pic.twitter.com/WXphrsc96x Husband: Why are your hands bleeding?*flashback to me struggling to open a pistachio for 20 minutes*Me: I’m learning how to play guitar.

Husband: You’re parked in the driveway listening to a book and scrolling your phone. Me: And I have 23 minutes left in my session. When my mother-in-law came to stay, she insisted we NOT change our regular routine for her. We obliged, but naked Saturday was a pretty awkward. My husband called me from upstairs because he needed tp and what did we do before cell phones Almost made it to the end of February before my wife made the first mention of what we could gift people for Christmas this year. Maybe next year will be the year we make it to March my wife: you put more time and energy into our son’s little league team than you do our marriage.me: well yeah our marriage doesn’t end in a championship tournament. My husband just said he's going to take a shower so I told him I hope he showers off his bad attitude*. *I got a new sweatshirt and put it on and asked if I look cute and he said ""well, it sure is a sweatshirt!"" which is obviously not the right answer and he needs to do better. According to my husband he's the only person on the road who knows how to drive. The eye-roll is implied. wife: [stressed and busy]me: [not working] let me help and I can do the grocery shoppingwife: I don't want you to do that.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/emaciated-palestinian-boy-dies-gaza-famine_n_65e5f01ae4b013678e162d03","Palestinian Boy In Photos That Showed Reality Of Gaza Famine Dies Of Malnourishment","sanjana karanth","2024-03-04","Yazan al-Kafarneh, a Palestinian boy whose emaciated appearance offered the world a stark illustration of Gaza’s accelerating starvation crisis, has become one of the latest children in the territory to die of severe malnourishment. Yazan was receiving medical treatment with the few resources available at Abu Yusuf al-Najjar Hospital in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are trying to survive without adequate shelter or food. Graphic photos taken on Feb. 28 and March 2, which appear below, show Yazan emaciated and bedridden while covered in blankets and receiving fluids intravenously. The photos were reposted online by activists, journalists and pro-Palestinian accounts, showing the reality of a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza born out of Israel’s ongoing offensive and monthslong blockade of aid deliveries. Yazan died of malnourishment on Monday, Al Jazeera reported. He was 10. “This child had turned into a skeleton in this war before he died,” Muhammed al-Kafarneh, a relative of Yazan, told Al Jazeera in a video interview on Monday, as Yazan’s body was being cleaned and prepared for burial in the background. “Hunger ravaged his body. This child was suffering from several diseases,” al-Kafarneh said. “The war came and took away all the basic components that could give him life.” Yazan’s family was originally living in north Gaza ― which is facing its own starvation crisis ― before Israeli strikes displaced them several times. In a video on Instagram, Yazan’s father, sitting beside his emaciated son, shared a photo, taken a week before Israel began its offensive, of Yazan smiling and not visibly malnourished. Hoping to find better health care for Yazan, who had cerebral palsy, the family arrived in Rafah. But despite his efforts, Yazan’s father could not locate the food, water or medicine his son needed to survive. “We found nothing, so he was met with a slow and painful death,” Muhammed al-Kafarneh told Al Jazeera. “The barbaric war and the oppressive actions of the Israeli occupation against the children of Gaza and its civilians must be stopped.” North Gaza itself is experiencing even less access to aid, with public order falling apart as Palestinians become desperate for food, water and other basic necessities. UNICEF said Sunday that at least 10 children have died due to dehydration and malnutrition in the north’s Kamal Adwan Hospital in recent days. “These tragic and horrific deaths are man-made, predictable and entirely preventable,” Adele Khodr, UNICEF’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. Malnutrition screenings conducted in the north by UNICEF and the World Food Program in January found that nearly 16% of children under 2 years of age were acutely malnourished, while similar screenings in Rafah found 5% of children in the same age range experiencing malnutrition. “The sense of helplessness and despair among parents and doctors in realizing that lifesaving aid, just a few kilometres away, is being kept out of reach, must be as unbearable, but worse still are the anguished cries of those babies slowly perishing under the world’s gaze,” Khodr said. “The lives of thousands more babies and children depend on urgent action being taken now.” Following an Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants, in which some 1,200 people were killed and roughly another 250 were taken hostage, Israel has barred entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies into Gaza, aside from a small amount of aid entering from the south. Some aid groups have said their deliveries are also being delayed due to Israeli forces firing at their trucks. The U.S. airdropped dozens of food bundles over Gaza on Saturday, even as it continues to assist the country blocking the aid in the first place. The airdrop occurred two days after Israeli forces killed more than 100 Palestinians trying to access aid on the first major delivery to north Gaza in a month, resulting in widespread anger at the Israeli military and its biggest ally, the U.S. government. Janti Soeripto, CEO of aid organization Save the Children, said Monday that “the conditions to provide humanitarian assistance to children in Gaza are not only not being met but are getting worse.” “We have been calling for more crossings, more opening hours, more capacity to check trucks and pass them through, not have trucks be off and unloaded again four or five times,” Soeripto told NPR. “These are all fairly straightforward ways to make the logistics of this operation much easier, less painful and more effective. And none of these have been taken up so far.” A US official familiar w/ top Biden aides' thinking tells me they expected scenarios like the flour massacre but know POTUS is ""not budging"" on pushing Israel in a real way despite Gaza's needs.The result: ""hard-to-do + low-yield PR stunts like air drops + portable port idea."" In addition to the airdrops, U.S. President Joe Biden said he wants to open a maritime corridor for aid “and expand deliveries by land.” A U.S. official told HuffPost’s Akbar Shahid Ahmed on Sunday that aides anticipated incidents like the aid convoy shooting ― now widely being described as the “flour massacre” ― but that they still don’t expect Biden to pressure Israel in a way that actually helps Gazans. “Pushing Israel to allow food in is totally off the table,” the official said, resulting in Biden’s pursuit of “low-yield PR stunts” like airdrops of aid and the idea of a maritime corridor. “We direct our message to the international community and the free people of the world: What are you waiting for? At least guarantee the right to life for children,” Muhammed al-Kafarneh told Al Jazeera. “You claim to be just and righteous. What are you waiting for? We have reached famine. Not only that, but a complete catastrophe.” GRAPHIC PHOTOS WARNING: The following highly distressing images depict death and severe malnourishment.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-trump-colorado-ruling-liberals-disagreement_n_65e63b5ee4b0d2a2475a625c","The Key Disagreement In The Liberal Justices’ Concurrence On The Trump Ballot Ruling","paul blumenthal","2024-03-04","The U.S. Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision on Monday overturning a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court that found former President Donald Trump could be disqualified from appearing on the state’s ballot for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. But while all nine justices put their names to that decision, a bitter 5-4 divide lurked underneath. The majority opinion allowed Trump to stay on the ballot in Colorado (and Maine and Illinois, where he had also been found ineligible) by arguing that states may only enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment ― the constitutional provision barring oath-breaking insurrectionists from future office ― for state offices but not federal ones. All of the justices agreed on this main point. But three justices ― liberals Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson ― disagreed vehemently with the assertion by the five conservative justices ― John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh ― that Section 3 could only be enforced for federal offices by specific congressional legislation. Fellow conservative Amy Coney Barrett issued a separate concurrence that refrained from elaborating on her disagreement with the majority opinion, concluding “our differences are far less important than our unanimity.” Invoking the court’s controversial decision in Bush v. Gore, which decided the razor-thin outcome of the 2000 election in favor of Republican George W. Bush, the liberal justices declared that the majority’s decision had gone too far by potentially closing off other avenues for federal courts and Congress to prevent insurrectionist candidates from gaining office. “Even though ‘[a]ll nine Members of the Court’ agree that this independent and sufficient rationale resolves this case, five Justices go on,” the three liberals write in a concurrence that reads like a bitter dissent. “They decide novel constitutional questions to insulate this Court and petitioner from future controversy.” The liberal concurrence took issue with the fact that the majority had not only ruled on whether the state of Colorado could enforce Section 3 against federal candidates but also on who could instead: namely, Congress, and only Congress, via legislation. In short, they argued, the decision removes power from the courts to rule on if someone was, in fact, an insurrectionist. The decision “forecloses judicial enforcement of that provision,” according to the liberals’ concurrence. Such enforcement could arise “when a party is prosecuted by an insurrectionist and raises a defense on that score,” they contended. Such a situation could arise if someone brings a legal challenge to an action by a future President Trump, like, say, a declaration of emergency in order to federalize police officers to round up undocumented immigrants for deportation. Similarly, it could negate any federal court review if Trump appointed anyone who engaged in the Jan. 6 plot to a federal office, such as former Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark. In doing this, the liberals argued, “the majority attempts to insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future challenges to their holding federal office.” As the liberals noted, “nothing in Section 3’s text supports the majority’s view of how federal disqualification efforts must operate.” Instead, they argued, the majority relied on flimsy precedent and cherry-picked historical quotes to create a new precedent, making Section 3 all but unenforceable in the courts. The majority cited an 1869 decision, issued by Chief Justice Salmon Chase while riding circuit, that argued that Section 3 required congressional authorizing legislation. But Chase’s decision in what was known as Griffin’s Case has been shown to be poorly reasoned and the result of his own personal political ambitions. The liberals also countered the majority’s assertion that Congress passed the Enforcement Act in 1870 in order to give a path to enforce Section 3, noting that the majority cherry-picked quotes from Sen. Lyman Trumbell in his support for the bill. “The majority also cites Senator Trumbull’s statements that Section 3 “‘provide[d] no means for enforcing’” itself,” the opinion said. “The majority, however, neglects to mention the Senator’s view that ‘[i]t is the [F]ourteenth [A]mendment that prevents a person from holding office,’ with the proposed legislation simply ‘affor[ding] a more efficient and speedy remedy’ for effecting the disqualification.” The majority opinion’s requirement that “congressional legislation enforcing Section 3” on federal officeholders must “reflect ‘congruence and proportionality’” and be tailored “‘to remedying or preventing’ the specific conduct” prohibited by Section 3, the liberals noted, also keeps Congress from passing “general federal statutes requiring the government to comply with the law.” What the court is asking of Congress is by no means clear. Does this mean that Congress cannot declare under the Electoral Count Reform Act that Trump’s electors are “not regularly given” due to his ineligibility under Section 3? “If the majority in Trump v. Anderson wanted to foreclose the possibility of a post-election Section Three challenge to Donald Trump’s eligibility, then they did a poor job,” Gerard Magliocca, a law professor at Indiana University School of Law and one of the few Section 3 legal experts, wrote of the decision. Barrett, the lone conservative to disagree with this part of the ruling, simply noted that she “would decide no more than that” states cannot enforce Section 3 for federal offices, but she added that she did not want to further inflame public passions around the court by loudly disagreeing with the majority.

The Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up.” The court could have simply chosen to speak in a unified voice, but instead five justices chose to further narrow any enforcement of Section 3 while muddying the waters about how exactly Congress could act to protect the country from oath-breaking insurrectionists.

Last week, a new episode of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast was released, in which Dornan made fun of Beatty for falling for an email scam involving fellow actor Eddie Redmayne. Dornan is a longtime friend of Redmayne; it’s unknown how Redmayne and Beatty know each other. Dornan began his anecdote nearly 13 minutes into the episode, as he told host Josh Horowitz about how scammers had hacked into Redmayne’s email account. “Eddie got scammed, and we all got emails [from his account] saying, like, ‘Guys, I’m up against it here. I need some cash,’” the “Fifty Shades” actor said. When Horowitz asked if anyone responded to the phishing email, Dornan did not hesitate to give a name. “Yeah, Warren Beatty was like, ‘What can I do?’” he said. Revealing that Beatty took the bait, Dornan paused and said, “I think I’m OK to tell this [story]?” After a moment of hesitation, Dornan then launched into how he felt about the 86-year-old responding to the scam. “I was like, ‘Yeah, Warren, you go. You go first, I’ll follow,’” Dornan said while cracking up. “No, but like, we all just got individual emails saying, ‘Guys, I need you to wire me some cash,’” he continued. “And fair credit, Warren Beatty was like, ‘Whatever you need,’ you know? What a legend.” Despite crediting Beatty for wanting to help out Redmayne, Dornan continued to tease the fellow actor, joking that the email scam happened “just before [Beatty] read the wrong name at the Academy Awards.” “So it all sort of makes sense,” he said. In 2017, Beatty presented the award for Best Picture at the Academy Awards alongside his “Bonnie and Clyde” co-star, Faye Dunaway. In one of the biggest hiccups in Oscar history, the pair had been given the wrong envelope and announced “La La Land” as the winner, when it was supposed to be “Moonlight.” HuffPost has reached out to Beatty and Redmayne for confirmation on whether this actually happened and for clarification as to how Dornan even knows about this if all of Redmayne’s contacts were emailed individually.

On Sunday, Gyllenhaal shared a throwback photo of himself posing with Patrick Swayze, with whom he appeared in the 2001 thriller “Donnie Darko,” on Instagram. In the accompanying caption, the actor hinted at differences between Swayze’s “Road House” and his performance in the remake, but noted that he was hopeful that his former co-star would still have enjoyed the new film. “I’ve been thinking back about my time working with Patrick on Donnie Darko, and rewatching this great man in the original Road House plus so many other films. I’ve never stopped being a fan,” Gyllenhaal wrote. “He was such a talent and I continue to have so much respect and admiration for what he put out and into the world.” He went on to note: “I’ll never forget his kindness to me when I was starting out— he didn’t have to take the time, but he always did. We’ve made a different RH this time around, but hoping it’s one he would’ve had fun watching!” Swayze died of pancreatic cancer in 2009 at age 57. The three-time Golden Globe nominee was hot off his “Dirty Dancing” success when he appeared in 1989’s “Road House,” which also starred Sam Elliott and Kelly Lynch. The movie followed James Dalton (played by Swayze), a New York bar bouncer who relocates to Missouri to run security at a local bar and ends up saving a small town from a corrupt businessman. The 2024 remake stars Gyllenhaal as Elwood Dalton, a reimagined version of Swayze’s character. This time around, the protagonist is a former UFC middleweight fighter, while the film itself takes place in the Florida Keys. The original “Road House” received middling reviews and was a box office disappointment. Perhaps buoyed by Swayze’s better-regarded performances in “Dirty Dancing” and other films, however, the movie was a surprise hit on home video. Only time will tell if Gyllenhaal’s performance in the new “Road House” will fare better. The film’s rollout, however, has gotten off to bit of a bumpy start.

In January, director Doug Liman announced plans to skip the movie’s South by Southwest (SXSW) premiere after its distributor, Amazon, opted for a direct-to-streaming release on Prime Video instead of a theatrical run. “That hurts the filmmakers and stars of ‘Road House’ who don’t share in the upside of a hit movie on a streaming platform,” Liman, whose credits include “The Bourne Identity” and “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” wrote in an essay for Deadline. “And they deprive Jake Gyllenhaal — who gives a career-best performance — the opportunity to be recognized come award season.” R. Lance Hill, who wrote the screenplay for the original “Road House,” filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Amazon Studios last week. In it, Hill alleged that work on the new movie wasn’t completed until January, months after the copyright deadline had passed and he’d reclaimed the film rights.

Also my kid: If you raise my allowance by 52.7% for the next 7 weeks, then I'll be able to afford that pair of Air Jordan 4s I want. My 11 y/o daughter wanted an allowance so we started negotiating a chores list but she put up her hand after a couple minutes and said, “Okay, this is great, but like when do we work in some self-care here?” Kids always know who to put first. My toddler calls allowance “aplowance” and if you correct her, you’re dead to me 14yo made 4.6 GPA for 1st semester of HS, so I gave him $40 for his savings to build a gamer PC, countering all my training that kids earn good grades for food+shelter. Boy said I was ""indulging in capitalist excess,"" but also asked if he was still gon get his regular allowance👀 My daughter telling me not to worry because she got her own allowance from my purse did not have the effect she intended My 10yo just asked me for his allowance and sang “I like big bucks and I cannot lie” and I know I’m not supposed to like this as his parent but I do, I really do My son asked if I got an allowance as a kid. I said yeah…my mom allowed me to stay in the house rent free and eat every night. Teen: mom when can I have some allowance Me: things are kinda tight Teen: but I still get one tho rightMe: PAYMENT STATUS NOT AVAILABLE Give your kids an allowance so they can stop selling their teeth to a fairy You should let your kids stay up however long they want but force them to go to school in the morning or they lose their allowance. That’s closer to preparing them to adulthood than making them go to sleep. My 8yo folding laundry: Hey Mom!

Had to tell her that puppeteering is not a chore but a PASSION. Me: “Out of all of the billions of kids in the world, you are my very favourite. I love you the most.”Wilder: “Can I have my allowance?” I taught my kids about inflation and now I’m embroiled in an acrimonious allowance negotiation. My husband forgot his phone in the house so my son ran in and got it and changed his wallpaper to barf emojis so I bumped up his allowance. professor dad who makes his kids submit funding proposals to increase their allowance I offered my oldest additional allowance money to vacuum rugs, which the kid jumped at.Why haven't I been doing this already?WHY. My kid just told me that if Lego people live in houses made of Lego they’re technically living inside their own flesh so I raised his allowance Thoughts and prayers for my kids who are upset that they didn't get their allowance this week, even though they didn't do anything to earn their allowance this week. My 11yo had the nerve to ask for his allowance even though his room looks like a crime scene and I mean, imagine what he could accomplish if he used this level of audacity for good.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/safe-driver-apprenticeship-program_n_65e5f473e4b0d2a2475a3fe9","Congress Set To Roll Back Extra Safety Rule In Teen Trucking Program","arthur delaney","2024-03-04","WASHINGTON ― Congress looks poised to undo a safety requirement that the trucking industry says has held back participation in a program for younger drivers. Lawmakers unveiled a bipartisan budget bill on Sunday that would fund certain federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year ― with a rider blocking the Department of Transportation from requiring freight carriers to point cameras at apprentice truck drivers. Federal law requires long-haul truckers to be at least 21 years old, but Congress told the department to let truck companies try out drivers ages 18 to 20 as part of a pilot program. The Safe Driver Apprenticeship Program was supposed to help the trucking industry with its hiring woes, bringing in thousands of eager young drivers, but only a few dozen apprentices have signed up, according to the latest data. The bipartisan infrastructure law required participating freighters to have modern safety technology on their trucks, such as collision mitigation systems, and the Transportation Department added an extra requirement for inward-facing cameras. The American Trucking Associations, an industry trade group, blamed the cameras for the low participation in the apprenticeship program. “These additional mandates have stifled program participation, limiting the utility of data that Congress ordered be collected on drivers in this age cohort,” ATA’s Nathan Mehrens said in an emailed statement. Mehrens said Congress intended the pilot program to be “a pathway for younger drivers to enter the industry as a first career choice.” Another possible explanation for the low enrollment is that younger workers aren’t interested in becoming long-haul truckers, which involves spending weeks away from home, when unemployment is low and easier jobs are readily available. Though few lawmakers are familiar with the teen trucking initiative, there does seem to be bipartisan agreement about doing the industry a favor by relaxing the extra safety rule. Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) added the anti-camera language to a Senate spending bill last year, and the provision was tucked into bipartisan House-and-Senate legislation over the weekend without any press statements or public disagreement. Congress has to pass that bill in order to avoid a partial government shutdown by the end of the week. (The trucking provision also strikes a requirement that truck companies register their apprenticeships with the U.S. Department of Labor.) Younger drivers are known to present higher risks on the road, so the pilot program requires extensive mentoring, in addition to high-tech safety equipment, with the goal of studying whether the requirements can mitigate the danger. Skeptics of the apprenticeship initiative view it as a straightforward giveaway to the industry, a step toward lowering the interstate driving age, and a threat to all drivers.

Envoy Says 'Reasonable Grounds' To Believe Hamas Committed Sexual Violence On Oct. 7","edith m. lederer","2024-03-04","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. envoy focusing on sexual violence in conflict said in a new report Monday that there are “reasonable grounds” to believe Hamas committed rape, “sexualized torture,” and other cruel and inhumane treatment of women during its surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. There are also “reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may be ongoing,” said Pramila Patten, who visited Israel and the West Bank from Jan. 29 to Feb. 14 with a nine-member team. In the report, she said the team “found clear and convincing information” that some hostages have been subjected to the same forms of conflict-related sexual violence including rape and “sexualized torture.” The report comes nearly five months after the Oct. 7 attacks, which left about 1,200 people dead and some 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s war against Hamas has since laid waste to the Gaza Strip, killing more than 30,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The U.N. says a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people face starvation. Patten’s report said the team’s visit “was neither intended nor mandated to be investigative in nature.” She said the team was not able to meet with any victims of sexual violence “despite concerted efforts to encourage them to come forward.” However, team members held 33 meetings with Israeli institutions and conducted interview with 34 people including survivors and witnesses of the Oct. 7 attacks, released hostages, health providers and others. Based on the information it gathered, Patten said, “there are reasonable grounds to believe that conflict-related sexual violence occurred during the 7 October attacks in multiple locations across Gaza periphery, including rape and gang rape, in at least three locations.” Across various locations, she said, the team found “that several fully naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down were recovered – mostly women – with hands tied and shot multiple times, often in the head.” While this is circumstantial, she said the pattern of undressing and restraining victims “may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence.” At the Nova music festival and its surroundings, Patten said, “there are reasonable grounds to believe that multiple incidents of sexual violence took place with victims being subjected to rape and/or gang rape and then killed or killed while being raped.” She said credible sources described finding murdered victims, mostly women, naked from the waist down, many shot in the head. On Road 232 — the road to leave the festival — “credible information based on witness accounts describe an incident of the rape of two women by armed elements,” Patten said. Other reported rapes couldn’t be verified during their time in Israel. But she said “the mission team also found a pattern of bound naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down, in some cases tied to structures including trees and poles, along Road 232.” Patten said that in kibbutz Reim, the mission team verified the rape of a woman outside a bomb shelter and heard of other allegations of rape that could not yet be verified. At Kibbutz Be’eri, Patten said, her team “was able to determine that at least two allegations of sexual violence widely repeated in the media, were unfounded due to either new superseding information or inconsistency in the facts gathered.” These included a highly publicized allegation that a pregnant woman’s womb was reportedly ripped open before being killed with her fetus stabbed inside her, Patten said. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Princess of Wales, who underwent a planned abdominal surgery in January, was photographed Monday riding in a car with her mother, Carole Middleton. The picture arrives just days after Kensington Palace shut down rumors about the princesses’ whereabouts, following increased speculation on the internet. “Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates,” a spokesperson told HuffPost on Friday. “That guidance stands.” The spokesman reiterated that the princess is “doing well.” The palace previously announced the timeline for Kate’s recovery in a statement announcing the royal’s operation on Jan. 16. “The surgery was successful, and it is expected that she will remain in hospital for 10 to 14 days, before returning home to continue her recovery,” the palace shared with HuffPost at the time. “Based on the current medical advice, she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.” Kate’s health concerns come at a difficult time for the royal family. Buckingham Palace revealed early last month that King Charles had been diagnosed with cancer, which was discovered during a “recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement.” “Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer,” the palace said at the time. “His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties.” The palace specified that Charles “will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

(Watch the video below.) Appearing on “The View” Monday, the 92-year-old EGOT winner was asked by co-host Ana Navarro what she thought of criticism that Biden, 81, was too old to run again. “Let me say this and it’s very succinct and to the point: I am not about to vote for someone who has 91 indictments against them for criminal activities,” Moreno said, referring to the charges against Donald Trump spread over four indictments. “I mean, enough said already. That’s so stupid. Look at all the stuff Biden has accomplished.” “I’ll take 81 years over 91 counts any day,” Navarro chimed in. “Ya damn right,” Moreno countered. After just turning 92, the fabulous Rita Moreno shares how spreading joy keeps her thriving: ""What I bring with me is a lot of joy and I love to laugh, and I love to make people laugh."" https://t.co/cVclFZQmjA pic.twitter.com/1L2sL6hyDx A New York Times poll of 980 registered voters published Sunday doesn’t exactly reinforce Moreno’s confidence. More than 60% of the voters who backed Biden in 2020 now say he’s “just too old” to govern effectively. A whopping 73% of all registered voters said he was too long in the tooth as well, according to the survey. But if voters aren’t going to heed the word of a show business legend who has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony, they can at least enjoy the joke she cracked at Trump’s expense on the talk show. “I saw a sign in a deli wall in LA, where I was visiting,” Moreno said, per The Wrap. “And it said: Trump Sandwich.

The famous momager and mother of Miley Cyrus explained her reasoning on the latest episode of her podcast, “Sorry We’re Stoned,” which she co-hosts with her daughter, Brandi Cyrus. The episode, which was released last week, included a guest appearance from Wiz Khalifa. “I didn’t smoke pot when I had kids. I didn’t start smoking until I was, like, 46,” Tish Cyrus told Khalifa. “But I think I would’ve been a better parent if I would’ve smoked then,” she continued. “I think I would’ve been, like, I don’t know ― school projects, I would’ve felt more fun.” Brandi Cyrus interjected that her mother could’ve been “much more tolerant” during that time period of her life. “I was just like, ‘Ahhh!’” Tish Cyrus said of her attitude at the time, reiterating, “I really do wish I had smoked then.” Tish Cyrus has five children: Miley, Braison and Noah with her ex-husband, musician Billy Ray Cyrus, and Brandi and Trace from a previous relationship. Billy Ray Cyrus adopted Brandi and Trace after marrying Tish Cyrus in 1993. Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus divorced in 2022 and have since remarried other people.

But, f**k, it took a lot of hard work and determination getting here.” Kelce, who started crying as soon as he sat down at Monday’s news conference, explained how much football has meant to him. “Stepping on the field was the most alive and free I had ever felt,” the 36-year-old said. “There was a visceral feeling with football unlike any other sport,” he said. “The hairs on my arms would stand up. I could hit somebody, run around like a crazed lunatic and then get told, ‘Good job.’ I loved football.” The Philadelphia Eagles center, who has played for the franchise for his entire tenure, thanked an array of people during his announcement, including his high school and college coaches, his teammates and his family. When he got drafted to the NFL and picked to play for the Eagles, his agent told him he would fit in great in Philadelphia. “Thirteen seasons in Philadelphia and I look back on a career filled with ups and downs,” he said. Kelce, a seven-time Pro Bowl player, helped the Eagles win the Super Bowl in 2018, but the team fell short in 2023 against the Kansas City Chiefs. Kelce said it was always a goal of his to play for just one team his entire career. “I couldn’t have dreamt of a better one and a better fit if I tried,” he said. Kelce became extra tearful when he spoke about losing to the Kansas City Chiefs and his brother, Travis Kelce, in the 2023 Super Bowl. “I won’t forget falling short to the Chiefs and the conflicted feelings of immense heartbreak I had selfishly for myself and my teammates,” he said. “And at the same time, the amount of pride I had that my brother had climbed the mountaintop once again.” Travis Kelce was also seen wiping away tears while watching his brother announce his retirement. He said he doesn’t know what’s next for his career, but he looks forward to the next step. “Thank you, Philadelphia,” Jason Kelce said. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you for letting me represent this city and allowing me into your homes every Sunday.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/french-parliament-enshrines-constitutional-right-to-abortion_n_65e60e6be4b0f890593386e4","French Parliament Enshrines Right To Abortion In Constitution After Historic Vote","barbara surk , nicolas garriga","2024-03-04","PARIS (AP) — French lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved a bill that will enshrine a woman’s right to an abortion in France’s constitution, a historic move designed to prevent the kind of rollback of abortion rights seen in the United States in recent years. In an exceptional joint session of parliament convened at the Palace of Versailles, the bill was approved in a 780-72 vote. Abortion enjoys wide support in France across most of the political spectrum, and has been legal since 1975. The vote makes France the first country to have a constitutional right to abortion since the former Yugoslavia inscribed it in its 1974 constitution. Serbia’s 2006 constitution carries on that spirit, stating that “everyone has the right to decide on childbirth.” Nearly the entire hall in France stood in a long standing ovation, and many female legislators in the hall smiled broadly as they cheered. There were jubilant scenes of celebrations all over France as women’s rights activists hailed the measure promised by President Emmanuel Macron immediately following the Dobbs ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022. Both houses of parliament, the National Assembly and the Senate, had already adopted a bill to amend Article 34 of the French Constitution to specify that “the law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.” In the lead up to the historic vote, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal addressed the 925 lawmakers gathered for the joint session in Versailles, and called on them to make France a leader in women’s rights and set an example in defense of women’s rights for countries around the world. “We have a moral debt to women,” Attal said. He paid tribute to Simone Veil, a prominent legislator, former health minister and key feminist who in 1975 championed the bill that decriminalized abortion in France. “We have a chance to change history,” Attal said in a moving and determined speech. “Make Simone Veil proud,” he said to a standing ovation. The lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, overwhelmingly approved the proposal in January. The Senate adopted the bill on Wednesday, clearing a key hurdle for legislation promised by Macron’s government, intended to make “a woman’s right to have an abortion irreversible.” A three-fifths majority in the joint session was required for the measure to be approved None of France’s major political parties represented in parliament have questioned the right to abortion, including Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party and the conservative Republicans. However, some lawmakers have voted against inscribing abortion right into the constitution in previous votes in both houses. Le Pen, who won a record number of seats in the National Assembly two years ago, said on Monday that her party will vote in favor of the bill but added that “there is no need to make this a historic day.” The right to an abortion has broad support among the French public. A recent poll showed support at more than 80%, consistent with previous surveys. The same poll also showed that a solid majority of people are in favor of enshrining it in the constitution. There were scenes of celebrations around France even before the joint parliamentary session began. Sarah Durocher, a leader in the Family Planning movement, said Monday’s vote is “a victory for feminists and a defeat for the anti-choice activists.” With the right to an abortion added to the constitution, it will be much harder to prevent women from voluntarily terminating a pregnancy in France, women’s rights and equality activists said. “We increased the level of protection to this fundamental right,” said Anne-Cécile Mailfert of the Women’s Foundation. “It’s a guarantee for women today and in the future to have the right to abort in France.” The government argued in its introduction to the bill that the right to abortion is threatened in the United States, where the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a 50-year-old ruling that used to guarantee it. “Unfortunately, this event is not isolated: in many countries, even in Europe, there are currents of opinion that seek to hinder at any cost the freedom of women to terminate their pregnancy if they wish,” the introduction to the French legislation says. The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to strip women of the right to abortion has reverberated across Europe’s political landscape, forcing the issue back into public debate in France at a time of political upheaval. Mathilde Philip-Gay, a law professor and a specialist in French and American constitutional law, warned against easing the pressure on legislators for women’s rights as far-right parties — determined to curtail women’s rights — gain political influence and are elected to form governments around Europe and elsewhere. “It may not be an issue in France, where a majority of people support abortion,” Philip-Gay said. “But those same people may one day vote for a far-right government, and what happened in the U.S. can happen elsewhere in Europe, including in France.” The next four years will change America forever.

Inscribing abortion into the French Constitution “will make it harder for abortion opponents of the future to challenge these rights, but it won’t prevent them from doing it in the long run, with the right political strategy,” Philip-Gay added. “It only takes a moment for everything we thought that we have achieved to fade away,” said Yael Braun-Pivet, the first female president of the French parliament, in her address to the joint session. Amending the constitution is a laborious process and a rare event in France. Since it was enacted in 1958, the French Constitution has been amended 17 times. The last time was in 2008, when parliament was awarded more powers and French citizens were granted the right to bring their grievances to the Constitutional Court.

Edwards, who starred for the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets after a record-setting college career at Michigan, told WDIV TV that he overheard an argument on Friday about music being played too loud. “The noise escalates, and you can start to hear some pushing and shoving ― I mean, you know what fighting sounds like. Start to hear some tussling, start to hear some fists,” Edwards said. “But then once I heard a thud... that’s what got me up. That’s what got me to turn around.” Edwards said he saw a young man about to slam the older man’s head on the counter, so he jumped into action. “I grabbed him, subdued him,” he said. According to Farmington Hills police, who described the suspect as a 20-year-old man, the victim was already unconscious and bleeding when Edwards intervened. Edwards “pulled the suspect off the injured man, at which time the suspect attacked [Edwards], who was able to fight the suspect off,” a police release said. The suspect fled the scene on foot but was captured without incident, according to police. “I’d like to thank the good Samaritan for taking action to stop the suspect in the midst of a vicious assault,” Farmington Hills police Chief Jeff King said in the release, which did not identify Edwards by name.

The unanimous 9-0 decision avoided answering whether or not Trump engaged in insurrection, finding instead that states do not have the right to disqualify candidates for federal office under the 14th Amendment. To no one’s surprise, Trump greeted the news with glee. “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” he wrote on Truth Social, the right-wing social media company he’s accused of trying to filch from its co-founders. Trump doubled down on that sentiment in remarks at Mar-a-Lago, applauding the justices for their decision. “They worked long, they worked hard, and frankly, they worked very quickly on something that will be spoken about 100 years from now and 200 years from now,” he said. Trump also reiterated his belief that the decision about his eligibility ultimately lies with the voters. “The voters can take someone out of the race, but a court shouldn’t be doing that,” he said. The twice-impeached former president faces 91 criminal charges spanning four criminal cases for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, illegally retaining hundreds of highly classified documents after he left office, and falsifying business records during the 2016 presidential election to conceal hush-money payments he made to two women with whom he allegedly had extramarital affairs.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. I hunt for and write about exceptional products for a living, and have read thousands of reviews for innumerable goods. That’s all to say that I have read many a gushing review. Yet I have to admit, the volume of exceptional reviews for these quick-dry hiking pants from Baleaf impressed even me — and the women’s version is on sale for 19% off for a limited time. These popular men’s and women’s pants are comfy, lightweight and so water-repellant that reviewers recount spilling bottles of water on them and simply watching the water roll off. The women’s are surprisingly stylish, thanks to their adjustable ankle straps that give the option of a more tapered look. In my opinion, most impressive of all is the material’s UPF 50+ sun protection factor, which reviewers swear by for guarding their legs from UV rays. Reviewers not only love these comfy pants for hiking, but also say they basically live in them. And they mean it. In addition to being vouched for by hikers and lovers of comfy clothing, folks with tons of different professions and hobbies have added these pants to their daily rotation of staples, including dental hygienists and nurses who use them as scrubs, fly fishers, climbers who zip-line and rappel, office and retail workers, camera operators, people who rehabilitate and groom animals, and construction workers. Some reviewers even dress them up to wear out to dinner. The women’s pants are available in 18 colors in sizes XS–3XL, and the men’s version is available in three colors in sizes S–3XL. (Note: For the women’s pants, a number of reviewers suggest sizing up.) Each has deep zippered pockets so you can stash your phone and other hefty items comfortably, then zip them right up to ensure they’re extra secure. (The women’s version has two pockets at the side and one at the back, and the men’s version has two at the side and back.) As someone who has been unwillingly subjected to women’s pants with either no pockets or insultingly small, shallow pockets, this is nothing short of awesome. They’re also highly durable, with one reviewer mentioning their pair got caught on an aluminum decking during a construction job, and their pants not only did not rip, but did not even snag. Okay, I’m listening. According to reviewers, they’re perfect pants to pack for travel since you can roll them up super tight, using up almost no room in your luggage. The adjustable drawstring waist will help these fit even if you’re feeling bloated or have some fluctuations in weight. And strikingly, folks of all body types love them, including tall, petite and plus size reviewers. One reviewer’s adult son was so impressed by her pair that he asked if they made them in men’s. Luckily for him, they do. And finally, reviewers say they also do a great job protecting against mosquitoes, welcome news given that mosquitoes are more plentiful this year than ever in many parts of the country. Grab your own pair while they’re on sale, or read on for what Amazon reviewers have to say. Promising reviews: “I wore these pants daily on an 8-day backcountry canoe trip for which I wanted good sun coverage. They held up great! They dried quickly (important on a canoe trip) and breathed well. I’m as happy with them as I would have been with a pair of pants from REI, which were all $50+ more expensive. Zipper pockets were nice ― particularly enjoyed the thigh pocket which fit a standard iPhone + small map and fun-size candy and was accessible while seated in the boat. For sizing reference, I’m 5′3″ and 125ish lbs, and a small worked well and still had room for me to slip a pair of long underwear under on our coldest day.” — Ana “Love this pants! They can be dressed up or dressed down. They are wrinkle free, light weight, contain 4 different zippered pockets and the drawstrings at the ankles can be pulled or not pulled, depending on if you want a jogger/hiker pant look or a causal pants look. These are super comfortable - I ordered two pairs and loved them so much I immediately got on online and ordered 2 more pairs in different colors. They fit true to size - I’m 5 ft., 1″ and approximately 113 pounds - an XS fit me perfectly with a nice loose fit. Highly recommend these - I think they’d also be great for travel - they are so lightweight they would not take up much room at all in a carry on bag.” — Lucy Van Der Laan “I am 67 years and love to garden. I wear these pants for the sun protection along with a white long sleeve crew neck. They have worked great and I do not overheat in them. The fabric is light weight and breathable.” — Smartlady By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Bissell’s Little Green portable carpet cleaner is a big-time fan favorite, so there’s a rush whenever it gets marked down. It has a reputation for selling out during big sales events like Amazon Prime Days, so if you’ve always wanted to get one for yourself at a discount, you’re in luck. Both Amazon and Walmart are offering this famed cleaning machine for less than $100 right now. The classic green version that you’ve probably come to recognize is $98 at Amazon, and there’s a cool black color that’s exclusive to Walmart also on sale for an impressive $89. That model works just like the green version, comes with the same 3-inch tough stain tool to spray, scrub and suction away dirt and stains, and the same handy 48-ounce tank capacity and the same free 8-ounce bottle of Bissell’s Spot & Stain with Febreze Freshness cleaner. I own one of these Little Green cleaners, and they are indeed supremely portable and carpet-saving (pet owners love them). Every time I spill food on my rug — this happens way too often — I just run for the Little Green, flip it on, spend a scant minute scrubbing, suction up the dirty water and then breath a sigh of relief. It’s saved me from soy sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, dollops of of curry and more than one dropped cheeseburger. Reviewers say they also use this on upholstery, car seats and even mattresses. It may just be one of the most beloved cleaning tools we share her at HuffPost, and this is the lowest price I remember seeing for it. Grab one now for up to $34 off. Promising reviews from Walmart.com: “Honestly amazing, my roommate’s cat knocked over a plant I’d just repotted and this made the carpet look good as new. We’re about to move, so I didn’t want to be charged for replacing all the carpets if it came to that which could be hundreds. Walmart had it for the cheapest price I’d seen anywhere, so I grabbed it. It took all the solution it came with and around an hour to do but it looks 1000% better. Prior to this I had rented one from Lowe’s which helped a little, but the stain was still noticeable. This made it look like there never was a stain. 10/10...” — Emily, verified purchase “Love this cleaner, I cleaned my kitchen stool seats, my sofas and my hallway carpets boy did it leave it so clean and very easy to use highly recommend.” —Arlene, verified purchase “Bought this because we needed a portable, smaller carpet cleaner to take back and forth to our cabin for smaller messes. Also for our boat and vehicles as well. It’s so easy to transport and functions really well. We were actually very impressed, it worked better then we expected.” — NW, verified purchase “I’m so glad that I bought the little green machine. Everyday messes are not as upsetting as they used to be. This machine has cleaned everything spotless, including black coffee and doggie accidents. And you can’t even tell where these stains occurred. I’ve also used it to clean our dining room chairs, really perked them up.

During an appearance on CNN Monday morning, Griffin was asked about a string of verbal slip-ups the GOP presidential front-runner made in speeches over the weekend. “You saw Donald Trump firsthand when he was, albeit four years or several years younger, at least. How much does he miss or mix up facts and the like?” CNN’s John Berman asked. “I have said this before, he is not as sharp as he was in 2016 and not even as sharp as he was in 2020,” Griffin said. She went on to say that Trump “is not the strongest fighter that Republicans could have right now,” adding that it’s “remarkable how much voters don’t see [his] age as also an issue because he is only 3 1/2 years younger than President Joe Biden.” Griffin was Trump’s White House communications director for eight months in 2020. She also served as a press secretary for former Vice President Mike Pence and the Department of Defense. Griffin said Trump has “never been a super articulate or eloquent person,” but he’s been consistently mixing up the names of people like Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley recently.

No matter what time of year it is, it’s always important to slather sunscreen on ourselves and our loved ones. Sunscreen is proven to reduce the risk of skin cancer and protect skin against premature aging, but unfortunately, that knowledge is not always enough to actually inspire us to apply sunscreen. Greasy, heavy sun lotions can make you dread application so much that logic goes out the window (I know that’s true for me). That’s why this bestselling EltaMD Clear broad-spectrum SPF 46 —currently 20% off with discount code REFRESH as part of Dermstore’s beauty refresh sale — is here to save the day and probably answer more than a few of your prayers. Beloved by dermatologists and thousands of 5-star reviewers, it provides strong UVA and UVB protection in a lightweight, oil- and fragrance-free formula that promises to leave no sticky residue on your face and no white cast. Those with sensitive skin or rosacea may benefit from its calming niacinamide and antibacterial zinc, both skincare favorites for soothing inflamed skin. This cult-favorite SPF also moisturizes with popular hyaluronic acid while helping even out hyperpigmentation, reducing shine and lightly exfoliating pores thanks to the inclusion of lactic acid. You just can’t go wrong with this gentle powerhouse sunscreen, and its 20% discount is the cherry on top. Apply under or over makeup, and be sure to reapply every two hours while you’re in the sun. Check out these glowing reviews from Dermstore — and while you’re grabbing a bottle for yourself, do your teen or your partner a favor and let them in on this sun protection must-have, too. “This is my go–to sunscreen. I’ve used it for about four years now and it’s perfect. It applies very smoothly and dries down quick. It feels more like a serum than a sunscreen. For years I dreaded applying sunscreen, but this one is amazing. I have from time to time wandered away from this product, but I always come back. No other sunscreen compares.” — Jessica “It’s honestly as good as sunscreen gets. I used it on my boyfriend and he thought I was putting regular lotion on his face since it’s so soothing and goes on totally transparent. Plus it’s non-irritating and great for skin conditions like acne.” — Delaney “This is by far my favorite sunscreen. I use it daily and it always protects my face from getting sunburnt. This is the one sunscreen that I used when I had severe acne and it helped my acne and inflammation greatly! I recommend it to everyone I meet.” — Stacy “This sunscreen is my favorite. As a brown-skinned girl, this doesn’t leave a white cast after being blended in! It also is incredibly hydrating.” — Savi “Holy grail sunscreen. As if this product NEEDS another five-star review — but it’s too good not to sing its praises! It blends like a dream and it doesn’t bother my oily, acne-prone skin. I don’t find that there’s any white cast, and my skin appears hydrated and glowy. Five million stars!” — Amy “As someone who has had numerous basal skin cancers removed from my face, I am always on the lookout for the best sun protection.

The 76-year-old surrendered to the Manhattan district attorney’s office early Monday following weeks of negotiations with prosecutors. He will be sentenced to five months in jail, according to The Associated Press. “Allen Weisselberg looks forward to putting this situation behind him,” Seth L. Rosenberg, one of Weisselberg’s lawyers, said in an emailed statement to HuffPost. Weisselberg, who was also sentenced last year to five months in prison after being found guilty of multiple tax fraud charges in 2022, had been suspected of lying about his former boss’ finances during a sworn deposition in May and while on the stand during Trump’s trial in October. Weisselberg, under oath, had said that he was not involved in an evaluation of Trump’s Manhattan penthouse, which was listed for years as much larger in size on his annual financial statements than it actually was. Shortly after Weisselberg’s testimony, Forbes published an article citing past emails and notes between the outlet and him that contradicted his claims. Forbes reported that he was not only involved in an evaluation of the penthouse, but he tried to inflate the property’s value over several years. New York state Judge Arthur Engoron later questioned the veracity of Weisselberg’s testimony prior to delivering his judgment in Trump’s trial last month. In an email to the defense and prosecution on Feb. 5, Engoron said he was considering whether he should throw out all of Weisselberg’s testimony after The New York Times first reported about Weisselberg negotiating with prosecutors on a perjury plea. “As the presiding magistrate, the trier of fact, and the judge of credibility, I of course want to know whether Mr. Weisselberg is now changing his tune, and whether he is admitting he lied under oath in my courtroom at trial,” Engoron wrote. Shortly after, Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355 million in penalties for lying about his wealth. Weisselberg was also permanently banned from having financial control over any New York corporation or similar business entity in New York. In his ruling, Engoron said “the evidence is overwhelming” that Weisselberg, as well as Trump’s former corporate controller, Jeffrey McConney, “cannot be entrusted with controlling the finances of any business.” McConney received the same business ban in New York.

A great many artists or their estates have condemned Trump’s use of their music over the years, including the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, the Smiths, Black Sabbath, Rihanna and others.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-trump-colorado-ballot-ruling_n_65984f08e4b0f9f6621ca0ee","Supreme Court Says Donald Trump Can Appear On 2024 Ballot","lydia o'connor","2024-03-04","The U.S. Supreme Court overruled a Colorado court’s decision barring Donald Trump from appearing on the 2024 presidential ballot in an unsigned and unanimous decision on Monday. The case revolved around a clause in the 14th Amendment stating that anyone who took an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution but then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against it is ineligible to hold state or federal office. The Colorado Supreme Court had ruled Dec. 19 that Trump’s actions in support of the Jan. 6 insurrection disqualified him from the ballot. The Supreme Court disagreed, arguing that states do not have the ability under the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates for federal office. “We conclude that States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office,” the decision states. “But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency.” The court’s decision ensures that Trump will remain on the ballot in Colorado, and Maine and Illinois, where judges and election officials similarly ruled him ineligible under the 14th Amendment. The decision came the day before Colorado’s Republican presidential primary election, which the state’s top court had ordered Trump disqualified from. “While the Supreme Court allowed Donald Trump back on the ballot on technical legal grounds, this was in no way a win for Trump,” Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the liberal legal group that led the Colorado lawsuit, said in a statement. “The Supreme Court had the opportunity in this case to exonerate Trump, and they chose not to do so.” Trump, on the other hand, called the decision a “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” The case came before the court after a group of Colorado voters challenged Trump’s eligibility under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment in state court. This challenge followed a series of lawsuits brought by CREW and Free Speech for People, another liberal legal group, seeking to disqualify other candidates from office for their participation or alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection. At first a Colorado court ruled against the challenge to Trump’s ballot eligibility by claiming that the presidency was not an “office ... under the United States” to which Section 3 applied. On appeal, the Colorado Supreme Court overruled the lower state court in a 4-3 decision to find that Section 3 applied to the presidency and that Trump engaged in insurrection that warranted disqualification from future political office. In its decision, the U.S. Supreme Court remained silent on whether Trump engaged in insurrection or not, but instead solely determined that states did not have the authority under Section 3 to disqualify federal candidates. “Because federal officers “‘owe their existence and functions to the united voice of the whole, not of a portion, of the people,’” powers over their election and qualifications must be specifically “delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States,” the decision says, quoting from its 1995 precedent in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton where it struck down state-imposed term limits on congressional candidates. While the court spoke in a united voice in its decision that states did not have the authority to disqualify federal candidates under Section 3, four justices dissented from the decision’s assertion that Section 3 could only be enforced by congressional legislation. “Today, the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming President,” a concurrence from liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson states. “Although we agree that Colorado cannot enforce Section 3, we protest the majority’s effort to use this case to define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision.” In addition, conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett issued her own concurrence stating that the case “does not require us to address the complicated question whether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced.” The court’s decision to allow Trump to remain on the ballot was not a surprise. When it heard oral arguments in early February, the court appeared unanimous in its skepticism of the Colorado Supreme Court ruling that Trump was disqualified from office because of his role inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. At that hearing, the court’s six conservative justices and three liberal ones appeared united in the argument that that clause does not empower individual states to remove candidates for federal office from the ballot without legislative authorization from Congress. “The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power,” Chief Justice John Roberts, historically a swing vote on the court, said at the hearing. “Wouldn’t that be the last place you’d look for authorization for the states, including the Confederate states, to enforce … the presidential election process?” he added. “That seems to be a position at war with the whole thrust of the 14th Amendment and very ahistorical.” Kagan raised similar concerns. “To put it most baldly, the question that you have to confront is why a single state should get to decide who gets to be president of the United States,” she said at the time. When it issued its ruling in December, the Colorado Supreme Court acknowledged the enormity of such a decision. “We do not reach these conclusions lightly,” the court wrote. “We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us. We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.” The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case at the request of Trump’s lawyers. The former president’s spokesperson Steven Cheung called Colorado’s decision an “unAmerican, unconstitutional act of election interference which cannot stand.” Efforts to remove Trump from the ballot have advanced in 36 states, though courts have since dismissed or rejected more than half of them. Trump’s legal woes are far from over. He was initially scheduled to face trial in March on four felony charges related to his role in the Capitol insurrection, but a judge delayed the start of that trial. A new date has not been set. Across the four criminal cases in which he’s been indicted, he’s been charged with 91 felonies. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

Greg Abbott (R-Texas) “couldn’t be more wrong” in claiming there is no need for Congress to approve legislation on immigration, and accused Abbott of “trying to wreak havoc” in cities across the U.S. Abbott had previously called on President Joe Biden to use his executive authority to improve the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. “The president does not need new laws,” Abbott told CNN’s “State of the Union” last month. “The president needs the backbone to make sure that he enforces the immigration laws that are already on the books.” Mayorkas on Sunday took issue with Abbott’s comments, telling CNN’s Dana Bash that the governor “couldn’t be more wrong” and that Abbott’s suggested approach failed during former President Donald Trump’s time in office. “As a matter of fact, former President Trump tried to close the border, and it was enjoined in the courts and never saw the light of day,” Mayorkas said. Mayorkas also blasted Abbott for failing to work with other U.S. officials, and for engaging in political stunts by busing migrants from Texas to Democrat-led states and cities like New York and Chicago. “This coming from an individual who is purposefully refusing to coordinate, communicate, collaborate with other officials, and trying to wreak havoc in other cities and states across the country,” Mayorkas said. “That is not a model of governance, and he couldn’t be more wrong.” Republicans, at Trump’s urging, ended up rejecting a bipartisan bill that would have established some of the toughest border enforcement measures in decades, to avoid potentially handing Biden a win in an election year. Abbott joined Trump at his campaign stop at the border last week, where the former president said he is “absolutely” considering the governor as a potential running mate.

Most recently, the administration sued Texas over a bill that would enable local police to arrest migrants who cross into the country illegally. A federal court struck down the legislation, but the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton (R), has already appealed the decision. Bash also asked Mayorkas whether he wants the Senate to hold an impeachment trial against him, after the House voted to impeach him last month in what was widely considered a politically motivated effort by Republicans to make Trump look tough on immigration ahead of November’s presidential election. “I’m going to let the Senate, of course, execute its responsibilities as it thinks best in the service of our country,” Mayorkas told Bash. “I am going to focus on work.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The policy has taken effect during spring training and the expectation is for it to continue in the regular season, outlets reported. The move may strike some as surprising given the city’s liberal bent and former San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick’s historic protests several years ago. But Melvin insisted there’s no politics behind the mandate. “Look, we’re a new team here, we got some good players here,’’ Melvin told USA Today in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Friday. “It’s more about letting the other side know that we’re ready to play. I want guys out here ready to go. There’s a personality to that.” He continued, “It has nothing to do with whatever happened in the past or whatever, it’s just something I embrace. You want your team ready to play and I want the other team to notice it, too. It’s as simple as that. They’re embracing it.” Melvin said he had the same rule as manager of the Oakland A’s and San Diego Padres and had to crack down from time to time. The Athletic previously reported that Melvin wants to enforce the policy during the regular season although getting full participation will be “trickier” because of different pregame routines. “But the expectation is that everyone who can be out there standing at attention will be out there standing at attention,” The Athletic wrote. The man he replaced to lead the Giants, Gabe Kapler, embraced activism when it came to the anthem. Kapler stopped appearing on the field in 2022 for “The Star-Spangled Banner” after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Sports Illustrated reported. He also took a knee in protest following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. Kaepernick’s demonstrations to raise awareness of racism and police brutality began in 2016, putting him in the cross-hairs of backlash that included the rage of Donald Trump.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-benny-gantz-meeting-dc_n_65e5da5be4b0f89059336d99","Kamala Harris Meets Israeli Cabinet Official Despite Netanyahu's Rebuke","aamer madhani , seung min kim","2024-03-04","WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris met on Monday with a member of Israel’s wartime Cabinet who came to Washington in defiance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the Biden administration intensifies its efforts to push more humanitarian aid into war-battered Gaza. White House officials said Benny Gantz, a centrist political rival of Netanyahu, requested the meeting and that the Democratic administration believed it was important that Harris sit down with the prominent Israeli official despite Netanyahu’s objections. President Joe Biden, Harris and other senior administration officials have become increasingly blunt about their dissatisfaction with the mounting death toll in Gaza and the suffering of innocent Palestinians as the war nears the five-month mark. “The president and I have been aligned and consistent from the very beginning,” Harris said in an exchange with reporters shortly before meeting with Gantz. “Israel has a right to defend itself. Far too many Palestinian civilians, innocent civilians have been killed. We need to get more aid in, we need to get hostages out. and that remains our position.” The White House, in a statement following the meeting, said Harris and Gantz discussed the urgency of completing a hostage deal to free more than 100 people believed still to be in captivity in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. She also reiterated the administration’s support for a temporary extended cease-fire that would facilitate the release of hostages and allow for a surge of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. Although Gantz holds many of the same hardline views as Netanyahu, he has been seen as more open to compromise on critical issues, including the increased delivery of humanitarian assistance. The meeting comes after the U.S. on Saturday carried out the first of what are expected to be ongoing airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The moment is reflective of the increasingly awkward dynamics in the U.S.-Israel relationship, with the U.S. forced to fly badly needed aid past its close ally as it looks to ramp up assistance for desperate civilians in Gaza. The first airdrop occurred just days after more than 100 Palestinians were killed as they were trying to get food from an Israel-organized convoy. The White House agreed to the meeting with Gantz even as an official from Netanyahu’s nationalist Likud party said Gantz did not have approval from the prime minister for his meetings in Washington. Netanyahu gave Gantz a “tough talk” about the visit — underscoring a widening crack within Israel’s wartime leadership. “We have been dealing with all members of the war Cabinet, including Mr. Gantz,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. “We see this as a natural outgrowth of those discussions. We’re not going to turn away that sort of opportunity.” In addition to his talks with Harris, Gantz met with White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Security Council Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk. Gantz also met with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and on Tuesday will sit down with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Gantz ,just before the start of his White House meetings, told a reporter with Israel’s public broadcaster Kan: “There will be an open and honest conversation between two friendly and important countries and partners.” Biden is at Camp David, the presidential retreat just outside Washington, until Tuesday as he prepares to deliver the annual State of the Union address later this week. Over the weekend, Harris issued a forceful call for a temporary cease-fire deal in Gaza, which administration officials say would halt fighting for at least six weeks. She also increased pressure on Israel not to impede the aid that workers are trying to get into the region. The White House has been advocating for that framework deal for weeks. Israel has essentially agreed to the deal, according to a senior Biden administration official, and the White House has emphasized that the onus is on Hamas to come on board. Biden faces mounting political pressure at home over his administration’s handling of the Israeli-Hamas war, which was triggered when militants in Gaza launched an attack, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 people hostage. In last week’s Michigan presidential primary, more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters cast ballots for “uncommitted.” Biden still easily won the state’s primary, but the “uncommitted” vote reflected a coordinated push by voters on the left to register their dissatisfaction with the president’s unwavering support for Israel as its military operations in Gaza have left more than 30,000 Palestinians dead. The vote totals raise concerns for Democrats in a state Biden won by only 154,000 votes in 2020. Gantz, who polls show could be a formidable candidate for prime minister if a vote were held today, is viewed as a political moderate. But he has remained vague about his view of Palestinian statehood — something that Biden sees as essential to forging a lasting peace once the conflict ends but that Netanyahu adamantly opposes. It is also assumed that when the heavy fighting subsides, Gantz will leave the government, which would increase pressure for early elections. Since Gantz joined Netanyahu’s three-minister war Cabinet in October, U.S. officials have found him to be easier to deal with than either Netanyahu or Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Until now, calls for elections have been muted due to the war, but analysts think that when Gantz leaves the government, it will send a signal to the Israeli public that the need for national unity has passed and efforts to oust Netanyahu’s government can begin in earnest. For his part, Gantz was aiming to strengthen ties with the U.S., bolster support for Israel’s war and push for the release of Israeli hostages, according to a second Israeli official. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t allowed to publicly discuss the disputes within the Israeli government. Gantz is scheduled to head to London for meetings after his U.S. visit. It was unclear if Gantz during his White House talks diverged from Netanyahu’s stances on Palestinian statehood or carrying out an expanded operation in the southernmost Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Israel against a Rafah operation without a plan to protect civilians, and the White House said Harris reiterated that position in her meeting with Gantz. “I don’t doubt there are some administration officials who believe just by meeting with Gantz they are undermining Netanyahu,” said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a conservative Washington think tank. “But if Gantz carries the government’s line on key issues of disagreement, these meetings are net-negative for the White House while helpful back home for Gantz.” ___ Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel; Wafaa Shurafa in Rafah, Gaza Strip; Samy Magdy in Cairo and Matthew Lee and Zeke Miller contributed to this report.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/american-kids-lack-independence_l_65e1f6cee4b0d2a2475922a8","The 1 Thing Kids In Other Countries Do That Differs Greatly From American Kids","marie holmes","2024-03-04","My son, age 14, loves watching the Japanese show ‘Old Enough’ on Netflix. The premise is that young children — ages 4, 3 and even 2 — are sent to run errands by themselves. Cleverly disguised camera crews trail them on their journeys while their parents wait for them at home or some other predetermined meeting point. The kids walk though neighborhoods, cross the street, navigate public transit and manage interactions with shopkeepers. One little girl carries her mother’s work pants to be mended. Another child purchases dumplings from a vendor. The children’s focus and determination is captivating, and it’s impossible not to become invested in their success at the task. The kids are also adorable. Their reactions and facial expressions regularly crack my son up. But that isn’t the show’s only allure. The sheer implausibility of the whole endeavor draws him in. “You would’ve never let me do something like this,” he observed. “You would’ve been freaking out.” He’s not wrong. When he was 3, I likely would’ve sent him hang gliding before allowing him to cross the street alone. But my parenting instincts aren’t just a product of my own neuroses. They’re part of a culture, and here in the U.S. we’ve developed a culture of overprotectiveness and fear when it comes to kids acting independently. By keeping them safely within arms’ reach, what are our kids missing out on? And what are some ways we could give them the opportunity to practice these vital life skills? Japan isn’t the only nation where you can find kids navigating a town’s streets and public transportation without adult supervision. Mei-Ling Hopgood lived in Argentina as a new mother, writing about the experience in her book “How Eskimos Keep Their Babies Warm,” in which she explores parenting practices around the globe. She noted that it was common in Argentina and in other countries to see children commuting to and from school without adults. In some places, the reasons behind this particular independence are structural. Not all families have cars, so the only options may be walking, biking or taking public transit. Another factor is parents’ level of trust in their community. When they send their kids out of the house, do they assume they will be safe and that the adults they interact with will be helpful and trustworthy? In Argentina, Hopgood saw signs of trust in the community of surrounding adults. “If a child is crossing the street, not with a parent, or if an older person is crossing the street and needs help, they will take your hands. For example, when I would take the girls back to Argentina when they were little, the drivers that would pick us up, a man they did not know, would take their hands and walk them to the car,” she said, much to the surprise of her daughters, who by then were living in the U.S. “The thinking [is] that adults are there to help you,” Hopgood told HuffPost. This includes men and even men you don’t know, and was a real shift from the “stranger danger” panic that permeated her American childhood. It was “notable to me because of the bias against men being nurturing people, or they are the strangers you should be afraid of.” Journalist Michaeleen Doucleff observed a similar kind of autonomy among the Maya, Inuit and Hadzabe children that she observed when researching her book “Hunt, Gather, Parent.” Children in these cultures, she told HuffPost, “have enormous freedom to decide where they go, what they do and who they’re with. Parents and older kids are around them, observing and ensuring they are safe. But generally their movements and actions are their own.” Again, there is a shared assumption that children are safe moving throughout the community. This autonomy extends to kids setting their own schedules — deciding when do go to bed, for example (an often fraught topic for American parents that has generated the profession of sleep consultant). In general, kids were entrusted with a multitude of what an American would likely consider “adult” responsibilities: “They use knives and the stove. They help take care of younger siblings (playing with them, changing diapers, feeding them). They take care of animals or a family garden. They learn to hunt, slaughter/butcher animals, make clothes. They work at local stores. They climb trees, gather firewood or forage for food,” Doucleff said. This trust in children’s ability to handle things includes managing their emotions and speaking for themselves. “They are allowed to get upset, have tantrums, without being scolded or forced to control their emotions very early,” Doucleff said. In addition, she said, “parents allow children to talk for themselves” rather than answering questions directed at them on their behalf or prompting them with what to say. Other cultures also have a higher tolerance for risk when it comes to kids’ behavior. Helen Russell, author of the forthcoming “The Danish Secret to Happy Kids” (released already in Britain as “How to Raise a Viking”), observed in Denmark that children often take risks in their extensive outdoor play and are expected to resolve conflicts among themselves when they arise. Likewise, children speak for themselves and are expected to dress themselves (including the all-important snowsuit!) and feed themselves, rather than being told by adults what to say, what to wear and when and what to eat. Danish children, Russell told HuffPost, are allowed to pretty much “roam free,” and the same is true in other Nordic countries. “Icelandic children are all allowed to roam free until a state-sanctioned ‘curfew’ in the summer holidays, when Iceland enjoys 24-hour sun. So, come July, 13- to 16-year-olds are allowed to run wild until midnight, while children up to the age of 12 get to hang out until 10 p.m.,” she said. Letting children travel about, do chores and play without interference from adults can allow the adults more time to get their own work done and might seem to require less effort. Doucleff, however, noted that it’s not that parents are letting their children go unattended. “Adults keep a close eye to ensure kids are safe. So it’s not about simply doing less.” The key difference, she explained, is that “parents don’t interfere with children’s actions and movements, especially during play.” Kids, not adults, are the ones who truly reap the rewards of this dynamic. “Lack of autonomy is strongly associated with anxiety and depression,” Doucleff said, while “high levels of autonomy are linked to confidence, drive and all-around better mental health. In the communities I visited in ‘Hunt, Gather, Parent,’ children had these in spades.” Autonomy, she explained, “enables children to learn adult skills ... . So they can be active contributors to their families and not simply attended to by their parents.” We know that being able to contribute meaningfully can help kids feel a sense of mattering, which is protective of their mental health. Knowing that adults trust them to get from one place to another or use the kitchen knives helps them believe in their own abilities and gives them opportunities to “learn on their own, make mistakes on their own,” Hopgood said. Experience teaches them that they can figure things out for themselves and overcome challenges. Russell explained that all the outdoor play kids engage in in Denmark, in spite of frigid weather, also has a positive effect on their well-being. “Studies show that spending time outdoors improves well-being and cooperation, reduces stress, helps with concentration and evens out differences between low-achieving and high-achieving children,” she said. Hopgood, a journalism professor at Northwestern University, noted that here in the U.S. we are beginning to see the effect of a lack of independence once these children head off to college. “Students coming to university, [their] maturity and responsibility level is years below what they were some years ago. Because of many reasons, but parents have done so much for them.” Without practice, kids lack problem-solving skills and confidence in their ability to tackle challenges without their parents’ help. There’s no need to move all the way to Latin America or Scandinavia to help your kids learn independence. Some communities, by their design, are more conducive to kids’ autonomy than others, and some places are also simply safer. But even within the confines of your own home, there are steps you can take to encourage this growth. “It’s about having confidence in children’s ability to learn and grow at a young age without the need for constant interference from adults,” Doucleff said. Doucleff measured her own interference in her children’s lives by counting how many times per hour she gave them commands. (“Eat two more bites, please.” “Give me the ball.”) She initially found that this number was 120 — which is in line with what most kids experience in Western cultures. “In cultures with autonomous children, parents give only two to three commands per hour. So a hundred times fewer! It’s radically different than the approach that’s common in the U.S.,” she said. She encourages parents to use their cellphones to record their own interactions with their children and count the number of commands they are giving now and make a goal of getting that number down to three per hour. You can start slow, by having a low-command hour just once a day, perhaps at the playground. She also recommends that parents take some time to observe their children. “See what their interests are but also their skill level. Then you know when to back off and be confident that they’ve got the situation handled or when to jump in to help if they need it.” Focus on building up their independence in a specific domain by “teaching them skills they need to handle any dangers or problems that may arise in these environments,” such as using knives and electrical plugs, crossing streets or watching for cars. “Then schedule time in their week to simply be autonomous in these environments (without devices),” she said. You don’t have to start by letting them roam free all afternoon. Instead, you might begin by letting them walk home from school with a sibling or group of friends. If they’re interested in cooking, you could plan to let them make breakfast for themselves on Saturday mornings. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

JetBlue said Monday that even though both companies still believe in the deal, they were unlikely to meet the closing conditions required in the agreement before a July 24 deadline. JetBlue’s new CEO, Joanna Geraghty, called the merger “a bold and courageous plan intended to shake up the industry status quo” and speed JetBlue’s growth. “However, with the ruling from the federal court and the Department of Justice’s continued opposition, the probability of getting the green light to move forward with the merger anytime soon is extremely low,” Geraghty said in a memo to employees of New York airline. She said uncertainty over the merger’s fate was distracting the airline from its effort to return to profitability. Spirit CEO Ted Christie said he was disappointed that the airlines could not combine and create a new challenger to the nation’s four biggest airlines but said he is confident that Spirit — which has been losing money since the pandemic started — can succeed on its own. JetBlue will pay Spirit a $69 million termination fee. The Justice Department sued to block the merger last year, saying it would reduce competition and drive up fares, especially for travelers who depend on low-fare Spirit. In January, a federal district judge in Boston sided with the government and blocked the deal, saying it violated antitrust law. On Monday, the Justice Department took a victory lap. “Today’s decision by JetBlue is yet another victory for the Justice Department’s work on behalf of American consumers,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “The Justice Department proved in court that a merger between JetBlue and Spirit would have caused tens of millions of travelers to face higher fares and fewer choices. We will continue to vigorously enforce the nation’s antitrust laws.” The airlines had appealed the ruling, and a hearing had been set for June in the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. The Biden administration’s Justice Department, which has fought against consolidation in several industries, previously killed a partnership between JetBlue and American Airlines on flights in New York and Boston. Spirit and Frontier Airlines announced a $2.2 billion merger in early 2022 — a deal that would have combined two similar carriers that charge lower fares than the big airlines but add on fees that generate a large chunk of their revenue. JetBlue jumped into the fray against the wishes of Spirit’s management, which warned that it would be difficult to win regulatory approval for a Spirit-JetBlue combination. JetBlue went over the heads of Spirit’s board, directly to Spirit’s shareholders, and won a bidding war against rival Frontier a few month later. While the deal was taking shape and wound up in court, there were continuing losses and other problems at Spirit, which is based in Miramar, Florida. In late January, JetBlue warned that it might terminate the agreement. The next four years will change America forever.

Activist investor Carl Icahn bought nearly 10% of JetBlue stock last month and won two seats on JetBlue’s board. The end of the JetBlue-Spirit deal raises questions about whether Alaska Airlines can pull off its proposed purchase of Hawaiian Airlines for $1 billion plus the assumption of about $900 million in debt. The Justice Department has not indicated whether it will sue to block that agreement.

The withering montage prompted conservative pundit Charlie Sykes, the former editor-in-chief of The Bulwark, to advise “bedwetting” Democrats on how to defeat the former president if, as is increasingly likely, he becomes the GOP nominee to take on President Joe Biden in November. “Well, what fresh hell?” Sykes responded to footage of Trump slurring, mispronouncing words, confusing Biden with former President Barack Obama and claiming a Taliban leader addressed him as “Your Highness.” Sykes acknowledged he’s “not a psychiatrist” but drew a sharp distinction between Biden who “is old” and Trump who is “deranged, demented and pathetic […] not to mention dangerous.” But Biden could use that to his advantage, the commentator suggested. Biden “will be able to say, ‘Yeah, I’m old, I’m very stiff when I walk, but this guy is also old and he’s crazy and he’s dangerous and he’s incoherent.’” Trump’s likely nomination will “focus the mind” among Democrats, he added, who he urged to “stop the bedwetting” and maybe “freak out a little bit.” “This could actually happen” he warned. “Maybe we ought to treat that threat the way it ought to be treated. If it’s an existential threat, let’s act like it is an existential threat. So, stop the bedwetting, but maybe a little freakout wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.” The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/petting-dogs-frustrated-annoyed-behavior_l_65df575be4b0e4346d54ad05","Love Petting Your Dog? There's Something You Should Know — And We Hope You're Prepared For This","am i doing it wrong?","2024-03-04","Some things go perfectly together: Peanut butter and jelly. He-Man and She-Ra. Netflix and chill. And... dogs and petting, right? Not necessarily. Believe it or not, that’s what we — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, the co-hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — learned when we recently chatted with Dr. Emily Levine, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist and the owner of Animal Behavior Clinic of New Jersey. “Many dogs really don’t find being pet and hugged and kissed particularly nice — they just don’t enjoy it very much,” she told us. “There are some dogs — don’t get me wrong — that love a good butt scratch or when you first come home or they haven’t seen you in a while, because they’re so excited to see you, that may mask how they really feel about it... but when you really watch a dog’s body language when they’re hanging out and doing their own thing, most of them are just tolerating [being petted] at best. There are lots of dogs where, quite frankly, they get so frustrated and annoyed that they start to growl and say ‘Hey, please, back off! I’m really not enjoying this.’” Of course lots of furry friends do seem to enjoy physical affection, but if we’re dealing with a dog who doesn’t seem particularly enthused about it, should we refrain from doing it? “This is where we have a little bit of a culture clash — human culture and dog culture. We have dogs... we love them... and I would say if they’re tolerating it, and as long as they’re not aggressing or it’s [not] making them very anxious — tail tucked, ears back — if they’re tolerating it, it’s a little bit like hugging your kid, especially as they become more a teenager, you know? Sometimes it’s like, you’re just going to hug them and kiss them and they just have to put up with it. So I don’t think it’s a terrible thing to pet and hug and kiss your pet if they tolerate it.” So when shouldn’t we be doing it? “If it clearly makes them anxious or it they’re using aggression as a strategy to say, ‘STOP,’ Dr. Levine said. “If we ignore the early signs — the growl, let’s say — then the dogs sometimes feel they have to escalate their message. Fair enough, because we aren’t getting it.” Dr. Levine noted that hugging in particular can make dogs feel suffocated, so she suggested some alternative physical expressions of affection that might be better appreciated by your pet. ″[You can pet] the cheek and the chin... probably avoiding going along down the back... and you can keep it brief, too,” she said. Prioritizing the quality of your interactions over quantity might be the approach to take. “It’s a relationship we have with our dogs — there’s always give and take — so as long as [petting] is not the only thing you ever do with your dog, let’s make sure they’re getting time to play, or getting time to do things they find enjoyable.” So how do we determine what our dogs want — or don’t want? Dr. Levine advised that our best bet is to look at their body language. “They’re constantly telling us how they feel. We just have to learn how to read it. We’re not born knowing that — no dog owner should feel guilty about not knowing how to read their dog. But there are lots of resources — body language videos and other resources — where you can learn how they are communicating ... It’s the best thing really that a dog owner can do, to really get to know their dog, learn how they speak, because they’re speaking all the time.” We also chatted about the one thing every pet owner should do while walking their dog, whether or not it’s safe for a dog to sleep with us in our bed and much more.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barbara-lee-katie-porter-california-senate-primary_n_65e50f3fe4b013678e15bf92","Progressives Trade Blame Ahead Of Likely Defeat In California Senate Primary","daniel marans","2024-03-04","Barring a significant upset, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey, a former Major League Baseball star, are set to emerge from California’s top two “jungle” primaries on Tuesday as the finalists for the open U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The situation has left progressives nationally and in California frustrated, wondering how they will end up on the outside looking in at a Senate race in one of the nation’s bluest states. And the answer, to many, comes down to a long-standing failure of the left to consolidate around a single candidate in contested primaries. “In race after race after race, the left is penalized for lack of consolidation while more moderate Democrats end up having a lane all to themselves,” said Morris Katz, a progressive Democratic ad maker who is neutral in the California primary. The die is not cast yet: Some polling has Rep. Katie Porter, one of the two progressive candidates, within striking distance of Garvey. Rep. Barbara Lee, the other candidate, trails Porter by a wide margin. Schiff, an antagonist to former President Donald Trump and frequent presence on MSNBC, has taken advantage of the division to his left. He’s spent millions of dollars on advertisements elevating Garvey with attack ads aiming to improve Garvey’s standing among GOP voters. (Porter responded with a much smaller ad blitz of her own bolstering Eric Early, another Republican contender.) In heavily Democratic California, Schiff wanted to face a Republican in the general election over either of his more progressive rivals. Schiff’s placement as one of the top two vote getters in the Golden State’s unusual nonpartisan primary system virtually assures him Feinstein’s old seat. But the ideological implications of Schiff’s impending triumph ― a defeat for the progressive wing of the party ― have gotten less attention than Schiff’s tactics themselves. Although Schiff is a hardened partisan gladiator whose credentials with the Democratic faithful only got stronger when House Republicans censured him, he is not one of California’s many progressive champions. While Porter, a consumer attorney and protégée of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), has developed a national following for her white-board presentations exposing corporate malfeasance, Schiff is a member of the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition for whom economic policy has always been less of a concern than national security. And while Lee, a former Black Panther famous for casting the sole vote against the blanket authorization of war shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks, has campaigned loudly for a cease-fire to end Israel’s war in Gaza, Schiff is a staunch defender of Israel’s policies. Both the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC have endorsed him; DMFI PAC has also spent a modest sum promoting his bid in Jewish news outlets in California. “It would be a shame to not have two progressive senators represent us in the U.S. Senate ― someone that is very clear eyed about corporate greed, someone that also understands the housing crisis,” said state Assembly member Alex Lee, who is backing Porter. “That’s what’s at stake here.” After Schiff’s massive fundraising edge and decision to bolster Garvey, a familiar culprit emerges: Progressives’ failure to consolidate behind a single candidate, even as Schiff had the moderate Democratic lane all to himself. A similar dynamic played out in the crowded Democratic primaries in New York’s 10th Congressional District in August 2022, New York City’s mayoral race in June 2021, and Massachusetts’ 4th Congressional District in September 2020. But if progressives agree that they would be better off parrying Schiff’s Machiavellian maneuvers with one strong candidate, they disagree deeply on which of the two candidates deserves the support of a unified left. “It has been true since the very beginning that Porter is the most viable progressive against both Schiff and Garvey.” To some of Porter’s backers, the three-term Orange County Democrat would have been the obvious beneficiary of consolidation. These progressives argue that Porter simply had a better chance of making it to a runoff with Schiff. Porter has led Lee in polls from the start of the race, though not always by her current nine-point margin. And she has also far outpaced Lee in fundraising, bringing in more than $28 million to Lee’s $5 million (though still far short of the nearly $39 million that Schiff has spent). In California, a 39 million-person state with some of the most expensive media markets in the country, flush campaign coffers are a prerequisite for competing. The fundraising gap was predictable: Porter had built a dedicated online fan base with 1.2 million followers on her official side account on X and 635,000 followers on her campaign account, compared with Lee’s 322,000 followers on her official side account on X and 72,000 followers on her campaign account. Having always run in a safe Democratic seat over decades in Congress, Lee was a relatively weak fundraiser, bringing in $2.2 million in the 2022 election cycle, compared to the $26 million Porter raised in her swing seat. “Porter is one of the best chances we have to get a Warren/Sanders-caliber figure into the Senate for decades to come,” said a national progressive strategist, who requested anonymity to protect professional relationships. “Lee deserves great credit for much of her work, and took that extraordinarily courageous vote in 2001, but it is clear that she isn’t going to make the top two.” “The left is now broad enough that it can win elections, but as it has grown, it hasn’t shrugged off its tendency to self-cannibalize,” the national progressive strategist added. What’s more, Porter’s allies believe that the combination of her brand of pro-consumer populism, and Schiff’s status as a hardened Democratic partisan, could make her appealing to enough independents and even Republicans to defeat Schiff in November. “It has been true since the very beginning that Porter is the most viable progressive against both Schiff and Garvey,” Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Porter. But Assembly member Lee, a Porter ally, declined to call for Rep. Lee to withdraw from the race and endorse Porter. Among other reasons, he is not sure that Lee’s supporters are natural pickups for Porter. The idea of Porter and Lee splitting the progressive vote is “a very convenient and reductive narrative that I don’t see bearing out in the data,” Assembly member Lee said. Indeed, polling data do not definitively demonstrate that Rep. Lee’s voters would break for Porter enough to propel Porter into the top two. A late January poll conducted by the University of Southern California found that Schiff was the second choice candidate of 51% of Lee’s voters, compared with 23% for Porter. Meanwhile, 66% of Porter’s voters cited Schiff as their second choice, compared with 12% who would vote for Lee. In addition, many Black voters are supporting Lee, a Black woman, out of affinity for her as a person, rather than because of their progressive ideology. Lee was getting the support of 28% of Black voters, compared to 19% for Schiff and 12% for Porter, according to a Morning Consult/Politico poll in December. At the same time, Porter and Lee do have stronger appeal than Schiff among progressives, according to a Berkeley/LA Times poll out on Friday. Two-thirds of Lee supporters and 58% of Porter supporters said it was “very important” to vote for a candidate who is “progressive in politics,” compared to 44% of Schiff voters who felt the same, the survey found. And California’s progressive attorney general, Rob Bonta, issued a dual endorsement of Lee and Porter. “Do I think Katie Porter has a better chance to make the runoff if Barbara Lee drops out? Yes,” Katz said. “Do I think Barbara Lee, who’s been a loyal advocate for the left for decades, should be pressured to drop out? No.” “She is the proven progressive candidate – the first one to call for a cease-fire, the first one to call for Donald Trump’s impeachment, and the only woman of color in the race.” Katz’s response exemplifies a challenge for Porter proponents: Lee’s status as a progressive icon makes many Democrats reluctant to cast doubts on her viability. To make matters more complicated, Lee’s supporters believe that she has had a harder time fundraising because of her identity as a Black woman and her representation of a lower-earning constituency in the East Bay Area. “It’s hard as an African-American woman representing Oakland to fundraise,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley Democrat backing Lee. “This is why we have so few African-American senators and so few African-American women in statewide office.” “There was hope that more progressives would rally around her,” he added. Asked to respond to the idea that she might drop out and endorse Porter, Lee’s campaign pointed to the support she has received from every constitutional statewide official in California to weigh in the race, the mayors of Los Angeles and San Francisco, Democratic clubs and grassroots activists across California, and a diverse array of outside groups that includes the Congressional Black Caucus and the progressive organization, Our Revolution. “She is the proven progressive candidate ― the first one to call for a cease-fire, the first one to call for Donald Trump’s impeachment, and the only woman of color in the race,” Isabel Naturman, a spokesperson for the Lee campaign, said in a statement. “Her lived experience is shared by multi-ethnic, cross-cultural coalition of Californians, including young voters, the LGBTQ+ community, and Latino and Black communities, who back her unparalleled record of advocating for and delivering on behalf of their needs.” Karen Bernal, a Lee supporter and former chair of the California Democratic Party’s progressive caucus, argued that, if anything, Porter should have dropped out of the race and endorsed Lee. Porter’s decision to vacate California’s 47th Congressional District, which Porter carried by three percentage points in 2022, also puts a key House swing seat at risk, Bernal maintained. “We’re going to lose that seat on top of it all,” she predicted. Porter’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the demand that she drop out and endorse Lee. Progressive outrage over Israel’s war in Gaza has fueled the passion of Lee supporters like Bernal. She supported Lee from the moment she entered the race, but now more than anything, she is inspired by Lee’s support for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza. “Currently, it is the primary issue,” she said. Lee came out for a permanent cease-fire in mid-October and has since made it a central focus of her campaign. For his part, Schiff has echoed the Israeli government’s insistence that calls for a cease-fire undermine its right to defend itself against Hamas, following the group’s massacre of nearly 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7. “I don’t see how people can call on Israel to permanently cease-fire while a terrorist organization is controlling Gaza and threatening to attack them in the manner of Oct. 7 over and over and over again,” he told the Jewish News Syndicate in late February. Porter has landed somewhere in between Lee and Schiff on Israel-Palestine policy. She came out in favor of a “lasting bilateral cease-fire” in December that included the Palestinian militant group Hamas’s release of all Israeli hostages. J Street PAC, a liberal pro-Israel group that has had its own difficulty balancing concerns about Israel’s security with the Jewish state’s failure to protect Palestinian civilians, has endorsed all three Democratic Senate candidates. But tellingly, only Porter advertises the group’s endorsement on her campaign website. “Not voting for Porter in the first round means that the general election in the biggest state won’t include anybody who’s remotely concerned about the suffering of Gazans,” said the national progressive strategist. Of course, progressives might have been more apt to unify behind either Porter or Lee, if a deep-pocketed and influential outside group had stepped in for one of the two contenders. “If this ends up being a Schiff-Garvey general election, it will both be true that progressives should have consolidated and women’s groups should have done more to prevent that outcome,” Green said. The absence of EMILY’s List, which provides critical funding and campaign infrastructure for pro-choice Democratic women candidates, from the race is especially notable.

The actor, who plays Riddler in the Matt Reeves-directed movie, weighed in on the concept after recent films such as “Madame Web,” “The Marvels” and “The Flash” had less-than-super outings at the box office. “There are enough comic book movies where you just know what you’re gonna get,” Dano told The Independent. “Reading the script for The Batman, you knew it was a real film. Every sentence… that’s just [writer/director] Matt Reeves.” Dano, whose “Love & Mercy” performance helped inspire Reeves to write Riddler with the actor in mind, added that the fatigue has led to what he called an “interesting moment” where people ask, “OK — what now?” “Hopefully from that, somebody either breathes new life into [comic book movies], or something else blossoms which is not superheroes. I’m sure there will still be some good ones yet to come, but I think it’s kind of a welcome moment,” he said. The actor continued, “It’s a larger thing, too. As soon as the word ‘content’ came into what we do — meaning-making movies or TV — it meant quantity over quality, which I think was a big misstep. And I certainly don’t need that as a viewer or as an artist.” Reeves — in an interview with The Guardian last year — revealed that Dano “loves doing a lot of takes,” including in the final scene of “The Batman,” which he said took two days where he had “easily done 70 to 80 takes” between him and co-star Robert Pattinson. “There were all these moments as the Riddler where he’d be tickled by something and then fly into a rage, and you never knew from take to take where that switch would come,” Reeves explained.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/apple-fine-european-union_n_65e5c3bbe4b0f890593363f9","Apple Fined Nearly $2 Billion By EU For Hindering Music Streaming Competition","kelvin chan","2024-03-04","LONDON (AP) — The European Union leveled its first antitrust penalty against Apple on Monday, fining the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion for unfairly favoring its own music streaming service by forbidding rivals like Spotify from telling users how they could pay for cheaper subscriptions outside of iPhone apps. Apple muzzled streaming services from telling users about payment options available through their websites, which would avoid the 30% fee charged when people pay through apps downloaded with the iOS App Store, said the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer. “This is illegal. And it has impacted millions of European consumers who were not able to make a free choice as to where, how and at what price to buy music streaming subscriptions,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said at a news conference in Brussels. Apple — which contests the decision — behaved this way for a decade, resulting in “millions of people who have paid two, three euros more per month for their music streaming service than they would otherwise have had to pay,” she said. It’s the culmination of a bitter, yearslong feud between Apple and Spotify over music streaming supremacy. A complaint from the Swedish streaming service five years ago triggered the investigation that led to the 1.8 billion-euro ($1.95 billion) fine. The decision comes the same week new rules take effect to prevent tech giants from cornering digital markets. The EU has led global efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies, including three fines for Google totaling more than 8 billion euros, charging Meta with distorting the online classified ad market and forcing Amazon to change its business practices. Apple’s fine is so high because it includes an extra lump sum to deter it from offending again or other tech companies from carrying out similar offenses, the commission said. It’s not the only penalty that the tech giant could face: Apple is still trying to resolve a separate EU antitrust investigation into its mobile payments service by promising to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment system to rivals. Apple hit back at the commission and Spotify, saying it would appeal Monday’s fine. “The decision was reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,” the company said in a statement. It said Spotify stood to benefit from the EU’s move, asserting that the Swedish streaming giant met over 65 times with the commission during the investigation, holds a 56% share of Europe’s music streaming market and doesn’t pay Apple for using its App Store. “Ironically, in the name of competition, today’s decision just cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is the digital music market’s runaway leader,” Apple said. Spotify said it welcomed the EU fine, without addressing Apple’s accusations. “This decision sends a powerful message — no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers,” Spotify said in a blog post. The commission’s investigation initially centered on two concerns. One was the iPhone maker’s practice of forcing app developers selling digital content to use its in-house payment system, which charges a 30% commission on all subscriptions. Those fees have turned into a significant part of Apple’s service’s division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company’s last fiscal year ending in September. Various legal and regulatory developments threatening to undercut the Apple’s commissions from the App Store have been weighing on the company’s stock, which has fallen by about 10% so far this year amid a broader market rally in the tech sector. Apple’s shares dropped 3% in Monday afternoon in the U.S. But the EU later pivoted its focus to concentrate on how Apple prevents app makers from telling their users about cheaper ways to pay for subscriptions that don’t involve going through an app. The investigation found that Apple banned streaming services from telling users about how much subscription offers cost outside of their apps, putting links in their apps to pay for alternative subscriptions or even emailing users to tell them about different pricing options. “As a result, millions of European music streaming users were left in the dark about all available options,” Vestager said, adding that the commission’s investigation found that just over 20% of consumers who would have signed up to Spotify’s premium service didn’t do so because of the restrictions. The fine comes just before new EU rules are set to kick in that are aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital markets. The Digital Markets Act, due to take effect Thursday, imposes a set of do’s and don’ts on “gatekeeper” companies including Apple, Meta, Google parent Alphabet, and TikTok parent ByteDance — under threat of hefty fines.

In a new video shared on social media Sunday, Stiefler challenged a “Trump 2024 Or Before”-banner carrying North Carolina woman over her false claim that Trump is still the president. “I believe he is,” she told Stiefler. When Stiefler noted that President Joe Biden is in the White House, the woman attacked former President Barack Obama as “calling the shots on all this mess” in the world. The pair went back and forth. Stiefler sought clarifications, and the woman insisted Obama was actually pulling the strings. Biden is “a bumbling fool right now,” she added. Then came Stiefler’s damning question: “But why would it matter if Obama was telling Biden what to do if Biden is not president?” The woman paused, then asked him to “say that again.” Stiefler repeated the question. The woman couldn’t answer, and the clip ended. Yesterday in North Carolina we heard that Trump is still president but that Obama is in charge. pic.twitter.com/jnmJCOBXdm The video has garnered more than 700,000 views alone on X, formerly Twitter.

Eric Swalwell Spots Sign GOP’s Biden Impeachment Inquiry Is Truly A Fail","josephine harvey","2024-03-04","Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) spotted a sign that Republicans’ impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden might be dead in the water. “That’s all she wrote, folks. Even crazy Tomi Lahren thinks this thing is over,” he tweeted, sharing a clip of the right-wing commentator on Fox News. “As somebody who does believe there’s plenty of evidence here, I think that this has failed optically for Republicans,” Lahren, a contributor to the network, told “MediaBuzz” host Howard Kurtz on Sunday of the impeachment probe. “They’ve done good work ... but optically, it does make it seem as though they’re beating up on someone with addiction issues,” she added, referring to the intense focus on the president’s son, Hunter Biden. She encouraged Republicans to focus on the election instead. “This impeachment inquiry, unfortunately, is falling flat with a lot of viewers and voters,” she said. Swalwell wasn’t the only one to spot the pivot. Ian Sams, a White House spokesperson, also shared the clip, writing: “When you’ve lost Tomi Lahren…” That’s all she wrote folks. Even crazy Tomi Lahren thinks this thing is over. https://t.co/uNRGSKZTqi Despite what Lahren says she believes and the claims of Republicans leading the probe, GOP lawmakers have failed to produce any evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden after more than a year of investigating him and his family. The investigation has unraveled in recent weeks, leaving its fate up in the air after one of Republicans’ key sources in the probe was charged with lying to the FBI about the Bidens. Lahren and many other Fox News pundits have been advocates for the inquiry, leaning heavily into unsubstantiated Republican allegations in their coverage for months.

Lisa Murkowski Says She ‘Could Not Vote’ For GOP Front-Runner Donald Trump","marita vlachou","2024-03-04","Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Saturday said she’s not prepared to vote for former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, as she urged voters not to give up on his rival Nikki Haley’s candidacy. In a phone interview with NBC News, Murkowski, who endorsed the former South Carolina governor on Friday, said she refuses to accept that the two main options available for Americans to choose from this November will be Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden. “I could not” cast a vote for Trump, Murkowski, a frequent critic of the former president, told NBC’s Ali Vitali. “I can’t vote for Biden,” she added. Murkowski also called on voters who share her desire to avoid another Trump-Biden rematch to give Haley a chance. “It’s not just a situation where Nikki is the lesser of the evils,” Murkowski said. “She is a qualified, competent, capable leader at a time when the country needs them.” Haley on Sunday scored her first win in the GOP contest, defeating Trump in the Washington, D.C. primary, also becoming the first woman in U.S. history to win a GOP primary. However, Trump over the weekend won the caucuses in Missouri and Idaho and received all 39 delegates from a party convention in Michigan, further solidifying his position as the front-runner in the race. Alaska, Murkowski’s home state, is holding its primary on Super Tuesday along with 14 other states for Republicans. Haley has previously pledged to stay in the race through at least Super Tuesday. Asked if she was prepared to stay in the contest through the Republican National Convention in July, Haley told NBC’s “Meet The Press” Sunday: “If the people want to see me go forward, they’ll show it. They’ll show it in their votes, they’ll show it in their donations.” Murkowski said she wouldn’t know how to proceed if Haley chose to drop out. Murkowski was the first senator to endorse Haley, closely followed by Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) Friday. The next four years will change America forever.

(Watch the video below.) In the umpteenth regurgitation of lies that he was denied victory through fraud, the criminally indicted former president told supporters in North Carolina Saturday that a whopping share of the electorate agrees with him. “What happened at that last election is a disgrace, and we’re not going to let it happen again,” the GOP front-runner said ahead of Super Tuesday’s slate of primaries that includes North Carolina. “Did you ever notice they go after the people that want to find out where the cheating was — and, by the way, 82% of the country understands that it was a rigged election, OK? You can’t have a country with that.” “A poll came out, 82% ― but they go after the people — they don’t go after the people that rigged the election — they go after the people that looking, they’re looking for the people that rigged the election,” he continued. “And that’s the people they go after. They got away with something; they’re never going to get away with it again.” The only polls that appear to even remotely correspond to the numbers Trump blathered on about are referring to conservatives only. Not the country. A May 2023 Rasmussen poll found that 84% of those who voted for Trump believed it’s “likely the outcome was affected by cheating.” And according to a 2021 Public Religion Research Institute poll cited by the conservative Washington Examiner, 82% of “Republicans who most trust Fox News” either “completely agree” or “mostly agree” that Trump was robbed of victory.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colorectal-cancer-prevention_l_65e1e971e4b013678e14fae7","I'm A Colorectal Cancer Doctor. Here Are 5 Things I'd Never Do.","julia ries","2024-03-04","Colorectal cancer is the third-most common type of cancer around the world. In the earlier stages, it can be tough to catch. The symptoms, like diarrhea, abdominal pain and anemia, can easily be overlooked or mistaken for another, more benign issue. There’s also been a spike in colorectal cancer diagnoses among younger people. The reason for this, though unclear, is likely multifactorial, with genes, environmental exposures and lifestyle all contributing. What we do know is that when colon cancer is caught early, it can be effectively treated. Fortunately, there’s a lot you can do to keep your bowel health in check. We asked Dr. Ursina Teitelbaum, a medical oncologist and section chief for gastrointestinal cancers at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center, about the most common mistakes worth avoiding for the sake of your bowels. Here’s what Teitelbaum said she personally avoids, and what you should, too: Family history is one of the strongest risk factors for colorectal cancer. Up to 1 in 3 people who get diagnosed with colorectal cancer have family members who also had it. There are a few reasons why cancer runs in families: genetics, shared environmental factors, and some combination of the two, according to the American Cancer Society. Because the health of your relatives directly influences your individual risk of colon cancer, it’s crucial to know your family history. Teitelbaum recommended asking your parents, siblings or other relatives if any family members, including grandparents, cousins, or aunts and uncles, were ever diagnosed with colorectal cancer. If you find out a first-degree relative had colon cancer, for example, you’ll be advised to start screening earlier. “Your colon health depends on your genes,” Teitelbaum said. Cases of colorectal cancer have been rapidly increasing among young adults. Though the disease, which affects fewer than 1% of adults, is still rare, the spike in incidence has made early screening and diagnosis all the more important. Because of this alarming trend, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued new colon cancer screening guidance in 2021 to try to catch more cases. Now, all adults are advised to starting screening by a colonoscopy or stool-based test starting at age 45. Regular colonoscopies are especially important for people with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, since these conditions can increase your risk of colorectal cancer. But even otherwise healthy people who have no family history can get colorectal cancer. “No matter how healthy your lifestyle is, when you hit a certain age, you need to get screened,” Teitelbaum said. Getting screened is the best way to catch colon cancer early and treat it. Doctors across the country have noticed that many younger adults don’t think their abnormal symptoms could be cancer, Teitelbaum said. And because they’re so young, health care providers may not immediately suspect issues either. This can lead to delayed diagnoses and poorer outcomes, research shows. The takeaway? You have to pay attention to your body, Teitelbaum stressed. Look out for any changes in bowel habits ― if you have always pooped on schedule but now frequently feel constipated, or notice blood in your stool and have abdominal pain, it’s worth talking to a doctor. Diarrhea, fatigue or unexplained anemia also warrants a medical checkup. It’s important to advocate for yourself. If you feel like your doctor isn’t taking your symptoms serious, go get a second opinion. “If you’re really worried, you need to persist,” Teitelbaum said. Though the causes of colon cancer are poorly understood, over half of colorectal cancers are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors. Smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol and having a sedentary lifestyle are thought to go hand in hand with a heightened risk of colon cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Your diet also plays a big role. Red meats and overly processed foods, such as soda, candy and cookies, have been linked to a higher risk of colon cancer, whereas vegetables, fruits and whole grains have been associated with a lower risk. “There’s no perfect predictor for colon cancer, but globally, a healthy lifestyle may help” in avoiding it, Teitelbaum said. Finally, Teitelbaum recommended getting comfortable with talking about poop. The more we open up about the topic, the better we can break down the stigma around discussing it.

Wolfe often felt the lines between her role and her mother’s role were blurred. “By the time my youngest brother was born when I was almost 11, I was overwhelmed with feelings of responsibility for his welfare. I used to sit by his crib and watch him sleep just to make sure he was safe,” Wolfe, the oldest of four, told HuffPost. “It wasn’t that I thought my mother wasn’t competent ― but more that I felt we were both responsible for the family by that point in my life,” she explained. “As if I was literally ‘other mom,’ rather than big sister.” In other words, Wolfe is deeply familiar with “eldest daughter syndrome.” The internet is rife with thinkpieces about the plight of oldest daughters and tweets about how we ― I might as well reveal my bias here ― need to unionize: “If you are the oldest sibling and also a girl you may be entitled to financial compensation,” one woman joked on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Though “eldest daughter syndrome” is a pop psychology term ― you won’t find it listed as an official diagnosis in the DSM-V ― a new study suggests that there may be more science to the pseudo-syndrome than previously thought. A University of California, Los Angeles-led research team found that, in certain instances, first-born daughters tend to mature earlier, enabling them to help their mother rear younger siblings. Specifically, the researchers found a correlation between early signs of adrenal puberty in first-born daughters and their mothers having experienced high levels of prenatal stress. Why does age of adrenal puberty matter? Changes in skin (acne, for instance) and body hair happen during this phase, but so do changes in brain development. Adrenal puberty processes are believed to foster social and cognitive changes; basically, superficial physical changes correlate with emotional maturity. When times are tough and mothers are stressed in pregnancy, it’s in the mother’s adaptive best interest for her daughter to socially mature at a quicker pace, said Jennifer Hahn-Holbrook, one of the co-authors of the study and an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Merced. “It gives mom a ‘helper-at-the-nest’ sooner, aiding the women in keeping the latter offspring alive in difficult environments,” she said. Notably, adrenal puberty does not include breast development or the onset of menstruation for girls (or testicular enlargement, in the case of boys). The study posits that girls become mentally mature enough to care for their younger siblings while not being physically capable of having their own children, which would naturally draw them away from their older daughter responsibilities. Older brothers are seemingly off the hook when it comes to this kind of parentification: The researchers did not find the same result in boys or daughters who were not first-born. “One reason that we didn’t find this effect in first-born children who are sons could be that male children help less often with direct childcare than female children do, so mothers have less of an adaptive incentive to speed their social pubertal development,” Hahn-Holbrook explained. Plus, she said, previous research suggests that female puberty timing is more malleable in response to early life experiences than males. The results of this study, published in the February issue of Psychoneuroendocrinology (say that five times fast ― or just once), were a long time coming: Researchers tracked the families for 15 years, from the pregnancy stage to the babies’ teen years. Researchers recruited women from two obstetric clinics in Southern California during routine first trimester prenatal care visits. On average, the women were 30 years of age and pregnant with one child, not twins. It was their first pregnancy for roughly half of the participants. The women were nonsmoking and not using steroid medications, tobacco, alcohol or other recreational drugs during pregnancy. They were all over 18 years of age. At five different stages of pregnancy, the women’s stress, depression and anxiety levels were measured, and then measured cumulatively. The depression assessment asked the women to rate the truth of statements such as “I felt lonely,” while the anxiety question asked how often they felt particular symptoms, such as “jittery.” Of the children born to these mothers, 48% were female and 52% were male. As the children aged, characteristics of adrenal and gonadal puberty were separately measured ― things like body hair, skin changes, growth in height or growth spurts, breast development and the onset of menstruation in females and voice changes and facial hair growth in males. The study also measured childhood adversity to account for other factors known to correlate to early maturation or signs of puberty in children, like the death of a parent or divorce before age 5 and the absence of a father and economic uncertainties at ages 7–9. Taking all that into account, it was the eldest girls who matured the fastest when their moms experienced high levels of prenatal stress. Other studies suggest that there is some later-in-life payoff for highly responsible eldest girls: A 2014 study found that eldest daughters are the most likely to succeed out of any sibling type, while a 2012 study found that those who are eldest-born are more likely to hold leadership roles. The findings ring true for Wolfe, the aforementioned author who said she felt like a second mom to her siblings growing up. “I’m not at all surprised by what the study found,” Wolfe said. “My story is slightly different — I went through true puberty, not just adrenal puberty, at 12, though I suspect I experienced an early cognitive maturation.” The study is interesting for another reason as well: The findings add to social scientists’ growing understanding of fetal programming, a fascinating area of study that explores how stress and other emotional and environmental factors women experience during pregnancy affect their children long after birth. “This is a first-of-its-kind finding and is fascinating to look at through an evolutionary lens,” Molly Fox, a UCLA anthropologist and one of the co-authors of the study, said in a press release. In an interview with HuffPost, Fox delved deeper into how fetal programming works. “One fascinating theory is that when you’re still a fetus in your mothers’ womb, you get cues about what the world is going to be like, and your body can flexibly adjust the shape of your life-cycle to be optimally suited to those conditions you expect to encounter,” she said. Fox and her co-authors are excited their work is out there for the public to read, especially after following the families along for so long. The fact that the findings were published just as a cultural conversation about eldest daughters broke out was just a cherry on top, especially for Fox, a co-oldest daughter. (She’s a twin.)

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-nipples-get-hard-cold_l_65e0bda5e4b005b858336e6b","So THAT'S Why Your Nipples Get Hard When It's Cold","kelsey borresen","2024-03-04","Exposure to cold temperatures can affect the body in a number of ways, like making your teeth chatter or cheeks redden. But have you ever wondered why nippy weather perks up your nipples? It’s not just a winter phenomenon — it can also happen in warmer times of year, like when the air conditioning is on full blast. So what exactly is occurring in the body when nipples become erect? The physiological process that leads to hardened nipples when cold is also what causes goose bumps (known medically as piloerections), dermatologist Dr. Joshua Zeichner told HuffPost. “This response is beyond our control and is a result of our bodies’ automated reactions to the environment,” said Zeichner, an associate professor of dermatology at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Essentially, a drop in temperature triggers your sympathetic nervous system, which is behind the fight-or-flight response and other involuntary bodily functions. This process activates specialized nerve cells controlling the erectile muscles that cause hard nipples and goose bumps, according to a 2016 study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. “When the body feels cold, the sympathetic nervous system contracts tiny arrector pili muscles, which are attached to hair follicles,” explained dermatologist Dr. Aanand Geria of Geria Dermatology in New Jersey. This creates goose bumps and makes the hair on your body stand upright. “In the case of nipples, it contracts the specialized smooth muscles,” Geria added. “This contraction pulls on the skin, erecting the nipple.” As for why this occurs, it’s one way that the body tries to retain heat in cold weather. The muscles beneath the skin contract “to trap the warm air near the skin and lose less heat from radiation coming off your skin,” plastic surgeon Dr. Michelle Lee told the outlet Shape. For mammals, including humans, “regulating core body temperature within a small range is crucial for survival,” Geria explained. The reflex that causes goose bumps (and nipple erections) in the cold is not so useful for humans today, but would have been quite important for our ancestors. Back when we were a much hairier species, having all of your body hair stand up helped with insulation — not to mention that it could make you look larger to ward off predators.

Nipples can become erect for other reasons unrelated to the cold, such as sexual arousal, tactile stimulation (like when they rub against your shirt), hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy or breastfeeding, and even “emotional responses like fear or excitement,” Geria said. Most of the time, hard nipples are just a normal bodily response to a number of different stimuli, he noted — but if you’re seeing “persistent or extreme erection unrelated to temperature or excitement,” then it could be indicative of a health problem. Also, if you’re experiencing pain with nipple erections or any type of discharge, it’s worth talking to your health care provider to rule out any underlying issues.

Sign up here for weekly book news, author interviews and more. It’s an impactful thing to see yourself — and the struggles you deeply feel — reflected on television screens and in the pages of books. Michael Arceneaux, a Black gay man who grew up in the South in what he describes as a difficult childhood, said he couldn’t see himself the way so many others could, especially in media dominated by the straight, white and financially comfortable. In Arceneaux’s collection of essays and other writings — a loosely connected series that will be complete with a third installment, “I Finally Bought Some Jordans,” in March — he describes wanting a kind of representation that goes beyond just Black or just queer, but rather a full-fledged and complex existence that everyone can and should find themselves in. In his first book, “I Can’t Date Jesus,” Arceneaux discusses what it was like to reconcile what he was taught to believe about homosexuality in an overtly religious household, and who he knew himself to be. Using candid, moving and hilarious prose, he explores how to still have a close relationship with his mother while also not completely agreeing on some of those fundamental beliefs. But it wasn’t easy to get to this point, according to the author. From very early on Arceneaux said there was some doubt about how commercially viable books written by someone Black and gay would be. As a result, he said he still experiences financial instability, amid inequities within the publishing industry and an on-going inability to shake some of the generational struggles that have and continue to impact Black men, like financial instability which he candidly explores in his second book, “I Don’t Want to Die Poor.” Despite all of this, Arceneaux’s persistence and dedication to the craft of engaging storytelling has managed to heal and bring together some unlikely audiences. I had the opportunity to discuss all of this with Arceneaux ahead of this upcoming book release, “I Finally Bought Some Jordans,” which will be released on March 12. Can you tell us a little bit about what readers can expect from “I Finally Bought Some Jordans” and how it relates to your other books? It’s more of a broader collection of essays than my other two books. There are similar themes of family and identity, but it’s focusing on the chaos of the last couple of years. I write a lot about the pandemic and grief and being impacted by death. I talk about suicidal ideation [and] losing friends to suicide. I try to make sense of how life’s not exactly turning out how I thought it would, even with all of the hard work and certain accomplishments, [while] still trying to maintain a sense of hope. I think a lot of other people are kind of secretly carrying a lot of pain and frustration or grief and still trying to process that pandemic. I hope I can give people some kind of comfort like no, you’re not crazy or alone, these are valid feelings. I think one of the things that you do so well is you write about these universal human experiences in a very relatable way that makes us all feel seen. Is this something that you intended for your writing to achieve? My intent with my work in writing or in anything is to make people laugh, make people think, and to also create nuanced narratives about people like me. And when I say people like me, that’s working class, Southern Black, that’s anyone coming from religious backgrounds. And fundamentally, I just didn’t want people to feel as alone, as I often have. In “I Don’t Want To Die Poor,” specifically, I write about private student loans and how they impacted every facet of my life. Private loans are disproportionately impacting a lot of Black college graduates and students, so I wanted to talk about what it’s like to have that financial insecurity. Another goal that I had was … particularly in publishing, to make it easier for people to see the commercial viability in stories that they don’t necessarily usually value monetarily and not on equal footing as often their white counterparts. Is that something then that you think would improve circumstances for minorities in the media and literary world? To make content like yours more mainstream and conventional? I do, honestly. I think a lot of us would be a lot better off if we really truly engaged with works that are created by people who are not like them because you can learn a lot from different types of people. When I’ve spoken on platforms like NPR and PBS, yes, I got so many messages from young queer black men or boys like happy to see someone like me speaking the way I do to them, and being comfortable in my own skin. But it’s also been very nice to get emails from nice white women in Maine or Vermont, saying they related to my story or, they didn’t get my references, but they Google[d] them, which is what I do when I read something from a white author or something I don’t know. I think smart is smart, funny is funny and a good story is a good story, so to say that my books only appeal to just Black people or queer people is really limiting. This country is truly segregated by design, in terms of class and race, so we don’t really get to interact as much as they make it seem on certain TV shows and films. So for me to be in these different types of spaces that you wouldn’t expect me to be in, and to speak the way that I do, and be very comfortable in my own skin [to] tell my story, is important because I write about things that are problems that we all share. *** You can shop Arceneaux’s works for yourself and pre-order a copy of “I Finally Bought Some Jordans” or keep scrolling to see some of his favorite Black-authored books that have served as personal inspiration for the author and can be vital reading for you.

But what if the real solution can be found in the hardware store? Have you ever noticed a change in the way your skin or hair looks and feels when you have showered someplace other than your home? Surprise! It could very likely be the water conditions that made a difference. These days, beautifying water filter ads come at us from every direction on social media, claiming to clear up your skin and add shine to your hair under a fancy new (and sometimes expensive) showerhead. So we wanted to know if experts thinks they really make a difference. Scientific research and water testing in the United States provides evidence that the water we shower with may contain contaminants that adversely affect the health of your skin, hair and potentially your overall health, particularly related to the amount of chlorine in the water along with other bacteria, chemicals and minerals. Angela Stiegler, a water infrastructure scientist, added that “although the water that arrives at your home from your local utility is safe to drink, in some cases, an at-home filtration system can be beneficial for your skin and hair because some water sources have more ‘hardness’ than others. Hard water contains more calcium and magnesium minerals than ‘soft’ water.” According to Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group (EWG) who researches contaminants in water, “Hard water, or water that contains higher levels of calcium or magnesium, can cause skin dryness or cause skin to be more sensitive.” In a previously reported HuffPost story, Dr. Brandon Kirsch, a board-certified dermatologist at Kirsch Dermatology in Naples, Florida, confirmed that hard water “can have cosmetic and dermatological effects, such as drying out hair and skin or exacerbating conditions like eczema. ... Chlorine and hard water minerals can also strip away natural oils from your hair, leaving it looking dull, and chlorine in particular can cause colored hair to fade faster.” Hard water can make shampoos, conditioners and cleansers “less effective and react with those products to form mineral build-up, which might irritate some people’s skin,” Stiegler added. “You’ll notice that if you have hard water at home, you can’t get as much lather or sudsiness with shampoos and cleansers, and your hair or skin just doesn’t feel as clean.” If you’re wondering about the state of the water coming out of your own shower or sink faucets, you can check the water contaminants in your area at www.ewg.org. You can also check the hardness of your water with home testing kits, which allow you to test water from multiple sources in your home. Solutions range from whole house systems to more affordable and “portable” systems for those who may not be homeowners. Let’s get into the different kinds of filters, what they remove and their efficacies. Studies have shown that charcoal is effective in removing chlorine, heavy metals and organic pollutants from water, and an activated charcoal system is a good option if you are a renter and not investing in something long-term. Charcoal water filters can be found in showerheads and showerhead filters, which attach between the wall spout and your current showerhead. A true filter, like the AquaYouth 2.0 filter ($60), fits 99.9% of showerheads, including hand-held units. It’s important to note that regular maintenance and filter replacement is required with a charcoal system ― filters need to be replaced about every six months. If you opt for a showerhead with the filter integrated, Canopy ($150) has a high rating of 4.8 stars. Canopy recommends filter replacements (which cost $65 for a two-pack) every 90 days. Your other option is a whole-house filtration system, like a reverse osmosis system, which can run you thousands of dollars and can use up to four times the amount of water than you’d use without a system, due to pushing so much water through the system in the filtration process. This can also reduce the water pressure in your faucets. The bottom line is that if you have hard water and can’t get your hair and skin products to work well, experts agree it’s worth giving water filtration a try. And luckily, that can be done by something as simple as trying a new showerhead. Take a look at the options below to find one for your budget.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-make-brown-rice-better_l_65d8e0e9e4b0189a6a7dc69e","This 1 Simple Step Makes Brown Rice Taste Infinitely Better","robin asbell","2024-03-04","If you’re one of the many people who doesn’t like brown rice, you might be missing out on enjoying a nutritious food because you’ve skipped a step in the kitchen. Making tender, nutty-tasting brown rice takes one little trick that costs zero pennies. The step that is so important, and often overlooked, is simple: just take the pan off the heat and let the cooked rice sit, covered, for about 10 minutes to finish steaming. This also applies to other whole grains, like farro, wheat berries and sorghum. I wanted to find out the science behind what’s going on in that pot, so I asked Cameron Jacobs of the USA Rice Federation. “Brown rice has the nutritious and hearty bran layer surrounding the endosperm intact. The act of allowing it to sit covered allows the brown rice kernels to absorb additional moisture from all the steam and leaves the consumer with an optimal mouthfeel for brown rice and a much less chewy grain than if you were to eat directly after all the water was absorbed.” I also asked Harold McGee, author of the seminal book ”On Food & Cooking: The Science & Lore of the Kitchen,” and a food chemistry expert. “It takes time for the absorbed water to become distributed evenly throughout the grains and hydrate the starch at the center; and serving the hot rice immediately will cause it to evaporate away some near-surface moisture as visible steam, leaving the bran a little drier and firmer. I actually don’t mind that contrast in texture, but the 5-10 minute rest does give you a more evenly cooked pot.” First, you do need to rinse the rice. All grains rub against each other during shipping, scraping fine particles loose. To remove it, simply place your rice in a bowl, cover with cool water by an inch or two, and swish the rice around with your hands. Pour off the water and drain in a wire mesh strainer. Because brown rice is coated with a bran layer, where all that sturdy fiber resides, brown rice and whole grains can benefit from soaking overnight, or even for an hour or so. If you’re in a hurry and didn’t plan ahead, you can skip it. If you’ve heard that whole grains should be soaked to remove phytates, which might prevent absorption of some nutrients, don’t worry. According to registered dietician Kelly LeBlanc, “From a nutritional standpoint, the concern around phytates and mineral absorption seems to be overblown. Regularly eating a diet high in phytates may limit this ‘anti-nutrient’ eﬀect, as shown in a 2015 study in the Journal of Nutrition. Since phytates are found naturally in plants, it’s not surprising to learn that they may also have some antioxidant and anti-cancer properties. In my own personal kitchen, I’ll try to give long-cooking grains like sorghum, barley, and wheat berries a soak to help reduce their cooking time. But if I happen to forget, it’s not something I lose sleep over – my meals are still yummy.” The absorption method looks like this: Simply boil 2 cups water, add 1 cup rice, return to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, set a timer for 35 minutes and cook, covered, until the water is absorbed. Then let it stand for 10 minutes. If you prefer “pasta-style” cooking, you bring a pot of water to a boil, add the grain and boil until tender, then drain. Then, be sure to return the hot grain to the pot, cover and let stand for 10 minutes. If you have a standard rice cooker, it will turn itself off when the water has absorbed, and you should give it 10 minutes to finish steaming then. Multifunction rice cookers, like Zojirushi, have built-in soaking and steaming to the program for brown rice. In an Instant Pot or pressure cooker, use a 1:1 ratio of brown rice to water, and let the pot release naturally, for a final steam. If you’re still on the fence about cooking brown rice instead of white, just know that its rep as a “health food” is well-deserved. According to Emily Ho, a distinguished professor of nutrition at the College of Health at Oregon State University, “Because it still has the hull, bran layer and germ intact compared to processed white rice, it is packed full of nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium, potassium and iron. It also is a great source of dietary fiber that can help your gut health. Consumption of brown rice is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared to intake of white rice, and lowering of blood glucose.” What a difference a few minutes can make!

The MSNBC host, a former Biden White House press secretary, took a “bit of a deep dive” into McConnell’s “unwavering devotion to winning and winning at any cost” Sunday. She started with his support of campaign finance reform in the 1970s. “[He was] denouncing the cancer of the corrupting influence of money and politics, only to do a complete 180 in the U.S. Senate, where he became instrumental in opening up our politics to the flood of special interest dark money,” said Psaki. She also noted he once was a defender of the Voting Rights Act, which he had described as a “landmark piece of legislation” in 2006. “And yet, McConnell has blocked all attempts to rebuild the law after conservatives on the Supreme Court, of course, gutted portions in 2013,” Psaki said. “This all adds up” for the Kentucky Republican, Psaki said, arguing that McConnell realized that opposing campaign finance reform “would mean raising far more unrestricted money” that could help him politically and that “suppressing the vote might help Republicans win elections.” ""A cynic focused on power… only to be swallowed by the monster that he enabled to obtain it.""@jrpsaki on the real legacy of Mitch McConnell pic.twitter.com/IqfbX8xIZE She later referred to him having “stonewalled” President Barack Obama’s appointment for Supreme Court justice in 2016 and seeing former President Donald Trump as the “means to an end” when it comes to filling federal courts with conservatives. Psaki described McConnell as leaving his post in a “diminished” state. She added that there’s been a lack of action on new Ukraine aid “despite his insistence” and the inability to pass a bipartisan border bill. “And yet despite all that McConnell thinks about Trump, which we know, he’s already said that if he is the Republican nominee he will support him,” Psaki said.

Vance (R-Ohio) boasted on X (formerly Twitter) about having a “long memory” as he warned colleagues against attacking Donald Trump. But Vance’s post immediately went viral for all the wrong reasons, seeing as it conveniently ignored his own past trashing of the former president. “If you’re fighting Trump and his endorsed candidates politically today, don’t ask my help in a year with your legislation or your pet projects,” the “Hillbilly Elegy” author warned. A reader-added community note was soon added to the post. I have a long memory. If you’re fighting Trump and his endorsed candidates politically today, don’t ask for my help in a year with your legislation or your pet projects. “Vance has publicly called Trump an ‘idiot,’ ‘reprehensible’ and ‘noxious,’” it recalled. “In Facebook messages, Vance wrote ‘I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn’t be that bad… or that he’s America’s Hitler.’” Indeed, Vance was a fierce critic of Trump ahead of the 2016 election. He called himself a “Never Trump guy” who “will never vote for Trump.” Trump’s policies, meanwhile, ranged from “immoral to absurd,” he added at the time. Vance later went full MAGA with his 2022 run for Senate, though. Trump rewarded him with an endorsement.

The former president “has never evolved beyond the kind of person he was when he was very young, and it’s not at all surprising because he grew up in an authoritarian household,” Mary Trump told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an interview that was broadcast at the weekend. It’s “one of the things that should worry everybody about Donald,” the Republican front-runner’s niece claimed. Mary Trump, who has become a fierce critic of her uncle, described her grandfather Fred Trump as “a quite straight-up sociopath.” As “favorite son,” Donald Trump therefore “knew what he needed to do in order to stay on my grandfather’s good side,” she explained. “Because he also understood what would happen to him if he didn’t,” she added. “So he [Donald Trump] is very comfortable in this milieu and it is extremely important to him that he get the benefits of associating with strong men like [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor] Orbán and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, but also that he be on their good side.” Last week, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull recalled his unease at seeing Trump fawn over Putin on multiple occasions. Turnbull called it “really creepy.” It is “really no laughing matter when, at that point the leader of the free world is being described as a pre-pubescent child with a crush on an older, more powerful person,” Mary Trump said of Turnbull’s comments. Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull: “When you see Trump with Putin, as I have on a few occasions, he’s like the 12-year-old boy that goes to high school and meets the captain of the football team. ‘My hero!’ It’s really creepy.”pic.twitter.com/x89ogncwQz By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Primary Loss To Haley Is Mercilessly Mocked","lee moran","2024-03-04","Former President Donald Trump’s spin on losing Sunday’s GOP presidential primary in Washington, D.C., to Nikki Haley was summed up by many critics with one word, “pathetic.” Following Trump’s first loss to Haley, the Republican 2024 front-runner’s campaign said “the swamp has claimed their queen” and claimed she only won thanks to “the lobbyists and D.C. insiders that want to protect the failed status quo.” Trump himself then ranted on his Truth Social platform that he’d “purposely stayed away from the D.C. Vote because it is the ‘Swamp,’ with very few delegates, and no upside.” “Birdbrain spent all of her time, money and effort there,” he continued, using his derogatory nickname for his former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Over the weekend we won Missouri, Idaho, and Michigan - BIG NUMBERS - Complete destruction of a very weak opponent. The really big numbers will come on Super Tuesday. Also, WAY UP ON CROOKED JOE!” he added. Trump wrote in a second post: “Birdbrain is a loser, record low performance in virtually every State. DeSanctus easily beat her in Iowa for a VERY DISTANT second place, and then she ran up to the podium, before he had a chance to do so, and claimed victory.” He continued, “I enjoy watching the Bird disavow her PLEDGE to the RNC and her statement that she would NEVER run against President Trump (‘A great President’). “Well, she ran, she lied, and she LOST BIG!” Critics responded in not so kind: Cry harder, you pathetic loser. pic.twitter.com/C40Vr7u904 YOU CAN'T HANDLE LOSS, TRUMP!

Steele, co-host of MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” flipped to a clip of the former president claiming that MAGA “represents 96% and maybe 100%” of the Republican Party as he spoke to supporters at a Virginia rally Saturday. “We’re getting rid of the Romneys of the world, we want to get Romneys – and those out,” said the GOP front-runner of the Utah senator who recently remarked that he would “absolutely not” vote for Trump in November. “But they know that we are the only ones who can stop them.” Steele, in response, noted that he’s a decadeslong member of the Republican Party before taking a swipe at Trump. “If anyone is the biggest RINO, it’s you, and we comin’ for you,” Steele said. “So, just so you understand, you drew the line, baby. I’m stepping up to it and a whole lot of Republicans out there –– at least 40% or more –– are stepping to that line, too. So you just need to chill on that.” Co-host Symone Sanders-Townsend added that Steele, a long-time critic of the former president, was putting Trump “on notice” before the ex-RNC chair chimed back in. “Just on notice — you bring it, baby, ’cause you wanna punk? Let’s punk, baby. Let’s go, one-on-one.” Co-host Alicia Menendez went on to note a post on X from Sarah Longwell, founder of the Republican Accountability Project, who pointed to former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake’s criticism of John McCain voters. “I forget, is she the Governor of Arizona right now, or no?” Longwell wrote in response to the Trump clip Sunday. “We’ve already seen this movie play out when you say, ‘We are not a big tent and we don’t want you at our table,’” Menendez said. Steele added that Trump — whom he called “the biggest RINO in the room” — has duped supporters into thinking he’s “somehow the conservative standard bearer.” “You want to try to build a party and grow it? You’re not doing it. You’re shrinking. What elections have you won? What elections have you won? None, except your own. And you’re not winning this one because you didn’t win the last one,” Steele said. The next four years will change America forever.

The two animals on the lam caused an unusual traffic jam Saturday afternoon as they wove through slowing traffic and then stopped it on Interstate 90 in the downtown Cleveland area. Cleveland.com reports that video from the Ohio Department of Transportation showed the animals trotting on the side of the road near the unit’s stables at about 12:15 p.m. Saturday. Another video showed them headed westbound in the eastbound interstate lanes, slowing and then halting traffic. The camera follows the animals, ultimately trailed by a police cruiser with flashing lights, heading further along the highway and then down an onramp before cutting across a grassy section onto a side street and out of view. Cleveland Police Sgt. Wilfredo Diaz told reporters that the horses were members of the department’s mounted division. He said they “inadvertently strayed” during “routine care and exercise.” “Mounted officers promptly recovered both horses, ensuring their safety, and no further incidents ensued,” Diaz said. Video of the horseplay prompted a good deal of online hilarity, with even the transportation department getting into the snarky act. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lee-speigel-ufo-journalist-huffpost-weird-news_n_64dce763e4b0eb9f33d7ec02","Famed UFO Reporter Puts Skeptics On Blast With A Defiant Final Act","david moye","2024-03-04","When Lee Speigel arrived in New York City in the early 1970s, there was a word for people who reported seeing a UFO ― “kooks.” The world this 74-year-old man left behind on Aug. 14, after a battle with esophageal cancer, has vastly changed. Politicians, scientists and law enforcement officials are no longer laughing at those who say they’ve witnessed an unexplained phenomenon. Just weeks before Speigel’s death, military whistleblowers testified before a congressional committee, claiming the government has secretly retrieved and reverse-engineered unidentified flying objects. And though the Pentagon denied those claims, it soon unveiled a website devoted to sightings of unidentified flying objects. As 2023 drew to a close, Congress ordered all files on UFOs ― now classified as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) ― released within 25 years so long as there was no Oval Office objection. These are files that government officials barely acknowledged in years past ― and information Speigel and other UFO investigators spent their lives in search of. NASA still maintains that there’s no proof UFOs are the work of extraterrestrials, but it’s a conversation that can no longer be ignored. To be sure, no single person can take credit for shifting public opinion, but Speigel’s contributions over his 60-year career stand out. He is renowned as the first person to organize and host a conference at the United Nations on UFOs, attended by dignitaries from around the world. “Lee sought out interviews with military officers, commercial airline pilots and the best sources he could find. These people put their credibility on the line when they claimed they saw something in the sky that defied explanation,” said Buck Wolf, director of HuffPost Trends, who also worked with Speigel at ABC News. “Lee might be the only UFO writer and researcher from his generation to make the jump into mainstream journalism. At NBC Radio, ABC News and HuffPost, his colleagues looked at him with skepticism and amusement. But he also earned their respect,” Wolf said. Wolf and Speigel’s widow, Lorraine Simone, raised more than $10,000 from friends, family and admirers for one final tribute — to send Speigel’s cremated ashes into space. His remains will be loaded on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, scheduled for launch on March 4 at Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California. Speigel’s ashes will circle the Earth every 90 minutes at roughly 17,000 to 17,500 miles per hour on a mission slated to last two to three years and will burn up upon reentry, “like a shooting star,” said Dan Peabody, CEO of Beyond Burials, the company administering Speigel’s funeral service. “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry, along with original cast members James Doohan and Nichelle Nichols; noted astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, best known for discovering Pluto; and 1960s counterculture hero Timothy Leary are among those who have also had space funerals. “Anyone who knew Lee knows he wanted to get into space somehow, especially after William Shatner did it,” said Simone. “I’m sure Lee is somewhere enjoying all this immensely.” Shatner, who portrayed the legendary Capt. Kirk on “Star Trek,” was 90 when he became the oldest man to voyage to space on a 2021 Blue Origin launch. In addition to the space funeral, Speigel’s friends and family organized and shipped his massive archive of taped interviews and case files to the National UFO Historical Records Center in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. Cmdr. Allan Palmer, a retired Air Force and Navy combat aviator, now serves as CEO and executive director at the National Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas. He thinks Speigel’s work is worthy of further study. Palmer consulted with Speigel in 2013 when creating the museum’s Area 51 exhibit. Area 51 is the now-famous top-secret site set up by the CIA and Air Force in 1955, which looms large in UFO lore. In the 1950s and 1960s, if a commercial pilot saw an aircraft flying at 70,000 feet or traveling at three times the speed of sound, it certainly would have seemed like otherworldly technology, Palmer said. Yet it wasn’t until 2013 that the government started acknowledging what was going on there. “Lee did so much in telling the story responsibly,” Palmer said. “Yet even with all we know today, there are still many unanswered mysteries.” Speigel’s personal journey is almost as amazing as some of the stories he covered. As a teen in Concord, New Hampshire, in the late 1960s, Elliot “Lee” Speigel was obsessed with the Apollo space program. But it was his other childhood love that brought him to New York City: folk music. By the early 1970s, he was singing and playing guitar on the same Greenwich Village stages that Bob Dylan and Harry Belafonte had been performing on a few years earlier. He went by the stage name Happy Day. Like any aspiring musician in the big city, Speigel scrambled to pay bills, working at times as a waiter, bartender and NBC page. He also put his tenor voice and audio production skills to use, crafting radio station ads and commercial jingles. In his downtime, Speigel devoured everything he could find on UFOs, but, except for sci-fi camp, all he could find were stray news clippings and paperback books. It struck him that there were no solid, feature-length recordings of some of the most credible UFO witnesses. He was soon pitching himself as the guy with the audio production skills to put that project together. By 1975, Speigel was traveling the country, conducting interviews that would become the CBS documentary record album “UFOs: The Credibility Factor,” featuring scientists, military personnel and aviation experts who admitted seeing things that defied explanation. Speigel focused extensively on the notorious July 1947 incident in Roswell, New Mexico, when the military seemed to admit — and then abruptly deny — that it had recovered the debris of an aircraft “not of this Earth.” In one of Speigel’s field assignments, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, a scientific adviser to the Air Force’s UFO study, Project Blue Book, invited him to North Carolina to investigate what the UFO website Rogue Planet described as “a spate of UFO sightings observed by local law enforcement.” During the trip, Speigel and multiple officers saw what he described as “the first well-documented UFO incident in the U.S. involving a triangle or boomerang-shaped UFO and multiple witnesses.” Speigel would joke years later that what they saw in the sky that day resembled “flying Doritos.” Speigel was hawking his UFO audio documentary album on late-night TV commercials in 1978 when he was invited by the island nation of Grenada to organize a meeting at the United Nations, attended by dignitaries from around the world, including U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. “Lee made a major contribution by organizing the U.N. meeting, which he is so well known for,” said Leslie Kean, author of the 2011 New York Times bestseller “UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record” and co-author of a 2017 New York Times investigative piece that revealed a secret Pentagon project to study UFOs. “He was one of the few reporters who had a platform to do regular stories on UFOs and related topics,” Kean said. By the late 1970s, Speigel’s work caught the eye of future MTV CEO Bob Pittman. In one of the most memorable nights of his life, they attended a party with comedian Richard Belzer. Together, they conceived of the late-night NBC Radio show “Edge of Reality,” hosted by Speigel, though at first he was billed only as “The Alien,” for promotional purposes. “There has always been huge interest in UFOs ― but not much info or ongoing dialogue, even more so way back then,” Pittman told HuffPost by email. “This was an attempt to tap into that for our audience.” Speigel dressed as a super-sized space lizard at promotional events to the delight of fans around New York City. If his shiny spacesuit looked a bit familiar, it’s because it was designed by the same NBC wardrobe team that threw together “Saturday Night Live’s” Conehead costumes. “It started as a gimmick, hence the name and suit. But [it] morphed into more serious reporting with Lee as the expert,” Pittman explained. “Did it change my views? Not sure, but it sure got me more interested,” said Pittman, adding that he thought Speigel was “a great human” who was “nice, considerate and thoughtful, as well as fun and funny.” Speigel shared an NBC studio briefly with notorious shock jock Howard Stern, who would occasionally go off on his otherworldly colleague. “He’d have people on from Mars,” Stern recalled in a hilarious 1992 on-air rant. “It was always UFOs. Every week. It’d be a whole show on UFOs. ... I’d say to him, ‘Have you seen a UFO?’” Stern denied that Speigel ever gave him a satisfactory answer. In an eight-year period beginning in 1978, Speigel recorded roughly 1,500 hours of local and national programming, interviewing actors William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, astronomers, astronauts and others who had something to say about the search for intelligent life in the universe. In that time, when Stephen Spielberg was working on projects like “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,” Spielberg had Speigel flown out to his home. “Lee had his share of celebrity fans. Robin Leach would visit when Lee he was in New York, not to discuss lifestyles of the rich and famous, but to go UFO hunting,” Wolf said. “One time, Lee invited a few of us HuffPosters to go see ZZ Top, and it was because the band wanted Lee to stay after the show and talk about space aliens.” When “Edge of Reality” ended, Speigel remained at NBC Radio in New York working on science and human interest stories while also contributing to Omni magazine. He joined ABC Radio Networks in the late 1990s, eventually moving to ABCNews.com as a copy editor. In 2010, when Wolf offered Speigel a chance to write freelance articles on unexplained phenomena for AOL News, he quit ABC, even though that meant giving up his health insurance. He was eventually brought on to The Huffington Post (now HuffPost) as a full-time reporter, winning the 2012 International UFO Congress Researcher of the Year award. In his six years at The Huffington Post, Speigel was able to get astronauts Edgar Mitchell, Alan Bean and Leroy Chiao to go on the record about UFOs, as well as luminaries, like actor Morgan Freeman, who opined that, “We may already be in the midst of a growing zombie apocalypse.” “In the newsroom, Lee stuck out like a sore thumb. He was a showman, and he pitched so many out-there stories,” Wolf said, recalling that Speigel’s desk was festooned with “Star Wars” toys and a giant statue of a spaceling, which he called the Alien Butler. “Other reporters were sometimes skeptical, but Lee wouldn’t have had a second career as a copy editor and proofreader at major news outlets if he wasn’t trusted,” Wolf said. The span of Speigel’s work is hard to describe. One Huffington Post story was headlined, “Hey, Even a Yeti Needs to Pee Sometime.” Another favorite among his colleagues was when Swedish rapper Elliphant asked him to discuss “alien sex” in a Rolling Stone interview. That’s not to say that all of Speigel’s wild stories panned out. At one Huffington Post editorial meeting, jaws dropped when he said he was on the verge of uncovering a vast, multinational conspiracy, which involved high-ranking U.N. officials, to cover up the crash-landing of a spacecraft. HuffPost senior editor Andy Campbell recalled telling Speigel at the meeting, “If there were ever a time to burn your sources and report what you have for the good of humanity, it’s now, Lee. The Earth needs you more than ever.” Nevertheless, in the community of UFO enthusiasts — both the sci-fi pop culture enthusiasts and the committed researchers who believe the truth is out there — Speigel was a legend. “He was a great journalist,” George Noory, host of “Coast to Coast AM,” told HuffPost. “He understood the paranormal better than anyone. He was doing it years before I started.” As a career capstone, Speigel revived “Edge of Reality” on the UN-X Digital Broadcast Network, pushing forward his research and conversations. Speigel also helped write and produce “The Phenomenon,” a James Fox documentary that featured interviews with former White House chief of staff John Podesta and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who admitted a lot of evidence “hasn’t seen the light of day.” Speigel’s UN-X producer, Race Hobbs, said his work needs to be preserved and built upon. “He never led witnesses, but, if they strayed, he could steer them. He knew what was important for people not familiar with the subject,” adding that Speigel was “a genius.” In the final months of his life, Speigel also helped author Marc Hartzman with his book “We Are Not Alone,” a look at humanity’s evolving views on UFOs going back to biblical times. “Lee opened doors no one else could,” Hartzman said. With Speigel’s interviews and case files now in the hands of the National UFO Historical Records Center, other researchers and journalists will soon have access to his work. Simone, Wolf and other friends and family are planning to gather in Santa Barbara County on March 4 for the launch of Speigel’s ashes. Speigel and Simone, who met in 1982, dated on and off for more than three decades before tying the knot in 2019 on the east end of Long Island. She still recalls when he wandered into the Manhattan magic shop where she was working. Speigel did not enter the store to purchase a magic potion. He was seeking an advertiser for his NBC radio show. Simone quickly recognized him, not by his striking resemblance to a young Al Pacino, but by his voice. “Lee used to do the voiceovers in radio ads for Omni magazine, and every time I heard it, I would turn up the volume because I loved his voice,” Simone said.

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) slammed the Supreme Court’s decision to hear arguments from former President Donald Trump that he is immune from prosecution for any actions he took in the White House. Raskin told MSNBC’s Jen Psaki on Sunday he believed a lower court’s decision on the matter was already “completely exhaustive and totally compelling.” Trump has argued he cannot be prosecuted on charges he attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election, seeking to lean on an unprecedented and broad interpretation of presidential immunity. A three-judge panel on the D.C. Court of Appeals unanimously rejected that argument last month, but the Supreme Court agreed to decide on Trump’s claims last week. Arguments are set for the week of April 22, which effectively freezes special counsel Jack Smith’s case against Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and will likely push any eventual trial until much later in the year. “This was an obvious case not to take up, and just let the D.C. Circuit Court ruling stand,” Raskin said on MSNBC’s “Inside with Jen Psaki.” “We don’t have a king here, we had a revolution against a king and the Constitution is written so that [the] president’s main job is to take care the laws are faithfully executed, not faithfully violated in his own interest.” .@jrpsaki: ""Do you look at this court and think some of these justices want to delay these trials?""@RepRaskin: ""Yeah. If you don't believe that, you're too innocent to be let out of the house by yourself at this point."" pic.twitter.com/Z0YI3r0cJH Trump has largely moved to delay his trials on dozens of charges leveled against him in four different indictments. If he wins reelection and has not been tried, he could order the Justice Department to dismiss the federal cases against him or try to pardon himself. Raskin laid blame for the Supreme Court’s move on the three justices nominated during Trump’s presidency and others under former President George W. Bush. When Psaki asked the lawmaker if he believed some on the court also wanted to see a delay in Trump’s trials, Raskin said you only had to look at the court’s recent rulings.

In a behind-the-scenes look at her 2024 Super Bowl halftime performance, the Grammy winner told her hair and makeup team about how her “pushy” nine-year-old Genesis Dean had been angling to befriend the “Bad Guy” singer. After what Keys said was three days of pestering, she agreed to text Eilish a video of her son where introduced himself and said, “Hi, my name is Genesis and I really like your music. And I’m Alicia Keys’ son.” Laughing at Genesis’ boldness, Keys cackled as she watched the video with her beauty team and showed them her accompanying text to Eilish. “Someone wanted me to send you this message,” it read. “I hope it makes you smile. How are you, beautiful? Big love!” A little too eager to connect with the artist, Keys said Genesis prodded her to see if he got a response “over and over” again. “I said no, it takes a minute,” she recalled telling him. “She likes to take time, reconnect. It’s all good.” Much to the annoyance of his mother, Genesis decided to take it upon himself and text Eilish a simple “Hi” from her phone. “Don’t bother the girl,” Keys said she told her son. “She’ll write back if she can write back.” But as she sat in the makeup chair getting ready for the Super Bowl stage, the “Girl On Fire” singer got the reply Genesis had been waiting for. “Genesis, it’s Billie,” Eilish responded in a video beside her brother and producing partner, Finneas. “I’m ready to be your friend any day.” “I would like to be your friend,” she said eagerly, as Finneas chanted Genesis’ name in the background. “Alicia is my friend, I love her. I love you. Let’s hang out and be friends.” Keys and Eilish go back to at least 2019, when they performed a duet of the song “Ocean Eyes” during an episode of “The Late Late Show With James Corden.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

GOP Presidential Primary","jennifer bendery","2024-03-03","WASHINGTON – Nikki Haley on Sunday defeated Donald Trump in the GOP presidential primary in Washington, D.C., her first win against the former president. It’s a relatively tiny victory, one Trump will almost certainly use to portray Haley as a creature of the D.C. swamp. D.C.’s 19 delegates will now cast their votes for her at the Republican National Convention in July. That’s out of 2,429 delegates, and so far, Trump has trounced her in all of the other state GOP primaries. Right on cue, shortly after Haley’s win was announced, Trump’s campaign said her victory means “the swamp has claimed their queen.” “While Nikki has been soundly rejected throughout the rest of America, she was just crowned Queen of the Swamp by the lobbyists and DC insiders that want to protect the failed status quo,” Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for Trump’s campaign, said in a statement. Trump has a total of 244 delegates and Haley now has 43. Whoever is first to hit 1,215 delegates will be the Republican presidential nominee. Trump is expected to get much closer following this week’s Super Tuesday primaries, where polls show him dominating from coast to coast. But Haley’s win counts for something. For starters, unbelievably, she is now the first woman to ever win a Republican presidential primary. Her ability to defeat Trump in any primary means he can’t celebrate a clean sweep, which, as petty as it sounds, is almost certainly going to infuriate him and delight his critics. And for Haley’s supporters in D.C., it’s a sign that there’s enough of them, even if in this small election, to send the message that they reject the MAGA grip on their party. “It matters for her to win in D.C. because I think it’s going to frustrate Trump more and more,” said Cherry, 66, who was one of about 250 people at a Haley campaign event in D.C. on Friday afternoon. She asked to use her first name only. “I’ve never hated a politician, but I hate Donald Trump,” she said. “This is America’s Hitler.” A Haley victory in D.C.’s GOP primary would “put our little group on the map,” said Dennis Paul, an 84-year-old semi-retired resident. “She seems to grasp things very well,” he said. “She’s obviously good on fiscal policy. She’s vibrant and exciting.” Joe, a long-time D.C. resident, praised Haley for her “message of real vigor and understanding of the issues.” He said he wants her to stay in the race as long as possible, even though it’s unlikely she can win. “First of all, she’s not Joe Biden. Secondly, she’s not Donald Trump,” said Joe, who is in his 60s and who also requested only using his first name, but confirmed his last name is not “Biden.” “Anywhere ― anywhere ― she can win and show momentum would be great,” Joe said of Haley. Some attendees at Haley’s event said she has come to represent something much bigger than herself. Antonia Ferrier, a former longtime senior aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the late Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), is now a major donor to Haley’s campaign. She said it’s clear there is a faction of voters who “feel almost voiceless in the Republican Party.” She rattled off recent polling that has deeply frustrated her: Nearly 70% of Americans don’t want a Biden-Trump rematch in November. Nearly 60% think they’re both too old. More than 40% of voters are registering as independent, tying a record high in 2014. “There is a collective scream in this country,” said Ferrier, who is currently an executive at a GOP nonprofit focused on advancing democracy. “It’s like a collective scream for a leader we can be proud of. But the established political class refuses to listen to it because of their own feedback loops or whatever fucking reason, and Haley is giving voice to that.” Ferrier said she wants the former South Carolina governor to stay in the race as long as she can, because “she is an affirmation of the politics saying there is a better way. She gets it. It’s clear she understands it.” “There is another way for our country,” she emphasized. Haley herself made this point at her campaign event on Friday. “We don’t have to live the way we’re living now,” she told the room, to applause. “But we need to be part of the solution. We’re gonna fight for Super Tuesday.” But what is Haley’s endgame, if it’s clear she can’t defeat Trump in the Republican primary but is continuing to campaign and raise money?

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jason-galanis-biden-impeachment-inquiry_n_65e778f0e4b0d2a2475ae706","Republicans Go To Bat For Federal Prisoner Who Testified In Biden Impeachment Inquiry","arthur delaney","2024-03-05","WASHINGTON — House Republicans are chasing a new lead in their impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden, sending official demands for information about how the Justice Department handled a federal prisoner’s requests for home confinement. Impeachment investigators interviewed Jason Galanis last month at a federal prison in Alabama, where Galanis, who claimed to have been a business partner of Hunter Biden’s, is serving a 14-year sentence for his roles in two multimillion-dollar fraud schemes. Galanis claimed during the interview that his request for home confinement last year had been rejected in order to prevent him from talking to Republicans searching for evidence of Joe Biden’s involvement in his son’s business deals. “I’ve been the victim of a pattern of retribution by the Department of Justice in order to prevent my home confinement, which would have allowed full and free access to congressional investigators,” Galanis said, according to an interview transcript. Despite the Justice Department granting Republicans’ request for an interview with Galanis and talking to him for four hours, some GOP figures still think there’s something fishy going on. In a letter from House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and Judiciary Committee member Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), the three said they were investigating Galanis’ allegations “and will take seriously any attempt by [the Bureau of Prisons] to obstruct the Committees’ inquiry, including by retaliating against witnesses.” The letter was sent Tuesday to the director of the BOP and the U.S. attorney’s office for the southern district of New York, which prosecuted Galanis. The U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment. The BOP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Galanis testimony and follow-up letter represent one of the more unusual rabbit holes Republicans have followed in their quest for incriminating evidence against the president. They have also interviewed a New York gallerist who sold paintings by Hunter Biden and the trustee of a bankrupt health care company that once hired the president’s brother. The gallerist and trustee (along with a series of other witnesses) have said they were unaware of Joe Biden being involved in his family’s business schemes. Republicans’ most serious allegation ― that the Bidens solicited bribes from a Ukrainian oligarch ― imploded last month when the Justice Department said an informant had made them up. Galanis testified that from 2012 to 2015, he partnered in business with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, a friend of Hunter’s, on a scheme to rake in billions from overseas private equity investors. “The entire value add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden,” Galanis said, adding that he once witnessed Hunter Biden put his dad on speakerphone at a restaurant in the company of other business associates. “The Vice President said, ‘Hello,’ and some pleasantries, ‘Hope you had safe travels,’ and seemed like he wanted to bring the call to an end by saying, ‘Okay, you be good to my boy,’” Galanis said. As part of the venture, Galanis went on to say that he “engaged in unlawful conduct” and was sent to prison. In 2016, the Justice Department announced charges against Galanis, Archer and five others for defrauding a Native American tribe and pension fund managers in a self-enrichment scheme. Though the defendants used Hunter Biden’s famous last name to sell their plans, prosecutors didn’t press charges against him. His lawyers have said he wasn’t involved. In an interview last year, Archer told lawmakers that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone repeatedly in the company of clients, but the president only offered pleasantries and commentary on the weather — essentially the same thing Galanis said he witnessed. Archer said the elder Biden wasn’t involved in their work and that he was unaware of Joe Biden taking any action as a government official to benefit his son. In his own deposition last week, Hunter Biden said he did not partner with Galanis and that he only knew his name from news reports. “I think that 10 years ago, for 30 minutes, I was introduced to Jason Galanis, and that’s only ― the only time I ever recall meeting him,” he said. Republicans didn’t press for more. Though he wasn’t charged alongside Galanis and Archer, the Justice Department has charged Hunter Biden with crimes for failing to pay his taxes on time and for illegally owning a firearm in 2018 while he was addicted to crack cocaine. Prosecutors have suggested they may seek additional charges. Galanis said that while he was in a Florida prison last February, he applied for home confinement in California and was approved. However, the approval was reversed in July after Republicans announced their subpoena for Archer’s testimony. Galanis claimed that a former BOP official told him prosecutors weighed in on the request, and he said prison officials offered shifting justifications when they rejected his appeals. He said he received his current placement in Alabama in August after complaining of persistent sexual harassment from a prison staff member at the facility in Florida.

Although he’s been treated professionally at the Alabama prison, Galanis said his overall experience makes him suspect his past association with the president’s son has put a target on his back. “From the experiences I’ve had in the criminal justice system, I believe I am putting myself at grave risk within the BOP for providing information into these matters concerning the president and his son,” he said. Republicans first asked the BOP for time with Galanis in November, several months after his home confinement request had been denied and he had been transferred to Alabama.

No single or specific incident led to this decision. Our decision was made to prevent such a significant incident.” Fraternities and sororities are fighting back. In a statement to The Washington Post, three Greek organizations said that UMD hasn’t given an explanation for the suspension or allowed them to defend themselves. “This shut down was so sudden and we’re frustrated with no answers,” Spencer Doyle, chapter president of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, told The Washington Post. “It is not fair to chapters operating the right way.” According to national hazing statistics listed on UMD’s website, 95% of students who are hazed won’t report it. According to the Hazing Prevention Network, 55% of fraternity and sorority members will experience hazing.

Blackwell engaged in a pretty toxic relationship with fellow cast member Jimmy Presnell during Season 6, and their dynamic seemed to bring out the worst in both of them. Presnell was initially emotionally aloof with Blackwell, causing her to unleash all of her insecurities on screen, which was excruciating to watch. But even if Blackwell’s antics were annoying, it seems some fans have taken their dislike of her a tad too far. “You guys have every single right to, you know, have opinions on my life,” Blackwell said while addressing fans on Instagram last week. “But like, I don’t know, maybe cease the death threats for a minute? I don’t know, just a thought.” Earlier in her video, Blackwell acknowledged that she came off pretty cringe. “Let’s be honest … woof,” Blackwell said about watching herself on “Love is Blind” over a year after Season 6 was filmed. “Imagine spending the year really working on yourself, finding those inner demons, and really becoming the woman you’ve always wanted to be, sitting with hardships in your life that you’ve never really sat with before — and then having to relive it.

The actors were photographed together on a beach in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, over the weekend, as seen in photos published by E! News on Monday. The two were seen smiling and holding hands on the shoreline of a beach. One photo showed the pair embracing each other with their foreheads pressed together. Nyong’o and Jackson had previously fueled dating rumors in December, when they were seen holding hands while walking through Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California. They were also spotted together in a car ahead of a trip to the grocery store in Los Angeles that same month, as seen in photos published by TMZ. Prior to that, fans of the actors speculated about their relationship on social media in October, when they were photographed at a Janelle Monáe concert with a group of friends. They have yet to publicly comment on their relationship. Representatives for Jackson and Nyong’o did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jackson was previously married to fellow actor Jodie Turner-Smith. The “Queen & Slim” actor reportedly filed for divorce from Jackson in October, after more than three years of marriage. They share a 3-year-old daughter. Tuner-Smith publicly discussed her divorce from Jackson for the first time last month. “Sometimes things we really want to work just don’t end up working. And that’s OK,” she told U.K.’s Sunday Times Style. “The most important thing is that you choose what’s healthiest for you and your family and definitely your children.” In October, Nyong’o shared her “heartbreak” with her Instagram followers after her split from sports commentator Selema Masekela.

King, who plays Leslie Bennett on “Euphoria,” said during a recent stand-up show that she doesn’t know when fans can expect new episodes of the show. “Season 3 is coming out — I don’t f**king know,” the actor and comedian said, as seen in a TikTok video she shared Monday. “Don’t ask me, I don’t know. It’s one of those things. People are like, ‘We need Season 3.’ I’m like, ‘Bitch, I need Season 3.’ I haven’t paid my rent in six months.” King then took a playful dig at her co-star, Zendaya, who plays her character’s daughter, Rue Bennett. “Zendaya’s over in Paris at Fashion Week,” she quipped. “I’m like, ‘Bitch, come home! I need you. Mama needs you!’” A two-time Emmy winner, Zendaya has been making the red carpet rounds on both sides of the Atlantic to promote “Dune: Part Two,” which also stars Austin Butler, Timothée Chalamet and Florence Pugh. Although King’s bit about Zendaya was meant in jest, she said her recent lack of steady employment was no laughing matter: “I haven’t booked nothing since ‘Euphoria.’ This is some bullshit.” “Euphoria” was officially renewed for a third season in early 2022. In November, however, HBO’s CEO Casey Bloys clarified that that the series wouldn’t return until 2025, partly as a result of the actors and writers strikes that brought most of Hollywood to a standstill last year. Since then, many of the show’s actors, including Colman Domingo and Jacob Elordi, have shared their thoughts on the delay. “[Creator Sam Levinson] is a person who writes and rewrites and writes and rewrites again, because I think he’s wrestling with what’s important,” Domingo, an Oscar nominee for Netflix’s “Rustin,” told GQ last month. “He’s responding immediately to what the ills of the world are. I know that the one thing I can tell you is that he’s very much interested in the existential question of who we are right now. Our souls. That’s what he wants to figure out with Season 3.” Elordi, who plays teen jock Nate Jacobs, joked to “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon in January that the “Euphoria” creative team might have to find a way to de-age him if the production delay was extended.

The attack killed her 3-year-old granddaughter, who had been sitting with Thari as she made bread for her family, and wounded Thari so badly that emergency workers put her in a body bag ― only realizing she was alive when her grieving sister noticed Thari’s eyes were still moving. Medical teams moved Thari and her injured husband from hospitals in Gaza to an Italian hospital ship, then to Egypt and eventually Qatar. She’s now had five surgeries, and is awaiting one more in her back. “If I had the option to stop treatment, I would go back in a heartbeat,” Thari, 39, told HuffPost last week. In addition to the concern for her children, her “heart burns” for her parents, who are 70 and 75. “I’m not able to heal because of my mind and emotional state,” Thari said. “My therapist tells me to stop watching the news, but how can I stop? I have to check the lists of people being martyred. How can I stop?” Since Israel began its devastating U.S.-backed campaign in Gaza on Oct. 7, retaliating for a shock attack by Gaza-based Palestinian militants that killed some 1,200 people, only a handful of the region’s 2.3 million residents have gotten to safety. Up to a thousand are believed to be living in Egypt after relying on their dual nationalities or bribes to travel through the Rafah Crossing, currently the only functional pedestrian exit point into and out of Gaza. And medical and diplomatic personnel have overcome bureaucratic and logistical hurdles to evacuate some Palestinians, like Thari, who needed urgent, specialized care. About 700 Palestinian civilians ― among them 300 children ― are now in Qatar, local officials say, a group that comprises mostly wounded people but also some of their companions. In interviews with HuffPost in the Persian Gulf state, a U.S. ally that plans to treat at least 1,500 injured Gazans, evacuees described heartache over separation from their vulnerable loved ones, and deep disillusionment about the global response to Israel’s offensive. Despite Israel’s claims that its military operation is focused on the militant group Hamas, it has killed more than 30,000 people, most of them civilians, according to Palestinian authorities. Perched on a beanbag chair in the courtyard of a residential facility just a few miles from the offices where Israeli representatives have visited for U.S.-backed discussions about a possible truce with Hamas, a 30-year-old mother named Watfah described watching coverage of President Joe Biden discussing the prospect of a cease-fire on Feb. 26. “He’s doing it while eating ice cream, mocking us,” Watfah said. Thari had particular disdain for governments in the Middle East. Palestinians have traditionally looked to fellow Arab nations for support, but in recent years, Israel has successfully convinced several of those states to establish ties with it without an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. “The only reason this is happening to us is because of the silence of the Arabs,” Thari said, tearing up. “Arab leaders are too scared to stand up to Israel and America ... It’s like spraying pest control on animals, that’s how many people have died.” Views like these reflect not only how the ongoing war has traumatized Palestinians, but also a widespread wariness about discussions in Washington, regional capitals, and beyond about halting the fighting and negotiating a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. Simultaneously, the evacuees’ stories underscore the yearning for a respite among those who understand conditions in Gaza ― a goal that Biden and other key figures say they are working hard to achieve before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins on March 10. “Our hearts are still back in Gaza,” Thari said. “I die a hundred times a day for my kids.” Mohammed Obaid, 42, and his 13-year-old son Bahaa have been in Qatar since Jan. 18. Since they were hit by an Israeli airstrike on Nov. 6, both have had complex surgeries. Bahaa has lost his left leg and is hoping to soon get a prosthetic. “We’re tired,” Obaid said. “We just want peace.” He fought back tears remembering how he tried to hold his wife’s hand after the strike, and how he realized, once they were taken to a hospital, that she had lost too much spinal fluid to survive. Obaid’s uncle, a surgeon, was able to help him and Bahaa get to Egypt for treatment. But Obaid’s other children are still in Gaza, and he has only been able to speak to them once a week. Struggling to feed themselves, they always ask him what he and Bahaa have been able to eat. “They’re living with their uncle, but they need their father,” he told HuffPost. “They already lost their mom ― they need their father.” Many at the Qatari facility said reuniting with their loved ones was their chief priority. Some had already been separated from family members during the war, as more than 70% of Gaza’s population has been displaced into makeshift refuges amid Israeli evacuation orders, bombardments and troop advances. Naheel, 35, and her five children have only seen her husband for a handful of days since Oct. 7. On Oct. 11, a premonition prompted her to move with her kids into a U.N. school. Her husband didn’t want to abandon their home. Attacks in their neighborhood, initially designated a safe zone by Israel, soon wounded him, putting him in a hospital bed for months. Meanwhile, the relative safety of Naheel’s shelter had limits. When she went out to a balcony to check that her kids had not strayed off the school grounds, a large piece of shrapnel hit her in the back. “It felt like I was on fire,” she said. Amid chaos at the local Nasser Hospital, she only got a dressing for the wound, then hurried back to her children. Still, she couldn’t watch them at all times. One day in late October, two of her sons ― 15-year-old Anas and 10-year-old Adham ― joined a group of boys in search of wood for cooking. Suddenly they were engulfed in what Anas called “toxic bombs” that made them feel like they were suffocating. By the time they were taken to a hospital, Adham was near death. Doctors told his family his brain had run short on oxygen, leaving him disfigured and unable to speak or control his limbs. By late December, bullets through the windows of the U.N. school, as well as airdropped Israeli messages about continued attacks, convinced Naheel to move again. Her husband went to Rafah and secured a tent, and Naheel and their children traveled three hours on a donkey cart to reunite with him on Jan. 10. Four days later, she heard that Egyptian authorities were willing to let her and Adham exit through Rafah. She hoped that permission could extend to their whole family. But when they arrived at the crossing, border guards refused to let her husband cross. “My kids broke down,” she recalled. Since they have been transferred to Qatar, she and the children have had minimal contact with him, but she says nothing could be more important for them, especially Adham. She showed HuffPost a video of him reacting excitedly when she mentioned his father. She said she is “begging” multiple governments for help, awaiting the day she sees his name spelled out on the Rafah exit list: Mohammed Abu Al Ola. Fear and longing are paired with guilt for some evacuees, making each day of the war harder to bear. Watfah, who arrived in Qatar two weeks ago with her severely injured 13-year-old son, is wracked by thoughts of her other children. Her 9-year-old daughter “is a parent now,” she said, caring for her young siblings. The family has already endured a loss: Watfah was seven months pregnant when the war broke out, but due to malnourishment and dehydration, her baby was stillborn, she said. Iman, a young woman from Gaza City, told HuffPost she thinks constantly about her decision to get in an ambulance with her daughter Aleen after the girl was hit by shrapnel on the balcony of their apartment on Dec. 10. Emergency personnel brought the pair to a hospital through Israeli checkpoints. Because of the extent of Aleen’s wound, which left a gaping hole in the side of her face, doctors kept her in a hospital and ultimately sent them to Egypt, then Qatar. Iman wonders if she could have snuck her other two children ― boys aged 12 and 4 ― into the ambulance too. She says she’s regularly asked that question by other people. But she also knows Israeli soldiers would have likely pulled them out of the vehicle. “I didn’t expect my daughter to need this much treatment. I can’t handle one more day without my other kids,” she said, expressing particular concern about Israeli forces’ pattern of treating men and older boys like her husband and her 12-year-old as potential combatants. As Iman receives meals provided by the Qatari government, her children in Gaza can rarely get rice, she said: “They’re starving.” Northern Gaza, where Iman’s family and about 300,000 other Palestinians live, is enduring near-famine conditions and children there are dying of hunger, U.N. and aid experts say. Though Israel controls the area, it has offered little support to efforts by donor groups and Israeli partners like the U.S. to send in a huge surge of food and other supplies. Worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza, and fears that continued bloodshed there will spark broader violence over Ramadan, are intensifying a U.S.-led attempt to negotiate a pause in fighting, allow in more aid and release Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. As HuffPost interviewed evacuated Gazans, Israeli technical experts and Qatari mediators with Hamas were assessing the possibility of trading Israeli hostages for Palestinians. Since then, however, talks have stalled over the questions of whether Israel will withdraw its troops from Gaza and whether Hamas will share details about individuals it wants included in the deal. From evacuees to well-connected sources, there’s little optimism among observers that a meaningful stop to the war is imminent. “They’re all liars. We were hopeful, but we kept getting let down,” Thari said in Doha. A U.S. official familiar with senior Biden aides’ thinking told HuffPost that top American officials know how dire the situation is ― and even anticipated a scenario like the tragedy last week, now being called a “flour massacre,” when more than 100 Palestinians trying to get aid were killed amid trampling and Israeli gunfire. Yet the president’s refusal to pressure Israel in a tangible way, for instance by suggesting limits on the American support fueling its Gaza offensive, is shaping U.S. policy, the official said. “Pushing Israel to allow food in is totally off the table,” they said. “Biden is not budging on anything.” The official, who has worked under both Democratic and Republican presidents, described a mix of incompetence and Biden’s “singularly” harmful views, like leaning more reflexively pro-Israel than other Democrats and, according to administration officials, viewing Israel as it was 30 or 40 years ago, rather than acknowledging its current strength and hard-right politics. The upshot, they said, is that the Biden administration would try to address the crisis through “complex, hard-to-do and low-yield PR stunts like airdrops.” Spokespeople for the White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Experienced humanitarians have condemned Biden’s new policy, launched over the weekend, of airdropping aid into Gaza. “The world’s wealthiest, most powerful, ‘greatest’ nation should not have to resort to needed, but inefficient and last-resort airdrops to get life-saving aid in,” Sean Carroll ― a former U.S. Agency for International Development official who now runs the group American Near East Refugee Aid ― recently wrote on LinkedIn. Given its influence, many say the U.S. could do more to change Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s approach. Netanyahu this week refused to even send an Israeli delegation to truce talks, and Israel has not permitted aid to enter northern Gaza through crossings it controls. “The Americans should be much tougher. They still don’t fully understand who they’re up against,” said a former senior Israeli official who requested anonymity to speak candidly. Advocates like Dylan Williams of the Center for International Policy argue that the U.S. should legally already be compelled to cut off military aid for Israel because the country is hindering the distribution of American aid. “It defies credulity for the administration to act as if it hasn’t made known to the President that the government of Israel restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of US humanitarian assistance, which is the standard set in the law,” Williams told HuffPost by text message. “If there is not a massive increase in aid into Gaza, I think you can expect congressional calls for enforcement of this law to grow.” Palestinians with lives in the balance say a change in course is overdue. Evacuees described how their loved ones’ days are dominated by anxiety about Israeli airstrikes, how their chronically ill relatives are unable to get treatment as hospitals focus on war injuries, and how their own futures feel inextricably tied to the war. “We’re resisting food, on hunger strike,” said Thari, telling HuffPost she only accepts a couple of spoonfuls of food to take her medication. “How can I eat when my dad is eating grass?”",-0.0343185952413264,0.253609729771324

In a phone interview on “Fox & Friends,” hosts Brian Kilmeade and Lawrence Jones asked the GOP front-runner if he was “on board” with the way Israeli forces have been carrying out their offensive in Gaza. “You’ve got to finish the problem,” Trump said. “You had a horrible invasion that took place, that would have never happened if I was president, by the way.” Hamas militants launched a deadly attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 hostages. About half the hostages were released during a temporary cease-fire late last year; 100 of the remaining 130 hostages are estimated to still be alive. In retaliation, Israel launched a massive and ongoing military offensive in Gaza, killing more than 30,000 Palestinians and wounding many more, as well as displacing millions. Trump dodged multiple questions by the “Fox & Friends” hosts on his stances related to Israel and Gaza and instead reiterated that the Oct. 7 attack and Israel’s retaliation would not have happened had he been president. “They wouldn’t have done it to me I guarantee you that,” he said. “They did this because they have no respect for Biden, and frankly, they got soft.” ""You gotta finish the problem"" -- Trump endorses Israel's war effort against Hamas pic.twitter.com/5VXrqSiuNM President Joe Biden’s unconditional support for Israel and its military offensive is beginning to cost him votes in the 2024 election. Michigan, which has one of the largest Arab and Muslim American populations, saw an unprecedented number of Democratic voters cast their primary ballot for “uncommitted” instead of for Biden. The uncommitted movement, which has started spreading to other states, was led by voters who felt that Biden was not taking his constituents’ concerns seriously about U.S. involvement in Israel’s offensive. Despite the president’s strong allyship with Israel, Trump would likely still be the preferred candidate for the Israeli government’s far-right leaders, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. Last month, Ben Gvir told The Wall Street Journal that Trump would give the Israeli right a stronger backing than Biden currently does. The next four years will change America forever.

The two leaders were close during the Trump administration, which cut Palestinians out of the negotiations over the so-called Abraham Accords and supported expanding Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. However, after Netanyahu called Biden to congratulate him on his win in 2020, Trump began to sour on the Israeli leader. Just days after the Oct. 7 attack, Trump praised the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group as “very smart” while disparaging Netanyahu and Israeli military officials. The Republican candidate had since stayed noticeably silent on the war until Tuesday.

Bob Menendez and his wife that allege they accepted gold bars, cash and a luxury car in return for favors the senator carried out to assist three businessmen. The new charges were in a rewritten indictment returned against the Democrat in Manhattan federal court. New charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice were added against Menendez and his wife, Nadine. An indictment already alleges that the couple conspired with three businessmen to accept the bribes in return for the senator’s help in projects pursued by the businessmen. Both have pleaded not guilty, along with two of the businessmen. A May trial has been scheduled. One businessman pleaded guilty to charges last week and agreed to testify at trial against the others. After his fall arrest, Menendez, 70, was forced to relinquish his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but said he would not resign from Congress. According to an indictment, Menendez and his wife accepted gold bars and cash from a real estate developer in return for the senator using his clout to get that businessman a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund.

In an interview with Bustle published Tuesday, Johnson spoke about the film’s unfavorable reception while reflecting on what it was like to be a part of the project, saying that “it was definitely an experience for me to make that movie.” “I had never done anything like it before. I probably will never do anything like it again because I don’t make sense in that world. And I know that now,” she said. The “Fifty Shades” star continued, “But sometimes in this industry, you sign on to something, and it’s one thing and then as you’re making it, it becomes a completely different thing, and you’re like, ‘Wait, what?’” Johnson, who plays the clairvoyant Cassie Webb in “Madame Web,” said she’s “not surprised” that the film “has gone down the way it has” and added that “of course it’s not nice to be a part of something that’s ripped to shreds, but I can’t say that I don’t understand.” The actor also spoke on the challenges of getting movies made because “decisions are being made by committees, and art does not do well when it’s made by committee.” “Films are made by a filmmaker and a team of artists around them. You cannot make art based on numbers and algorithms. My feeling has been for a long time that audiences are extremely smart, and executives have started to believe that they’re not,” Johnson said. “Audiences will always be able to sniff out bullshit. Even if films start to be made with AI, humans aren’t going to fucking want to see those,” she continued. Many social media users on X, formerly Twitter, praised Johnson for her remarks in the interview.

The rules in the model building code will require new homes to come equipped with the circuitry to hook up induction stoves and electric car chargers, and will be used as a benchmark in almost every state. In November, trade associations representing gas utilities and furnace manufacturers launched a last-ditch effort to gut the provisions, which will be released this year. The International Code Council, the nonprofit organization that works with industry groups and local governments to write the generic codes enshrined into law across most of the country, even bent its own rules to grant players like the American Gas Association and the American Public Gas Association extra time to file appeals, HuffPost reported last month. The fossil fuel groups challenged codes that would make it cheaper for homeowners to opt out of gas, arguing that the proposals either fell outside the bounds of what the energy code was meant to do or were forged through improper procedures. But the ICC’s appeals board this week rejected all nine challenges to the latest energy codes, ruling that the “appellants have not demonstrated a material and significant irregularity of process or procedure.” The gas companies will have one more chance to make their case in a two-hour hearing later this month before the ICC’s board of directors, which will make a final decision at its March 18 meeting. The trade groups that filed the appeals say they plan to push the top executives to overturn the decisions. “This issue is, in fact, not concluded,” said Francis Dietz, a spokesperson for the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group for gas furnace manufacturers that filed an appeal. The American Public Gas Association said it was “disappointed” by the appeals board’s ruling, which the trade group representing municipal gas utilities framed as a threat to Americans’ access to “energy sources that they prefer.” “Fortunately, the appeals process is not over,” the trade group said in a statement to HuffPost. “In the end, the ICC’s Board of Directors will ultimately decide whether to support or reject the appeals. We are closely monitoring to see what they decide.” While the outcome isn’t guaranteed, two sources with knowledge of the process said it would be unusual for the executive panel to buck the appeals board’s recommendations. The ICC directed HuffPost to its public webpage about the current appeals process but did not respond to an emailed question about when the board of directors last overturned a decision by the appeals board. Rejecting the industry appeals may restore some credibility to the beleaguered ICC, whose once-sleepy tradition of updating the nation’s model building codes came under scrutiny in recent years following what advocates saw as an industry coup. “This is definitely a positive development, and we’ll see how the final step goes,” said Mike Waite, the director of codes at watchdog American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and a volunteer who helped author this year’s commercial building codes for the ICC. “The ICC needs to follow their written policies and we still need this code to go much further to hit our energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.” Since the ICC became the national standard for model building codes in the 1990s, the organization had convened local governments and industry associations every three years to update its codebook. At the end of the process, elected officials alone voted on the final version of the codes, giving the ICC enough democratic legitimacy that virtually every state set its codes as the benchmark in local laws. In 2019, however, local governments under pressure to cut planet-heating emissions rallied to vote for the greenest energy codes enacted in a generation. Industry groups balked, first challenging local officials’ eligibility to vote, then filing appeals to strip key climate-friendly provisions out of the codebook. The ICC’s appeals board removed some provisions related to wiring needed for electric cars and appliances, handing a victory to the gas associations that challenged the codes. Then the ICC went a step further, and proposed eliminating governments’ right to vote on the final version of energy codes altogether. While elected officials would still get the last say on codes related to plumbing and swimming pools, energy codes would instead be written by “consensus”-minded committees where industry associations would enjoy equal representation with governments. Governments, including the newly-inaugurated Biden administration, urged the ICC against making the change. The ICC went ahead with the new system, which gas utilities hailed as a win for the industry. “Those appeals should not have been placed in front of it in the first place, so they made the correct judgment here.” Early on, gas companies sought broader influence over a system critics now saw as rigged — at least slightly — in the industry’s favor. Finding two-thirds supermajorities to enact proposals on each of the committees writing energy codes proved challenging. But the process ultimately yielded a proposed codebook for 2024 that the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found improved efficiency by up to 10% and pushed decarbonization forward in particular with new electrification measures. While those efficiency gains fell short of the leaps the 2021 code made over its predecessor, the 2024 code’s circuitry for electric vehicles and appliances made significant progress on cutting emissions, according to the national lab’s preliminary analysis. Advocates who worked on the committees that wrote the latest code said the proposed 2024 codebook did not go as far as groups like ACEEE wanted, but the nonprofit said the compromise improvements made the package worth supporting. On its own, the fact that ICC broke its own rules to give the industry groups more time to file appeals amounted to a “scandal,” ACEEE said. But if the ICC granted the appeals and overturned the key electrification codes, ACEEE said advocates would look to abandon the ICC process altogether in favor of a new benchmark for model codes. “The appeals board itself dealt with what it had placed in front of it,” Waite said. “But those appeals should not have been placed in front of it in the first place, so they made the correct judgment here.” It’s still unclear how the next round of code-writing will play out, he said, and warned that advocates still doubt “that the ICC is a fair administrator of its own process.” Still, Waite said the appeals board’s ruling confirms that slashing planet-heating emissions is “within the scope” of the energy code-writing process.

And so I did ‘Skirt Up Day’ and oh, my god. She lost it on me, and I was just not in the mood to back down.” Green said the fight was “a huge moment for everyone” on set at the time. Garth has spoken about her time on “90210” before, and said she also “struggled” with competitiveness stemming from being on the show. “If I’m honest, I think the show kind of taught me to be threatened by other girls, be threatened by other women and be more competitive because I wanted our costars’ approval or attention,” she said on an episode of her podcast, “9021OMG,” which she co-hosts with her former co-star and friend Tori Spelling, back in 2021.

Damian Hurley recently shared the first trailer for his feature directorial debut, “Strictly Confidential,” in which his 58-year-old mom gets hot and heavy with a younger woman (Pear Chiravara). Social media users were naturally baffled (and curious) by the trailer. “Part of me wants to thank [Damian Hurley], none of me wants to shake his hand,” one user wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “She’s a beautiful woman. It’s also peak Roman Empire for a kid to be directing mom in soft-core porn,” another wrote. According to People, “Strictly Confidential” is billed as a “sensual thriller with a devilish twist,” where a woman named Mia (Georgia Lock) goes to the Caribbean to investigate her friend’s death. While there, she meets Lily (Elizabeth Hurley) — and enters a “seductive world of sex, betrayal and murder.” Back in 2022, Damian Hurley explained on Instagram how his mother ended up in the film. “I want to worship [my mom] who, during the making of my first ever short film back in 2010 (when I was 8) promised me she’d be in my first feature,” he wrote at the time. “True to her word, the minute this film was greenlit, Mama dropped everything and raced out to the beautiful Caribbean to help.” While speaking with People, Damian Hurley elaborated on what it was like to work with his mother. “We only had 18 days to shoot the whole film, so our twin-like telepathy was invaluable throughout,” he said, adding that the “power dynamic” between them was “complicated at the best of times” but made for “a joy to come to work” with. Still, their upcoming collaboration has clearly unsettled some people.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kyrsten-sinema-senate-reelection_n_65e770f5e4b0d2a2475ae4cd","Kyrsten Sinema Announces She Won't Seek Reelection","igor bobic","2024-03-05","Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) announced on Tuesday she won’t be seeking reelection in November, ending months of speculation about her political future. In a video released by her office, Sinema complained about the death of civility and compromise in American politics.` “The only political victories that matter these days are symbolic, attacking your opponents on cable news or social media. Compromise is a dirty word,” Sinema said. “I believe in my approach. But, it’s not what America wants right now.” “Because I choose civility, understanding, listening, working together to get stuff done, I will leave the Senate at the end of this year,” she added. Sinema’s decision not to run for reelection means that Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) is now set for a one-on-one race with election denier Kari Lake, the likely Republican candidate, in November. National Republicans believe Sinema’s exit will boost Lake’s chances of flipping the seat and winning control of the Senate next year. “An open seat in Arizona creates a unique opportunity for Republicans to build a lasting Senate majority this November,” Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. “With recent polling showing Kyrsten Sinema pulling far more Republican voters than Democrat voters, her decision to retire improves Kari Lake’s opportunity to flip this seat.” Earlier public polls of a hypothetical matchup between Lake and Gallego have found Gallego leading or the two candidates neck-and-neck, with a large number of undecided voters. Lake, who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has been the outspoken supporter of Jan. 6, 2021, rioters, characterizing those prosecuted for their actions as “political prisoners.” She has also been a vocal critic of the late GOP Sen. Arizona Sen. John McCain. Gallego on Tuesday invited Sinema to help him defeat Lake in November. “Protecting abortion access, tackling housing affordability, securing our water supply, defending our democracy — all of this and more is on the line,” Gallego said in a statement. “That’s why Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike are coming together and rejecting Kari Lake and her dangerous positions.” Sinema left the Democratic Party and became an independent in 2022. She has been fiercely criticized by some on the left for standing in the way of progressive priorities in the Senate, including a higher minimum wage, higher corporate tax rates, and the elimination of the filibuster. Those positions helped to effectively sour her standing with Democratic voters in Arizona. Her only path forward, had she chosen to run for reelection, would have been gathering enough signatures to appear on the ballot as an independent ― a difficult and risky campaign. Still, Sinema was deeply involved in crafting all the major bipartisan bills that passed in Congress in recent years, including the gun safety overhaul, infrastructure reform, new protections for gay marriage and improvements to the Electoral Count Act, to name a few. But it was the most recent negotiation over U.S. immigration and border policy that seemed to shake Sinema’s belief in bipartisan compromise. The next four years will change America forever.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. With endorsements from Wirecutter, Consumer Reports and Gear Patrol (along with thousands upon thousands of Amazon reviews), Coway is one of the most highly rated brands in the crowded space of air purification. When a Coway air purifier is on sale, you want to act fast to grab one at a discounted price. Right now, you can get the popular Coway Airmega 1512HH air purifier for 30% off its list price at Amazon. Unlike many bulky (and downright hideous) home appliances, the polished design of this device will actually make you want to show it off. It comes in black, white and a luxurious black and gold WiFi-enabled option (which is not on sale), and could easily become your favorite machine-turned-home decor. The sleek purifier has a complex, three-stage filter that captures and reduces up to 99.97% of irritating particles ― including pollen, pollutants and other allergens ― along with odors and volatile organic compounds (like airborne gases from your gas stove). It’s designed to purify rooms of up to 867 square feet and has a timer feature you can set to run one, four or eight hours before it automatically shuts off. It comes in black and white and measures 16.8 inches by 18.3 inches by 9.7 inches. When it comes time to replace your filters (the odor filter every six months and the HEPA once a year) the process couldn’t be any easier and a complete replacement set is easily available to grab with your purchase. You can see some promising reviews for the Coway down below or head back up to snag one for an impressive 30% off its regular price. Promising Amazon reviews: “Three weeks in and we couldn’t be happier with this filter. Quiet and effective. If it detects contaminants the light turns red and the fan kicks up to high, which is a bit loud (when set to auto), but it doesn’t run high for long.We have a woodstove for heat, which creates a lot of dust. This has cut it back a lot, and has cut the amount of dusting I have to do overall.We’re both breathing easier, and its cut down on the smell of our 2 large house dogs.” — SpragueRiverHomestead “Fed up with musty odors and dust this winter, we got several air purifiers. This one deserves its top reputation. It really cleans the air in a room―even a large room. I used to wake up with a headache every day; once we started using this guy, those were a thing of the past. My son was having trouble with allergies (probably to dust or mold), and we swapped units. After he started running this one in his room, he was fine. He could get a similar result with the other units only by running them at a higher, noisy level.The sleep mode is not completely silent, but quiet enough for me (a light sleeper). It is also not completely dark, but it’s easy enough to put an opaque object over the bright LED that can’t be turned off when the unit is on.One really great feature of this purifier is that if it loses power and then the power comes on again, it will start up with the same setting it was on before. All of our other air purifiers, once the power goes off, you have to manually turn it on again for it to run. Why does this matter? I plugged the Coway airmega into a smart plug so that I can control it from afar―turn it on when I’m away from home, or schedule it to run for a certain number of hours each day and turn itself off and on again. I can’t do that with the Levoits.” — Emommy “I have two Coway air purifiers in my apartment and have run them non-stop for nearly 5 years, aside from cleaning and changing filters. Online reviews said they are durable and this is quite true. Some of my favorite features:- Easy to service. There are three layers of filtration - a screen behind the front cover that captures lint, hair, large items, an activated charcoal filter to remove odors and a true HEPA filter behind that. Removing the outer cover to vacuum the screen is very easy. Accessing the other filters is also a snap.- Very durable. As I mentioned, mine are nearly 5 years old and one has always been in a room with my two boys, so seen its fair share of knocks.- Ability to run int auto mode where it speeds up if it detects pollutants- Adjustable sensitivity to pollutants- Three fan speeds. The first two are nearly silent. The 3rd (high) makes a decent amount of noise, but the only time I ever use high is during extreme wildfire/smog events or if cooking something smokey. Middle speed moves plenty of air and should be all you need.The only con I can think of is that my interior designer wife is not crazy about their appearance. Doesn’t bother me. One of my favorite home products.” — SeattleGreen By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

By 12:30 p.m., the outages, which were reported around the world, appeared largely resolved, according to tracking website Downdetector.com. Meta’s head of communications, Andy Stone, blamed a “technical issue” for some users’ inability to access the company’s servers. “We resolved the issue as quickly as possible for everyone who was impacted, and we apologize for any inconvenience,” he said in a statement posted to X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Facebook appeared to get hit the hardest of all Meta-owned sites, with nearly 500,000 users reporting outages just before 11 a.m. Messaging app WhatsApp, in comparison, only had a few hundred reported outages, according to Downdetector.com. The outages became a trending topic on X, with Meta users turning to the rival social media platform to express grievances. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

It didn’t work. (Watch the video below.) On a Saturday night airing of “King Charles” on CNN, the two watched a clip of Trump bragging about Black supporters who have “embraced” the shirts, which bear Trump’s booking photo in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. “When you heard that, what did you think?” Gayle asked the basketball Hall of Famer. “First of all, I’m just going to say this: If I see a Black person walking around with Trump mugshot, I’m gonna punch him in the face,” Barkley replied. “Charles, you really can’t say that, ’cause, A, you don’t mean that,” King shot back. “Oh, I mean that sincerely,” he said. “And then you will be arrested for assault, and then what?” King said, perhaps still hoping for Barkley to withdraw the remark. “I’m gonna bail myself out and go celebrate,” Barkley responded. When the studio guests laughed, King told them not to encourage her colleague. The clip went viral and has been viewed by more than 7 million people.

It’s hard to miss in the skin care sphere, and is personally one of my favorite, must-have devices. If you’ve been eyeing one of these delightful tools then I have good news for you, because NuFace is having its Friends & Family sale this week, making it the perfect time to splurge on the brand’s award-winning devices and skin care products. Enjoy 25% off sitewide today through March 11— no code at checkout required. If you’re a skin care devotee, having a high-tech skin care device or two in your repertoire is the perfect way to amp up your beauty routine. From LED light masks to lasers and facial toning devices, the addition of a high-quality beauty tool can make quite a difference to a wide range of skin issues, from acne to tone and texture, fine lines, sagging skin, anti-aging and more. Unfortunately, if you want to get a device that actually works, you may have to make a pretty steep financial investment, which is why any time there’s a sale happening, we love to jump on it. The NuFace in particular is a great investment. It’s an FDA-cleared microcurrent device that claims to gently stimulate the face and neck in an effort to tone, lift and contour facial muscles and reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles. You can purchase various additional attachments, like a red light wrinkle reducer and a lip and eye wand, to make it a more versatile, multifunctional tool. It has five different intensity levels, so you can also work your way up if you find it to be a bit too strong at first. Users swear by its effectiveness, and I’ve noticed that nearly a year of regular use has resulted in firmer, tighter and even brighter skin around my face, jawline and neck. Used consistently, the NuFace Trinity can be an excellent complement to even the simplest beauty routine. I like to use it while watching TV — I just throw on the conductive gel and go to town for five to 10 minutes a day. It’s easy to incorporate into your regimen and will stand the test of time, making it worth ever penny. Below, I’ve rounded up a few of NuFace’s most popular items.

The union election held at the Ivy League school in Hanover, New Hampshire, could prove to be historic, but the legal battle over whether the players can bargain collectively is far from over. Dartmouth’s trustees have disputed the athletes’ legal status as employees eligible to unionize. It could be years before the case is resolved at the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees private-sector union elections, and possibly federal court afterwards. “These players are our members and we welcome them warmly.” But for now, the players have made clear they intend to bargain over their working conditions as part of the Service Employees International Union Local 560, the same group that represents cooks, custodians, groundskeepers and other workers on campus. The vote tally was 13-2 in the union’s favor. “These players are our members and we welcome them warmly,” the union’s president, Chris Peck, said in a statement. “We’re all looking forward to standing in solidarity as they begin to negotiate their historic first contract.” Dartmouth said in a statement that it was “proud to build productive relationships” with its unions, but that it doesn’t believe the basketball players are workers. “In this isolated circumstance ... the students on the men’s basketball team are not in any way employed by Dartmouth,” the school said. “For Ivy League students who are varsity athletes, academics are of primary importance, and athletic pursuit is part of the educational experience.” The National Collegiate Athletics Association, the governing body for college sports, has always insisted that college athletes are not employees, despite being the center of a billion-dollar industry. Union campaigns have percolated within the NCAA for years, but until Tuesday none had made it so far as to see the ballots opened following a vote. Football players at Northwestern University in Illinois held an election in 2014, but the labor board impounded the ballots pending the school’s appeal. Members of the board ultimately declined jurisdiction in the case, killing the union effort by punting on the politically explosive question of whether the athletes were really employees. 🏀MAKING HISTORY!🏀 Dartmouth Men's Bball team votes to join SEIU L560—our 500-strong union of campus custodians, security officers, museum guides, and others. @Dartmouth, it’s time to bargain a fair contract.

The school filed a Hail Mary-motion last week trying to either block the election from happening or have the ballots locked up while its legal challenge played out. The labor board did not oblige. But immediately after Tuesday’s vote, the school appealed the decision that allowed for the vote to take place. That puts the issue before the NLRB’s board members in Washington. Due to appointments by President Joe Biden, the labor board now has a Democratic majority that tends to hold a broader, more union-friendly view of collective bargaining rights, with a track record that bodes well for the players and the SEIU. The board also had a Democratic majority when it decided to extinguish the Northwestern union effort, but the political and legal landscape around college sports has changed significantly over the past decade. College players can now profit off their name, image and likeness, while recent polling shows a majority of Americans believe college athletes should be paid directly by their schools. “The labor board now has a Democratic majority that tends to hold a broader, more union-friendly view of collective bargaining rights.” The next four years will change America forever.

Meanwhile, a separate NLRB case revolves around whether football and basketball players at the University of Southern California qualify as employees for the purpose of labor law. The labor board’s general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, argues that the university, the PAC-12 conference and the NCAA have misclassified the players as “student athletes” rather than the employees they are. Abruzzo told HuffPost in a 2021 interview that she believes college athletes are workers under the law. “If players at academic institutions feel like they want to choose a union to represent them in discussions with their employer over wages or working conditions ... then they should be filing [union representation] petitions,” she said.

Michael Luttig slammed the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling allowing Donald Trump to remain on 2024 ballots, calling elements of the decision “stunning in its overreach.” On CNN Monday, Luttig said the ruling was “both astonishing and unprecedented, not for its decision of the exceedingly narrow question presented by the case — though that issue was important — but rather for its decision to reach and decide a myriad of the other constitutional issues surrounding disqualification under 14th Amendment.” Luttig, a former veteran conservative jurist on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, was among a number of prominent legal minds to begin publicly arguing last year that Trump was ineligible to hold office again under the so-called insurrection clause of the Constitution — Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. He filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in January, arguing his point. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that states do not have the authority to bar the former president from appearing on ballots, overturning a Colorado court’s decision to do so. The Supreme Court also ruled that only Congress has the authority to disqualify federal candidates under Section 3. The three liberal justices and conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett disagreed with that decision. In a concurrence, the liberal justices said they protested the “majority’s effort to use this case to define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision.” Barrett, in her own concurrence, wrote that the case did not require the court to decide the “complicated question” of whether federal legislation is the only enforcement mechanism for Section 3. According to Luttig, in deciding those questions unnecessarily, the majority “effectively decided that the former president will never be disqualified from holding the presidency in 2024 or ever for that matter.” He added, “But even more importantly, as the concurrence said, effectively, the court today decided that no person in the future will ever be disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, regardless of whether he or she has engaged in an insurrection or rebellion against the Constitution of the United States.” Listen to his analysis below on CNN’s “The Lead.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

(Watch the video below.) The former president baselessly insinuated last month at CPAC that California balloting is corrupt, but that God could fix that ― and guide him to victory. “If God came down and God was the vote checker, I believe we would win,” said Trump, who lost to Joe Biden by more than 5 million votes in the state in 2020. Not to mention that predominantly Democratic California has not voted for a Republican candidate in a presidential election since 1988. But that was beside the point for Meyers. “I doubt God wants anything to do [with you],” the “Late Night” host told Trump. “If God came down and counted votes, I’m sure you’d accuse him of cheating too.” Meyers then went into his Trump impression. “I find the robe very suspicious, the long flowing robes which he wears even in the summer,” the comedian said in Trump’s voice. “Even in the summer, a robe? You see the videos of him walking into the voting center. The robe is normal. And then he walks out. The robe is bulky. Because he’s hiding ballots under the robe and no one will check the robe because we’re all too woke now.” Fast forward to 2:25 for Meyers’ takedown of Trump’s heavenly hope.

David Franklin Slater, 63, was arrested Saturday after allegedly conspiring to transmit and transmitting classified information about Russia’s war on Ukraine to the unnamed individual over a three-month period in early 2022, which is when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began. “Dear, what is shown on the screens in the special room?? It is very interesting,” one message sent to Slater in March read, according to a copy of the three-count federal indictment. “You have a job in the Operations Center today, I remember, I’m sure there is a lot of interesting news there?” another message read. Slater, dubbed the person’s “Secret informant love” and “secret agent,” became employed in a classified area at the Offutt Air Force Base, south of Omaha, in 2021 after retiring as a lieutenant colonel from the Army the year prior. He was assigned to the United States Strategic Command at the base and attended classified briefings regarding Russia’s war against Ukraine from February to April 2022, according to the indictment. In messages allegedly exchanged between the pair, the individual asked for information about classified briefings and military strategies that could impact Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assault. “Dave, I hope tomorrow NATO will prepare a very unpleasant ‘surprise’ for Putin! Will you tell me?” one message cited in the indictment read. “Sweet Dave, the supply of weapons is completely classified, which is great!” read another. Another message applauded Slater for allegedly sharing information about NATO members’ movement by train before it was announced publicly on the news. “You are my secret informant love! How were your meetings? Successfully?” the message read. Slater, whose initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday, faces up to 10 years in prison for each count of conspiracy to transmit and the transmission of national defense information. He did not have an attorney listed. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tricia-rose-systemic-racism-book_n_65e5fc96e4b013678e163080","Where Is Systemic Anti-Blackness Lurking In 2024?","chaz l. cruz","2024-03-05","During the past few years, discussions about racism and social inequities have swelled, especially in professional settings. The main message: Racism is bad. Let’s shut it down somehow. Yet, we’re not seeing progress. Instead, we’re seeing the implementation of anti-affirmative action laws, the elimination of diversity and equity inclusion positions, and the censorship of books that critically examine racism’s legacy and its insidious nature. Living in this contradictory reality sometimes makes me want to yell, “Computer, end program!” But I’m a gamer, so I stay in the game. What keeps me grounded and focused is that countless individuals share the vision of a more just and safe world — a world where we learn from our collective past and use that knowledge to cultivate systems that uplift — a world where cultural and systemic anti-Blackness is dismantled. Professor Tricia Rose is one of those touchstones who makes me feel hopeful; she’s spent much of her career shedding necessary insight on how to confront pervasive issues directly. In her latest book, “Metaracism: How Systemic Racism Devastated Black Lives — and How We Break Free,” which drops on March 5, she delves fearlessly into the intricate web of institutional anti-Blackness, offering vivid analysis of its impact on all of our lives. By tracing racism’s insidious influence across generations and through various societal institutions, we can better understand how we can arm ourselves against it. Ahead of her book release, I had the honor of chatting with Rose about what she feels are the most potent and pressing issues we, as Black and people of color, face today. Drawing from her extensive research, data analysis, and lived experiences, she provides powerful narratives and strategies for liberation and empowerment. In her work, she invites readers to critically engage with the systems perpetuating inequality, empowering them to become agents for change. What called you to write “Metaracism” at this particular moment in time, and what do you hope readers will take away from it? I started this larger project on systemic racism about eight years ago when I was teaching a class, and I began to realize that there was a lot of confusion around how racism worked. [The students] thought it was all attitudes and behaviors and individual mistreatments. The idea that affirmative action was reverse racism: even the Black kids, white kids, and other ethnic groups felt that way. I realized they didn’t understand what was happening. This is not just about individual values, beliefs, and attitudes. This process is built in such a way that you can be a neutral participant and really make a very negative contribution — you can be a nonconscious participant. So, visuals became important to me. People do not easily see how education and all these details connected to criminal justice and high levels of punishment and policing in and out of schools — they are really complicatedly interconnected over time. So, that’s when I started doing research about how these connections accumulate. And I realized this was much bigger than what I thought it was. What actionable steps or strategies do you suggest for anyone who is empowered to dismantle deeply embedded racism? The chapter at the end of the book focuses on what it takes to break free, and by that, I’m hoping people don’t think, “Oh, we changed this policy; we’ll be good,” or “We changed this approach to education, and it’ll solve it.” Many of us are trapped in a paradigm, and that paradigm includes the myth that racism is not systemic. That myth that society generally works fine, minus the couple of unintended consequences or bad apples or whatever. But when you change your paradigm and you tell stories that show the power of the interconnections and the way they harm Black people specifically, once you start unpacking that paradigm, a new one emerges. That new one means you’re asking different questions, and that’s the beginning of individual and collective change. One part of that argument really resonated with me — specifically where you say, in the book, “Our individual experiences are better understood when they are systemically informed.” I’m glad I said that! We are individuals. We don’t want to say, “I’m Black, I’m Latinx, I’m whatever it is, and this is the only experience I can have.” Many people have many constellations of disadvantages; they are not all the same. And our own individual will, intelligence, opportunity, luck can change things for us, but when we understand ourselves in the bigger picture of how things are systemically arranged, we should be more proud of how well we do and how much we contribute. We should recognize that we know more about the world we are in and what we are subjected to. It is empowering to me to know that. How do you navigate the heaviness of discussing systemic racism while also offering hope that things can potentially change? This is probably one of the most important difficulties that I’ve faced. I think if I try to empathize by exploring and exposing this reality that, it may be temporarily despairing. But if it’s going to continue on, then not knowing about it is actually self-destructive and dangerous. Pretending it’s not going on because you do not want to hear the details — this really diminishes your ability to effectively organize for the kinds of changes that will help the whole world, especially for those who are brown and Black people. For everybody, really. This system is designed to make things more difficult, not for everyone at every moment, but overall. I need to know this if I’m going to do well and if I’m planning to protect people around me. I think that we have muscles for dealing with human suffering — the muscles it takes to deal with human suffering in terms of landslides and genocides, and the Ukraine war, children starving. The world has a lot of suffering in it. But you have to develop the muscles for responding to that in the right way. And you don’t do that by running away. How do you, in this book, speak to non-Black readers or those who may be resistant or defensive readers in these difficult conversations? One of the things I tried to make clear was that Black people are specifically positioned in the ways I described at length, and that doesn’t mean that others are not a part of an oppressive system. But [these struggles] are not identical. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent weeks trying to broker an agreement in which Hamas would release up to 40 hostages in return for a six-week cease-fire, the release of some Palestinian prisoners and an influx of aid to address the humanitarian catastrophe in the isolated territory. Two Egyptian officials said the latest round of discussions had ended. They said Hamas presented a proposal that mediators would discuss with Israel in the coming days. Hamas has refused to release all of the estimated 100 hostages it holds, and the remains of around 30 more, unless Israel ends its offensive, withdraws from Gaza and releases a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants serving life sentences. U.S. officials have said they are skeptical that Hamas actually wants a deal because the group has balked at a number of what the U.S. and others believe are legitimate requests, including giving the names of hostages to be released. “It is on Hamas to make decisions about whether it is prepared to engage,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday. “We have an opportunity for an immediate cease-fire that can bring hostages home, that can dramatically increase the amount of humanitarian aid getting in to Palestinians who so desperately need it, and can set the conditions for an enduring resolution,” Blinken said. Jihad Taha, a Hamas spokesperson, said the negotiations were ongoing but “the ball is in the Israeli court.” He said Israel had thus far refused Hamas’ demands for people who fled northern Gaza to be allowed to return and for guarantees of a long-term cease-fire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. “Hamas is open to proposals and initiatives that are consistent with its position calling for a cease-fire, withdrawal, the return of the displaced, the entry of relief convoys and reconstruction,” Taha said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly rejected Hamas’ demands and repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas is dismantled and all the hostages are returned. Israel did not send a delegation to the latest round of talks. An Israeli official said Israel was still waiting for Hamas to hand over a list of hostages who are alive as well the hostage-to-prisoner ratio it seeks in any release deal. It was not clear if that information was included in the latest proposal. The Israeli and Egyptian officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the negotiations. Benny Gantz, a member of Netanyahu’s War Cabinet and his main political rival, met with senior U.S. officials in Washington on a visit that drew a rebuke from the prime minister, the latest sign of a growing rift within Israel’s leadership. Mediators had hoped to broker an agreement ahead of Ramadan, the month of dawn-to-dusk fasting that often sees heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions linked to access to a major holy site in Jerusalem. The month is expected to begin around March 10, depending on the sighting of the moon. “The negotiations are sensitive. I can’t say there is optimism or pessimism, but we haven’t yet reached a point at which we can achieve a cease-fire,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Monday. The war began with a Hamas attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages. More than 100 of them were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. The attack sparked an Israeli invasion of the enclave of 2.3 million people that Gaza’s Health Ministry says has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians. Aid groups say the fighting has displaced most of the territory’s population and pushed a quarter of the population to the brink of famine. The U.N. children’s agency said Monday that at least 10 children have reportedly died in isolated northern Gaza because of dehydration and malnutrition. “There are likely more children fighting for their lives somewhere in one of Gaza’s few remaining hospitals, and likely even more children in the north unable to obtain care at all,” Adele Khodr, the UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. “These tragic and horrific deaths are man-made, predictable and entirely preventable,” she added. The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that 15 children have starved to death at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza and another six were at risk of dying from malnutrition and dehydration. It was not clear if the children had underlying medical conditions that increased their vulnerability. Northern Gaza, the first target of Israel’s offensive, has suffered mass devastation. The World Food Program recently suspended aid shipments to the north, citing the breakdown of security. An attempt by the Israeli military to bring in aid ended in tragedy last week when over 100 Palestinians were fatally shot by Israeli forces or trampled to death in a melee. Up to 300,000 Palestinians are believed to remain in northern Gaza after Israel ordered the evacuation of the entire region, including Gaza City, in October. Many have been reduced to eating animal fodder to survive. The U.N. says one in six children under 2 in the north suffer from acute malnutrition. The United States and other countries have carried out air drops in recent days, but aid groups say the expensive, last-ditch measure is not enough to address the soaring needs. Israel is still carrying out strikes in all parts of Gaza and has threatened to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, where around half of Gaza’s population has sought refuge. Gantz has said the Rafah operation could begin as soon as Ramadan if there is no deal on the hostages. Gaza’s Health Ministry said 97 people had been killed over the last 24 hours. bringing the overall Palestinian death toll to 30,631. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures, but says women and children make up around two-thirds of the total casualties. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames the high toll on Hamas because the militants operate in dense, residential areas. But the army rarely accounts for individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The next four years will change America forever.

Lindsay Lohan officially confirmed on Monday that the beloved 2003 body-swap comedy is finally getting a sequel. After years of anticipation, Lohan said on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” that she and Jamie Lee Curtis will return. “It is [true],” she told host Andy Cohen. “I don’t want to say too much. And we’re both excited.” Lohan caught herself and cheekily added, “I’m gonna speak for Jamie.” The duo spoke with The New York Times last year to celebrate the film’s 20th anniversary and teased fans with hopes for a sequel. “As I went around the world with ‘Halloween Ends,’ people wanted to know if there was going to be another ‘Freaky Friday,’” Curtis told the outlet. “Something really touched a chord … I called my friends at Disney and said, ‘It feels like there’s a movie to be made.’” Lohan added at the time that they’d “only make something that people would absolutely adore.” While she told People on Monday the sequel is “in the process,” however, a date to start filming remains under wraps. The first film starred Lohan and Curtis as a mother-daughter duo who magically swap bodies, but it wasn’t an original. Based on a 1972 Mary Rodgers novel, it was first adapted in 1976 with Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris and again in 1996 with Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann. The 2003 iteration was the most commercially successful take, however, and grossed more than $160 million at the worldwide box office — and spawned endless fan fever with every hint of a possible sequel in the decades to come.

Lohan, who was once deemed one of the most promising actors of her generation but left the spotlight amid substance abuse struggles, told People that she’s “just excited to work with Jamie again and see how much further we can take” the body-swap premise. The actor’s cinematic return is in full swing, however, with a three-film Netflix deal and surprise cameo in 2024’s musical version of “Mean Girls.” The newfound mother might just find her real comeback with “Freaky Friday 2.” “I think we’re going to have a lot of fun with this,” she told People.

Show a little restraint when you win. Show a little restraint when you don’t win.” Fox News host Trey Gowdy says Trump should exhibit some ""humility"" on the SCOTUS ballot ruling because it's very likely the court will also overwhelmingly rule against him on presidential immunity.""It's confusing when you say 'I love you' on one day and 'I hate you' the next."" pic.twitter.com/5Gg11O6Xn3 The U.S. Supreme Court’s Monday ruling ended an effort in several states to remove Trump from ballots over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection under the so-called insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that states do not have the authority to disqualify candidates for federal office under that clause. Trump called the decision a “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” Later, in remarks from his Mar-a-Lago estate, he urged the Supreme Court to rule in his favor on his claims of presidential immunity.

If they’re not allowed to do their job, it’s not what the founders wanted, but perhaps even more importantly it will be terrible for the country.” Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to rule on Trump’s claims that he is immune from prosecution for his actions as president, scheduling oral arguments for April 22.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-witness-fani-willis-disqualification-hearing_n_65e70046e4b0f9d26cac5c70","Trump Co-Defendant Offers New Witness To Testify In Effort To Remove Willis","marita vlachou","2024-03-05","Attorneys for one of the co-defendants of former President Donald Trump in the Georgia 2020 election interference case on Monday said a new witness could testify on the timeline of the relationship between Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and a top prosecutor she hired to work on the case, according to new court documents. While Willis admitted to having a relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as one of the three special prosecutors in the case in November 2021, she said the romance didn’t start until the spring of 2022. Both testified their relationship ended last summer. David Shafer, a defendant in the case, has contested the testimony by Willis and Wade about when they started dating. In a court filing submitted Monday, Shafer’s lawyers Craig Gillen and Holly Pierson requested to subpoena Cindi Lee Yeager, a co-chief deputy district attorney for Cobb County, Georgia, for testimony if Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee grants a request to reopen hearings into the potential disqualification of Willis. Gillen and Pierson claim Yeager could testify that lawyer Terrance Bradley, who has previously appeared before the court, told her Willis and Wade “definitely” started dating when Willis was running for the district attorney’s office in 2019 through 2020. Bradley has already testified before McAfee, but said he was “speculating” when defense attorneys brought up a text he sent them stating he believed Wade and Willis had been dating since she was municipal court judge. Shafer’s attorneys added that Yeager could also provide testimony on a conversation she allegedly heard take place between Willis and Bradley when he visited her office around September 2023. Willis, according to the court documents, called Bradley to discuss an article in the press about how much Wade was being paid for his work on the Fulton County probe. “They are coming after us,” Willis allegedly told Bradley. “You don’t need to talk to them about anything about us.” Shafer’s lawyers added that Yeager became “concerned” over the inconsistencies she spotted in Bradley’s testimony. It’s unclear if this will have an impact on how McAfee will rule. The judge said Friday he would issue a decision on whether Willis should be disqualified within the next two weeks. “I think it’s been very much made clear by the argument made today that there are several legal issues to sort through, several factual determinations I have to make, and those aren’t ones I can make at this moment,” he said. Willis’ office has not commented on the allegations included in Monday’s filing, but the Fulton County district attorney has previously fiercely defended herself against accusations of wrongdoing. “I’m not on trial no matter how hard you try to put me on trial,” she told defense attorneys in a hearing last month.

The “Shark Tank” star’s remark went viral on X, formerly Twitter, amid nagging concerns about Biden’s age — even though he is just four years older than his likely opponent, Donald Trump. While Trump is getting flak for his recent verbal stumbles, confidence in the incumbent has reportedly waned. According to a New York Times poll of 980 registered voters published Sunday, more than 60% of the voters who backed Biden in 2020 now believe he’s “just too old” to govern effectively. Cuban, the co-founder of Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs, was at the White House to advocate for lower prescription drug prices. The billionaire businessman told Bloomberg he was voting for Nikki Haley in Tuesday’s Texas Republican primary as a “protest vote against Trump.” Cuban buttressed his support for Biden by riffing on Elon Musk’s X post joking that Cuban would vote for the president if he were a flesh-eating zombie.

The fact that his Netflix film “They Cloned Tyrone” premiered in June certainly didn’t help. Foxx himself previously touched on the rampant speculation and joked in December: “I know a lot of people been saying I was cloned out there.

Here's What It Did To My Grief.","diana weisman","2024-03-05","Artificial intelligence is widely believed to be the next frontier — an uncharted future, primed for exploration and new life — but since learning about ChatGPT, I can only think about the after-life. Will the way we view death transform with technology? It’s a question I’ve been asking myself for over 10 years. My recognition of a new type of graveyard began when I was a teenager and I understood a young person’s death meant they left behind more than just family or belongings — it also meant Facebook pages with entire personalities frozen in time. A profile of a deceased classmate would hold 300+ photos of a night buying slurpees at 7-Eleven, a badge proclaiming they “liked” baby sloths, and comments from friends saying they’d see them tomorrow. We were part of generation “me,” which made the sudden absence of “them” feel even more haunting in the digital realm. At that time, Facebook was also not prepared for the fact that its “friends” would die and their profiles would remain. After users started to get notifications to “add” their dead loved ones, the company made updates to its profile settings and created a process by which users could be allowed to control a deceased connection’s “digital legacy.” An explainer video on Facebook reads: “We live in a digital world, what happens when we leave it behind?” When my dad left his behind in 2019, I couldn’t bear to visit his Facebook page, but knowing it existed made it hard to avoid. There were too many comments left from people I didn’t know, all of whom proclaimed to love my Dad. It felt like a virtual tombstone that my family did not create. I didn’t know what was worse — the heartfelt messages from strangers or knowing that he’d never respond. I investigated how to get the page taken down so I wouldn’t be tempted to look at it again, but gave up filling out the online form required to do so when Facebook asked me to provide a death certificate. I thought, You want me to throw my dad’s death certificate into my at-home scanner to prove you should delete his page? I guess it’s probably a fair ask when I think about it now. One might wonder then, after years of avoiding his digital poltergeist, why I’d be hoping to get ChatGPT to speak like my dad. The concept came to me around the time of my wedding, when I contemplated revealing to our guests my life’s biggest regret: that my husband and dad had not gotten a chance to meet. I wanted to admit my failing to bring them together in my vows as a sort of public, emotional self-lashing, but that would have been a total downer. Having been exposed to ChatGPT in my work, I saw AI as my out. If I could train the bot to follow the speech patterns of my father, maybe he and my husband might finally be able to have a conversation. I knew this task would be challenging, as ChatGPT requires very specific prompts to produce optimal results. I would need to provide the bot with a full profile of my dad’s speaking characteristics for it to copy, and maybe even feed it past examples from our text conversations. For added flair, I could ask the bot to interrupt every now and then with a cough, as my dad frequently did from smoking cigarettes all his life. After working out lines of basic descriptions, like his age and the amount of words with which he would usually respond, I realized how difficult the rest of this process was going to be. Chats with my dad were often extremely random and I’d usually walk away from them wondering what it was we were even talking about. This was not because he didn’t know how to have a discussion, but because he was likely thinking of numerous things at once. As a documentary producer who worked in his field for 40 years, my dad was very creative and could make any conversation into a story. You could argue he was always producing your very interaction. He might begin singing lyrics to a song you didn’t know or drop names of people you’ve never met and then it was over. That was him. You never knew what you would get. So, could I get a bot to be him? The more I tried, the more my excitement waned. I spent hours researching the proper prompts and wrote long soliloquies dissecting my father’s persona. But every time the bot offered a response that sounded nothing like my dad — like when it called me a “youngster,” I could see the mask slip. In the midst of this private experiment, I began working with a creative who goes by Shxpir (pronounced Shakespeare). Even before we met, I knew we would have a lot in common, but I didn’t think we’d both be thinking about death. As we got to talking on the set of an ad campaign, he revealed he also had lost his father and was using tech to work through those emotions. In contrast to my guilt, his stemmed from a lack of having ample photographs of his father. He told me he’d been feeling his dad’s physicality in this world slipping from his memory with each passing day. Now, he’s working to render his father virtually, and in 3D, from the images he does have. His project will be completed in a few months and it will allow him to create new images of his father from every angle. In awe of his dedication, I asked Shxpir how he finds the strength to continue the project, as I continuously stumble over emotional roadblocks — memories, pain, the occasional cry — that keep me from trying again. “Sometimes I don’t know if I can handle it,” he admitted to me. Back in 2021, Shxpir began working on a proposal for a business that would recreate deceased loved ones digitally and is now actively working on his own Metaverse funeral for whenever he’s no longer on this planet. With a deep understanding of art and years of digital rendering experience, Shxpir knew that the business of death and mourning, like that of fashion and cosmetics, could be thrust into the digital space at any moment. Although it’s become more of a side project, rendering his dad has remained an important mission for him. “At the end of the day,” he told me with a resolve I could feel through the phone, “as an artist, it’s an experiment for my personal growth.” After some time, I stopped my experiment with ChatGPT and logged into an AI video generator for the first time. I typed “older man talking on the phone” into the generator bar and waited to see what it would return to me. For a long time, I wanted to create art about a vivid dream I had after my dad died. I even sought advice from a dream analyst to help interpret it. In the dream, I was on the phone with my dad and I suddenly realized his voice started to sound different, as if someone had been impersonating him the whole time. It felt so horrifyingly vivid, I woke up thinking I should call my dad and make sure he was OK. After the AI digested my prompt, a face appeared on the screen: a brunette older man, slightly balding, wearing large glasses and hunched over a desk while talking on the phone. I was surprised. Wow, there he is, I thought. He had about four extra fingers, a feature AI tends to trip up on, but he looked a lot like my dad. I went on from there, creating small one-second video scenes using the AI, until I had compiled a full visual retelling of my dream. The process of acquiring the “footage” felt strangely peaceful in its impassiveness. The AI did not ask why I wanted to create this rendering, it just provided scenes in response to my prompts. I added words and phrases like “film noir style” to get a darker effect. I could calmly say “try again” if it did not give me the render I wanted. The graphics it output looked human, but also alien — part dream, part nightmare. The shapes of people were not fully formed. The colors moved on the screen like ink in water. I thought one of the brunette women it rendered looked like me too. I finished the piece by adding my own audio narration and titled it “The Call.” After watching the final product, tears flowed from the bottomless pit that is the well of grief. But I also breathed a sigh of relief. Communicating with AI — creating this piece — gave me a sense of closure I hadn’t felt before. Still, I wondered if this whole process was healthy, or if I had just fallen for an illusion of feeling understood. I reached out to my friend and colleague Marni Blank for her perspective. Marni is a death doula — a person who guides people through the end-of-life process — for either themselves or a loved one. Her response to my project made me feel better. “Some people need to go through the stage of revisiting memories of the person or photos, over and over again — or some people need distance,” she told me. “I think it’s just about what that person needs at that moment.” Social media has also reprogrammed our brains to want to keep a white-knuckled grasp on our memories. “We live in an age where it’s really hard to let go of anything,” Marni said. “Pre-Instagram, you could completely forget someone you broke up with existed.” When I asked her if she would seek to have her social media accounts deleted after she passed, she sounded surprised by my question. “I think I’d want to leave it up to the people who are grieving ... I think to myself, who is going to be affected? Because it won’t be me.” My thoughts snagged on her words — her focus on “the people who are grieving.” That was me. I had only been focused on my dad, and how he could be real again. I thought AI was the answer, but it proved to be a mirror. Months after my ChatGPT experiment, I realized that my struggle with the AI bot was not that it could not “be” my dad. It was the deep sadness that came with facing the truth that he would never again be able to do something new — a new thought, a new conversation — like one I’d hoped he would have had with my husband. Only when I, myself, sought to create something new, like “The Call,” did AI truly give something valuable back to me. There’s irony in the fact that my nightmare of my dad’s voice not really being his voice was so similar to what I was experiencing while attempting to give AI his personality. I think back to Shxpir and his quest for “personal growth” and how I hadn’t realized he’d given me the answer I had been searching for all along. The next four years will change America forever.

Though I thought AI would be a fitting match for powerful emotions like sorrow and grief, which seem to transcend the physical world, it turns out AI’s power may be providing pathways to better understanding ourselves. Technology will never be able to replace the strength we need to go deep inside ourselves and make something of our darkest sorrows. The will to keep moving forward with our grief in tow will never be rendered for us by machines. While so many of us are trying to decipher how AI will play a role in our lives, we must seek to keep ourselves at the center of that search. Because the scariest thing about AI might be realizing that it can’t do it all — especially when it comes to curing the pain of losing someone real.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-potential-endorsement_n_65e715f0e4b0170871fbb4dd","Mitch McConnell Weighs Endorsing Donald Trump In Potential Stark Turnaround","lisa mascaro","2024-03-05","WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate leader Mitch McConnell is the highest-ranking Republican in Congress who has yet to endorse Donald Trump’s bid to return to the White House — having once called the defeated president “morally responsible” for the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack. But that’s potentially about to change. McConnell’s political team and Trump’s campaign have been in talks over not only a possible endorsement of the former president but a strategy to unite Republicans up and down the party’s ticket ahead of the November election, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. How, when or where McConnell would endorse Trump is less head-spinning than the idea that it could happen at all: A stunning rapprochement for two men who have not spoken since McConnell enraged Trump by declaring Joe Biden the legitimate winner of the 2020 presidential election. But a fast-moving series of events ahead of Super Tuesday’s elections have been set in motion by McConnell’s own sudden announcement he would step down as leader next session and as Trump is on track to move closer toward the GOP nomination. Taken together, it lays bare the lengths that McConnell, the longest-serving Senate leader and an ever calculating politician, will go as he works to win back Republican control of the Senate in what could be among his final acts in power. “I still have enough gas in the tank to thoroughly disappoint my critics, and I intend to do so with all the enthusiasm which they have become accustomed,” McConnell said last week in announcing his decision to step aside as leader for the next session. Not long ago, it appeared Trump would have few fans politically lining up behind his bid to return to the White House, particularly from the halls of Congress. In the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, key Republicans, including McConnell, signaled unequivocally they were done with Trump. In a scathing speech during the Senate impeachment trial on charges Trump incited the insurrection at the Capitol, McConnell decried Trump’s intemperate language and the “entire manufactured atmosphere of looming catastrophe” and “wild myths” about a stolen election. “The leader of the free world cannot spend weeks thundering that shadowy forces are stealing our country and then feign surprise when people believe him and do reckless things,” said McConnell after the mob siege. Still, McConnell declined to vote to convict Trump of the impeachment charges in the Senate trial, saying it was for the courts to decide, since the defeated president by then was out of office. “He didn’t get away with anything yet,” McConnell said in the February 2021 speech. Trump is now charged in several cases including a federal indictment of conspiring to defraud the U.S. and obstruct an official proceeding related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by supporters trying to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election. Trump has appealed claiming immunity. The first sign that McConnell was leaving the door open to reuniting with Trump came in early 2023 when he was asked about Trump’s potential return to the presidential campaign. At the time, McConnell suggested he would support the Republican Party’s eventual nominee, declining to name names or mention Trump. But endorsements matter to Trump, who has assigned key campaign staff in charge of roping in support from elected officials in what has become a two-way political street. The GOP leaders are also relying on Trump to support — or at least not attack — their own nominees for the House and Senate. As McConnell is weighing his decision to endorse Trump despite his concerns over Jan. 6, he is watching core Republican voters flock to the former president. And he is wary of being the one to try to stand in their way. It’s not just McConnell but the other Republican leaders on Capitol Hill who have all quickly fallen in line as Trump emerges ever so close to again becoming the party’s nominee at the top of their party ticket this November. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson traveled to Mar-a-Lago last month to meet with Trump at his private club about House races as the new speaker works to keep his slim GOP House majority. The other House Republican leaders endorsed Trump as the former president’s team pushed for backing ahead of the Iowa, New Hampshire and other early contests. Senate Republican leaders did the same. And Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, the chairman of the Senate GOP campaign arm who is a friend, hunting and fishing partner to the president’s oldest son, Don Trump, Jr., had told others as far back as 2022 he hoped Trump would run again. He became the first member of Senate GOP leadership to endorse him. When Daines traveled to Mar-a-Lago for his own visit in February 2023, he told Trump the most important thing he could do for Trump was deliver a Senate majority to confirm Cabinet nominees and approve conservative policies, according to another person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. Daines remains close to Trump, and the two speak often, the person said. “I’m encouraging the Republican Party to unite behind President Trump,” Daines said in a recent statement to the media, including AP. McConnell’s past political distaste for Trump appears to be no match for the GOP leader’s desire to win back a Senate majority for Republicans one more time as he prepares to exit the leadership stage. The two have traded harsh words since even before McConnell’s 2021 speech, with Trump deriding the now 82-year-old as an “Old Crow.” But in recent weeks Trump has refrained from name-calling McConnell, or using racial slurs against McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, the former Trump Transportation Secretary, who resigned in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack.

Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on Monday held a meeting with former President Donald Trump as he is reportedly mulling entering the race to succeed Mitch McConnell (Ky.) as GOP Senate leader. McConnell, 82 last week announced his decision to leave the post in November, putting an end date to his tenure as the longest-serving Senate leader in history. Scott posted a photo with Trump Monday on X, formerly Twitter, writing it was “great” to meet the former president. “We’re going to continue working together to win big in 2024 and fix Washington,” Scott wrote.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/haiti-violence_n_65e6fe9ee4b0f9d26cac5a08","Gangs In Haiti Try To Seize Control Of Main Airport In Newest Attack On Government Sites","evens sanon , pierre-richard luxama","2024-03-05","PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Heavily armed gangs tried to seize control of Haiti’s main international airport on Monday, exchanging gunfire with police and soldiers in the latest attack on key government sites in an explosion of violence that includes a mass escape from the country’s two biggest prisons. The Toussaint Louverture International Airport was closed when the attack occurred, with no planes operating and no passengers on site. Associated Press journalists saw an armored truck on the tarmac shooting at gangs to try and prevent them from entering airport grounds as scores of employees and other workers fled from whizzing bullets. It wasn’t immediately clear as of late Monday whether the attack, which was the biggest one in Haiti’s history involving the airport, was successful. Last week, the airport was struck briefly by bullets amid ongoing gang attacks, but gangs did not enter the airport nor seize control of it. The attack occurred just hours after authorities in Haiti ordered a nighttime curfew following violence in which armed gang members overran the two biggest prisons and freed thousands of inmates over the weekend. “The secretary-general is deeply concerned by the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Port-au-Prince, where armed gangs have intensified their attacks on critical infrastructure over the weekend,” said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. A 72-hour state of emergency began Sunday night. The government said it would try to track down the escaped inmates, including from a penitentiary were the vast majority were in pre-trial detention, with some accused of slayings, kidnappings and other crimes. “The police were ordered to use all legal means at their disposal to enforce the curfew and apprehend all offenders,” said a statement from Finance Minister Patrick Boivert, the acting prime minister. Gangs already were estimated to control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince, the capital. They are increasingly coordinating their actions and choosing once unthinkable targets like the Central Bank. Prime Minister Ariel Henry traveled to Kenya last week to try to salvage support for a United Nations-backed security force to help stabilize Haiti in its conflict with the increasingly powerful crime groups. Dujarric said the secretary-general stressed the need for urgent action, especially in providing financial support for the mission, “to address the pressing security requirements of the Haitian people and prevent the country from plunging further into chaos.” Haiti’s National Police has roughly 9,000 officers to provide security for more than 11 million people, according to the U.N. They are routinely overwhelmed and outgunned. The deadly weekend marked a new low in Haiti’s downward spiral of violence. At least nine people had been killed since Thursday — four of them police officers — as gangs stepped up coordinated attacks on state institutions in Port-au-Prince, including the international airport and national soccer stadium. But the attack on the National Penitentiary late Saturday shocked Haitians. All but 98 of the 3,798 inmates being held at the penitentiary escaped, according to the Office of Citizen Protection. Meanwhile, at the Croix-des-Bouquets prison, 1,033 escaped, including 298 convicts. The office said late Monday that it was seriously concerned about the safety of judges, prosecutors, victims, attorneys and others following the mass escape. It added that it “deplored and condemned the policy of nonchalance” demonstrated by government officials amid the attacks. Following the raid at the penitentiary, three bodies with gunshot wounds lay at the prison entrance Sunday. In another neighborhood, the bloodied corpses of two men with their hands tied behind the backs lay face down as residents walked past roadblocks set up with burning tires. Among the few dozen people who chose to stay in prison are 18 former Colombian soldiers accused of working as mercenaries in the July 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse. “Please, please help us,” one of the men, Francisco Uribe, said in a message widely shared on social media. “They are massacring people indiscriminately inside the cells.” Colombia’s foreign ministry has called on Haiti to provide “special protection” for the men. A second Port-au-Prince prison containing around 1,400 inmates also was overrun. Gunfire was reported in several neighborhoods in the capital. Internet service for many residents was down on Sunday as Haiti’s top mobile network said a fiber optic cable connection was slashed during the rampage. After gangs opened fire at Haiti’s international airport last week, the U.S. Embassy said it was halting all official travel to the country. On Sunday night, it urged all American citizens to depart as soon as possible. The Biden administration, which has refused to commit troops to any multinational force for Haiti while offering money and logistical support, said it was monitoring the rapidly deteriorating security situation with grave concern. The surge in attacks follows violent protests that turned deadlier in recent days as the prime minister went to Kenya seeking to move ahead on the proposed U.N.-backed security mission to be led by that East African country. Henry took over as prime minister following Moise’s assassination and has postponed plans to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, which haven’t happened in almost a decade. Jimmy Chérizier, a former elite police officer known as Barbecue who now runs a gang federation, has claimed responsibility for the surge in attacks. He said the goal is to capture Haiti’s police chief and government ministers and prevent Henry’s return. The prime minister has shrugged off calls for him to resign and didn’t comment when asked if he felt it was safe to come home. ___ Associated Press writers Joshua Goodman in Miami and Dánica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He’s like, ‘I really wanna zig-a-zag-ahhh,’” Fallon quipped on “The Tonight Show” on Monday. “It sounds like his brain got a flat.” “To make it seem like he meant to say that, they made it his new campaign slogan,” he added.

The real action will be farther down the ballot. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will continue their steady marches toward their party’s nominations when states including Alabama, Colorado, California, North Carolina, Utah and Vermont head to the polls. (Also in the mix: American Samoa, the one territory that Michael Bloomberg managed to win during the former New York mayor’s doomed 2020 quest for the Democratic presidential nomination.) Biden faces only nominal opposition from Rep. Dean Phillips, whose home state of Minnesota votes today. Biden’s so far won all 206 Democratic delegates up for grabs. Trump, meanwhile, still faces a challenge from former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. Trump has amassed 244 delegates to Haley’s 43, nearly half of which she won in last weekend’s GOP primary in Washington, D.C. But though Trump is expected to collect the roughly 1,200 delegates he needs to clinch the Republican nomination before the end of the month, Haley might do unexpectedly well in states like Vermont and Utah that have either open primaries where Democrats can vote for her or more moderate GOP bases that may reject Trump. Haley might need only a few victories to prolong Trump’s pursuit of the nomination, precious days and weeks putting him and the Republican National Committee further behind Biden and the Democratic National Committee in fundraising. Haley has only committed to staying in the race through Super Tuesday, so it’s not entirely out of the question the former South Carolina governor might suspend her campaign following Tuesday’s elections, at which point it’s not clear whether she might walk back her attacks on the former president and endorse him. The make-or-break races, however, will be in critical House, Senate and gubernatorial primaries, including the massive intra-party brawl among Texas Republicans; a fight to determine whether progressives have a shot at succeeding the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein in California; indications of how Israel’s war in Gaza is playing in Democratic primaries; and a race in which a Trump-backed conspiracy theorist is favored to win the GOP nomination for governor. Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a conspiracy theorist who has claimed that Beyoncé is “satanic,” the 1969 moon landing may have been fake and there is a ruling class of secretive reptiles, is on track to win the Republican nomination for governor in North Carolina. Robinson, who has been endorsed by Trump, is poised to take on Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein. The current governor, Democrat Roy Cooper, is term-limited out. Even when compared to recent extreme GOP nominees, Robinson’s record of sexism, homophobia and Islamophobia is particularly ugly. He’s mocked kids who survived school shootings as “immature media prosti-tots” for advocating gun safety reforms. He’s claimed that homosexuality leads to pedophilia. He’s referred to former first lady Michelle Obama as a man. Despite all of that, Robinson has risen politically for one reason: He’s fashioned himself in the mold of Trump. They have endorsed each other, and last weekend, Trump attended a rally with Robinson and declared that he is “Martin Luther King on steroids.” Of course, Robinson has insulted King in the past, too. He said the civil rights leader was an “ersatz pastor” and a “communist” and that the 1960s civil rights movement was “crap.” North Carolina will have the biggest and most expensive governor’s race nationwide. It’s a crucial swing state in the presidential election, and of the 11 gubernatorial elections this year, just two are in swing states: North Carolina and New Hampshire. Beyond that, if Robinson wins in November, the GOP will have total control of the state’s government. At least one local political analyst previously speculated to HuffPost that Robinson’s extremism will backfire on him in the November election. “We have seen ever since the elevation of Trump, Republican primary voters, again and again, time and time and time again, choosing the candidate who makes an awful general election candidate in a purple state,” said Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “My presumption is Mark Robinson will fall right into this pattern.” Centrist Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff is almost certain to nab the leading spot in California’s top-two “jungle” primary contest for the open seat previously held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, but all eyes will be on progressive Rep. Katie Porter and her bid to secure second place over the Republican candidate in the race, former baseball player Steve Garvey. Porter, who rose to prominence in Congress for grilling fossil fuel industry and Wall Street CEOs, has faced a multimillion-dollar barrage of television advertising funded by wealthy donors who are seeking to deny her a spot in the runoff. Separately, Schiff’s campaign has spent heavily to elevate Garvey in conservative media in hopes of boosting his appeal and ensuring that Schiff faces an easily beatable Republican candidate in California, a Democratic stronghold, instead of Porter. Polls have found Porter struggling to keep even with Garvey for second place in the race even though his campaign has barely spent any money of his own on advertising. Meanwhile, Rep. Barbara Lee, the other major progressive candidate in the race, trails in third place, splitting the left in yet another advantage for Schiff’s establishment-backed campaign. U.S. Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas) is facing off against Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez for the Democratic nomination to run against one of the most polarizing Republicans in Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz came close to losing to his Democratic challenger, Beto O’Rourke, in 2018 and remains unpopular in Texas. Allred is a mild-mannered former NFL player who has boasted a fundraising and polling advantage since announcing his candidacy last year. Gutierrez’s district includes Uvalde, site of a horrific elementary school massacre in May 2022, and he has pushed for stricter gun control as a state legislator and an unapologetic progressive. During a debate in January, Allred defended his moderate voting record, including his support for a symbolic resolution condemning President Joe Biden’s handling of immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. “I’ve built broad coalitions in my campaigns,” Allred said. “That’s how you win tough races.” There are seven other candidates in the race, and the winner needs 50%, so the biggest question may be whether Allred can win outright or will wind up in a runoff against Gutierrez, who should do well among the state’s large Latino population. Everyone knew that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee would be spending big money in Democratic primaries this year, but the mammoth pro-Israel group’s decision to make California state Sen. Dave Min its first target of the cycle has puzzled observers across the spectrum. Min, who is competing against attorney Joanna Weiss, also a Democrat, for the chance to succeed Rep. Katie Porter in California’s 47th Congressional District, has not called for a cease-fire in Israel or for restricting U.S. aid to Israel. But AIPAC’s super PAC, the United Democracy Project, has still spent $4.7 million on ads blasting Min. The TV, digital and direct-mail campaign has cast Min as a general-election liability against a likely Republican opponent due to his arrest in May for driving under the influence of alcohol. Min maintains that AIPAC is trying to beat him because he, like Biden, has been critical of Israel’s expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank. “Maybe AIPAC wants a rubber stamp. I’m not going to be a rubber stamp,” Min told Semafor. Min, a former banking law professor who is the sole Korean American in the state legislature, has the support of Porter; Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.); the AAPI Victory Fund, which supports Asian American and Pacific Islander candidates; organized labor; and many of his fellow state lawmakers. But Weiss, who founded a local Democratic club, has an outside money advantage. Two super PACs affiliated with EMILY’s List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, have spent nearly $1 million on her bid. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is backing primary challenges against 10 of the Texas state House Republicans who voted against the creation of a private school voucher program, helping to kill the proposal. School vouchers have long been a white whale in Texas, one of the only Southern states that does not already have such a program. The overwhelmingly right-wing proponents of vouchers, who insist that they give parents mobility when a local school isn’t cutting it, have blamed the mostly rural Texas Republicans opposed to the program for being too close to teachers unions. In reality, those lawmakers say they oppose the voucher plan for fear it would deplete enrollment at rural schools with little room to lose funding. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) is backing his own slate of primary candidates against House Republicans who voted to impeach him on corruption charges in May, and he has endorsed several who stood by his side as the state Senate acquitted him. Paxton’s efforts have less money behind them, but in at least one case, they conflict with Abbott’s preference. Paxton is supporting state Rep. Travis Clarty, a rural Republican opposed to vouchers, while Abbott has endorsed a pro-voucher challenger against Clarty. The cryptocurrency industry, which profits from investment in digital forms of money, is putting a lot of actual dollars in the hat to avoid the kind of federal regulation that might affect profits as it faces intense scrutiny. In the California Senate primary, Fairshake, a super PAC funded by leading crypto players, including Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, has spent more than $10 million trying to sink Porter, a proponent of stricter banking rules and protégé of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Protect Progress, a separate super PAC with a nearly identical list of donors, has spent $1.7 million to support Shomari Figures, a former Biden and Obama administration official running on Tuesday in a competitive Democratic primary in Alabama’s newly redrawn 2nd Congressional District. In October, a federal court ordered the creation of Alabama’s 2nd, where the voting-age population is nearly half Black, after finding that the previous districts had suppressed Black political power. Figures’ strongest Democratic rivals are state Reps. Anthony Daniels and Napoleon Bracy. Should no Democrat get an outright majority on Tuesday, there will be a runoff on April 2. Democrats are strongly favored to pick up the seat in November. And in Texas, Protect Progress has spent nearly $1 million in support of state Rep. Julie Johnson, who is running to succeed Rep. Colin Allred, a Senate candidate, in a district representing a large share of Dallas and its suburbs. Johnson is running against Dr. Brian Williams, a trauma surgeon and former Air Force officer. Immigration is consistently the top issue for GOP voters in public polling, and a primary for a U.S. House district along the U.S.-Mexico border will test whether Republicans are willing to make a statement on the border crisis using one of their own. GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales is facing four primary challengers who argue he’s out of step with the MAGA wing of the party on a host of issues, including border security, marriage equality and gun rights. Texas’ 23rd Congressional District, which stretches along the southern border in western Texas from El Paso to San Antonio, contains the city of Uvalde, site of the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School, where a gunman killed 17 children and two teachers. In the wake of the massacre, Gonzales supported stricter gun safety rules, a move that earned him a censure from the Texas Republican Party and other grassroots groups. And challengers including local GOP activists and a retired U.S. Border Patrol agent soon lined up to take out the incumbent representative, arguing he isn’t tough enough on the border at a time when the country is seeing a deluge of migrant crossings. Gonzales, who came into office in 2020 after a close race against Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, downplayed his chances of losing the party’s nomination in the primary. “Anybody who wishes to challenge me — it’s a fool’s errand. I’ll run you into the deep end of the pool every single time and drown you. So, I welcome it,” he said. California’s 22nd Congressional District, located in the state’s agricultural Central Valley, has long frustrated Democrats. In majority Latino district where Democrats have a massive registration advantage, low turnout has meant Republican Rep. David Valadao has won five of the last six congressional races. This cycle, the party looked to have an even worse problem: It was possible neither of the two Democrats running for the seat ― former state Rep. Rudy Salas and state Sen. Melissa Hurtado ― would advance in the state’s top-two primary system. Though Valadao was a lock to advance, his support for Trump’s impeachment would generate just enough intra-party opposition for another Republican to qualify instead. The problem set off a round of backbiting within the party, with Democrats grumbling about EMILY’s List working to recruit Hurtado, whom they ultimately never endorsed. National Democrats, who prefer Salas as their candidate, have spent $1.3 million to back Salas, and newer rounds of data show the chances of a lockout fading. Still, it’s $1 million the party would prefer not to spend this far from November. The next four years will change America forever.

Over the years, she’s developed a reputation as a leading progressive and member of the Congressional Black Caucus ― and for churning through staff at record levels. Her treatment of staff member helped doom her run for Houston mayor last year. Now she’s trying to hold on to her House seat representing a majority-Black district surrounding Houston against a challenge from former Houston City Councilwoman Amanda Edwards, 42, who began running while Jackson Lee was still campaigning to be mayor. The race against the 74-year-old Jackson Lee has been an old-fashioned generational showdown.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/massage-gun-neck_l_65e5e229e4b0d2a2475a39c9","Why You Should Never, Ever Use A Massage Gun On Your Neck","leigh weingus","2024-03-05","Massage guns have surged in popularity in recent years, and for good reason: They actually work. According to a 2023 systematic review, massage guns can help improve short-term range of motion, flexibility and recovery. This likely comes as good news to anyone who deals with a lot of muscle stiffness. “I used to think they were just gimmicky things that might feel good in the moment but were not that useful,” admitted physical therapist Ingrid Anderson, founder of Intown Physical Therapy in Atlanta, Georgia. “Now, I believe they have a place for pain relief and treating certain conditions.” But before you whip out that massage gun, are there any parts of the body where a massage gun will do more harm than good? The answer is yes. If you’re one of the 30-50% of adults in the U.S. who suffer from chronic neck pain, please don’t use your massage gun regularly to remedy it. According to Anderson, you’ll want to stay away from any bony area of your body when using the machine ― and your neck is very bony. If you use it on areas with lots of muscles, like your shoulders or the back part of your neck, that’s a safer bet. “I don’t recommend using a massage gun on your neck,” she said. “While necks have lots of muscles, there are many superficial bony prominences and superficial nerves, neither of which like being pounded with a massage gun.” The neck is composed of sensitive areas and vital blood flow that connect to the brain, making using a massage gun on it a not-so-great idea, said Kevin Lees, a chiropractor in Arizona. “Some areas of muscle have receptors that help with balance. If these receptors are overstimulated or damaged, they can cause nausea and dizziness,” he said. “Pressure from a massage gun may cause soft tissue damage and possibly vascular damage.” Perhaps you’ve also seen the viral TikTok where one user warned viewers about the dangers of using the tool on your neck after she experienced problems herself. As Health reported, putting the tool on your neck ― which helps with blood flow to the brain ― may also lead to rare but serious injury if you’re not careful. Ryan Krzyzanowicz, a clinical associate professor and program director of the Master of Science in Athletic Training program at the University at Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions, told the outlet that “you do not want to use percussive therapy (a massage gun) over an artery.” “In the neck we get worried with blood flow to the brain, and in theory, percussion could temporarily starve the brain from blood flow, causing mini-stroke or stroke-like symptoms,” Krzyzanowicz continued. Again, this is more rare, but still a risk to consider. If your neck is really bothering you, turn to the pros. “If you are experiencing neck pain, it’s best to see your doctor to determine the underlying cause. If massage is the solution, have a professional work on the affected muscles,” Lees told HuffPost. Neck pain is a pain in the neck (sorry, we had to), and it’s clear that a massage gun isn’t the solution. So what is? First, get to the source of the neck pain. “Neck pain can be caused by a variety of things. Some of the most common are poor posture, stress and poor sleeping positions,” Lees said. “While a massage gun may help with some of the symptoms, addressing the underlying condition is the only way to prevent the problem from recurring. Poor posture can be due to the ergonomics of a workstation, or a muscle imbalance that causes hunching of the upper back. Sleeping awkwardly with an improper pillow or stomach sleeping may also cause neck pain.” The best way to relieve neck pain, Anderson said, is to stop doing the things that cause it. “This includes a good work-station setup, not craning your neck forward while working, and, most importantly, lots of breaks. Data show that a 20-second movement break every 20 minutes goes a long way towards preventing neck pain,” she said. Once you have a stiff and sore neck, Anderson added, the best things you can do at home are heat or cold (whichever feels good!), topical pain relievers such as lidocaine patches or pain-relieving creams and movement. “Even if it doesn’t feel the best, moving through neck range of motion ― looking right, left, up and down ― goes a long way to shortening an episode of neck pain,” Anderson said. If your pain doesn’t resolve, chat with your doctor or a physical therapist. You may need some manual interventions like medication, specific exercises or trigger point shots (or all of the above) to help relieve the pain. “Massage guns are best used on large muscles, especially in the legs, shoulders, and back,” Lees said. “These muscles tend to do most of the work when exercising or doing physical labor. Because they are large it’s generally safe to work them with a massage gun unless a tear is suspected.” Anderson also pointed this out. “Areas of big muscles are the best for massage guns,” she said. “My favorites are quads, calves and glutes. Just make sure and stay away from anything bony, even if it feels useful.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/theragun-massage-gun-relief_l_65e225d7e4b0d2a247594afc","Reviewers Say This Light, Reasonably Priced Massage Gun Was Their 'Best Purchase Ever'","haley zovickian","2024-03-05","HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. Rarely do you encounter a product so effective that it blows you away. For me and a plethora of reviewers, the Theragun Relief massage gun is one of those things. It’s a massage gun designed to unknot clenched muscles and help relieve everyday pain and tension. What makes it so impressive, to me, is that it does so surprisingly gently given its power — and at a comparatively accessible price point that reviewers described as “an absolute steal,” given that many quality massage guns can run for well over $500. “I’ve found that the Theragun brand offers a better variety of pressure and speed for all levels of comfort,” Hilary Burkholder, a massage therapist at The Summit in Philadelphia, previously told HuffPost. Dr. Mathew J. Hamula, an orthopedic surgeon at New York-Presbyterian Medical Group, also previously told HuffPost that Theragun massage guns can reduce perceived pain in users by stimulating nerve receptors that in turn relax muscles. “For the most part, they have been successful in treating delayed onset muscle soreness as well as acutely improving range of motion,” Hamula explained. “[Theraguns] tend to be best suited for muscle aches and pains as well as myofascial release to treat areas of tension, knots, adhesions from trauma and tightness.” This has been my experience as a user of Theragun massage guns; I’ve been fortunate to try several of their models and to own the Theragun Relief, the brand’s newest model that’s designed to work as an everyday massager with three speeds and three attachments to target different muscles. It’s also an affordable alternative to some of the brand’s pricier models. Before trying the Theragun for myself, I was skeptical that it would even work for me. I deal with persistent pain from tight, clenched muscles that make it difficult to sleep, and which only seemed to be worsening. I didn’t know what to expect when I first turned it on, and when I did, it at first felt a little strange, like a high-percussion pounding that flattened my muscles but strangely did not hurt, instead delivering a physical relief and release. After spending a few minutes on each of my shoulders, I found that my previously tight, knotted muscles felt liquid-y and knot-free, like I was once again a kid with fluid, pain-free muscles. Of course, you should see a doctor or physical therapist if you feel consistent pain in your body. But the ability to feel this level of relief so quickly blew my mind, and felt like something of a miracle. Reviewers agree with me, too. “I was initially skeptical,” wrote one Best Buy reviewer, “but I was blown away by its performance.” Another Best Buy reviewer swore by it for helping their arthritis, and an Amazon reviewer called it “great for relieving the daily stiffness that comes with advanced age.” Reviewers appreciate how lightweight it is, making it easy for those with small hands and those sharing their Theragun with the rest of their household found their family members delighted: “‘[O]ne of my kids said, ‘[B]est purchase ever!’” And while you can find other cheaper options, reviewers say this one is well worth the extra money. “I [had] the cheaper off-brand version of one of these for a while and the on-brand is definitely worth the extra price,” one Amazon reviewer said. You can grab one of the Theragun Relief models at Amazon, Target or Best Buy, or check out other Theragun options at Amazon or Therabody. Take a look at reviewers’ input below: “I was initially skeptical about the ‘Relief’ given its much lower price point compared to other Therabody products, but I was blown away by its performance! Not only does it deliver the same high-quality deep tissue massage I’ve come to expect from Therabody, but at $149, it’s an absolute steal. The “Relief” has been a game-changer for my post-workout recovery. Its ergonomic design, combined with the power it packs, rivals the more expensive models in the market that go for $200+. It’s clear that Therabody has once again prioritized the user experience without compromising on quality. For those on the fence because of the cost of premium massage guns, the ‘Relief’ is your answer. Highly recommended!” — LlamasRFun, Best Buy “Perfect for my tight muscles! I was a massage therapist for 10 years. I wish I had this back then. Everybody needs this! It has several speeds and three different attachments to target specific areas of tightness/sensitivity.” — AndreaH, Best Buy “Exactly as described. Gr8 for ppl who suffer from arthritis. I was able to single handidly hit the knot between my shoulder blade and spine. This lil fella has enough power to break up tension areas and loosen them without any muscular assistance from me. FYI: if I’m leaving a review, that must mean that it was a pretty dang good product. Just sayin because I don’t leave reviews lightly.” —diSguisedRealist, Best Buy “So worth it!! We are a family of four and we all have enjoyed using it. We are planning on buying a second one! one of my kids said, ‘best purchase ever!’” — Soniagris, Best Buy “I wish I had discovered this years ago! Easy to use, very good battery life with multiple uses before charging is required. It can be used by ones self with the triangle handle that can be held in many ways, as well as used on someone else. This model has 3 levels, I’ve never gone above the second setting, and prefer the first setting but I am thin and boney. My husband prefers the 2nd level setting. It is very effective muscle relief for soreness and stiffness. It helps loosen everything up for flexibility and movement.” — Jody, Amazon “I have the cheaper off-brand version of one of these for a while and the on-brand is definitely worth the extra price. It’s a little bit easier to use on yourself due to the handle and it is also a lot quieter than the cheaper version that I used to have” — anne sue, Amazon “Great for relieving the daily stiffness that comes with advanced age.” — Weaverlady, Amazon “I have small hands and this gun is small and light enough for me to use.” — M.Bermudez, Amazon By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The longer you stay at these jobs, the more comfortable you may get ― even if it does feel increasingly like your career is stalling. And that’s where you might hit the dreaded “job plateau.” It’s a period of time in a long-term job where you feel stuck, frustrated or bored by what you do. Lisa Orbé-Austin, a licensed psychologist who focuses on helping professionals manage their careers, said she sees a lot of people who will ignore for a long time that they are in a job plateau because it’s often a job they know how to do well. “The beginning of a plateau doesn’t feel terrible,” Orbé-Austin said. “But it’s when that ... becomes kind of a feeling of ‘I’ve done this 1,000 times; what’s new about this?’ you have to kind of then think about ‘What is next for me?’” If you do not take action, you can hold yourself back from taking more fulfilling opportunities and stay stuck in a job you should have long left. Sometimes there are warning clues and hints that will alert you to your plateau before you are fully ready to acknowledge or address the problem. Here are some of the most common ones: If you feel you’ve done all you can in terms of skills you can develop and things that you can learn, you’re likely in a job plateau, said Nell Wulfhart, a decision coach who helps professionals get “unstuck” so they can move on. To decide if you’ve really stopped learning useful skills, Wulfhart suggests writing down what you want your future to look like a year to 10 years from now, as well as your long-term goals. “Maybe it’s boring at the moment, but is [the job] actually getting you the skills you need for that next big job leap? Or are you learning things that could be useful when you want to start your own business in five years?” Wulfhart gave as examples. “Sometimes you literally just have to put in the time. And there’s no way to sort of avoid it or skip over it or take a shortcut,” Wulfhart said. But if what you are doing is not serving these long-term goals, then you know that you have hit your plateau. Your ability to be promoted and get raises are tangible ways to track your opportunities for growth in a role. Wulfhart said to watch out if there’s a repeated pattern of your boss promising opportunities and promotions over months and years, but they never happen. “People love praise, and they love the idea that someone is looking out for them,” Wulfhart said. “That kind of thing can keep you coasting along for a really long time.” Wulfhart said many of her clients come to her with job plateaus they have been in for years. She said one of the big signs of a plateau is if you keep obsessing over the idea of leaving your job. “If the thought starts buzzing in your brain, like, ‘Maybe I’ve done all I can with this,’ or ‘Maybe it’s time to get out of here,’ that probably is not going to go away,” Wulfhart. For clients who are torn between leaving and staying at a job, Wulfhart said she asks them to answer: “Would I take this job now if somebody offered it to me?” That’s because one of the reasons people stay put in a job that has plateaued is because it is a job that seems good on paper, Wulfhart said. Answering this question can help you clarify if this is really a job that you are content to stay in long-term. “I would encourage people really to look at who they are now, not who they were when they got the job, just to see if it’s still a fit for them,” Wulfhart said. Does every day feel the same at work? When you’re not learning or growing, you can become completely disengaged from your projects, and it’s a sign that you’ve hit your plateau. “Oftentimes when people are in a plateau, they’re not really thinking about it. They’re just going through the motions more than anything,” Orbé-Austin said. A job plateau is a tough place to be in, but it is possible to address it more immediately. Here’s how: Before you start job-hunting, assess what your current job is offering you. A stable but boring job that you know how to manage may be just what you need to complete higher priorities in your life. Wulfhart gave the example of a job that is helping you pay off credit card debt or helps fund your true passion of being in a band. “I have a friend who has worked in medical publishing for 25 years. And he does not care about medical publishing,” she recalled. “But he has a band, and he’s really into the band. And this is a steady, reasonably well-paid job ... So that’s a perfectly good reason to stay at a job.” While you feel stuck, Wulfhart suggested, it can help to find a hobby unrelated to your job, like pottery, a book club or crafting, that you enjoy doing. Nurturing a new passion can help you see what you have been missing at your job. “When you find something that you’re actually really hyped and passionate about, then it kind of puts the rest of your life into perspective,” she said. “You’re like, ‘Oh, this is actually what it looks like to really enjoy the thing that I do. Like, why am I putting up with less at my actual job?’” People often stay in job plateaus because of their fear of the unknown. Deep down, you may know you need to quit, but you’re afraid of ending up in a job that is worse than what you have. Doing informational interviews with people in other jobs you’re interested in can dispel those anxieties and give you the encouragement you need to take action. With informational interviews, you will also learn what responsibilities you can do at your current job to look like a better candidate for positions you actually want, Orbé-Austin said. You want to take these responsibilities “strategically, so they can be helping you get to the next place you want to go,” Orbé-Austin said. “But you’ve got to know the place first before you start doing that.” Ultimately, getting out of a job plateau and finding a more rewarding opportunity can be tough, hard work, which is why so many of us simply stay put.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/playing-musical-instruments-aging-brain-health_l_65dfada2e4b005b85832abc7","This 1 Hobby Is Great For An Aging Brain, According To A New Study","jillian wilson","2024-03-05","If you’re looking to bolster your cognitive abilities and keep your mind sharp throughout your lifetime, you may want to pick up a musical instrument. A recent study published in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that playing is good for your brain health as you age. Researchers examined 1,107 people in the U.K. over the age of 40 with an average age of 67.82. Participants self-reported their musical experience via a questionnaire and took part in a cognitive assessment, which tested their working memory and executive function. Researchers then studied how four aspects of musicality — listening to music, playing an instrument, singing and self-reported ability — impacted cognitive behavior and compared that to people who did not have a musical background. “This large-scale, longitudinal study supports previous research indicating that musical training supports cognitive health by improving memory and lowering risk for age-related cognitive decline,” Dr. Gary Small, a memory, brain and aging expert at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, told HuffPost via email. Small is not affiliated with the study. It’s worth noting that 83% of participants were women, so it’s not totally indicative of the general population. Another caveat is that some data was self-reported, said Dr. Arman Fesharaki-Zadeh, a behavioral neurologist and neuropsychiatrist at Yale Medicine in Connecticut, who is not affiliated with the study. Self-reporting leaves room for error; people may misremember their musical background or misunderstand a question. Playing music largely involves your executive function, so it’s natural for folks with a musical background to see an improvement in the brain, said Dr. Golnaz Yadollahikhales, a neurologist at Cedars-Sinai in California, who is not affiliated with the study. Your executive function refers to your “ability to multitask and organize oneself, and being able to sequence and prioritize,” Fesharaki-Zadeh explained. Additionally, playing music keeps you cognitively active, meaning it challenges your brain. “Being cognitively active throughout one’s life can have a protective role” in brain health, Fesharaki-Zadeh continued. This is known as your cognitive reservoir (or cognitive reserve) and activities like playing music can build this up. Yadollahikhales noted that she’s seen the study’s findings in her day-to-day work, too. People with a good cognitive reserve perform well even when their brain imaging has signs of atrophy. Brain atrophy is linked to issues like dementia and aphasia, according to the Cleveland Clinic. “The patients of mine who were musicians or who were still playing music at the time of diagnosis would show better cognitive function than what was expected to be seen based on their structural imaging findings,” Yadollahikhales said. You may want to consider dabbling in music. The research and the experts who spoke to HuffPost were all pretty clear that playing musical instruments and singing can be beneficial for your long-term cognition. If you’re ready to start some lessons and are open to the process, consider trying specific instruments. The study found that playing keyboard-based instruments, like the piano or organ, had the biggest benefit on memory and executive function, study author Anne Corbett told Newsweek, followed by brass and woodwind instruments. The social aspect of music may be beneficial for your brain, too. Corbett also told Newsweek that the singers in the study had better complex task completion as they aged. But the study noted that the benefits that come with singing may also have to do with the social connections that are formed when singing with a choir or in a group setting. “Music doesn’t usually happen in isolation,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said. Think about it: Music is often played in a group, practiced with a teacher or performed for other people. That social interaction is one of those protective factors for brain health, he added. Bottom line: You’re never too old to start learning and challenging your brain. “Overall, it is recommended that people start building their cognitive reserve early in life,” Yadollahikhales said. “This can be achieved by playing music and games such as puzzles, reading books and being physically active ... also, as mentioned in this study as well, higher education can affect cognitive reserve positively.” Even if it’s been years or even decades since you’ve challenged your brain to something new, hope is not lost. “We’re never too old to learn, I think that’s a known concept,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said. Benefits can be seen whether you’re 65 or 18. Neurogenesis, the forming of new connections and new cells in the brain, is often not as robust for someone in their mid-70s when compared to someone, say, learning at a new job in their mid-20s. But by learning music (or by learning anything new) you activate this process again, Fesharaki-Zadeh added. “So, let’s say somebody doesn’t have dementia [and] they’re wondering what are the ways that they can protect their brains against dementia — music could be potentially a viable strategy because it does incorporate a lot of the other factors such as learning, emotional well-being, social connections ― and they’re all great for the brain,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said. It’s important to keep in mind that while you can control certain risk factors, you can’t control your genetics. “Although this study demonstrates that musicality provides a significant cognitive benefit, other non-genetic ... and genetic risk factors contribute to the risk of cognitive decline,” Small said. “So, even highly successful people with healthy lifestyles will develop dementia if they have a strong genetic predisposition.” But, as Yadollahikhales mentioned above, if you build your cognitive reserve throughout your life, you’ll be better off if you do develop cognitive impairment or dementia. Studies “have shown that being cognitively, socially and physically active after the development of cognitive impairment and dementia can slow down the progression of the disease,” Yadollahikhales said.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/signs-parentification-child_l_65d7982ae4b0189a6a7d425f","4 Signs You May Have Been 'Parentified' As A Child","kelsey borresen","2024-03-05","It’s common for parents to gradually give their kids more responsibilities as they grow up. When those responsibilities are age-appropriate, that can be a good thing and help the child build skills like accountability, independence and teamwork. But when a child is saddled with adult responsibilities, it can turn into a damaging phenomenon known as “parentification.” Parentification is essentially when the child and caregiver swap roles. So the kid is emotionally supporting the adult (known as emotional parentification) and/or managing the logistics of the household (known as instrumental parentification). Emotional parentification tends to be more harmful than the instrumental type. ″[It’s] the phenomenon that happens when a parent relinquishes the role of parent and a child feels the need to step into that role,” Kristene Geering, a parent educator at the family resource Parent Lab, previously told HuffPost. “So instead of the parent taking care of the child’s needs, the child takes care of the parent’s needs,” she said. Expecting your kid to be a contributing member of the household by putting away their laundry, cleaning up their toys or feeding the dog is not the same as parentification. Parentification is when the burdens placed upon the kid are excessive and prolonged, putting “an emotional toll on the child and getting in the way of developmentally appropriate social, emotional and academic endeavors,” Dr. Khadijah Booth Watkins, associate director of the Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital, previously told HuffPost. Examples of parentification might be if a child is expected to act as their parent’s therapist, be the caregiver for younger siblings or the peacemaker during adult squabbles. Clinical psychologist Cindy T. Graham, founder of Brighter Hope Wellness Center, told HuffPost it’s important to keep cultural and ethnic differences in mind when having these conversations, as “many cultures value interconnectedness among family members and ‘pitching in.’” In cultures where this is the case, “we would also expect to see that the children are allowed to be kids with time to play with other children, be involved in education with other children,” she added. “We would expect that the responsibilities of the home do not regularly overshadow an appropriate childhood experience.” Certain circumstances increase a child’s risk of being parentified, like if their parent is struggling with a physical or mental health issue, a substance use disorder, a divorce or financial troubles, trauma therapist Maggie Nick told Care.com. Immigrant families may also find themselves in this type of dynamic due to language barriers and culture shock. “We are more likely to see parentification in single-parent households, with the oldest siblings being most at risk,” Nick told the publication. If this sounds all too familiar, read on as therapists share the signs you may have been parentified as a child. Struggling to set and maintain boundaries is a sign you may have experienced parentification, said Evelyn Pechous, an associate marriage and family therapist at The Expansive Group. You may have a habit of neglecting your own desires, plans and preferences in order to satisfy someone else’s. In adulthood, you may continue to take on a lot of responsibility and feel a “consistent need to be in control of situations,” Graham said. “Adults who were parentified as children may struggle with allowing others to take the lead in situations,” she said. “This could also result in having relationships with those who will allow them to take charge. Adults who were parentified as children might harbor feelings of resentment from the lack of support.” Over time, this inability to let others share some of this responsibility can leave you “overburdened and eventually burned out,” Graham added. Perhaps your parent treated you like their confidant when you were just a kid and leaned heavily on you for comfort and support. They may have even made comments like, “I need you to make me happy” or “If I didn’t have you to talk to about this, I don’t know what I’d do.” In adulthood, you may continue to feel like you’re responsible for other people’s feelings and well-being. “The caregiver may also have communicated messages such as, ‘If you don’t do well in class, you’re going to make me angry. So do well so you don’t make me angry,’” Pechous said. “This message can then develop an internalized narrative for the child that they must be ‘good’ or ‘perfect’ to prevent their caregiver from becoming angry.” When a loved one is venting to you about something happening in their life, you can’t resist the urge to offer unsolicited advice and solutions in an effort to save the day. “While adults who were parentified as children can be empathetic peacemakers in their relationships, this can also lead to over-involvement in the interpersonal dynamics of others,” Graham said. She added: “In short, the adult who was a parentified adult can struggle with internal feelings of discomfort stemming from having to watch others figure out how to navigate their own lives.” Being placed in situations that were not developmentally appropriate as a kid can hinder your emotional and cognitive development and lead to high stress, anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed, according to The Attachment Project. Making matters worse, your caregivers may not have given you the comfort or support needed to help you work through these emotions, which “can further interfere with the development of healthy emotional regulation skills,” the project’s website says. You may have also had trouble socially and academically as a kid because of all the responsibility you carried at home. Long term, you may struggle with maintaining healthy boundaries and relationships. Additionally, you may develop clinical depression “due to a constant hypervigilance of a caregivers’ emotions or challenges with identifying wants and needs,” Pechous said. But not all of the outcomes are negative, Graham noted. It can be useful to consider some of the positive effects of this kind of upbringing. “For example, parentified adults may be dependable and high-achieving, or even the ‘rock’ of their families, friend circle, workplace and community,” she said. “They may also be likely to remain calm in difficult interpersonal situations.” If you’re an adult trying to deal with the parentification you experienced as a child, there are things you can do to process and move forward. For starters, work on identifying your own authentic desires and needs, Pechous said. “Notice how different situations, such as boundary-setting, physically feel in our bodies. When we are able to slow down and help our bodies understand that we might no longer be in the same environment or unsafety we were in before, our nervous system can become much more attune to the present,” she said. “When we are able to slow down and help our bodies understand that we might no longer be in the same environment or unsafety we were in before, our nervous system can become much more attune to the present.” Building a consistent routine with protected time set aside for relaxation and self-care practices “can reduce the potential for burnout and overcommitment,” Graham said. “Having an accountability buddy, or someone who checks in to make sure that one is not overcommitted, is also a helpful strategy.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

(AP) — A single-engine plane crashed near a highway in Nashville, Tennessee, just a few miles short of the airport it had tried to reach for an emergency landing, killing five people aboard, authorities said. The pilot made an emergency call to John C. Tune Airport around 7:40 p.m. Monday, reported engine trouble and was given clearance to make an emergency landing, Metro Nashville Police Department spokesman Don Aaron said. A short time later the pilot radioed that the aircraft would not reach the airport, he said. The plane burst into flames when it crashed in a grassy median just off Interstate 40 and behind a Costco on the city’s westside. The crash scene was about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) south of the general aviation airport. “It appears that everyone on board perished,” Aaron said. In a statement early Tuesday on the social media platform X, police said five people died. It said the Federal Aviation Administration was at the scene and the National Transportation Safety Board planned to arrive Tuesday. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/credit-card-late-fees-cfpb-rule_n_65e68bd6e4b0f8905933b823","Credit Card Late Fees Would Drop Under New Biden Administration Rule","jonathan nicholson","2024-03-05","The Biden administration is trying to rein in what it says are unnecessarily high credit card late fees, putting in place a new consumer protection rule it says will lower them. “For over a decade, credit card giants have been exploiting a loophole to harvest billions of dollars in junk fees from American consumers,” Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Tuesday. “Today’s rule ends the era of big credit card companies hiding behind the excuse of inflation when they hike fees on borrowers and boost their own bottom lines.” The move is part of a slate of measures unveiled Tuesday by regulators and agencies meant to show the Biden administration is trying to boost competition and bring down costs to consumers as many voters are still chafing from the effects of prices increases in 2022 and 2023. Those other moves include a proposal by Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel to limit bulk billing of broadband services in multi-household buildings, such as condo and apartment complexes, and a move by the Agriculture Department to boost competition for processing in livestock and poultry markets. But the CFPB rule, to be officially published Tuesday, may get the most notice. The bureau said banks collected more than $14 billion in late payments in 2022 and that those fees made up more than 10% of all the fees and interest banks charged customers. A 2009 law was meant to limit late fees to no more than the amount needed to actually recover late payments. But in implementing the law, the Federal Reserve provided an exception for banks that charged no more than $25 for the first late payment and $35 for subsequent ones, and it allowed those amounts to rise with inflation. The average fee is now $32, said the CFPB, which is now in charge of enforcing the 2009 law. Its new rule would bring that down to $8, saving an estimated $220 annually for the 45 million people who pay late fees. Though fees have long been a steady source of income for banks, they are in good financial shape and may not feel much of an effect from the change. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in November that U.S. banks made $68.4 billion in profits in the third quarter of 2023, down slightly from the quarter before. Still, major banking trade groups — the American Bankers Association, the Consumer Bankers Association and the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions — warned in 2023 that the change would mean more borrowers would pay late because the fees would not deter them and would subsequently see their creditworthiness suffer.

During an interview with Right Side Broadcasting Network that was broadcast in front of supporters from his Mar-a-Lago home, Trump claimed there are “people who are coming from parts unknown, countries that you’ve never heard of.” “Languages that nobody in this country speaks. We don’t even have teachers of some of these languages,” he continued. Then he asked, “Who would think that we have languages that are like from the planet Mars?” The line drew a laugh from the audience. “Nobody, nobody, knows how to, you know, speak it,” Trump added. Trump on immigrants: They have languages that nobody in this country speaks. The languages are from Mars pic.twitter.com/diVfTZ88nU Four-times-indicted Trump has regurgitated a similar line of attack on immigrants. “Nobody can explain to me how allowing millions of people from places unknown, from countries unknown, who don’t speak languages,” he confusingly complained during his visit to the U.S. southern border last week. “We have languages coming into our country. We have nobody that even speaks those languages. They’re truly foreign languages. Nobody speaks them,” he added. “And they’re pouring into our country, and they’re bringing with them tremendous problems, including medical problems, as you know.” CNN’s fact-checking reporter Daniel Dale, though, at the time said the claim “seems to be just conjured out of thin air” and is “nonsense.” Amid record levels of migrants at the border, Republican 2024 front-runner Trump has sought to make immigration a key issue in the 2024 election, which is looking increasingly likely to be a repeat of the 2020 vote between himself and President Joe Biden. Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration and limit legal immigration if he returns to the White House, promising “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.” “Look, we have to deport a lot of people, and they have to start immediately,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity last week. Local police officers would play a key role in the deportations, he explained. MARS-a-Lago? This tracks, for a man who stared directly into an eclipse. Donald Trump, in an interview with RSBN, says that some of the immigrants crossing the border are speaking ""languages that are, like, from the planet Mars. Nobody knows how to, you know, speak it.""Trump often makes similar claims, but this is a new interplanetary variant. His cheese has slid off the launch pad ~ fucking Mars? Does he think illegal aliens are......aliens????? Pretty sure he couldn’t point to Mars on a map of the solar system. The next four years will change America forever.

During a discussion on President Joe Biden’s fitness for office on Monday, Democratic strategist Jonathan Kott said he’d rather have a POTUS “who maybe has a stutter once in a while than one who spews conspiracy theories, racist nonsense, and has dinner with Nazis.” Bruce fired back by falsely accusing Kott, a former aide to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), of calling “a number of Republicans Nazis and racists.” She railed, “So, I think we can put him in the category of willing to go there.” DAMN!

(Trump later claimed he’d “never heard” of Fuentes before their “very quick dinner”). But the Fox News personalities didn’t allow Kott’s defense. “That is a tactic that is not going to work,” raged Bruce. “The American people don’t like it, and they are taking it personally. Look at his numbers. It’s not going to work.” As Faulkner drew the conversation to a close, she told Kott she was withdrawing her earlier praise of him for not name-calling.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-supreme-court-legal-peril_n_65e6a554e4b0f8905933ba3a","Trump’s Staying On The Ballot, But His Legal Peril Is Just Starting","nicholas riccardi","2024-03-04","DENVER (AP) — Former President Donald Trump gained a clear win at the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, which unanimously ruled that states don’t have the ability to bar him — or any other federal candidates — from the ballot under a rarely-used constitutional provision that prohibits those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. The decision shuts down a push in dozens of states to end Trump’s candidacy through a clause in the 14th Amendment, written to prevent former Confederates from serving in government after the Civil War. But it may open the door to further electoral uncertainty, exposing more state officials to disqualification under the provision and setting up a constitutional showdown should Trump win the election. Facing four separate criminal trials, Trump’s legal peril may just be beginning. So is the Supreme Court’s role in that process. Here are some takeaways: A TECHNICAL, BUT STILL BIG, WIN The most significant thing the court did Monday was to overturn a Colorado Supreme Court ruling from December that Trump was not eligible to be president because he violated the insurrection clause, Section 3, of the 14th Amendment. This will also stop efforts to kick him off the ballot in Illinois, Maine and other states. Had the Supreme Court let the Colorado ruling stand, it could have triggered a new wave of litigation that might have left Trump disqualified in many states. The high court avoided addressing that politically contentious issue of whether Trump played a role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol that would have barred him from seeking office. The ruling is almost devoid of references to Jan. 6 or insurrection, and doesn’t address whether Trump committed such an act by sparking the attack on the Capitol. Instead it focuses on the technical, procedural question of who gets to decide an election challenge under Section 3. All nine justices agreed that is the purview of Congress. But a narrower majority of five went further, ruling it can only be done through legislation. That exposes significant splits underneath the unanimous majority, and points toward the greatest uncertainty the ruling creates. A TIME BOMB FOR JAN. 6, 2025? One possible outcome that the case presented was the prospect of unelected judges disqualifying the man dominating who has already received hundreds of thousands of votes in the nominating process. But another potential nightmare is that if Congress is the only entity that can determine whether a presidential hopeful is indeed disqualified for engaging in “insurrection,” that it makes that determination on Jan. 6, 2025, when required to certify a possible Trump victory in the presidential election. The high court shut down the first possibility, but may have left the door open to the second one. The five-justice majority — all from the court’s conservative wing — said Congress can implement Section 3 through legislation, “subject of course to judicial review.” (That means the court reserves for itself the right to have the final say.) That triggered a dissent from the court’s three liberals, who complained that that “shuts the door on other potential means of federal enforcement.” That would appear to include a rejection of Trump’s electors should he win the election ― but multiple legal experts said Monday that it wasn’t that clear, and the only way to know may be for Congress to try. FEELING THE HEAT The 14th Amendment case is one of two putting the high court squarely in the midst of the ongoing presidential election. Last week, the court agreed to hear Trump’s appeal of a federal ruling that he’s not entitled to immunity from criminal charges for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Trump’s trial on those charges was originally scheduled to begin Monday, but has been postponed because of the battle over his immunity challenge. The high court taking up his appeal in late April raises the possibility that trial won’t conclude until after the presidential election. The justices’ discomfort over being put in the middle of the nation’s partisan divide came through in a brief, but notable, concurring opinion by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Though one of the court’s conservatives, she didn’t agree with the majority’s ruling that Congress can only enforce Section 3 through legislation. But she didn’t want to sign onto the liberals’ dissent, either, instead warning against focusing too much on partisan divisions. “...this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency,” Barrett wrote. “The Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up.” “For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case,” she concluded. “That is the message Americans should take home.” ACTION IN THE STATES The court’s ruling shuts off using Section 3 against federal officials absent action by Congress but it leaves open the ability of states to use the provision against their own state officials, noting there’s a rich record after the Civil War of just those sorts of actions. That’s already begun anew in the post-Jan. 6 era. The first disqualification under Section 3 in more than a century came in 2022, when a New Mexico court removed Couy Griffin, who was convicted of entering the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 while leading a group called “Cowboys for Trump,” from his rural county commission. The group that brought that case, Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, next filed the Colorado case against Trump. They said they were eager to continue filing Section 3 cases against lower-level Jan. 6 participants. TRUMP’S LEGAL TRAVAILS AHEAD Few observers expected the Supreme Court to keep Trump off the ballot. But he’s facing far more perilous legal road ahead. The first of Trump’s criminal trials, for allegedly falsifying business records to pay hush money to an adult film actress during the 2016 presidential campaign, is scheduled to start in New York later this month. The former president is also appealing a New York judge’s ruling that he pay $355 million for fraud committed by his businesses, and verdict that he pay a writer $83 million for defaming her after she sued him for sexual assault.

Depending on how and how quickly the high court rules on Trump’s immunity claim, he could still face charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election in Washington DC before this November’s election. Two more cases are more likely to come later – in Atlanta where Trump faces state charges for his 2020 election plot, and in Florida where he’s tentatively scheduled for a May trial on improper retention of classified documents after leaving the presidency, but the trial date is expected to be postponed.

The suit was filed by former Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal, former chief financial officer Ned Segal, former head of legal and policy Vijaya Gadde and former general counsel Sean Edgett. The executives, fired after Musk’s 2022 takeover, say they were entitled to severance due to clauses in their contracts. (Twitter was later renamed X.) The amounts include a year’s salary and stock options, but the group claims Musk “fired them without reason, then made up fake cause and appointed employees of his various companies to uphold his decision.” According to Agrawal’s offer letter, obtained by The New York Times, he was entitled to a severance payment of more than $57 million. Segal was entitled to more than $44 million in benefits and Gadde more than $20 million. Edgett was also entitled to nearly $7 million, according to the suit. “Musk’s refusal to pay Plaintiffs their benefits is part of a larger pattern of refusing to pay Twitter’s former employees the benefits and other compensation they are due,” the complaint says. “He claimed in his termination letters that each Plaintiff committed ‘gross negligence’ and ‘willful misconduct’ without citing a single fact in support of this claim.” The group’s lawyers argued the tactic fit with Musk’s public pledges to deny severance to employees he fired after taking over Twitter. The suit added Musk had vowed a “lifetime of revenge” on the former executives after the group blocked his attempt to walk out on the $44 billion takeover deal.

(AP) — Donald Trump won the North Dakota Republican presidential caucuses on Monday, adding to his string of victories heading into Super Tuesday. The former president finished first in voting conducted at 12 caucus sites, ahead of former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The results resumes Trump’s winning streak, which was briefly interrupted on Sunday when Haley notched her first victory of the campaign in the District of Columbia’s primary. The White House hopefuls now turn their attention to Super Tuesday, when results will pour in from 16 states in contests that amount to the single biggest delegate haul of any day in the presidential primary. Trump and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, are dominating their races and are on track to winning their nominations later this month. Under North Dakota’s rules, candidates are eligible to win delegates if they finish with at least 20% of the vote. However, a candidate who wins at least 60% of the vote receives all of the state’s 29 delegates. Four candidates were on the ballot, including Trump and Nikki Haley. The other candidates, who have received little attention, were Florida businessman David Stuckenberg and Texas businessman and pastor Ryan Binkley, who recently ended his campaign. In 2016, it was a North Dakota delegate who helped Trump secure the number needed for the Republican presidential nomination. He swept North Dakota’s three electoral college votes in 2016 and 2020, winning about 63% and 65% of those votes, respectively. As president, Trump visited Bismarck and Mandan in 2017 to talk about tax cuts, and he campaigned twice in Fargo in 2018 for Kevin Cramer in the then-congressman’s successful Senate bid against Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. North Dakota’s Democratic-NPL Party is holding a presidential primary almost entirely by mail, with mail-in voting from Feb. 20 to March 30, and limited in-person voting for residents of Indian reservations. President Joe Biden, Rep. Dean Phillips and six others are on the ballot. A third party will count ballots in Fargo on March 30, with results available on the party’s website afterward.

The new allegations add to Jones’ original lawsuit, in which he accuses Diddy of sexual assault and harassment. In new filings, Lil Rod claimed that Diddy or his son Justin shot Justin’s friend, identified in the complaint as a 30-year-old named G, in the abdomen and near his leg or hip area in a bathroom at Chalice Recording Studio in Los Angeles in September 2022. He claims that G has since disappeared. The complaint, which included pictures purported to show a bloodied bathroom, said the shooting followed an argument involving Diddy, Justin and G during a “writers and producers camp” at the studio. The three moved to a nearby bathroom just 2 feet away from Lil Rod when multiple shots were fired, at which point the producer feared being shot through the door, according to the complaint. It then added that Diddy and Justin left the bathroom while G remained on the floor and that multiple people then crowded around the door. In an effort to help G, Lil Rod applied pressure to his wounds, propped him up on the toilet and urged the surrounding bystanders to call for an ambulance, according to the complaint. Lil Rod then carried G to the ambulance in front of the studio as Diddy and his son “disappeared to another part of the studio,” according to the document. The complaint claims that G was “physically incapable of walking” and that Lil Rod had to carry him to the ambulance. “Mr. Combs gave strict instructions to inform the police that he had nothing to do with the shooting. He also forced Mr. Jones to lie to the police by telling them that G was shot standing outside the studio by a drive-by assailant,” the complaint says. Lil Rod’s recollection of the shooting clashes with the official Los Angeles Police Department account and claims from Diddy’s attorney Shawn Holley that the shooting did not happen at the studio, NBC News reported Monday. At the time, KCAL-TV in Los Angeles reported that the victim was shot outside of the studio, citing the LAPD. The report, which was featured in the amended complaint, did not include names. “When LAPD arrived on scene, it was immediately determined (conclusively) that the shooting took place some distance from the studio,” Holley told NBC News. “Neither Sean nor Justin were in the vicinity or even aware of what had occurred until afterwards. So I don’t think either of them were interviewed [by police],” Holley added. Further, the complaint included a screenshot of an Instagram message from the studio to an unnamed recipient that claimed the shooting occurred “half a block away from Chalice.” “As of the date of this filing, neither the Los Angeles Police Department, nor the Los Angeles Fire Department have released any official reports surrounding this shooting. There has been no body camera footage, and no 911 call recording. What is even more disturbing, is that there has been no citing [sic] of G,” the complaint said. In Lil Rod’s initial complaint, filed on Feb. 26 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, he accuses Diddy of “constant unsolicited and unauthorized groping”; coercing him to engage in sexual acts with sex workers; as well as lacing alcohol given to Lil Rod and his guests, which included underage girls. In addition, the complaint says that Diddy runs a racketeering enterprise has not paid him for his production work on his latest album, “The Love Album.” Rod also claims in the suit that Diddy said he was “responsible for” a shooting involving a rapper named Shyne in 1999. “Filing a lawsuit should never be the first option in a dispute. We can have an honest discussion to resolve the issues as I suggested, or we can follow the same plan Shawn Holley used that got her clients Danny Masterson and Tory Lanez convicted. Makes one wonder who is really managing this situation for Mr. Combs,” Lil Rod’s attorney Tyrone Blackburn said, according to NBC News. Lil Rod is the first man to file a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against Diddy, who has branded himself as “Brother Love” despite previous allegations of violence and faulty business practices from numerous men who had been employees, Rolling Stone reported. The Bad Boy Entertainment founder was accused of sexual abuse in four other lawsuits in November, starting with a harrowing lawsuit filed by an ex-girlfriend, model and R&B artist Cassie. In a 35-page complaint, Cassie accused Diddy of raping and abusing her, forcing her to have sex with male sex workers as he watched, and inciting a drug and alcohol addiction. The “Me & U” singer’s accusations came as the Adult Survivors Act in New York, which allowed accusers to come forward with allegations of sexual abuse beyond the set statute of limitations, was set to expire in November. Cassie and Diddy settled the lawsuit the day after it was filed. Following Cassie’s suit, at least three more from other women were filed under the New York statute before it expired. One woman, identified in the lawsuit as Liza Gardner, accused Diddy and singer Aaron Hall of raping her and her friend in 1990 or 1991. Another woman, Joi Dickerson-Neal, accused Diddy of raping her, filming it and showing the video to others in 1991. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a lawsuit claiming that Diddy, former Bad Boy Records President Harve Pierre and an unnamed man “gang raped” and “sex trafficked” her when she was 17 years old in 2003. At the time, Diddy was 34. Following the onslaught of lawsuits, Diddy, who has denied all the accusations against him, stepped down from his position as chairman of the media company Revolt in November. Plans for a reality TV show that was set to focus on his life and family were cut short in December. “Enough is enough,” he wrote in an Instagram post in December. “Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.” The next four years will change America forever.

John Thune (R-S.D.) confirmed Monday that he’s throwing his hat in the ring to become the Senate Republican leader once Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) steps down. Thune, the Senate minority whip, shared the news with KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “Well, I hope to be, and I’m going to do everything I can to convince my colleagues,” Thune replied when asked if he was gunning for the leadership position. “They’re the voters. They’re the ones who ultimately make the decision. But that, as we look at a new generation of consistent, principled, conservative leadership in the United States Senate that empowers our Senate Republicans, that puts a [check and balance] against ... what has been the, a very liberal Schumer/Biden agenda, I’m prepared to lead that effort,” referring to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and President Joe Biden. His announcement comes days after 82-year-old McConnell, the longest-serving Senate leader in history, said he’ll step down in November and leave office when his term ends in January 2027. “One of life’s underappreciated moments is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter. This will be my last term as Republican leader in the Senate,” an emotional McConnell told his colleagues Wednesday. Thune has served in the Senate since 2005 and has been the Republican whip since 2019. He was a vocal opponent of efforts by former President Donald Trump, the likely GOP nominee in this year’s presidential election, to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump’s plot to overturn Biden’s victory would “go down like a shot dog,” Thune said at the time, adding, “I just don’t think it makes a lot of sense to put everybody through this when you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be.” The next four years will change America forever.

The “Baywatch” star — whose ultra feminine and glammed-up appearance contributed to impossibly high beauty standards for women in the 1990s — made headlines in September when she decided to ditch her signature look and attend Paris Fashion Week without makeup. In an interview with fashion and lifestyle outlet Highsnobiety that was published last week, the former Playboy model said that her decision to go makeup-free has been a part of her “healing experience” and noted that she now uses a “more natural” beauty routine. She also shared how the choice to get rid of her glam team made those closest to her, including her two sons, Brandon Thomas and Dylan Jagger, nervous. “My boys were like, ‘Mom, you must have a glam team,’” Anderson said. “And my agents were like, ‘You have to have a glam team! Where’s the stylist?’ I go, ‘I know how to put a dress on myself. I don’t need someone buttoning up my blouse. I got this.’ And they were just horrified.” Anderson’s decision to nix the makeup has received praise. Scarlett Johansson called Anderson’s makeup-free look at Paris Fashion Week “powerful,” while Jamie Lee Curtis said she was “so impressed and floored” by the “Home Improvement” actor’s “act of courage and rebellion.” Elsewhere in her Highsnobiety interview, Anderson said that the look that made her famous was never authentic. “I was actually always a tomboy growing up,” she said. “I never wanted to wear a dress. I was athletic. I made mud pies.” She also hinted as to why she initially embraced a style that wasn’t really hers. “We all get roped into, ‘Oh, I want to be successful so I can have this and this, and show people that I’m cool, chic, admired,’” Anderson said. “And then we’re all just left with debt and a fancy car.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-2020-fake-electors-wisconsin_n_65e6679ce4b0f8905933a9b1","Wisconsin Fake Elector Case Settlement Offers New Details On Trump Lawyers' Strategy","sophia tareen","2024-03-04","Two attorneys for then-President Donald Trump orchestrated a plan for fake electors to file paperwork falsely saying the Republican won Wisconsin in a strategy to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 victory there and in other swing states, according to a lawsuit settlement reached Monday that makes public months of texts and emails. Under their agreements, Kenneth Chesebro and Jim Troupis turned over more than 1,400 pages of documents, emails and text messages, along with photos and video, offering a detailed account of the scheme’s origins in Wisconsin. The communications show how they, with coordination from Trump campaign officials, replicated the strategy in six other states including Georgia, where Chesebro has already pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the 2020 election. The agreements settle a civil lawsuit brought by Democrats in 2022 against the two attorneys and 10 Republicans in Wisconsin who posed as fake electors. The Republicans settled in December. “Our democracy demands better than this,” said Scott Thompson, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys who helped negotiate the agreements. “That is why this lawsuit … consistently sought transparency, accountability and deterrence. We can’t let this happen again.” There is no admission of wrongdoing or liability in the agreements in which Chesebro and Troupis promise to never participate in similar efforts involving future presidential campaigns. Troupis must also pay an undisclosed amount to the plaintiffs. Troupis said Monday in an emailed statement that the “alternate elector ballots” were “a reasonable course of action” given that the 2020 results were appealable to the U.S. Supreme Court. “The settlement was made to avoid endless litigation, and nothing in today’s settlement constitutes an admission of fault, nor should it,” he added. Phone and text messages left Monday for Chesebro weren’t immediately returned. Electors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party’s electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome. The documents show how Chesebro and Troupis, Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin, used arcane laws in rationalizing and drafting the false certificates for the fake electors. They also reveal how the two strategized ways to delay deadlines for certifying electoral votes and sway public opinion, including floating ideas on conservative talk radio. In November 2020, as they were awaiting a decision from the then-conservative leaning Wisconsin Supreme Court on Trump’s effort to invalidate thousands of votes in the state, Chesebro suggested to Troupis that they contact conservative radio hosts in Milwaukee and Madison: “Mostly to maximize the chance that SCOW (Supreme Court of Wisconsin) justices hear about this quickly and prejudge the case?” He ended with a winking emoji. The fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied wrongdoing. Michigan and Nevada have criminally charged fake electors, but there’s no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, has suggested he’s relying on federal investigators while also not ruling out a state probe. Attorneys who negotiated the settlement said information in the documents has already been provided to Kaul’s office. Monday’s agreements were announced by Georgetown University Law Center’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, Law Forward and the Madison-based Stafford Rosenbaum law firm. According to the plaintiffs’ attorneys, the documents show how Troupis, an attorney who has represented the Republican Party of Wisconsin and is a former judge, was deeply involved in the origins of the effort. Trump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes. At Troupis’ urging, Chesebro drafted memos in the final months of 2020 detailing how to prepare the fake elector certificates and how they should be signed. The documents include a 10-minute video of the fake electors who cheer and take photos as they cast and sign ballots for Trump at the Wisconsin State Capitol. There are no direct communications with Trump in the documents, but there are exchanges with top campaign aides and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. A day after Chesebro shares a Dec. 6 memo on strategies, Troupis follows up via text: “I have sent it to the White House this afternoon. The real decision makers.” There’s a brief mention of a Dec. 15 afternoon meeting with Trump in the Oval Office that both men attended with others. Days later, Chesebro refers to Trump’s social media post summoning followers to Washington on Jan. 6, saying “Be there, will be wild!” “Wow. Based on three days ago, I think we have a unique understanding of this,” Chesebro texts Troupis. Trump campaign officials did offer their assessment of each state’s progress on the fake elector plan. “Wisconsin appears to be the most organized state so far,” concludes a Dec. 11, 2020, email from Trump campaign associate general counsel Joshua Findlay to Chesebro. “This all came out of Wisconsin and expanded to other states,” said attorney Mary McCord with Georgetown’s institute, who helped negotiate the settlement. “That was a significant part of the narrative that led to the violence on Jan 6.” After the deadly attack at the Capitol, the attorneys discussed falsely deflecting blame from Trump supporters to members of the anti-fascist movement, among others. “It’d be nice if Trump surrogates could get across that without antifa’s role in the actual breaking in … the scene at the Capitol would have been entirely peaceful. And that Trump could not (have) reasonably foreseen this,” Chesebro wrote in a text to Troupis. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-election-2024-trump-kennedy_n_67244818e4b0871068feb853","RFK Jr. Wants Federal Health Data So He Can Show Vaccines Are Unsafe, Trump Transition Co-Chair Says","michelle r. smith","2024-10-31","PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A co-chair of Donald Trump’s transition team said Trump supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wants access to federal health data so he can show vaccines are unsafe and lead to them being pulled from the market in a second Trump administration. Howard Lutnick echoed a number of Kennedy’s debunked anti-vaccine talking points in a CNN interview Wednesday, including falsehoods about the vaccine schedule and the disproven theory that vaccines cause autism. Trump has talked often about how Kennedy, who suspended his own presidential bid and endorsed him in August, will have a big role to play if the former president returns to the White House. While Lutnick said Kennedy would not be chosen as secretary of health and human services, he was not specific about what Kennedy’s role might be. Lutnick made the comments the same day that Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump asked him to “reorganize” agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture. The comments by Lutnick raised immediate concerns among public health experts that giving influence to one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world could lead to what one said would be “severe health consequences” for Americans, especially children. They come just days before the Nov. 5 election and as Trump, a Republican, and Democrat Kamala Harris are vying to sway late-deciding voters to their side. Lutnick, the CEO of the financial services company Cantor Fitzgerald, told CNN that Kennedy wants access to data “so he can say these things are unsafe” and that will stop the sales. “He says, if you give me the data, all I want is the data and I’ll take on the data and show that it’s not safe. And then if you pull the product liability, the companies will yank these vaccines right off of the market. So that’s his point,” Lutnick said. It was unclear what data Lutnick was referring to since extensive data and research on vaccine safety is publicly available. The World Health Organization has estimated that global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives in the past 50 years. In recent days, Trump has said he would let Kennedy “go wild” on health, food and medicines. Kennedy has said repeatedly that he plans to exercise his influence over a wide range of policies if Trump wins and said Trump had promised him control over health agencies and told him he wanted him to reorganize them. Asked about Kennedy’s comments and his role in a Trump administration, Jason Miller, a senior adviser for the campaign said the only thing Trump and his campaign are focused on is winning on Nov. 5. “Everything after that is after that, and President Trump has made clear that Bobby Kennedy will play an important role,” Miller wrote. It would be “extremely dangerous” to put Kennedy in a position of power where he could make decisions or have the ability to change regulatory policy, said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Removing vaccines from the market would lead to severe health consequences for America,” said Sharfstein, a former deputy commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “We go about our daily lives in the United States not worrying about a lot of preventable diseases like measles because of the protection that the vaccines provide. But if there were to be a systematic effort to use the tools of the federal government to undermine vaccination, children won’t be safe. Full stop.” Even if Kennedy is given a lesser role where he provides input and comments but doesn’t have control over policy, it could still be damaging, according to people who have served in public health roles in government. “Advisers like Scott Atlas have demonstrated the significant influence they can wield without congressional oversight, raising fears of misinformation and harm,” Trump’s own surgeon general, Dr. Jerome Adams, wrote in an email, referring to Trump’s former COVID-19 pandemic advisor, a radiologist with no background in infectious disease, who advocated for the widely discredited herd immunity strategy. Adams said he believed it was unlikely that Kennedy could be appointed to lead a major health agency because he has no medical expertise, it would likely be difficult for him to pass a background check for a top secret clearance and he’d likely lack support in Congress — though Trump circumvented the background check system during his first administration and stocked his Cabinet with acting officials who had not received congressional approval. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit. Republican lawmakers have long enjoyed – and reciprocated – support from pharmaceutical companies, even vowing to dismantle a law signed by Democratic President Joe Biden that allows the government to negotiate the price of prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees. Republicans have argued the law will hurt the businesses and stifle innovation in the industry. But vaccine skepticism, growing across the country, has become deeper among conservatives. In addition to people’s health and well-being, the possibility that Kennedy’s influence would result in debunked ideas like a vaccine link to autism being again dredged up and wasting time, energy and money disheartened public health advocates. “Trump helped bring the vaccine to market, and he took the vaccine. ... I don’t know why he’s giving this person this mouthpiece,” said Amy Pisani, CEO of Vaccinate Your Family, noting Trump’s Operation Warp Speed helped bring the COVID-19 vaccine to market, though Kennedy has relentlessly attacked it. Vaccinate Your Family is a nonpartisan group co-founded by former first lady Rosalynn Carter and former Arkansas first lady Betty Bumpers that has worked on vaccine programs with both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations for the past 30 years.

JD Vance unleashed a slew of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim rhetoric during a long conversation with podcaster Joe Rogan that aired Thursday, saying it was “common sense” to exclude people with certain backgrounds from the United States. Vance, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, spoke with Rogan for more than three hours, talking at length about the Trump campaign’s plans for the southern U.S. border while criticizing the Biden administration. At one point, Rogan described a “worst-case scenario” for people fearful of a state falling under Islamic law, pointing to a recent law in Minneapolis that allows mosques to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer. “That starts getting real weird,” Rogan told Vance. “When you have people openly saying our goal is … to outbreed everyone who is not Muslim.” “Scares the hell out of me,” Vance replied. “That’s what to me is so crazy … about some of the hyper left-wing reaction. Where you see actual religious tyranny is increasingly in Western societies where you’ve had a large influx of immigrants who don’t necessarily assimilate into western values but try to create, I think, a religious tyranny at the local level.” “And if you think that will happen at a national level, you’re [called] crazy.” Vance then lamented that those who want to exclude people from some nations — referencing the Trump travel ban on people from some majority-Muslim nations, an order that he has pledged to restore — were called racist. “Somehow it’s fundamentally racist to say, well, we don’t want certain people of certain backgrounds to be in the United States of America,” the senator from Ohio said. “No, it’s just common sense.” Vance went on to say that there is “something in the modern liberal mind that doesn’t even allow” people to ask how certain immigrants would benefit the country. “If the answer is we don’t benefit,” he said, “then why would we bring them into the country?” Trump has continued to fill his campaign rallies with striking anti-immigration rhetoric, stoking fears of an incursion along the southern border and blasting the Biden administration for what he describes as inaction on a migrant crisis. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, however, has pointed to Trump’s insistence earlier this year that Republicans block a bipartisan border deal that the White House had touted as an effective fix for border enforcement.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-us-biden-garbage-comment_n_6724318be4b00acf55d95c19","White House Altered Joe Biden's 'Garbage' Remarks, Despite Stenographer Concerns: Report","aamer madhani , zeke miller","2024-10-31","WASHINGTON (AP) — White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which President Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two U.S. government officials and an internal email obtained Thursday by The Associated Press. Biden created an uproar earlier this week with his remarks to Latino activists responding to racist comments at a Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Biden, according to a transcript prepared by the official White House stenographers, told the Latino group on a Tuesday evening video call, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.” The transcript released by the White House press office, however, rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading “supporter’s” rather than “supporters,” which aides said pointed to Biden criticizing Hinchcliffe, not the millions of Americans who are supporting Trump for president. The change was made after the press office “conferred with the president,” according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers’ office that was obtained by The AP. The authenticity of the email was confirmed by two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. The supervisor, in the email, called the press office’s handling of the matter “a breach of protocol and spoilation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices.” “If there is a difference in interpretation, the Press Office may choose to withhold the transcript but cannot edit it independently,” the supervisor wrote, adding, “Our Stenography Office transcript — released to our distro, which includes the National Archives — is now different than the version edited and released to the public by Press Office staff.” The edit of the transcript came as the White House scrambled to respond to a wave of queries from reporters about Biden’s comments. The president’s remarks clashed with Vice President Kamala Harris’ near-simultaneous speech outside the White House in which she called for treating Americans of differing ideologies with respect. The Trump campaign quickly moved to fundraise off the quote, and the next day, Trump himself held a photo op inside a garbage truck to try to capitalize on Biden’s criticism. Harris on Wednesday distanced herself from Biden’s comments — making the clearest break from the president since she took over for him at the top of the Democratic ticket just over three months ago. “Let me be clear,” she told reporters, “I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.” According to the email, the press office had asked the stenographers to quickly produce a transcript of the call amid the firestorm. Biden himself took to social media to say that he he was not calling all Trump supporters garbage and that he was referring specifically to the “hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally.” The stenographers office is charged with preparing accurate transcripts of public and private remarks of the president for preservation by the National Archives and distribution to the public. The two-person stenography team on duty that evening — a “typer” and “proofer” — said any decision to change the transcript would have to be made by their supervisor, the head of stenographers’ office. The supervisor was not immediately available to review the audio, but the press office went ahead and published the altered transcript on the White House website and distributed it to press and on social media in an effort to tamp down the story. White House press secretary Andrew Bates that evening also posted on X the edited version of the quote and wrote that Biden was referring ”to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage.’” The supervisor, a career employee of the White House, raised the concerns about the press office action — but did not weigh in on the accuracy of the edit — in an email to White House communications director Ben LaBolt, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and other press and communications officials. “Regardless of urgency, it is essential to our transcripts’ authenticity and legitimacy that we adhere to consistent protocol for requesting edits, approval, and release,” the supervisor wrote. The supervisor declined to comment to The AP and referred questions about the matter to the White House press office. Asked to comment, Bates did not address the alteration of the transcript and said: “The President confirmed in his tweet on Tuesday evening that he was addressing the hateful rhetoric from the comedian at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally. That was reflected in the transcript.” House Republicans, meanwhile, were debating launching an investigation into the matter. House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and House Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on Wednesday accused White House staff of “releasing a false transcript” of Biden’s remarks. In a letter to White House counsel Ed Siskel on Wednesday, they called on the administration to retain documents and internal communications related to Biden’s remarks and the release of the transcript. “White House staff cannot rewrite the words of the President of the United States to be more politically on message,” the lawmakers wrote to Siskel. Stefanik and Comer said the action could be in violation of the Presidential Records Act of 1978. — Madhani reported from Las Vegas.

Thomas Gannon, 56, was found dead inside his home in Honesdale, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to the report by the Wayne County Coroner’s Office released Wednesday. Gannon had been a suspect in the killing of a woman whose body had been found in Suffolk County, New York, on Monday. Sabina Rosas, a New York City artist who also went by the name Sabina Khorramdel, was found dead at Shou Sugi Ban House in Water Mill, New York. The Suffolk County Police Department has not confirmed her cause of death, but told local media that police believe she was a “victim of violence.” Gannon “confessed to committing the homicide immediately prior to taking his own life,” according to a press release from the Wayne County coroner’s office. Edward Howell, the county coroner, told the Tri-County Independent, “I confirmed the confession by reading a message the decedent sent to a family member immediately prior to his death.” Rosas co-founded Ruyo Journal, an online magazine which echoed in a statement on Thursday that her death was caused by violence. The magazine also addressed the attention Rosas’ killing has gained in recent days, with some media outlets speculating about the circumstances of her death and her relationship with Gannon. “We want to make it clear that no family member or close friend of Sabina has spoken to any media outlets. Any information circulating from these sources is unverified and should not be trusted,” the magazine wrote. Authorities have not confirmed the type of relationship between Gannon and Rosas, but the artist’s mentor, Elizabeth Phillips, told CBS News that Gannon supported Rosas financially. “He was here for dinner twice ... He had money, and he wanted to help her and he wanted to be with her all the time,” Phillips told CBS News. She said Gannon gave her the “creeps.” The next four years will change America forever.

The 78-year-old Democrat made the stunning remarks Wednesday at a Harris campaign rally in Michigan, a crucial swing state that has one of the largest Palestinian and Arab American communities. Those communities, both in Michigan and other states, have repeatedly voiced their hesitation to vote for Harris due to her stance on Gaza policy, which is virtually unchanged from that of President Joe Biden. Clinton called that hesitation “a mistake.” “I understand why young Palestinian and Arab Americans in Michigan think too many people have died, I get that,” Clinton said to the quiet crowd in Muskegon. “But if you lived in one of those kibbutzim in Israel, right next to Gaza, where the people there were the most pro-friendship with Palestine, most pro-two state solution of any of the Israeli communities … and Hamas butchered them.” Bill Clinton in Michigan: ""I understand why young Palestinian and Arab Americans in Michigan think too many people have died — I get that, but…""""Hamas makes sure that they're shielded by civilians, they'll force you to kill civilians, if you want to defend yourself."" pic.twitter.com/cYzlsmWTGo Clinton’s claim that Arab Americans “think too many people have died” is in reference to the more than 43,000 Palestinians killed by the Israeli military since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel and killed 1,200 people while taking about 250 hostage. The Israeli military has also taken Palestinian civilians captive throughout its offensive, and medical experts estimate the Gaza death toll to be much higher than local officials can tally. In response to critics pointing out the disproportionate casualties and collective punishment ― a violation of international law ― the former president said he’s “not keeping score” but that Israeli forces have to kill tens of thousands of Palestinians because they are allegedly human shields for Hamas. It should be noted that the Israeli military has recently been accused of using Palestinian civilians as human shields in their Gaza operations. International and U.S. law also warns against the indiscriminate killing of civilians, even if militants are allegedly embedded among them. “What would you do if it was your family and you hadn’t done anything but support a homeland for the Palestinians? And one day they come for you and slaughter the people in your village?” Clinton said. However, this also describes what the Israeli military is currently doing to families in Gaza and the occupied West Bank ― some of whom are loved ones of the Palestinian Americans he directed his remarks to. Clinton echoed sentiments voiced by right-wing Israelis ― such as equating all Palestinians with Hamas fighters ― that work to dehumanize occupied people so that large civilian casualties are more accepted in the public eye. The former president also argued that Israelis inhabited the land “before their faith existed,” referring to Islam ― a historically inaccurate claim framing Palestinians as just Muslims when they are, factually, a multifaith group largely descended from native Canaanites who have lived on the land for thousands of years. “Bill Clinton’s racist and ahistorical remarks were meant to justify the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land. The Harris campaign is doing itself no favors attaching itself to that kind of hateful rhetoric,” a spokesperson for the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project told HuffPost. The Harris campaign did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on Clinton’s remarks, including whether the candidate believes his comments will help her earn the votes of Muslim and Arab Americans. It’s unclear what the campaign was hoping to achieve with such a speech just days before the election, given Harris’ ongoing struggle to win the community’s trust in Michigan. “Rumor has it the Dems want to send Bill Clinton to Dearborn to rally the Arab vote this weekend,” Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud posted on X. “Do us a favor – stop sending surrogates who have no respect or regard for this community. You’re only inflicting more damage.” The Biden-Harris administration has provided billions of dollars in weapons to Israel, which has used them to turn Gaza into a wasteland of rubble, sewage and corpses with hardly any health care or aid. The State Department has yet to take action on almost 500 reports it’s received claiming Israel used American weapons to cause excessive civilian harm in Gaza, according to The Washington Post on Wednesday.

(AP) — A man faces a felony assault charge after an unprovoked attack on a fellow passenger who was sleeping during a cross-country flight this week, according to authorities. An FBI agent said Everett Chad Nelson punched the other man repeatedly in the face and head, leaving the man bleeding, before another passenger pulled him off the victim. The attack on a United Airlines flight Monday from San Francisco to Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia lasted about a minute. “Thanks to the quick action of our crew and customers, one passenger was restrained after becoming physically aggressive toward another customer,” United said in a statement. “The flight landed safely and was met by paramedics and local law enforcement.” United said there were 82 customers and six crew members on the flight. According to an FBI affidavit, Nelson left his seat in the rear of the plane and used a lavatory near the front before attacking the other man, who suffered bruises around his eyes and a gash on the nose. Blood was splattered on the the sleeves of Nelson’s windbreaker. The agent said Nelson was moved to a seat near the front of the plane and was watched by the passenger who had stopped the assault. There was no indication that Nelson knew the victim, who was not identified. The public defender listed as Nelson’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Daren Christopher Abbey, 41, was charged with deliberate homicide in the killing of Dustin Kjersem, 35, who was found dead inside his tent near Big Sky on Oct. 12 by his girlfriend, officials said. It was not immediately clear if Abbey had an attorney representing him. Gallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer said Kjersem had planned a weekend camping trip with his girlfriend and arrived early on Oct.10 to set up the campsite. He was supposed to pick her up the following day after she finished working, but he did not show up. Springer said Kjersem’s girlfriend went to the campsite on Oct.12 with a friend and found him dead inside his tent. In an earlier news release by the sheriff’s office, authorities said that because of the viciousness of the attack, the caller who reported Kjersem dead said it may have been caused by a bear. However, there were no signs of bear activity at the campsite, and an autopsy determined Kjersem’s death was a homicide. During the course of the investigation, detectives collected DNA evidence from a beer can at the scene, which led them to Abbey, Springer said. Abbey was taken into custody in Butte on an unrelated charge on Saturday, and he allegedly confessed to killing Kjersem on Tuesday. Springer said Abbey had been employed in the Big Sky area at different times. Booking records note his tattoos include a swastika, an iron cross and SS lightning bolts. According to Springer, Abbey told investigators he was looking for a place to camp on Oct.10 when he ran into Kjersem, who welcomed him to the campsite and offered him a beer. However, at some point during the interaction, Abbey struck Kjersem with a piece of solid wood, stabbed him in the neck with a screwdriver and attacked him with an ax, Springer said. Abbey reportedly removed items from the campsite that he believed would link him to the killing. The next four years will change America forever.

Visiting a union hall in Philadelphia, Biden and local union leaders highlighted the American Rescue Plan of 2021 and how it funded union pension plans that were facing insolvency. The pensions of an estimated 1.2 million workers and retirees have been protected from cuts due to the legislation. It was no accident that the event took place in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most critical of battleground states for Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and for her opponent, former President Donald Trump. Democrats have worried about Harris’ strength with the kind of blue-collar union voters whose pensions were backstopped by the bill. Biden made sure anyone listening knew that the pension rescue got no Republican backing when Democrats muscled it through Congress over three years ago as part of a larger, pandemic-era stimulus package. It passed on a party-line vote in the Senate, with Harris casting a tie-breaker at a critical juncture for the bill. The president said the vote underscored the hyperpartisan nature of Congress these days. “We used to have real differences in the Senate. But at least when the critical things, we ended up getting together. But not anymore,” Biden said. “This is a different deal we’re working with. Not a single, solitary Republican in the House or the Senate, not one, voted to help with the pensions. Not one single one.” “It’s the way things have gotten,” he added. “It’s wrong.” He said that he and Harris “worked like hell” to include the pension rescue, known as the Butch Lewis Act, as part of the American Rescue Plan, and theorized that some Republicans would have voted for it but were afraid to cross party leaders. “I believe a lot of those Republicans who voted no thought it was wrong. But they’re afraid to vote the right way,” Biden said. The legislation provided an estimated $74 billion to $91 billion to shore up troubled multiemployer pension plans, which are funds that employers pay into under collective bargaining agreements. The funds can run into trouble when union membership declines over time, with more retirees drawing down benefits and fewer contributions going in on behalf of active workers. The White House said Pennsylvania is home to an estimated 65,000 of the workers and retirees helped by the legislation. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a government-run entity that insures multiemployer pension plans, said Friday it had approved an application to pump $684 million into a plan covering 29,000 workers and retirees in the service sector. The pension rescue became something of a campaign story after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ executive board declined to make an endorsement in the presidential race. The Teamsters had the largest pension plan saved from cuts, and so the decision not to back Harris angered many members and labor allies John Pishko, a retired Teamster from western Pennsylvania, spoke at the Philadelphia event about how the legislation helped save his retirement. He said he was set to lose 30% of his pension benefit, or about $1,000 a month, before Democrats stepped in with the bailout. “That’s a pretty substantial cut to any working man,” Pishko said. “It was devastating.” He had assumed he would “never” be able to stave off those cuts. “It matters when you have a president and vice president who has your back,” he said.

Click here to subscribe. Election Day is Tuesday. And while plenty of politicos and pundits are out there predicting what will happen, the reality is that … nobody knows. The polls are super close, nationally and in the swing states. Forecasting models see the race as a coin flip. But you can spot some clear storylines that say a lot about how the two presidential campaigns have unfolded so far, and that might even help explain the outcome after the fact. One of those storylines is the determination and enthusiasm of women who back Democrat Kamala Harris, including women who might be afraid to say so publicly because their husbands support Republican Donald Trump. I first heard about this last week, in Michigan, while covering a campaign event for Democratic Senate candidate Elissa Slotkin. Slotkin said canvassers were reporting stops at houses with large Trump signs, where women would answer and ― when asked which candidate they were supporting ― would quietly point to a photo of Harris on the canvassers’ campaign literature. Slotkin went on to say she’d been hearing of an organic campaign to put notes in bathroom stalls, reminding women that their votes are confidential and that they should vote like their daughters’ lives depend on it. It all sounded a little apocryphal. But it turns out that there really is a sticker and sticky note campaign, and it has been underway for at least several weeks, as Ms. Magazine and then NBC News reported in September. And though the movement appears to have started on its own and spread over social media, lately the underlying sentiment has been getting high-profile support from figures like former first lady Michelle Obama, who in a recent Harris campaign appearance said, “If you are a woman who lives in a household of men that don’t listen to you or value your opinion, just remember that your vote is a private matter.” Are there enough hidden votes to change who wins a state? Probably not. But the emotional fuel for it, the determination of so many women to elect Harris over Trump, absolutely could prove decisive. If that happens, it would be one of the more ironic twists in modern political history ― and one of the more fitting ones, too ― because a campaign pitting men against women is exactly the campaign Trump and his advisers wanted. It’s no secret that this year’s gender gap is shaping up to be the largest in memory, with polls showing men favoring Trump by double digits, and women favoring Harris by a similar margin. In many ways, that gap was preordained not because of who’s on the ballot, but what’s at stake ― the future of reproductive freedom, and one side that’s actively pushing to regress back toward restrictive gender roles and limited rights. But instead of trying to counter that, Trump has leaned in. On the eve of this summer’s Republican National Convention, even before President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid and Harris became their party’s nominee, Trump campaign officials boasted about how they were hoping to create what Axios called a “boys vs. girls election,” with ”Donald Trump’s chest-beating macho appeals vs. Joe Biden’s softer, reproductive-rights-dominated, all-gender inclusivity.” So powerful was this appeal, Trump’s campaign managers told The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta, that Trump would manage to peel off some of the Black and Hispanic men who would traditionally vote Democratic, enough to offset losses among women. “For every Karen we lose, we’re going to win a Jamal and an Enrique,” one Trump ally had previously told Alberta. The Trump campaign has unfolded just as his team promised ― which helps explain why, for example, Trump has spent the final weeks before the election appearing alongside former Fox News host Tucker Carlson (who recently suggested that the country needed Trump to be a “dad” who would deliver a “spanking”) while sidelining former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (who has been popular with independent female voters). And the strategy may very well work. Polls have shown Harris struggling to hit the margins among Black and (especially) Hispanic men that previous Democrats have. But the Trump gambit depends on winning over more men faster than he alienates women. And that’s hardly a safe bet. In just the last few years, the gender gap has been increasing at a faster pace than before, as my colleague Lilli Petersen explained recently. Part of the reason for this shift is the Republican Party’s assault on reproductive freedom, culminating in the Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling striking down its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and the enactment of abortion bans in multiple states. Trump has bragged about appointing the justices who made that ruling possible. Trump, by all accounts, has come to understand that abortion is a political liability. That’s why over the past year he has, on occasion, suggested that some of the state bans go too far — or promised to protect access to in vitro fertilization, something at risk under abortion bans because it can involve the destruction of embryos. But with Trump being Trump, he’s been inconsistent and vague about what he would or wouldn’t support when it comes to reproductive rights. And that’s not to mention the message his campaign has been sending about forcing adherence to traditional gender roles, in part with Trump’s selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate. Vance’s past includes statements that women without children are “childless cat ladies” who have too much influence in politics, as well as suggestions that the sexual revolution made it too easy for women to leave bad marriages. After these comments came to light, Vance doubled down — essentially apologizing to cats, but not women. A campaign determined to win over more women would have made a serious effort to walk back these statements, starting with an apology. Vance never offered one, and neither did Trump. How is this all shaking out? Overall, according to a recent Politico analysis, women are accounting for 55% of the early vote across battleground states. And in Pennsylvania, a state that many strategists consider the most important for each candidate, data suggests that early voting includes a relatively high proportion of Democratic women who did not vote there in 2020. Early voting is a notoriously unreliable predictor of outcomes, for the simple reason that the data about who is voting doesn’t say that much about how they are voting, especially in an environment without solid baselines for comparison. Early voting did not become particularly widespread until 2020, in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and with Trump advising his supporters not to vote by mail. (This year, he’s generally encouraged them to vote early if they can.) But women are a larger proportion of the population and, historically, they have voted at higher rates too. Last month, political scientist and Brookings senior fellow Elaine Kamarck ran the numbers on different scenarios to see what would happen if women came out to vote in the same proportion as in 2020, given the latest polling numbers available. She found Harris would win Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — enough to win the election. The underlying polling numbers are now a month old, plus there’s no way to know how accurate they were. And a significant increase in turnout among men could easily elect Trump, Kamarck went out of her way to note. But, she concluded, “if women’s turnout stays the same as in 2020, it could be a good year for Harris; if it increases, it could be a very good year for her.” That’s why the intensity of Harris’ support among women is so important, and why I reached out to Nikki Sapiro Vinckier, a Democratic activist in the northern Detroit suburbs. Sapiro Vinckier, 36, is an OB-GYN physician’s assistant and abortion-rights advocate. She’d volunteered for Democratic campaigns before, but after watching Trump’s 2024 campaign unfold ― and then seeing Harris become the Democratic nominee ― she started making her own lawn signs and, more recently, stickers that she’s distributing locally and through social media. The stickers say: “Ladies, no one will know who you vote for. Vote for your daughters, your sisters, yourself. Vote Kamala.” Sapiro Vinckier told me she has already ordered more than 30,000 stickers and is on her way to distributing all of them. Sapiro Vinckier said she knows she’s not the only one getting so involved. “You have women who are coming out in tremendous numbers to vote, but you also have women coming out in incredible numbers to organize,” she said.

It was an informed, and proud, choice. As Maya Angelou said, “When people show you who they are, believe them.” We closely know Kamala Harris, who she is, what she believes, why she cares and that she’s ready to get to work for all Americans. Harris has spent her entire career in public service. It’s a path she chose because of her deep belief in freedom, opportunity and justice — the promise of America. What distinguishes Harris’ leadership is her constant awareness of who isn’t in the room. That awareness goes far beyond physical presence — it’s about who we hold in our minds, our hearts and our policies. When she’s crafting solutions for America’s future, she’s thinking about the single parent working two jobs who couldn’t make it to the town hall; the rural family struggling with internet access who couldn’t join the virtual meeting; the first-generation college student studying late into the night; the small business owner working too many hours to attend a campaign rally. Her vision of America includes those whose voices often go unheard but whose dreams and determination are the true measure of our nation’s promise. This deep understanding shapes not just her policies, but her fundamental approach to leadership — ensuring that every American, in the room or not, has a fair shake in our shared future. We are the Colored Girls. Combined, we have over a century of political experience. We’ve worked alongside civil rights leaders, presidents, labor leaders and community leaders, and witnessed some of history’s most pivotal moments. Through it all, we’ve learned that true leadership emerges when the moment demands it. This moment requires a leader with vision — one who sees America’s promise not despite our challenges, but through them. Vice President Harris is that leader. Each of us came to know Vice President Harris at different points along her remarkable journey, as far back as when she was a student at Howard University. Two of us hosted her first national fundraiser when she ran for San Francisco district attorney, determined to reform the system from within. Some connected with her during her groundbreaking campaign for California attorney general. Others worked alongside her during her presidential campaign, witnessing her early commitment to voting rights and democratic participation. Through every role and every challenge, we’ve seen her leadership firsthand. Harris has revealed her character through her words and deeds. As a daughter of immigrants who dared to dream, she embodies the promise that brought generations to our shores. As a former caregiver who balanced family responsibilities with professional duties, she intimately understands the struggles of working families. Her story mirrors that of countless unnamed women who’ve sustained our democracy through their unwavering service and sacrifice. In California, as a prosecutor, she pioneered programs giving first-time offenders a second chance. As attorney general, she secured billions from big banks to help homeowners recover from the foreclosure crisis. As a senator, she championed working families and defended reproductive rights. As vice president, she’s helped deliver historic investments in American infrastructure while standing firm against threats to our democracy. This week, as we cast our votes for Vice President Kamala Harris, we felt the presence of every ancestor who paved this path. We thought about Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who led the March on Washington just a few months before Harris was born. We thought of our grandmothers and grandfathers who couldn’t vote but taught us the power of persistence. We remembered Fannie Lou Hamer, who endured physical violence for the right to cast a ballot. We honored Shirley Chisholm, who dared to be the first Black woman to seek the nation’s highest office, making this moment imaginable. We celebrated faith leaders who held our communities together, teachers who nurtured our dreams and domestic workers who sacrificed everything so their children could thrive. This week, as 75,000 Americans from all walks of life gathered on the National Mall, we witnessed a moment of profound symbolism. Harris stood between two monuments demonstrating the long fight toward freedom and justice in America: the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Between these landmarks — one marking the presidency’s origins, the other embodying our people’s path from bondage to freedom — Harris spoke of America’s next chapter, carrying forward both the weight of history and the hope of tomorrow. Every step Harris takes toward the presidency walks on ground made firm by the feet of ancestors. Every word she speaks echoes with the whispered prayers of generations who reached for the possibility of freedom even when it seemed impossible. For us, casting a ballot for Harris carries the weight of history. As Black women who have spent decades in the political trenches, we know the special significance of voting for the first Black and South Asian woman to serve as president. This isn’t just about representation – it’s about realization. The realization of dreams deferred. The realization of possibilities denied. The realization of our ancestors’ faith. On Nov. 5, Americans can choose more than their next president. They can affirm that the dreams of generations who held America to its promises were not in vain. In Harris, we see a leader who carries their wisdom and resilience. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-fbn-cowboys-jury-duty_n_672543a4e4b01f6919da0f4a","No, Being A Dallas Cowboy Doesn't Exempt You From Jury Duty","schuyler dixon","2024-11-01","FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Brandon Aubrey was pretty sure being the kicker for the Dallas Cowboys was going to get him out of jury duty. It’s safe to say he was surprised to end up serving on a domestic violence case that lasted a week and ended with his jury sentencing the defendant to 65 years in prison. “Eye-opening, long, frustrating, depressing, hearing the story,” Aubrey said Thursday in an interview conducted by a member of the Cowboys’ media relations staff. “The story was a sad one. I don’t really want to get into all the details of the story, but it was very depressing and dragged on longer than anybody expected it to. So, glad it’s over.” Aubrey wasn’t in the Dallas locker room during the team’s media availability on Thursday. A team staffer emailed a transcript of the interview with the kicker to the media later in the day. A year ago, Aubrey set an NFL record as a 28-year-old rookie by making the first 35 kicks of his career. A record streak of eight consecutive games with at least one field goal of 50 yards or longer ended last weekend in a 30-24 loss to San Francisco. The Cowboys (3-4) visit Atlanta (5-3) on Sunday. With Aubrey’s anonymity likely blown by that kind of eventful start to his career, he said the judge told everyone during jury selection who he was. Aubrey said he has a sister-in-law who is a prosecutor, and she had assured him his celebrity would disqualify him. Aubrey, who had postponed his jury summons once but wasn’t allowed to do it again, also thought he had a suitable conflict to present to the judge — being at the team’s facility to prepare for last weekend’s game in San Francisco. The judge acknowledged him by name and said he could come back to him on the issue of conflicts, Aubrey said. The next thing the kicker knows, the judge is saying Aubrey won’t have any conflicts because the court won’t be in session over the weekend. “I could have been more assertive and at that point, everyone knows who I am there, and I don’t want to sound like I think I’m better than anyone else or that I’m above the job,” Aubrey said. “So kind of sat there quietly and didn’t say anything, which was probably a mistake. I figured at that point still, he’s not going to pick me.” As it turned out, Aubrey had to scramble to get in his kicking work during the week. He didn’t get to the facility until close to sundown Thursday of last week, first fighting the sunset and actually kicking in the dark for a spell with long snapper Trent Sieg and his holder, punter Bryan Anger. Aubrey couldn’t kick in the comfort — and under the lights — of the team’s indoor practice facility because of a high school game. “You can’t really see where you’re kicking, and for Bryan in particular, trying to catch the snaps, he had a hard time at first tracking the ball and hitting the spot,” Aubrey said. “So, it was a lot harder, but really just wanted to get the leg moving and keep the body fresh for game day.” Aubrey wasn’t really tested against the 49ers, making his only field-goal attempt from 29 yards and all three extra points. A former Major League Soccer prospect who played that sport at a Dallas-area high school and Notre Dame, Aubrey got a shot with the Cowboys last year after they scouted him in the USFL. When he was trying to get the attention of pro teams, Aubrey would leave his day job and go straight to local fields so he could kick. Jury duty had him reliving the experience.

In an interview with Variety published Wednesday, the actor reflected on one of his seminal films, 1999’s “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” which also starred Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow. His portrayal of Dickie Greenleaf in the film nabbed him an Academy Award and made him a sex symbol to legions of fans. Five years after the release of “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” Law was selected as People magazine’s “Sexiest Man Alive.” It was at that point, he now acknowledges, that he began to grow “frustrated” by the hyper-fixation on his physical appearance. “Interestingly, I was talking about this to a friend,” he told Variety. “He made a good point. He said, ‘If you were a woman, people would have been told off for objectifying you.’ I think it frustrated me because I was this young guy desperately keen to have an acting career and for people to talk about that, as opposed to what I looked like.” As an example, the article points to Law’s 2004 appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” when he appeared to laugh nervously as DeGeneres suggested that men were getting plastic surgery to copy his lips. Prior to “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” Law was primarily known as a theater actor in his native England. The movie’s success led to his casting in a plethora of high-profile projects, including 2001’s “A.I.: Artificial Intelligence” and 2003’s “Cold Mountain,” for which he received his second Oscar nomination. But being catapulted to global fame left him “feeling really invaded by people prying into ... my private life,” he said, alluding to the media frenzy when he divorced his first wife, Sadie Frost, and began a relationship with his “Alfie” co-star, Sienna Miller.

But being invaded was something that always made me bristle. So, sadly, I always associated the experience with that discomfort. I really don’t want to go over old ground, but there was a chapter afterwards, as things got more and more intense in that way.” These days, Law says, “the attention of the photographers and the prying eyes” have moved on. Since 2019, he’s been married to psychologist Phillipa Coan, with whom he shares two children. Variety’s interview with Law comes as the actor is gearing up for the release of a number of high-profile projects, including the films “Eden” and “The Order.” In December, he’ll appear in the Disney+ series “Star Wars: Skeleton Crew.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Daniella Moreno and her mother, Liliana Moreno, 43, were last seen on May 30, 2016, at or near a Home Depot in Hialeah, Florida, according to an FBI press release seeking information on their whereabouts. For years, Daniella’s father, Gustavo Alfonso Castano Restrepo was considered a person of interest as the last person to see them alive. But it wasn’t until Tuesday that federal prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida unsealed an indictment against him, charging him with kidnapping resulting in death. Prosecutors did not immediately answer questions from HuffPost about what led to the new indictment. According to police documents cited by local TV station WPLG in 2016, on May 30, Castano Restrepo had asked Liliana Moreno and their daughter to come with him to the Home Depot, but he got into an argument with Liliana Moreno while driving. Castano Restrepo told police he pulled over and dropped the two off near a turnpike, after she scratched his arm. Castano Restrepo said he drove to his job at a warehouse, but when he returned to pick Liliana and Daniella up, they weren’t there. The mother and daughter weren’t reported missing until Liliana Moreno’s sister was unable to contact her for days and Daniella was absent from school, police in Doral said at the time, according to NBC affiliate WTVJ. Police suspected foul play after checking Moreno’s apartment and found it was unoccupied, and that Moreno appeared to have left suddenly. An immense search effort began and was covered closely by local media. Days later, police found Castano Restrepo inside a truck parked outside the Home Depot in Hialeah, harming himself with a knife, the Miami Herald reported. He denied his involvement in his daughter’s and Moreno’s disappearances, CBS News reported. In 2021, investigators sought to bring new attention to the case, which had by then gone cold, even as Castano Restrepo remained a person of interest. “He’s out in the community here in South Florida,” Miami-Dade Police Detective Christopher Villano told CBS News at the time. “We’re dotting all our I’s and crossing all our T’s and, in these cases, we don’t just want to make an arrest.” An attorney listed as Castano Restrepo’s representation declined to comment to HuffPost on Friday.

Jackson joined former “SNL” colleagues Dana Carvey and David Spade on their reflective “Fly on the Wall” podcast Wednesday and said, “We gotta talk about Alec Baldwin, because he was on ‘Fly on the Wall,’ and he said my breasts looked like garbage cans.” In an appearance on the podcast last year, Baldwin said “the only time” he ever broke character on “SNL” was in April 1990, when the costume Jackson was wearing for a sketch apparently made her “boobs” look “like two garbage cans sticking in your face.” Jackson said Wednesday that Baldwin has “been mean” to her ever since the publication of her 2012 book, “Is My Bow Too Big?” which included a more direct description of alleged misconduct, which Jackson spoke about on another podcast in March. “Alec was sitting next to me on the set, and he asked me why my boobs were so big,” Jackson said on the “Wasn’t That Special: 50 Years of SNL” podcast. “That’s rude, and it’s caustic and it’s inappropriate.” HuffPost has reached out to representatives of Baldwin for comment. Jackson added in the March podcast that, though it was hard to know “if he was flirting with me” or “being mean,” she sensed “a mixture.” On Wednesday, she scolded Carvey for telling Baldwin last year that she was trying not to “fall in love with him” on the 1990 set. “I don’t remember it that way,” she told Carvey. Jackson also blamed “political correctness” for being dropped by her agent around that time and argued on Wednesday that Baldwin — who has done his Donald Trump impression on “SNL” over the years — “has hatred inside of him.” As for the moment when “political correctness” supposedly reared its head, the outspoken conservative — who frequently shares Christian and pro-Trump posts on Instagram — said she had merely performed “this little song called ‘White Men Are Good’” at a comedy club.

Liz Cheney should eliminate him in the race for the White House. “This must be disqualifying,” she told reporters in Madison, Wisconsin. “Anyone who wants to be president of the United States who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president.” The Democratic nominee for president’s remarks come a day after Trump dreamed up a violent scenario for Cheney, a Republican who’s endorsed Harris and appeared with her on the campaign trail. “She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let’s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face,” the Republican presidential nominee told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson during an appearance in Arizona. Trump’s remarks, Harris said Friday, are indicative of how he plans to treat his political opponents if he wins the presidency next week. “Rep. Cheney is a true patriot who has shown extraordinary courage in putting country above party,” Harris said. “Trump is increasingly, however, someone who considers his political opponents the enemy, is permanently out for revenge and is increasingly unstable and unhinged. His enemies list has grown longer, his rhetoric has grown more extreme and he is even less focused than before on the needs and concerns and challenges facing the American people.” Trump has made over 100 public threats to “investigate, prosecute, imprison or otherwise punish his perceived opponents,” NPR reported last week. Most notably, he suggested last month that members of the “radical left” represent “an enemy within” that he’d confront with military force if elected. Trump has mocked concerns about him imprisoning his political enemies. “It’s unbelievable. Did you see ‘Donald Trump wants to put us in jail,’” he said in North Carolina on Wednesday, parroting the alarm. “Donald Trump is going to go after some of the scum that you see back there,” he continued, gesturing to the press pit at his rally. “They’re so dishonest. ‘Donald Trump is doing terrible things. He wants to put us in prison.’ That’s what they’ve been trying to do to me for three years — they got this story mixed up.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The singer and actor delivered an emotional speech in support of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s 2024 rival for the White House, at a Thursday event in North Las Vegas, Nevada. Lopez called out wildly problematic jokes made Sunday by Trump rally speaker Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Hinchcliffe and others at Madison Square Garden also made xenophobic remarks, as well as racist comments about Black people, Palestinians and Jewish people. “At Madison Square Garden, he [Trump] reminded us who he really is and how he really feels,” Lopez said on Thursday. “It wasn’t just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day. It was every Latino in this country. It was humanity and anyone of decent character.” “I am an American woman,” she later said. “I am the daughter of Guadalupe Rodríguez and David Lopez, a proud daughter and son of Puerto Rico.” “We are Americans,” she added. Elsewhere in her speech, Lopez fought back tears as she encouraged people to vote. “I promised myself I wouldn’t get emotional. But you know what? You know what? We should be emotional. We should be upset. We should be scared and outraged. We should,” she said. “Our pain matters. We matter. You matter,” she continued. “Your voice and your vote matters.” The Trump campaign faced swift backlash after the New York rally. This week, Puerto Rican celebrities such as Bad Bunny and Ricky Martin pushed back against the rhetoric from the Republican’s event. Actor Aubrey Plaza, who has Puerto Rican heritage, similarly decried Hinchcliffe’s “disgusting remark.” Meanwhile, Trump has tried to distance himself from the stand-up. His team has said that the “garbage” joke “does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.” But the former president has also downplayed the racist and problematic rhetoric from his event. On Tuesday, he described the New York City rally as “an absolute lovefest.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/parents-raising-confident-kids_l_67211017e4b04165810acdfe","Here's The 1 Thing Parents Get Wrong About Raising Confident Kids","kelsey borresen","2024-11-01","Raising confident kids today can feel like an uphill battle — particularly in a time when social media stirs up feelings of inadequacy, comparison and self-doubt among young people. Parents want to help their children feel capable and self-assured as they move through the world, but sometimes the way they go about it is misguided. Developmental psychologist Aliza Pressman, co-founder of the Mount Sinai Parenting Center and author of “The 5 Principles of Parenting,” addressed one of the common mistakes parents make in an August episode of the podcast “On Purpose With Jay Shetty” — a clip of which has been making the rounds on Instagram. The key thing to remember, she said: “Competence builds confidence, not praise.” “Telling your kid they’re amazing is not going to make them feel like they’re amazing. It’s the competence — like helping them develop the skills,” Pressman explained in the episode. “And those skills don’t have to be that you’re like a star violinist or tennis player. It can be that you know how to cook or put the dishes away. Just a functioning individual.” She goes on to say that parents “tend to do everything” for their children even when the kids themselves are capable of handling it, “but then praise them, as if that’s building their confidence.” A post shared by Dr. Aliza Pressman (@raisinggoodhumanspodcast) In an interview with HuffPost, Pressman said that while it is, of course, important that we show our children that we believe in them, “a pathway to believe in themselves is to watch themselves get competent at something.” “And then our praise is actually this authentic mirroring of what they already know to be true about themselves,” she explained. You can bolster confidence with competence in any area, she said — even by contributing to household chores. A long-term University of Minnesota study found that kids who helped with basic household tasks as young children were more self-reliant as adults than those who did not have chores or started doing them in their teenage years. Give your child some developmentally appropriate tasks around the house and resist the urge to micromanage them. “Don’t give them a chore and fix it because you do it better,” Pressman said. “Let them get better at it through practice.” And it doesn’t just have to be chores. Start by having your child practice things they already have an interest in because that will make them more motivated to develop that task or skill. “Whatever they practice consistently will get stronger,” Pressman said. “Then they experience the delight of building competency, and it can be translated to things they may be less interested in later.” “Telling your kid they’re amazing is not going to make them feel like they’re amazing. It’s the competence.” Neuropsychologist Sanam Hafeez also emphasized that it’s important for parents to allow their kids room to solve problems on their own. “Give them support, but don’t rush in to fix everything,” Hafeez, director of Comprehend The Mind, told HuffPost. “Ask them to verbalize how they feel about how they handled something. Validate their feelings. Remind them that you love them unconditionally and you’re always there to support them if they need it.” To strengthen confidence in kids, she also suggests teaching them to take time to reflect on their past achievements. Remind them that things they are capable of now once felt out of reach. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

And how six months from now they’re going to be able to do a lot more things,” Hafeez continued. “I show them how learning or skill-building doesn’t happen overnight. It really is one foot in front of the other and staying with the building blocks.” And while strengthening confidence takes time, the pursuit is worthwhile. “Caregivers rightfully care so much about supporting confidence,” Pressman said. “Confident kids make better choices, they know who they are and they also can be more generous to others.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Liz Cheney is condemning comments Donald Trump made about imagining her getting shot at. During an appearance with Tucker Carlson in Glendale, Arizona, on Thursday night, Trump called Cheney a “radical war hawk,” and suggested putting her in a soldier’s place, “with a rifle, standing there, with nine barrels shooting at her.” He added: “Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.” Cheney responded to Trump’s attack on Friday by noting its authoritarian bent. “This is how dictators destroy free nations,” she said on X, formerly Twitter. “They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.” This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. #Womenwillnotbesilenced #VoteKamala https://t.co/URH5s929Sa Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams said that Trump’s suggestion about “sending a prominent Republican to the firing squad” was a clear and stark contrast with his Democratic opponent, who is considering adding a GOP member to her cabinet. “This is the difference in this race,” he told the Associated Press. Many of Trump’s former allies and advisers also condemned Trump’s statement, including Alyssa Farah Griffin, former Trump White House director of strategic communication and current panelist on “The View.” “It’s unconscionable,” Griffin told CNN Friday morning. “I don’t know how Republican leaders, many of whom served with Liz Cheney and at one point considered her a colleague and a friend, cannot denounce this.” Miles Taylor, former Homeland Security chief of staff, called Trump’s comments “sick” and said on X that “any fellow conservative of conscience should condemn this in the strongest terms.” But others, such as prominent Trump critic and former Republican congressman Joe Walsh, insisted that the former president did not call for Cheney “to be executed in front of a firing line.” Instead, he posted on X that “in Trump’s typically stupid, ugly fashion, he’s trying to make a point about Cheney’s stance on war.” The next four years will change America forever.

I'm Shocked Anyone Would Pass Up This Opportunity.","mercy chikowore","2024-11-01","“I usually don’t vote,” she said casually over her waffles, the words landing between us like a spilled mimosa. I stared at my eggs Benedict, suddenly less appetizing, as the now-ruiner of brunch continued with a proud grin, “And if I do vote in the presidential election, I just write my name in.” She laughed. The irony wasn’t lost on me. Here I was, a new U.S. citizen practically vibrating with excitement about my first time voting, sitting across from someone willingly throwing away what I’d spent nearly two decades trying to obtain. I’m what they call a third-culture kid, which is a fancy way of saying “globally confused.” I was born in Japan, with roots in Zimbabwe, and a childhood pinballing between New York City, Harare, and Geneva before landing in South Carolina for college. My cultural diversity manifests primarily through food: My love language is sushi, I feel at home when I eat my mom’s sadza with oxtail, and I salivate over the perfect raclette. Like many of America’s 45 million immigrants, I’m fluent in the art of being from everywhere and nowhere — a human GPS constantly recalculating. “You’ve never voted before?” The question comes with enough raised eyebrows to start a TikTok trend. I’ve mastered the apologetic hands-up surrender: “No, I just became a U.S. citizen!” I watch how quickly the judgment transforms into celebration, like I’ve just announced I’m expecting. (Mom, if you’re reading this — I am not. This example just seemed appropriate here.) What they don’t see is the Olympic-level obstacle course that is the immigration system. My previous partners, friends and family who helped me navigate it deserve medals themselves for watching me amateur breakdance my way through this adventure. They say your first time should be special. Mine, at 39 years old, involved a white envelope, sweaty palms, and an overwhelming urge to take a selfie — yes, I’m still talking about voting. After nearly two decades of living in the D.C. metropolitan area, I finally joined America’s most exclusive club: people who complain about politics while actually doing something about it. A club that, apparently, my friend at brunch had no interest in joining. For every person who casually dismisses their right to vote over bottomless mimosas, there are countless others — immigrants, noncitizens, people fighting through systematic barriers — who would trade anything for a chance to have their voices heard. We are the ones watching from the sidelines, holding our breath, while others treat their voting rights like an optional weekend activity. I join approximately 24 million other naturalized citizens — roughly 10% of American voters, or as I like to think of it, enough people to start our own country of formerly-not-Americans. For us, the responsibility hits different. Every bubble I filled represented years of watching from the sidelines, nodding politely during political discussions while internally screaming, “I HAVE THOUGHTS!” Don’t get me wrong — I’ve never been quiet about my opinions and have always tried to participate civically however I could. I’ve done public relations for immigrant causes and voting organizations, and supported enough agencies and nonprofits to fill a Scrabble board with D.C.’s alphabet soup. But there’s something special about finally getting to vote. It’s like being promoted from enthusiastic spectator to actual player, except instead of sports, it’s democracy. And trust me, I’ve waited on the sidelines long enough. Side note: Can we talk about those election reminder texts? “Hey Mercy, this is [Political Organization] checking for the 47th time if you’ve thought about voting today!” Yes, [Political Organization], I think about voting the way my mom thinks about my single status — constantly and with increasing urgency. But here’s the wild part: In 2020, some state races were decided by just a few thousand people. So when people tell me they’re skipping the election because they don’t like the candidates, they can’t be bothered, or their “vote doesn’t matter,” I remind them that voter apathy dilutes democracy. When you don’t vote, you don’t have a say on issues that affect you and your loved ones. This morning, I walked a block to drop off my ballot, half expecting confetti to fall from the sky. Nothing happened. No parade, no marching band, not even a single firecracker. Just me, casually participating in democracy like I’ve been doing it all my life. The significance wasn’t lost on me — in many countries, including where my entire family resides, people risk their lives for this right. My first ballot feels like the price my ancestors paid for me to get here. That’s what makes me emotional. I returned home a first-time voter and unscathed.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-campaign-beauty-spa-expenses_n_67250acfe4b01f6919d9f8e5","Ted Cruz’s Senate Campaign Has Spent Thousands At Beauty Spas","arthur delaney","2024-11-01","Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has spent thousands of dollars from his campaign account at beauty spas over the years, potentially breaking rules against personal use of campaign funds. Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission from 2016 through October, reviewed by HuffPost, shows the Ted Cruz for Senate campaign committee has spent more than $9,000 at salons. It’s not clear if the expenses were for the candidate, who doesn’t appear to wear makeup or maintain an expensive haircut, or for someone else. Cruz’s wife, Heidi Cruz, has acted as a campaign surrogate in the past. The most recent expenditure was $282 at Allure Day Spa in New York City on Oct. 11, between the first and second weeks of Cruz’s bus tour across Texas. It’s not clear what the money was spent on, though the most expensive package the spa advertises on its website costs $250 and provides “HydraFacial skin-renewing treatments” to “help you achieve a youthful, confident look.” Earlier this year, the Cruz campaign spent $310 in June and $876 in February on a makeup artist in Houston. The campaign has listed the same vendor more than a dozen times in FEC reports going back to 2018. The Cruz campaign declined to comment for this story. Candidates for federal office aren’t allowed to spend campaign funds on themselves, though there can be gray areas, including for things like meals and travel costs. The FEC says candidates should use what’s known as an “irrespective test” to determine whether the spending should count as personal or official, stating on its website that “if the expense would exist even in the absence of the candidacy or even if the officeholder were not in office, then the personal use ban applies.” Richard Briffault, an expert on campaign finance at Columbia Law School, said the question of whether the beauty spa expenditures were acceptable could depend on whether the Cruz campaign’s spending was for something more elaborate than what the recipient of these services does as part of their normal routine. “It is personal use,” Briffault said. “And the question is, is it the kind of personal use that [they] would be doing irrespective of whether or not he was running for office?” Cruz is in a close reelection contest with Democratic challenger Rep. Colin Allred (Texas), who has frequently brought up the Cruz family’s 2021 trip to Cancun in the middle of a winter storm that killed more than 200 Texans. Campaign spending on personal luxuries has caused controversy in the past. In 2009, the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint against the Republican National Committee for having spent six figures on fancy clothes for Sarah Palin when she was John McCain’s running mate. The FEC dismissed the complaint, saying the personal use ban applied to individual campaign committees, not party committees. In 2007, Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards used campaign funds for insanely expensive haircuts, including one that cost $1,250 because he flew his stylist out to do the trim on the campaign trail. The story was an embarrassment for Edwards, whose campaign focused on the scourge of poverty — but it did not result in a sanction by the FEC. Edwards was later indicted for campaign finance violations related to his coverup of an extramarital affair. During a podcast episode in June focused on Donald Trump’s conviction for falsifying business records related to hush money payments that the government said amounted to campaign expenditures, Cruz talked about the irrespective test specifically in reference to personal haircuts. “We don’t want candidates using campaign funds to pay personal expenses, whether new clothes, a weight loss program, or a gym membership purchased to help the candidate look better,” Cruz said, quoting a former FEC commissioner, and prompting an interruption from his co-host, Ben Ferguson.

HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. If you’re itching for barbeque, but don’t have outdoor space, we’ve got good news. An indoor grill can be your apartment-friendly, all-weather cooking companion, offering perfectly charred veggies and meats sans the smoke, right on your kitchen counter. In fact, we found one by Ninja currently on sale for 25% off that one reviewer raves is “one of the best purchases I’ve ever made.” It doesn’t just char foods; the six-in-one functions also let you air fry, roast, bake, broil and dehydrate as needed. The grill also has a thermometer to take the guesswork out of meat prepping and it heats up to 500°F. The price usually hovers around $199.99, but you can snag one today for only $149.99 for a limited time! According to several reviewers, that smoky flavor is still present, whether you’re cooking meats or veggies, and the built-in thermometer is a nifty way to keep tabs on how everything’s going. One reviewer writes, “I got this specifically to air fry wings and cook burgers inside without a huge grease mess and this does great at both. It cooks some of the best home made wings I’ve ever had, makes perfect burgers with little effort, and the whole setup is easy to clean. I’ll have to try cooking some other stuff in it eventually since it is capable of so many things.” HuffPost Shopping growth strategist (and city apartment dweller), Adam Schubak, has a Ninja Foodi indoor grill and loves that the appliance helps him “cook faster and eat healthier.” “If I had to stick to only one kitchen appliance, there would be no question about my choice. I use my Foodi daily...sometimes to grill meats or bake chicken cutlets and other nights to roast vegetables or air fry potatoes as my sides,” he shared. “Sometimes I wish I had two just so I can use several of the functions simultaneously.” [FYI: There is a Ninja product that lets you cook your food using two different functions at the same time. And it’s on sale right now too👀!] The included grill grate, air fryer basket and drip pan are all dishwasher-safe for breezy clean-up, too, so there is no smoke or a messy kitchen. If you’re looking for a way to elevate your foods without leaving your warm, cozy home, consider grabbing this indoor grill while it’s on major discount.  “This one of the best products I’ve ever purchased. I use it to cook everything that I don’t have to Boil! This is an absolute life saver in the kitchen and virtually no mess and clean up. Fry /Bake/ Roast. You can cook an entire meal in this. AND you can put in something frozen and it will cook it, no problem. I’ve even made Brownies in this…and the Fried Chicken? OMG. I can fry chicken with or without egg/flour and the crispness is unbelievable. My mother didn’t believe me because she’s an “old school” iron skillet, chicken fryer. I fried the chicken and she couldn’t tell the difference. The BEST part: The Clean Up. I let the oil from the chicken ( You don’t have to add oil, its the natural oil from from the meat) solidify, then take a paper towel wipe it out of the insert, then wash the fryer insert. Takes 3 mins. No stick/ No grease popped all over the stove/ OR Your wrists!…. Your Done. I barely even use the stove anymore..Unless it a Holiday.” — Courtney Jackson [This review has been trimmed for legth, read the full review here.] “Ninja has demonstrated remarkable product innovation. This company consistently impresses with its new offerings. This particular product significantly reduces cooking time while providing the versatility to grill, roast, bake, and more. As a devoted fan, I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys cooking.” — Rondell Brooks “I’ve only had this for a month and have used at least 10 times already. Quick and efficient. I have grilled steaks, chicken and pork chops so far and all have been delicious. I like to buy frozen onion rings and this air fries them as good as freshly fried onion rings. I love this product!” — DawgFan “I’ve been wanting an air fryer for a while now, but space is limited in our small casita. When I saw this combo of an indoor grill/air fryer, and that the brand was Ninja, I jumped right in. LOVE this appliance! I do not find it so big that it takes up major real estate on my kitchen counter at all. The grill is easy to work and cooks fabulously! The air fryer not only cooks but reheats left overs to perfection. Even the hubby likes to use it which says a lot! It is so easy to clean and use. Most importantly, the food really tastes GOOD! It also takes less time for me to put together a quick dinner/lunch. Ninja quality is worth every penny. If you are thinking about purchasing this, just do it; you won’t be sorry at all.” — DiJeff “This 6-1 machine far exceeded my expectations.

The ceremony was held in Salem, Massachusetts, the site of the infamous Salem Witch Trials during the late 1600s, which saw hundreds accused — and around 20 executed — as supposed “witches.” Daniels was appropriately dressed like one when she accepted the first annual “Salem Witches’ Woman of Power Award” at the town commons and, in front of hundreds of fellow witches, chronicled living in a mobile home as a result of the blowback from her testimony about the former president. “I was put on the stand two years ago and someone said I was unfit to testify because I was a witch,” said Daniels, per The Guardian. “I was honest, I was telling the truth and I was persecuted. To me this award should inspire others to speak up and not be silenced.” Daniels told the Boston Globe she “screamed like a little girl” when she learned about the honor, which recognizes strength, intuition and “magic,” as she has been a self-described witch since childhood. “No one understands what the last six years have been like for me,” she added. “Everyone else gets to turn off the TV and forget about politics, which has reached this next-level, dark insanity. I don’t get that opportunity. I’m living in an RV because I can’t go home. The persecution those witches felt hundreds of years ago feels very familiar to me.” Christian Day, a self-described warlock who organized the event, praised Daniels. “A lot of people know Stormy for being a porn star and fighting against Trump in court,” he told attendees, per the Guardian. “But a lot of people don’t know that she is a practicing witch, and that she is someone who stands out as a woman of power.” Trump was convicted earlier this year on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to hide his $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels. He might well retake the White House next week. Daniels, meanwhile, says she’s lived “on the run” ever since her home address was displayed in court. (Trump’s attorney has said this was an accident.) The adult film actor launched a GoFundMe in June to raise money for a new house, and to help her escape the rape and death threats from Trump’s supporters.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/derrick-anderson-fake-family-photo-cease-and-desist_n_6722487ce4b03a564e7cf110","Virginia GOP Candidate Demands Opponent Stop Using 'Fake Family' Photo In Ads","jennifer bendery","2024-11-01","WASHINGTON — Virginia GOP congressional candidate Derrick Anderson has issued a warning to his Democratic opponent, Eugene Vindman, over campaign ads accusing Anderson of trying to pass off someone else’s wife and three daughters as his own family. Anderson, who is unmarried and has no children, made national headlines in September after The New York Times discovered his campaign was using footage of him posing with the woman and children in what could easily be mistaken for a family photo shoot, except it turned out to be a friend’s family. One video featuring Anderson with the woman and girls was shared on Anderson’s YouTube channel and posted on a website paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee. In another video his campaign filmed for a possible ad and that was posted on the NRCC-run website, Anderson is shown sitting around a dining room table with the same woman and girls. On Thursday, Anderson used that footage of him sitting with the woman and her daughters in a new campaign ad focused on abortion. They appear around the 20-second mark. His campaign told HuffPost in September that this footage was simply Anderson appearing in “a normal campaign video with female supporters and their kids.” But in the final days of this election cycle, Vindman and Democratic groups are running a barrage of campaign ads accusing Anderson, who reportedly lives with his dog and is engaged, of trying to give voters the impression that he’s a family man. And on Monday, Anderson’s campaign responded with an official-sounding letter declaring that Vindman and local TV stations don’t have the right to air images of the family seen in Anderson’s videos. HuffPost obtained a copy of the letter, which identifies this family as Ashley Cremisio and her three daughters. It notes that Cremisio’s lawyer sent a separate cease-and-desist letter to House Majority PAC, a Democratic political action committee running ads against Anderson. “This letter is to serve as written notice to your station that Vindman for Congress did not obtain the permission of Mrs. Cremisio to use her image or the permission of Mr. or Mrs. Cremisio on behalf of her three minor daughters, to use their images in their advertisement,” read the letter. “Furthermore, Mr. and Mrs. Cremisio would never have granted Vindman for Congress permission to do so given the manufactured and false narrative around the image,” it said. “In light of this unauthorized use, we are writing to request that your station remove this advertisement from your airwaves immediately to prevent further harm and distress to Mrs. Cremisio and her daughters.” Here’s a copy of the letter, signed by a campaign adviser: The ads hitting Anderson over his “fake family” range from serious to comical. A Vindman ad called “What Is Real” flashes an image of Anderson with this family as ominous narration says the Republican candidate “got caught lying again, faking a family.” And in one hilarious ad paid for by House Majority PAC, an Anderson look-alike arrives home from work to hang out with cardboard cutouts of the family. “Ready, sweetie?” says the Anderson look-alike, tossing a Frisbee at a cutout of one of the girls and watching as the disc falls to the ground. This ad, called “Fake,” warns that the Republican candidate is trying to fool people about lots of things, including his extreme views against abortion. Vindman has made protecting abortion rights a central issue in his campaign. Anderson, by contrast, celebrated the Supreme Court overturning the Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide, and has said he supports leaving women’s access to reproductive health care up to individual states to decide. The problem with the Anderson campaign’s demands is that the images of him with the woman and children are still publicly available on the National Republican Congressional Committee’s so-called red box website, where campaigns publish materials available for super PACs to pick up and use in ads. In other words, Anderson is claiming Vindman and Democratic political groups can’t use these images in political ads at the same the NRCC is making them available for use in ads. Anderson’s campaign said in a Thursday statement that Vindman is unfairly using the woman and children to “lie” to voters about who they are. “Vindman’s been using a mother and her underage daughters in our district to lie to voters for weeks, and he’s arguing legal technicalities to far-left media outlets? That’s very telling, and very gross,” read the statement. “He’s ginning up false attacks to avoid talking about lying about his military background, his shady business dealings, and his support for open borders, higher costs, and far-left party politics.” The campaign also emphasized that Anderson has never claimed that the woman and children were his family, and that their images were never used in any pro-Anderson campaign ads (except Anderson’s latest ad about abortion uses this footage of him with this woman and her daughters, and he previously shared the footage of him with this family on his YouTube channel). Anderson’s campaign did not respond to a question about why Vindman wouldn’t have permission to use images of this family in his political ads when the NRCC is still making them available for use in political ads. Vindman’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the demands from Anderson’s campaign. Beyond his ads, Vindman has been making cracks about Anderson’s “fake family” on the campaign trail. At a recent rally in the Virginian town of Dumfries, he reportedly brought up his “real wife” and “real kids” to laughs in the crowd. Vindman’s name might sound familiar. His twin brother, retired Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, made international headlines in 2019 when he testified during then-President Donald Trump’s impeachment inquiry hearings about his shady dealings with Ukraine. Both Vindmans were whistleblowers amid those hearings, and Trump ended up firing both of them from their government jobs. Anderson has aligned himself with Trump, who endorsed him Wednesday. “Derrick is America First all the way, and he is running against a weak and pathetic Democrat named Yevgeny ‘Eugene’ Vindman who, along with [California Democratic Rep.] Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff and others, lied to push the Ukraine Impeachment Hoax, a continuation of the greatest and most dangerous Political WITCH HUNT in the History of our Country!” Trump wrote on social media. “Derrick Anderson has my Complete and Total Endorsement - HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!” he said. Anderson and Vindman are running to represent Virginia’s 7th Congressional District. Both are new to politics, both are lawyers and both have military backgrounds: Anderson is a former Green Beret who completed five deployments, while Vindman is a former Army colonel who served for 25 years. They’re competing for the seat being vacated by Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor. It’s a tight race: The Cook Political Report ranks this seat as a “Democrat Toss Up.” Vindman is leading by 2 points in the most recent poll in this district, according to polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight.

But amid concerns over Donald Trump’s fitness for office, there’s been no such uproar on the conservative network. “The Daily Show” put that double standard on full display in a video using Fox News footage and commentary from the time, but with footage of Trump’s recent garbage truck stumble spliced in. “We need to see the records of anyone that’s around the age of 70,” Marc Siegel, a Fox News medical analyst, said in one of the clips, as the edit from “The Daily Show” shows Trump flailing while opening the door of a garbage truck earlier this week. Fox News freaking out about Hillary’s health in 2016 but make the footage Trump pic.twitter.com/hGa7NGNxpy In August 2016, Fox News host Sean Hannity speculated on air with guests that Clinton, who was 68 at the time, might have brain damage. He noted that she had stumbled earlier in the year and questioned what he said were “weird pauses” in her speech. Clinton ended up releasing her medical records in September 2016 after she had a health scare due to pneumonia. This week, Hannity called Trump’s entry into the garbage truck an “iconic, epic moment.” Trump, 78, has declined to share any detailed health records, despite mounting public concern about his cognitive state. He has given increasingly rambling and incoherent speeches and has behaved erratically on the campaign trail, prompting hundreds of health care professionals to sound the alarm about his condition and fitness for office.

HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Heads up: Apple’s latest and greatest iPad is currently on sale at its lowest price ever. For a limited time, Target is slashing $100 off the 11- and 13-inch versions of the 2024 iPad Air. These models were released back in May, and the iPad Air was updated to be much lighter and sleeker. They also added USB-C connectivity, tweaked the front and back-facing camera, and upgraded performance and processing speeds. With up to 10 hours of battery life, so you can stream movies, browse HuffPost and FaceTime with family for hours on end. This is the lowest it’s been all year, so don’t sleep on this deal — hurry to it! The newest iPad Air adds an M2 chip for faster speeds, a landscape-style camera for beautiful outdoor shots, Apple Pay for touchless tap payments, a beautiful, vibrant retina display and an even thinner width for extra portability. Several critics of product review publications like CNN Underscored and Tom’s Guide also say its battery life is especially impressive, offering beyond the claimed 10 hours of battery life on a single charge. Target is offering $100 on the 2024 iPad Air in storage sizes 128 GB, 256 GB, 512 GB and 1 TB, but the year’s best discount is on the 128 GB 11-inch device, which knocks 17% off the high-end tech device. While there aren’t many user reviews out on the 2024 iPad Air just yet, the ones available all agree: this is the best iPad out. Nab the 2024 iPad Air for $100 off at Target, and read on for promising reviews from Amazon customers — where it’s already sold out! “I really like this iPad Air! It’s beautiful, lightweight and has plenty of storage and features! Since my M1 only had 64 GB; it was easy to fill up. But, with this new beauty, I can add as many apps as I wish! The price was good and it will give me years of service. Some tech-savvy users talk about the refresh rate as compared to the iPad Pro. I have an M1 Pro and I don’t compare the two. I just know that when I am using either one of the 3; I am thoroughly satisfied with overall performance! Love me some iPads 🤩” — SuiteLadyJ  “Needed my own iPad instead of always using my wife’s. I love to draw so I mainly use it for procreate. The battery life is great. I can draw almost a whole day or two on one charge. I got the blue one. The color is nice. It’s a blue metallic. The weight is incredible. It feels like nothing. It performs very well. I haven’t had any issues. The reaction time and speed are very good as well. I use it everyday. I love it. 10/10” — Alexander Veiths  “This is a fantastic iPad Air. I use it every day and have it with me all the time. My previous one died after many years of heavy use. The updates on this new one are great. The screen resolution is really beautiful. It’s lighter in weight than my old one and a little thinner. The camera takes gorgeous pictures. I’m extremely happy with it. It was so simple to transfer everything because it was all in the cloud. Setup was a breeze. I have absolutely no complaints.” — Jodie Campbell  “I recently purchased a new IPad Air M2 to upgrade from a generation 5 IPad. So far, it has been a seamless experience. I am still using the older IPad for a second screen or for listening to music or streaming, but the new IPad has pretty much taken over the du ties of my MacBook Pro too! I purchased an Apple Pencil for work and it has worked out pretty well so far. It is nice being able to write again. My fingers were getting tired of the typing motion so it will be nice to switch between the two mediums. I highly recommend the new IPad Air 11 inch M2. It makes me feel all grown up and super productive! : )” — Shelley  “Time for me to replace my aging Apple products this year. My 2019 iPad still works but I really underestimated the amount of storage I needed. 32GB was fine for my first iPad in 2014 but very inadequate for today’s demands. It was becoming pretty useless and I was unable to update the software without having to make more storage available. So instead I bought one of the new iPad Airs. I contemplated the Pro model but decided to also update my 12 year old MacBook so decided to go with the Air 11 in model ― really a fine product. Great speed and screen resolution is superb. I use it every day reading the news with my coffee. I opted for Apple Care + as well ― through iPad settings. I guess next up is a replacement for my iPhone11.” — BobR52 By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He contrasted this man with other members of the “crazy” broader LGBTQ+ community, especially transgender and nonbinary people. The next four years will change America forever.

The Army Office of Special Trial Counsel charged the 21-year-old specialist on Wednesday with murder and obstructing justice in the death of Sgt. Sarah Roque, 23.

A judge on Friday granted Krasner’s request to keep a civil lawsuit he filed against Musk and Musk’s pro-Trump America PAC in state court, rather than having it moved to federal court as the tech billionaire wished. Musk, for his part, filed a motion seeking to quash any personal appearance he is ordered to make in court, saying that his attendance is unnecessary because the case is largely focused on actions of America PAC. Earlier Friday morning, Musk had accused Krasner of engaging in a “rushed stage play” and a “spectacle” as he urged a federal judge to deny Krasner’s emergency request to keep the suit in state court. Krasner sued the billionaire and his pro-Donald Trump America PAC over their pledge to give away $1 million daily to registered voters. Musk claims the giveaway is random, but Krasner alleges that Musk is intentionally targeting people in battleground states with an “illegal lottery scheme” meant to influence voters. Musk has argued that Krasner must square off with America PAC attorneys in federal court because the lawsuit raises questions about a federal election and the federal laws that govern political action committees, not state matters. Krasner is adamant that his lawsuit isn’t about whether Musk and America PAC are violating federal laws that ban vote-buying. Rather, the district attorney wants a state court, not a federal one, to determine whether the program violates Pennsylvania’s prohibitions against illegal lotteries. Attorneys for Musk’s PAC filed a notice in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania federal court this week requesting to have the case remanded there. Explaining this maneuver in a brief filed Friday, a lawyer for the PAC wrote that the group’s expenditures are “political speech” and thus “entitled to First Amendment protections,” which is a federal jurisdictional issue. But U.S. District Judge Gerald Pappert disagreed. Musk and America PAC “have not identified any question of federal law that must be resolved in Plaintiff’s favor in order to prove either state-law claim,” Pappert’s memorandum states. “Defendants argue the Complaint’s references to ‘the forthcoming Federal Presidential Election’ show the lawsuit necessarily raises questions of federal law,” Pappert wrote. “But federal question jurisdiction does not turn on a plaintiff’s motivations in filing suit; it turns on whether the legal issues arising from the claims originate in federal or state law.” The ploy to have the lawsuit remanded to federal court may have been a boon for Musk anyway. The giveaway ends on Nov. 5, meaning that by the time the courts decide the next steps, the initiative will already be over. The Justice Department warned Musk in a letter last month that he may run afoul of federal election laws against compensating voters, but Musk was undeterred. Four giveaway winners are from Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state, according to a website for the program. So far, the PAC has given away a total of $14 million to voters who signed the petition that states they agree to support the First and Second Amendments. The website indicates that winners will be declared through Nov. 5. As of Friday, the site specified that those winners would be selected in Arizona and Wisconsin, which are also battleground states in the 2024 election. Musk and Krasner were initially meant to face off in court on Friday, but the hearing was brought forward to Thursday. Krasner had asked to move the hearing to a more secure venue following a deluge of threats he said he received. The DA accused Musk of amplifying inflammatory posts about him and the lawsuit on X, the social media platform Musk owns. In court records, Krasner showed Musk’s reposts from a user on X who claimed the DA knew his lawsuit wasn’t legal but “wants a leftist judge to stop it before Election Day.” Other users on the platform have threatened to come to Krasner’s house in masks and harass him. Musk himself was a no-show at the hearing, sending his lawyers in his stead. Attorneys for Krasner, Musk and America PAC did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nicole-shanahan-qanon-trump_n_6724f6d9e4b01f6919d9e831","Trump Ally Nicole Shanahan Appears To Promote Weird QAnon Theory","matt shuham","2024-11-01","Nicole Shanahan, the former running mate of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., appeared to promote a conspiracy theory about government-led child abuse Thursday during an event featuring GOP nominee Donald Trump. Shanahan, who has endorsed the prospect of what she’s called a Trump-Kennedy “coalition government,” criticized first lady Jill Biden for dressing up as a panda bear for Halloween the previous day. “The parading of Jill Biden in a panda suit yesterday — right in front of our eyes,” Shanahan said in her speech at the “Tucker Carlson Live” event, prompting some boos throughout the venue. “What the hell is this mockery? No more!” Viewers not steeped in conspiracy theories might have wondered what the fuss was about. But as Will Sommer, a Washington Post reporter who wrote a book on QAnon, explained on X (formerly Twitter), “panda eyes” refers to “the puffy eyes received by children abused in Satanic rituals by the cabal.” Shanahan was “alluding to some QAnon beliefs here,” Sommer wrote. Neither Trump’s campaign nor Shanahan immediately returned a request for comment about the remarks. In reality, the first lady’s costume was a nod to the return of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. She helped the zoo hype the bears’ arrival in an October video. The White House said Thursday that Biden wore the Halloween costume as a “welcoming gesture” for the pandas, The Associated Press reported. Former RFK Jr running mate Nicole Shanahan alluding to some QAnon beliefs here — she appears to think Jill Biden's panda costume was a reference to ""panda eyes,"" the puffy eyes received by children abused in Satanic rituals by the cabal. https://t.co/B6w6EaSzXd QAnon is the years-old conspiracy theory universe that asserts that liberal elites in politics and media are secretly running a massive, satanic child abuse ring. The movement venerates Trump, believing he’ll stage mass arrests and potential executions of his political enemies as part of an effort to abolish the so-called “deep state” and seize control of government. Though QAnon originated with the anonymous posts of a supposed government insider on an online message board, it has since grown diffuse, expressed through hysteria over transgender people and other right-wing culture war topics. Shanahan’s remarks were shared approvingly by some QAnon adherents on X, which is owned by Trump surrogate Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. Liz Crokin, an adherent of another conspiracy theory dubbed “Pizzagate” who has more than 400,000 followers, reposted the video and cheered Shanahan’s speech, calling the panda suit a “well known pedophile symbol.” Crokin had posted earlier accusing the Bidens of hosting a “Pedophile-Themed Halloween Party For Children.” Shanahan didn’t elaborate on her beliefs about Jill Biden’s costume, but elsewhere in her remarks, she referred to the election as “deeply spiritual” and called on the audience to be “individual sovereigns” rather than “puppets of corporate interests.” She intoned ominously about being in “the belly of the beast” and meeting “all those celebrities you see doing those endorsements.” The good people of the country, she said, are “more populous than the tiny segment of the population that has been responsible for so much of our pain.” Shanahan is the former wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, and their 2023 divorce settlement reportedly left her with more than $1 billion. As Kennedy’s running mate, she donated millions to help his campaign. Kennedy and Shanahan ended their bid for the White House in August, with Kennedy endorsing Trump. Shanahan has since fashioned herself into a pro-Trump wellness guru. Kennedy, the nation’s most prominent anti-vaccine advocate, said recently that Trump has promised him “control” of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture. Trump said at his Madison Square Garden rally this week that he would let Kennedy “go wild on the medicines.” Shanahan has spoken on TV and podcasts in support of Trump’s candidacy, and funded pro-Trump videos, including one criticizing Democrats for having “Trump Derangement Syndrome.” She said during the Carlson event that she was about to become “a first-time Trump voter,” eliciting raucous cheers as she filled out what she said was her actual ballot.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-subway-chokehold-death_n_67250235e4b00acf55d9bbaf","Prosecutor Says Veteran's Subway Chokehold 'Went Too Far,' Defense Praises His 'Courage.'","jennifer peltz","2024-11-01","NEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors and defense lawyers agree on this about Marine veteran Daniel Penny’s encounter last year with a distressed, angry man making ominous remarks on a New York subway: Penny didn’t mean to kill him. But a prosecutor told jurors Friday that Penny “went way too far” in trying to neutralize someone he saw as a threat and not as a person, while a defense attorney said Penny showed “courage” and put others’ welfare ahead of his own when he placed Jordan Neely in a chokehold that ended with Neely limp on the floor. Both sides gave opening statements Friday in the manslaughter trial surrounding Neely’s death. The case has rattled fault lines surrounding race, homelessness, perceptions of public safety and bystanders’ responsibility. Penny’s critics see him as a white vigilante killer of a Black man who was behaving erratically and making dire statements but wasn’t armed and hadn’t assaulted or even touched anyone in the subway car. Supporters credit the 25-year-old Penny with taking action to protect frightened riders — action that he has said was meant to defuse, not kill. Prosecutor Dafna Yoran told jurors the case isn’t “a referendum on our society’s failure to deal with mental illness and homelessness on the subway,” nor on police response, on whether Penny had a right to intervene before officers arrived or even on whether his initial decision to use a chokehold was appropriate. Rather, she said, “He used far too much force for far too long. He went way too far.” She said he showed “indifference” toward Neely and “didn’t recognize his humanity.” Not so, said defense lawyer Thomas Kenniff. He told jurors that Penny applied only as much force as needed to contain a “seething, psychotic” man who had lunged toward a woman with a small child and declared, “I will kill.” “In that moment, Danny could look away and pray, or he could summon the courage to put the safety of his neighbors above that of himself, to protect those who could not protect themselves,” and he did the latter, Kenniff said. “It doesn’t make him a hero. But it doesn’t make him a killer.” Jurors, who were quizzed earlier about their subway experiences, later saw police body camera video of officers trying to revive Neely on the subway floor and Penny calmly explaining he had “put him out.” The case has been absorbed into the United States’ fractious politics, with Republican officials speaking up for Penny and Democratic ones attending Neely’s funeral. Both supporters and critics of Penny have held demonstrations; Penny arrived at the courthouse Friday to critical chants from a small group of protesters. Once in court, Penny sat straight up in his seat at the defense table, mostly looking directly ahead. A member of Neely’s family who was in the audience sometimes sniffled with tears. “We know who the victim is in this case, and we know who the villain is,” family lawyer Donte Mills said outside court. Neely’s life was tattered by mental illness and drug use after his mother was murdered and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a teen, his family has said. By 30, he sometimes entertained subway riders as a Michael Jackson impersonator, but he also had a criminal record that included assaulting a woman at a subway station. Penny, an architecture student who served four years in the Marines, was going from a college class to a gym when he encountered Neely on a subway May 1, 2023. Neely was begging for money, shouting about being willing to die or go to jail, and making sudden movements, according to witnesses. Yoran said Neely talked about hurting people. Penny put his arm around the man’s neck, took him to the floor and held Neely there, with Penny’s legs around him. With a bystander recording some of the encounter on video, Penny held Neely for about six minutes, Yoran said. The hold continued as the train stopped at a station, all but two fellow riders got off, those two helped restrain Neely, and another warned Penny, “If you don’t let him go now, you’re going to kill him,” according to her statement and court papers. Kenniff said Penny was pleading with fellow passengers to call police and that he kept holding Neely because the man periodically flailed or tried to get up. Penny ultimately released Neely nearly a minute after his body went limp, prosecutors said. He waited for police, but Yoran noted that although Penny was trained in first aid, he didn’t check Neely’s breathing or pulse or try to revive him. Penny later told police that he had simply wanted to “de-escalate” the edgy situation and wasn’t trying to injure Neely but rather “to keep him from hurting anyone else.” City medical examiners determined that Neely died from compression of the neck. Penny’s lawyers question that finding. ___ Associated Press journalists Joseph Frederick and David R. Martin contributed.

In an interview on Thursday’s broadcast of “The View,” Cuban had said that Trump doesn’t surround himself with “strong, intelligent women,” suggesting that’s why the Republican politician hasn’t been seen lately with Nikki Haley, his onetime presidential primary opponent turned supporter. “Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women, ever. It’s just that simple. They’re intimidating to him. He doesn’t like to be challenged by them,” said Cuban, who has been stumping for Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2024 White House race. “Nikki Haley will call him on his nonsense with reproductive rights and how he sees and treats and talks about women. I mean, he just can’t have her around. It wouldn’t work,” he added on the ABC talk show. (Cuban’s comments can be heard at the 23-minute mark here.) His remarks were subsequently seen by many as a criticism of any woman who supports Trump, something that the presidential candidate and others immediately pounced on. “All strong women, and women in general, should be angry about this weak man’s statement,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. Trump also called Cuban, who initially supported him in the 2016 presidential election, “a really dumb guy” and said that “nobody respects him.” Following his TV appearance, Cuban sought to clarify his comments and apologize to anyone offended. “When I said this during the interview, I didn’t get it out exactly the way I thought I did. So I apologize to anyone who felt slighted or upset by my response,” he said in a Friday post on X, formerly Twitter. “As I said, it wasn’t about Trump voters, supporters or employees. Current or former.” In a separate post, he wrote that he knows “many strong, intelligent women voting for Trump. Including in my extended family.” He went on to name people like GOP strategist Kellyanne Conway and former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao as examples of “strong intelligent women” who have worked with Trump.

With one hand, of course. Wilson made a dazzling 26-yard go-ahead touchdown catch early in the fourth quarter and the New York Jets snapped a five-game losing streak by beating the Houston Texans 21-13 on Thursday night. GARRETT WILSON CATCH OF THE YEAR?!?! 🤯🔥TOUCHDOWN JETS.(via @NFL)pic.twitter.com/SM7m1gJAEz “I just kind of lobbed one up there and he made an unbelievable catch,” quarterback Aaron Rodgers said. “That was a huge play. ... That’s a game-changing play.” Rodgers had three touchdown passes, including another earlier one-handed score by Wilson and a 37-yard throw to recently acquired Davante Adams, and the Jets (3-6) won for the first time in four games under interim head coach Jeff Ulbrich. With the Jets trailing 10-7 and facing third-and-19 from the Texans 26, Rodgers tossed the ball up toward Wilson in the end zone. The star wide receiver jumped and reached up with his right hand with both legs spread in in the air — looking like the Michael Jordan “Jumpman” logo. The play was initially called an incomplete pass, but Ulbrich challenged. “Oh, my goodness,” Ulbrich said. “I mean, I was talking to the ref when they were reviewing it. I was like, ’Just for the sake of posterity, you have to say that’s in just so it goes down in history.” A video replay review confirmed that Wilson’s shin was down in the end zone and a touchdown was called to give the Jets a 14-10 lead with 12:54 left.

At a campaign event in Glendale, Arizona, on Thursday, Trump ranted to the crowd about the vice president, saying, “When that sleazebag said during the debate, she said, ‘Oh, your rallies aren’t well attended and people leave.’” “They don’t leave, and they’re really well attended. We can’t get places big enough,” Trump fumed. “Nobody leaves,” he added later, insisting that it’s “never happened before.” During the Sept. 10 presidential debate, Harris poked Trump in a spot almost certain to trigger a reaction: attendance at his rallies. She said people “start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom.” Trump immediately lashed out, veering off-message into one of the most widely ridiculed moments of the evening, ranting falsely that immigrants are eating cats and dogs. People had indeed been leaving some of Trump’s rallies early, sometimes while he was still speaking. With just days until the election, critics can’t believe Trump is still harping on this topic. “The most thin-skinned man on planet earth. Harris’s jibe about his crowds bothers him much more than anyone calling him a Nazi or Hitler,” political commentator Mehdi Hasan posted on X, formerly Twitter. “God that debate from TWO MONTHS AGO lives rent-free in Trump’s head,” another social media user wrote.

Raffensperger debunked the video. “This is false and is an example of targeted disinformation we’ve seen in this and other elections,” Raffensperger said in a statement. “It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the 2024 Presidential election.” Raffensperger added that state partners and the federal Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency are working to identify the origin of the clip. “In the meantime, we ask Elon Musk and the leadership of other social media platforms to take this down,” he said. “This is obviously fake and part of a disinformation effort. Likely it is a production of Russian troll farms. As Americans we can’t let our enemies use lies to divide us and undermine our faith in our institutions — or each other.” CNN reported that while the original post featuring the video was taken down, the clip has continued to make the rounds on social media. Last week, the U.S. intelligence community warned that the Kremlin would continue to disseminate media content with the intention of dividing Americans and creating distrust in the U.S. election system. The federal intelligence officials cited a recent fake video showing someone destroying mail-in ballots of people who voted for Trump in Pennsylvania, a key battleground in this election. They said it was created and shared by Russian actors. Raffensperger has repeatedly sought to reassure Georgians about the integrity of the election. “No matter which side of the partisan divide a voter might be on, every voter in our state should know that the results will be valid because the election is secure,” he wrote in an opinion piece for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published on Thursday. Musk, who endorsed Trump over the summer, has become a top surrogate for his campaign, holding events and donating millions in support of the former president’s White House bid.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-lt-bolivia-day-of-the-dead-bread_n_6724f438e4b00acf55d9ac4d","Bolivian Artist Carves Faces On Bread For Day Of The Dead","paola flores","2024-11-01","EL ALTO, Bolivia (AP) — During the Day of the Dead celebrations that take place in late October and early November, Latin Americans honor their departed loved ones by setting up altars adorned with food, flowers and photographs. But what about carving the actual face of your deceased spouse or family member on a plaster to decorate a piece of bread? That is exactly what one artist in Bolivia is doing. As part of a centuries-old tradition to honor their dead on Nov. 2, Bolivians share a sweet bread called “tantawawa” (Aymara for “baby bread”) in a symbolic way to connect the living with the dead. Traditionally, the “tantawawa” are decorated with generic, plastered faces, but Bolivian artist William Luna thought it would be even more symbolic if he could carve out a feature that resembles the loved ones that people are remembering. Inspired by the loss of his mother, Luna began sculpting her face onto a “tantawawa” for the first anniversary of her death in 2017. He then introduced this idea to local markets, and now receives requests from families eager to honor their loved ones in this unique way. “Families ask for the masks to resemble their deceased loved ones as closely as possible,” Luna explains. “I focus on each person’s distinctive features, as we all have something special that sets us apart.” Luna meticulously crafts each mask, starting with a photo of the departed individual. He then shapes clay using his fingers and modeling tools to capture the person’s likeness. Once satisfied with the clay model, he creates a plastic mold and fills it with plaster. The final step involves painting the mask, sometimes with the help of the family. The entire process takes about a week. Milton Eyzaguirre, an anthropologist from the National Museum of Ethnography and Folklore in La Paz, said that there’s not an exact record of the origin of the “tantawawa”, only that they are pre-Hispanic. Historically, the bread was made with quinoa flour, but now wheat is commonly used. “Our tradition holds that souls return hungry and thirsty, and that is why families have food waiting for them,” he said. Luna, the artist, says that his idea is to give people a way to see their deceased loved ones again. “Even if it’s only in this way,” he said, gazing at some of the plastered faces. ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pregnant-teenager-died-trying-get-care-three-visits-texas-emergency-rooms_n_6724ef50e4b01f6919d9dcf3","A Pregnant Teenager Died After Trying to Get Care in Three Visits to Texas Emergency Rooms","lizzie presser , kavitha surana","2024-11-01","This story was originally published by ProPublica. Candace Fails screamed for someone in the Texas hospital to help her pregnant daughter. “Do something,” she pleaded, on the morning of Oct. 29, 2023. Nevaeh Crain was crying in pain, too weak to walk, blood staining her thighs. Feverish and vomiting the day of her baby shower, the 18-year-old had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours, returning home each time worse than before. The first hospital diagnosed her with strep throat without investigating her sharp abdominal cramps. At the second, she screened positive for sepsis, a life-threatening and fast-moving reaction to an infection, medical records show. But doctors said her six-month fetus had a heartbeat and that Crain was fine to leave. Now on Crain’s third hospital visit, an obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to “confirm fetal demise,” a nurse wrote, before moving her to intensive care. By then, more than two hours after her arrival, Crain’s blood pressure had plummeted and a nurse had noted that her lips were “blue and dusky.” Her organs began failing. Hours later, she was dead. Fails, who would have seen her daughter turn 20 this Friday, still cannot understand why Crain’s emergency was not treated like an emergency. But that is what many pregnant women are now facing in states with strict abortion bans, doctors and lawyers have told ProPublica. “Pregnant women have become essentially untouchables,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor emerita at George Washington University. Texas’s abortion ban threatens prison time for interventions that end a fetal heartbeat, whether the pregnancy is wanted or not. It includes exceptions for life-threatening conditions, but still, doctors told ProPublica that confusion and fear about the potential legal repercussions are changing the way their colleagues treat pregnant patients with complications. In states with abortion bans, such patients are sometimes bounced between hospitals like “hot potatoes,” with health care providers reluctant to participate in treatment that could attract a prosecutor, doctors told ProPublica. In some cases, medical teams are wasting precious time debating legalities and creating documentation, preparing for the possibility that they’ll need to explain their actions to a jury and judge. Dr. Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine, said patients are left wondering: “Am I being sent home because I really am OK? Or am I being sent home because they’re afraid that the solution to what’s going on with my pregnancy would be ending the pregnancy, and they’re not allowed to do that?” There is a federal law to prevent emergency room doctors from withholding lifesaving care. Passed nearly four decades ago, it requires emergency rooms to stabilize patients in medical crises. The Biden administration argues this mandate applies even in cases where an abortion might be necessary. No state has done more to fight this interpretation than Texas, which has warned doctors that its abortion ban supersedes the administration’s guidance on federal law, and that they can face up to 99 years in prison for violating it. ProPublica condensed more than 800 pages of Crain’s medical records into a four-page timeline in consultation with two maternal-fetal medicine specialists; reporters reviewed it with nine doctors, including researchers at prestigious universities, OB-GYNs who regularly handle miscarriages, and experts in emergency medicine and maternal health. Some said the first ER missed warning signs of infection that deserved attention. All said that the doctor at the second hospital should never have sent Crain home when her signs of sepsis hadn’t improved. And when she returned for the third time, all said there was no medical reason to make her wait for two ultrasounds before taking aggressive action to save her. “This is how these restrictions kill women,” said Dr. Dara Kass, a former regional director at the Department of Health and Human Services and an emergency room physician in New York. “It is never just one decision, it’s never just one doctor, it’s never just one nurse.” While they were not certain from looking at the records provided that Crain’s death could have been prevented, they said it may have been possible to save both the teenager and her fetus if she had been admitted earlier for close monitoring and continuous treatment. There was a chance Crain could have remained pregnant, they said. If she had needed an early delivery, the hospital was well-equipped to care for a baby on the edge of viability. In another scenario, if the infection had gone too far, ending the pregnancy might have been necessary to save Crain. Doctors involved in Crain’s care did not respond to several requests for comment. The two hospitals, Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas and Christus Southeast Texas St. Elizabeth, declined to answer detailed lists of questions about her treatment. Fails and Crain believed abortion was morally wrong. The teen could only support it in the context of rape or life-threatening illness, she used to tell her mother. They didn’t care whether the government banned it, just how their Christian faith guided their own actions. When they discovered Crain was pregnant with a girl, the two talked endlessly about the little dresses they could buy, what kind of mother she would be. Crain landed on the name Lillian. Fails could not wait to meet her. But when her daughter got sick, Fails expected that doctors had an obligation to do everything in their power to stave off a potentially deadly emergency, even if that meant losing Lillian. In her view, they were more concerned with checking the fetal heartbeat than attending to Crain. “I know it sounds selfish, and God knows I would rather have both of them, but if I had to choose,” Fails said, “I would have chosen my daughter.” Crain had just graduated from high school in her hometown of Vidor, Texas, in May of 2023 when she learned that she was pregnant. She and her boyfriend of two years, Randall Broussard, were always hip to hip, wrestling over vapes or snuggling on the couch watching vampire movies. Crain was drawn to how gentle he was. He admired how easily she built friendships and how quickly she could make people laugh. Though they were young, they’d already imagined starting a family. Broussard, who has eight siblings, wanted many kids; Crain wanted a daughter and the kind of relationship she had with her mom. Earlier that year, Broussard had given Crain a small diamond ring — “a promise,” he told her, “that I will always love you.” On the morning of their baby shower, Oct. 28, 2023, Crain woke with a headache. Her mom decorated the house with pink balloons and Crain laid out Halloween-themed platters. Soon, nausea set in. Crain started vomiting and was running a fever. When guests arrived, Broussard opened gifts — onesies and diapers and bows — while Crain kept closing her eyes. Around 3 p.m., her family told her she needed to go to the hospital. Broussard drove Crain to Baptist Hospitals of Southeast Texas. They sat in the waiting room for four hours. When Crain started vomiting, staff brought her a plastic pan. When she wasn’t retching, she lay her head in her boyfriend’s lap. A nurse practitioner ordered a test for strep throat, which came back positive, medical records show. But in a pregnant patient, abdominal pain and vomiting should not be quickly attributed to strep, physicians told ProPublica; a doctor should have also evaluated her pregnancy. Instead, Baptist Hospitals discharged her with a prescription for antibiotics. She was home at 9 p.m. and quickly dozed off, but within hours, she woke her mother up. “Mom, my stomach is still hurting,” she said into the dark bedroom at 3 a.m. “I’m in a lot of pain.” Fails drove Broussard and Crain to another hospital in town, Christus Southeast Texas St. Elizabeth. Around 4:20 a.m., OB-GYN William Hawkins saw that Crain had a temperature of 102.8 and an abnormally high pulse, according to records; a nurse noted that Crain rated her abdominal pain as a seven out of 10. Her vital signs pointed to possible sepsis, records show. It’s standard medical practice to immediately treat patients who show signs of sepsis, which can overtake and kill a person quickly, medical experts told ProPublica. These patients should be watched until their vitals improve. Through tests and scans, the goal is to find the source of the infection. If the infection was in Crain’s uterus, the fetus would likely need to be removed with a surgery. In a room at the obstetric emergency department, a nurse wrapped a sensor belt around Crain’s belly to check the fetal heart rate. “Baby’s fine,” Broussard told Fails, who was sitting in the hallway. After two hours of IV fluids, one dose of antibiotics, and some Tylenol, Crain’s fever didn’t go down, her pulse remained high, and the fetal heart rate was abnormally fast, medical records show. Hawkins noted that Crain had strep and a urinary tract infection, wrote up a prescription and discharged her. Hawkins had missed infections before. Eight years earlier, the Texas Medical Board found that he had failed to diagnose appendicitis in one patient and syphilis in another. In the latter case, the board noted that his error “may have contributed to the fetal demise of one of her twins.” The board issued an order to have Hawkins’ medical practice monitored; the order was lifted two years later. (Hawkins did not respond to several attempts to reach him.) All of the doctors who reviewed Crain’s vital signs for ProPublica said she should have been admitted. “She should have never left, never left,” said Elise Boos, an OB-GYN in Tennessee. Kass, the New York emergency physician, put it in starker terms: When they discharged her, they were “pushing her down the path of no return.” “It’s bullshit,” Fails said as Broussard rolled Crain out in a wheelchair; she was unable to walk on her own. Fails had expected the hospital to keep her overnight. Her daughter was breathing heavily, hunched over in pain, pale in the face. Normally talkative, the teen was quiet. Back home, around 7 a.m., Fails tried to get her daughter comfortable as she cried and moaned. She told Fails she needed to pee, and her mother helped her into the bathroom. “Mom, come here,” she said from the toilet. Blood stained her underwear. The blood confirmed Fails’ instinct: This was a miscarriage. At 9 a.m, a full day after the nausea began, they were back at Christus St. Elizabeth. Crain’s lips were drained of color and she kept saying she was going to pass out. Staff started her on IV antibiotics and performed a bedside ultrasound. Around 9:30 a.m., the OB on duty, Dr. Marcelo Totorica, couldn’t find a fetal heart rate, according to records; he told the family he was sorry for their loss. Standard protocol when a critically ill patient experiences a miscarriage is to stabilize her and, in most cases, hurry to the operating room for delivery, medical experts said. This is especially urgent with a spreading infection. But at Christus St. Elizabeth, the OB-GYN just continued antibiotic care. A half-hour later, as nurses placed a catheter, Fails noticed her daughter’s thighs were covered in blood. At 10 a.m., Melissa McIntosh, a labor and delivery nurse, spoke to Totorica about Crain’s condition. The teen was now having contractions. “Dr. Totorica states to not move patient,” she wrote after talking with him. “Dr. Totorica states there is a slight chance patient may need to go to ICU and he wants the bedside ultrasound to be done stat for sure before admitting to room.” Though he had already performed an ultrasound, he was asking for a second. The first hadn’t preserved an image of Crain’s womb in the medical record. “Bedside ultrasounds aren’t always set up to save images permanently,” said Abbott, the Boston OB-GYN. The state’s laws banning abortion require that doctors record the absence of a fetal heartbeat before intervening with a procedure that could end a pregnancy. Exceptions for medical emergencies demand physicians document their reasoning. “Pretty consistently, people say, ‘Until we can be absolutely certain this isn’t a normal pregnancy, we can’t do anything, because it could be alleged that we were doing an abortion,’” said Dr. Tony Ogburn, an OB-GYN in San Antonio. At 10:40 a.m, Crain’s blood pressure was dropping. Minutes later, Totorica was paging for an emergency team over the loudspeakers. Around 11 a.m., two hours after Crain had arrived at the hospital, a second ultrasound was performed. A nurse noted: “Bedside ultrasound at this time to confirm fetal demise per Dr. Totorica’s orders.” When doctors wheeled Crain into the ICU at 11:20 a.m., Fails stayed by her side, rubbing her head, as her daughter dipped in and out of consciousness. Crain couldn’t sign consent forms for her care because of “extreme pain,” according to the records, so Fails signed a release for “unplanned dilation and curettage” or “unplanned cesarean section.” But the doctors quickly decided it was now too risky to operate, according to records. They suspected that she had developed a dangerous complication of sepsis known as disseminated intravascular coagulation; she was bleeding internally. Frantic and crying, Fails locked eyes with her daughter. “You’re strong, Nevaeh,” she said. “God made us strong.” Crain sat up in the cot. Old, black blood gushed from her nostrils and mouth. Crain is one of at least two pregnant Texas women who died after doctors delayed treating miscarriages, ProPublica found. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has successfully made his state the only one in the country that isn’t required to follow the Biden administration’s efforts to ensure that emergency departments don’t turn away patients like Crain. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, the administration issued guidance on how states with bans should follow the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The federal law requires hospitals that receive funding through Medicare — which is virtually all of them — to stabilize or transfer anyone who arrives in their emergency rooms. That goes for pregnant patients, the guidance argues, even if that means violating state law and providing an abortion. Paxton responded by filing a lawsuit in 2022, saying the federal guidance “forces hospitals and doctors to commit crimes,” and was an “attempt to use federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.” Part of the battle has centered on who is eligible for abortion. The federal EMTALA guidelines apply when the health of the pregnant patient is in “serious jeopardy.” That’s a wider range of circumstances than the Texas abortion restriction, which only makes exceptions for a “risk of death” or “a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” The lawsuit worked its way through three layers of federal courts, and each time it was met by judges nominated by former President Donald Trump, whose court appointments were pivotal to overturning Roe v. Wade. After U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, a Trump appointee, quickly sided with Texas, Paxton celebrated the triumph over “left-wing bureaucrats in Washington.” “The decision last night proves what we knew all along,” Paxton added. “The law is on our side.” This year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the order in a ruling authored by Kurt D. Engelhardt, another judge nominated by Trump. The Biden administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, urging the justices to make it clear that some emergency abortions are allowed. Even amid news of preventable deaths related to abortion bans, the Supreme Court declined to do so last month. Paxton called this “a major victory” for the state’s abortion ban. He has also made clear that he will bring charges against physicians for performing abortions if he decides that the cases don’t fall within Texas’ narrow medical exceptions. Last year, he sent a letter threatening to prosecute a doctor who had received court approval to provide an emergency abortion for a Dallas woman. He insisted that the doctor and her patient had not proven how, precisely, the patient’s condition threatened her life. Many doctors say this kind of message has encouraged doctors to “punt” patients instead of treating them. Since the abortion bans went into effect, an OB-GYN at a major hospital in San Antonio has seen an uptick in pregnant patients being sent to them from across Southern Texas, as they suffer from complications that could easily be treated close to home. The well-resourced hospital is perceived to have more institutional support to provide abortions and miscarriage management, the doctor said. Other providers “are transferring those patients to our centers because, frankly, they don’t want to deal with them.” After Crain died, Fails couldn’t stop thinking about how Christus Southeast Hospital had ignored her daughter’s condition. “She was bleeding,” she said. “Why didn’t they do anything to help it along instead of wait for another ultrasound to confirm the baby is dead?” It was the medical examiner, not the doctors at the hospital, who removed Lillian from Crain’s womb. His autopsy didn’t resolve Fails’ lingering questions about what the hospitals missed and why. He called the death “natural” and attributed it to “complications of pregnancy.” He did note, however, that Crain was “repeatedly seeking medical care for a progressive illness” just before she died. Last November, Fails reached out to medical malpractice lawyers to see about getting justice through the courts. A different legal barrier now stood in her way. If Crain had experienced these same delays as an inpatient, Fails would have needed to establish that the hospital violated medical standards. That, she believed, she could do. But because the delays and discharges occurred in an area of the hospital classified as an emergency room, lawyers said that Texas law set a much higher burden of proof: “willful and wanton negligence.” No lawyer has agreed to take the case.

(AP) — A winged creature from Oregon was crowned this year’s winner Thursday in an annual bat beauty contest put on by the Bureau of Land Management. On Halloween, which was also the last day of International Bat Week, a hoary bat with a feisty personality named “Hoary Potter” defeated “Lestat”, the western small-footed bat from Idaho, in the final round of the contest. It also bested a Townsend’s big-eared bat named “Sir Flaps-A-Lot” from Utah, among others. The victory marks the third year in a row that a bat from Oregon has taken first place in the contest. Last year, “William ShakespEAR,” a female Townsend’s big-eared bat from southern Oregon took the title. In 2022, a canyon bat named “Barbara” also from southern Oregon was declared the winner. The federal agency has held the competition since 2019 to raise awareness about the animal’s ecological importance. The bats are part of wild populations living on public lands, and are photographed by agency staff. BLM posted the photos on its Facebook and Instagram accounts, and asked people to vote for the cutest one. Hoary bats are known for swift flight and wrapping themselves in their own tails to mimic leaves and to hide from predators, the agency said. Because of this attribute, it estimated Hoary Potter would be “the perfect candidate for seeker on this year’s Quidditch team,” referring to the game in Harry Potter that is played on flying brooms. Emma Busk, the BLM wildlife technician who photographed Hoary Potter, said bats play a key role in the environment by eating insects and pollinating flowers and fruits. But they’re increasingly facing the threats of habitat loss, disease and light pollution, and are often misunderstood as scary disease carriers, she said. “Less than 1% of all bat populations actually carry rabies, and the bat-to-human disease transmission is actually really low,” she said.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-lt-mexico-day-of-the-dead-pets_n_6724ef73e4b01e8b2424ccbe","Pets Join Mexico's Day Of The Dead Celebrations","fabiola sánchez","2024-11-01","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Pets are not forgotten during Mexico’s famed Day of the Dead celebrations, when even Fido and Tiger get a place at the altars Mexican families set up to honor their deceased loved ones, complete with flowers, candles and photographs. Though the human dead usually get their favorite food or drink placed on altars, the nature of pet food can make things a little different. The holiday has roots in Mexican pre-Hispanic customs, as does the reverence for animals. The small, hairless dogs that Mexicans kept before the Spanish conquest were believed to help guide their owners to the afterlife, and were sometimes given special burials. But the inclusion of pets on family altars has grown in recent years. Day of the Dead begins Oct. 31, to remember those humans who died in accidents; it continues Nov. 1 to mark those who died in childhood and then Nov. 2 to those who died as adults. Observances include entire families cleaning and decorating graves, which are covered with orange marigolds. At both cemeteries and at home altars, relatives light candles, put out offerings of the favorite foods and beverages of their deceased relatives. The presence of pets has gained such momentum that now Oct. 27 is considered Day of the Dead for pets and the National Anthropology and History Institute includes tips on its social platforms for how to include them in altars. Mexico City graphic designer Meztli Lizaola makes sure every year that her beloved tawny-coated Chihuahua, Taco — who died two years ago — has a place at the altar on a table in the corner of her living room. Taco’s ashes are there in an urn, and so is his lively-eyed photo, next to a photo of Lizaola’s deceased father. The orange-flowered cempasúchil — a type of marigold — is placed around the photos, as well as candles and figurines of skulls. Taco was an omnivorous eater and — as his name suggests — enjoyed tacos (especially roast pork) and other traditional Mexican human foods like quesadillas and concha pastries. But because she has four other dogs, she can’t leave Taco’s favorite foods on the altar; some sneaky pup is likely to snatch it. For years now, elements of Halloween have been mixing into the seasonal festivities, and for pets it’s no different. For those who still have living dogs and cats, it is not uncommon to find a wide variety of pet Halloween costumes at pet shops, including inmate-style “bad dog” costumes. Ethnohistorian Juan Pablo García Urióstegui says the inclusion of pets and Halloween influences are part of changes in the traditional holiday that have accelerated, particularly in the last three years, “We are experiencing changes in the traditions. It is happening very fast,” said García Urióstegui, of Mexico’s National Anthropology Museum. Now it’s not unusual to find pets on airplanes, in bars and restaurants or even at their owners’ medical appointments. For one thing, especially in big cities, the large family of numerous children is often a thing of the past, and couples having only pets — dubbed “perrihijos” or “dog kids” — are now not uncommon. “That’s where you see these practices concerning death starting to take hold,” he said. “They are no longer just another companion ... they are living beings who hold memories, and whose memory must be commemorated.” But the admiration for dogs goes way back in Mexico, where hairless dogs known as xoloitzcuintles were common before the Spanish brought their larger, furrier hounds to Mexico during the 1519-1521 conquest. The pre-Hispanic dogs were often sacrificed or buried near their owners — or represented as carefully crafted ceramic figurines — because the owner would need the dogs’ keen senses to find the path to the underworld after death. Lizaola still feels Taco’s absence. His face is tattooed on her right arm. The dog changed her life and that of her partner. The next four years will change America forever.

Initially, there was some resistance within her family to including Taco on the altar, a place long reserved for departed family members.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pet-squirrel-seized-peanut_n_6724eb53e4b01e8b2424c8dd","Instagram-Famous Squirrel Named Peanut Seized By New York State Authorities","karen matthews","2024-11-01","A New York man who turned a rescued squirrel into a social media star called Peanut is pleading with state authorities to return his beloved pet after they seized it during a raid that also yielded a raccoon named Fred. Multiple anonymous complaints about Peanut — also spelled P’Nut or PNUT — brought at least six officers from the state Department of Environmental Conservation to Mark Longo’s home near the Pennsylvania border in rural Pine City on Wednesday, Longo said. “The DEC came to my house and raided my house without a search warrant to find a squirrel!” said Longo, who is 34. “I was treated as if I was a drug dealer and they were going for drugs and guns.” The officers left with Peanut, who amassed hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram, TikTok and other platforms during his seven years with Longo. They also took Fred, a more recent addition to the family. A spokesperson for the DEC said in a statement that the agency started an investigation after receiving “multiple reports from the public about the potentially unsafe housing of wildlife that could carry rabies and the illegal keeping of wildlife as pets.” Longo, who runs an animal refuge inspired by his squirrel buddy called P’Nuts Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary, took to Instagram to mourn Peanut’s loss. “Well internet, you WON,” Longo posted. “You took one of the most amazing animals away from me because of your selfishness. To the group of people who called DEC, there’s a special place in hell for you.” Longo fears that Peanut has been euthanized. “I don’t know if Peanut is alive,” he said in a phone interview Thursday. “I don’t know where he is.” The DEC spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether Peanut had been euthanized. Longo said he saw Peanut’s mother get hit by a car in New York City seven years ago, leaving the tiny squirrel an orphan. Longo brought Peanut home and cared for him for eight months before trying to release the squirrel into the great outdoors. “A day and a half later I found him sitting on my porch missing half of his tail with his bone sticking out,” Longo said. Longo determined that Peanut lacked the survival skills to live in the wild and would remain an indoor squirrel. Soon after Longo posted videos of Peanut playing with his cat, internet fame followed. A scroll through Peanut’s Instagram account suggests that this is no ordinary squirrel. Peanut leaps on to Longo’s shoulder, he wears a miniature cowboy hat, he eats a waffle while wearing crocheted bunny ears. Over the years Peanut’s story has been featured on TV and newspapers including USA Today. Longo, who works as a mechanical engineer, was living in Norwalk, Connecticut, until he decided to move to upstate New York last year to start an animal sanctuary. P’Nuts Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary opened in April 2023 and now houses about 300 animals including horses, goats and alpacas, said Longo, who runs the sanctuary with his wife, Daniela, and other family members. Longo is aware that it’s against New York state law to own a wild animal without a license. He said he was in the process of filing paperwork to get Peanut certified as an educational animal. “If we’re not following the rules, guide us in the right direction to follow the rules, you know?” Longo said. “Let us know what we need to do to have Peanut in the house and not have to worry about him getting taken.” The next four years will change America forever.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. You don’t need a genealogy expert to undercover your familial past. The advent of at-home DNA tests has made ancestral deep-diving a little easier (for better and for worse), simply by mailing a saliva sample to a lab, waiting weeks for processing and viewing your genetic details online. If you’re interested in unlocking your past with a DNA test— one that reviewers say is “easy, fun and illuminating” and provides a “fun, educational experience” — Amazon has an incredible deal on an AncestryDNA test. Normally $99, you can grab one today on sale for just $40, so jump on this deal before the price shoots back up. This AncestryDNA kit aims to detail a person’s origins from 2,600 global regions and reviewers say it’s super simple to use. Once you purchase the kit, you can activate it online and submit your spit sample with the included prepaid mailing kit. After six to eight weeks — though some user reviews say results may come faster than that — you’ll receive an interactive report with details on your ethnicity and geographic origins, as well as your ever-expanding family tree full of other users who’ve used AncestryDNA in the past. These kits have helped people find their parents, discover distant relatives and better understand their ancestors. “This DNA test brought us a lot closer to our family” says user Michael Haller. “So many doors have opened up to me, to our family, with the critical help of the results through this DNA kit. Literally, generations of our family have been revealed, hooked together, and opened communication pathways among the living relatives that we didn’t even know we had or existed.” Of course, sharing your DNA comes with privacy risks, but if you find your familial curiosity too much to resist, then this under-$40 AncestryDNA test may be too good of a deal to pass up. You might also be comforted by the brand’s overall privacy approach found on the Ancestry website. “I did Ancestry after doing 23 and me. Ancestry has a lot more information about my family’s history and seemed more accurate. The $30 monthly membership to have access to the records is prohibitive, so I will be canceling after the 3 month free trial. I did learn a lot of family history, though. If it was something I could afford, I would keep it.” — Donald Dunlop  “Some of the results were expected, some were new and surprising but all of it has been interesting and fun to share with family and friends. The ethnic diversity within our own family, especially between siblings has been most fascinating. We inherit traits from a genetic grab bag of sorts from each of our parents and this can lead to a myriad of unexpected combinations. This grab bag is complex and fascinating, with much that scientists can not fully explain. I did not expect Ancestry to unravel all of these mysteries with a mail-in saliva test.” — Terri  “As a result of Ancestry DNA kit, my twin nieces found our family. This includes a great niece and nephew. My Dad, Uncle and sister previously submitted their own Ancestry DNA tests. Since then my Dad and sister have died as did my Mother. It was a profound loss. Having the twins find us encouraged me to submit my DNA as well. The twins now have a family and connection that was denied them for 38 years. We have some catching up to do, but they are us. When I met one twin, who lives 30 miles away, I hugged her and it was like giving my sister a hug. After sadness and grief, my heart was filled with joy and happiness. Do I recommend this product? Absolutely, positively yes!” — J Kennedy  “It’s hard to find words and where to begin, but as a child you have no options to ask your parents about a WHY or WHEN ...and you hope that one day in the future , you do find your answers !!..Things were kept as Secrets and nobody ever spoke about our Families past , but now I do understand the WHY !!..There are still many more unanswered questions and the WHEN will maybe never been discovered, plus another new question of HOW just popped up in my mind !?...but for now , I feel much more confident when I talk about my heritage!!..I am very excited and proud of my grandparents ❤️ how they did managed their survival within a very hard time , with 2 young girls in their ‘luggage’, where one was later my mother !!!...Thanks to ANCESTRY for helping me now to understand the WHY and WHEN and hopefully one day I will be able to discover the HOW 🤔 My journey just started today , but my answers are now laying in front of me !!!...Thanks to everyone from the ANCESTRY TEAM for helping me , to understand now many situations in my childhood , but I never received the ANSWERS for !!!..God bless you all 🙏😇🥰” — barbara Edenf.  “I was adopted at birth so I had been been searching for family for years. I took this test for my birth “father’s” family to prove the man my birth mother told me was my father 20+ years ago (my brother’s father) was my biological dad. After testing I matched NONE of the family members tested but matched an entirely different family close enough for a first cousin/sibling match. Of course I matched my own children and my birth mom’s family. She was just mistaken about my father but she has passed away so I can no longer ask her as has my father also . I only have one of his brothers that will talk to me. I am 58 yrs old and still never got to have a father 🥺 but glad I know the truth. Thank you Ancestry. I am also uncovering amazing ancestors on their website on both sides of my family.” — AFMerc  “I was excited when my results came in and saw my DNA results and matches.

Grab These Must-Have Beauty Picks Now","tatayana yomary","2024-11-01","Prepare yourselves, beauty and self-care lovers! The annual Sephora Savings Event has arrived with deals that will make any person who loves beauty and personal care blush. Known as the créme de la créme of beauty savings events, this semiannual sale allows beauty enthusiasts and novices alike to try new products or re-up on their daily essentials at up to 30% off! With hair care, makeup and skin care up for grabs, the options are endless and deals depend on your Sephora Beauty Insider status. Access to the sale is contingent on your status in Sephora’s three-tiered Beauty Insider program. Rouge members (folks who spend a minimum of $1,000 annually) get first dibs. Starting Nov. 1, they can enjoy 20% off select brands. VIB members who spend at least $350 annually get access to the sale on Nov. 5 with 15% off. Like VIB members, Insiders will also gain access to the sale on Nov. 5 with a 10% discount. (Remember, Insider status is free and only requires signing up for Sephora’s mailing list.) Also, if you’re a Rouge member (or know someone who is), this year, Sephora’s offering the option to share the early 20% off access with a non-member. People at every tier of the Beauty Insider status can enjoy 30% off on all Sephora Collection products, using the code “SAVINGS” at checkout. Navigating Sephora’s extensive lineup of over 300 brands can be tedious but we’ve taken on that task for you. Below are the must-have products in Sephora’s Savings Event. Prices are listed by tier so consider this your comprehensive cheat sheet for the full sale from now through its Nov. 11 end date. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Foot massages after every hard day on your feet may not be in the cards for you, but there's another way to tap into some foot care. Enter the Sephora Collection's foot mask. Designed to slip onto your foot like a sock, it wraps your feet in the lap of hydrating luxury to nourish and repair the skin. Enriched with coconut extract, the foot mask is meant to leave feet with a baby-soft feel. Note: Don't forget to use the code ""SAVINGS"" to get your 30% off at checkout. Promising review: ""My feet were so hard for months and just after one use they became so soft, I left it overnight that made skin feel a bit soggy but after I washed them they were soft for days."" — Asht6 It's never too early to start focusing on improving skin texture concerns like fine lines, wrinkles, the appearance of large pores and more. After trying this moisturizing essence from SK-II, I finally realized why this treatment is a must-have. Aside from improving my skin tone and texture, this lightweight essence makes my skin softer and leaves a gorgeous, dewy glow behind. Skip the false lashes for the night and let your natural fringe be the star of the show (especially when you're running low on time!). While you may scratch your head at this thought if you're working with straight and short lashes, Sephora Collection's weightless mascara is known for working magic. It combines the best of both worlds, curling and lifting, to add some extra pizazz to your lashes for up to 12 hours. Get it in the full or the mini size. Note: Don't forget to use the code ""SAVINGS"" to get your 30% off at checkout. Promising review: ""I grabbed this on sale the first time and was shocked at how well it did. The number of compliments I got on my lashes has been insane. I don’t even have to curl my lashes first which is a huge plus!"" — Cdb16 Summer Fridays lip balm acquired its cult following via Beautytok (the corner of TikTok where beauty and personal care enthusiasts reside) — and for good reason! Featuring shea and murumuru seed butters plus vegan waxes, this silky find hydrates, soothes and smoothes parched lips on contact for a happy pout. It also works double-duty as a nighttime mask to help you maximize the nourishment. Not to mention, this lip balm comes in nine deliciously scented flavors that are almost good enough to taste. Leftover makeup on your canvas is bad news for the face. From stained bed linens to impending acne woes, removing every speck of product is key for healthy skin. Sephora Collection's cleansing wipes are infused with micellar water, allowing you to wipe away makeup down to the last drop confidently. No harsh rubbing is required! They're available in full-size but also in (cheaper) travel minis, both of which are on sale. Note: Don't forget to use the code ""SAVINGS"" to get your 30% off at checkout. On this side, we play absolutely no games with adding sunscreen to our skincare routine to shield our skin from UVA and UVB rays that cause premature signs of aging, hyperpigmentation and other harm. The Innisfree SPF 36 works overtime on sun defense but it also features ingredients like green tea and sunflower seed oil that soothes, hydrate and deliver lasting moisture with a radiant glow. I especially love that it's white-cast-free, making it suitable for all skin tones. Every makeup lover needs a reliable red lip in their collection. There's also no such thing as having too many reds in your makeup bag, and this sheer Sephora Collection formula offers the best of the must-have hue. The shade is classic and sexy, helps you exude confidence and can give anyone major sex appeal. This sheer-shine lipstick flaunts a creamy, weightless formula that's designed to keep your lips hydrated for up to 12 hours. Not into reds? You can still enjoy the hydrating lip color since it's available in loads more shades ranging from nudes to to pinks to even a sheer, shimmery look. Promising review (for the Ray of Red shade): ""I love that this lipstick is sheer and has light pigmentation it almost feels like a lip balm with color than a lipstick and I love that but also it’s buildable if you want the color to shine through. I love it."" — Helloitsmonica Olaplex is known for its bond-repairing capabilities, and its leave-in conditioner sets a new standard. Formulated with split ends in mind, this product immediately seals, hydrates, softens and detangles strands for a salon-quality look with every use. Bonus: It's also designed to protect hair from heat damage up to 450 degrees! Promising review: Honestly, I wasn't expecting much of a difference. I'm always purchasing the latest product and I'm more frequently disappointed than I hope for. At first, I didn't see too much of a difference until the third time I used it. It's amazing! It's the one product I know I can expect noticeable results and make my hair from mid shaft to ends look like I just got a haircut and color. No more split ends popping out or sticking out making my hair look like a scarecrow. By the way my hair is medium thickness but has many breakage and split ends due to hair extensions and not being able to cut all the bad off unless I wanted a short short haircut which I don't. Another main thing that I love about this product is that I put it on the next day for hydration and it doesn't leave residue or make my hair look like I hadn't washed it. It just looks healthy. This project really does hydrate. I'm so glad I purchased this item and I don't really leave reviews but I knew that I wanted other women to find something that actually works without spending hundreds of dollars."" — Foxychica On this side, we take makeup application seriously. This velour puff comes in major clutch for baking, setting, and touching up your makeup seamlessly, leaving you with an airbrushed finish. Its triangle shape is perfect for getting into hard-to-reach areas, and the rounded end is ideal for applying makeup to the larger parts of your face. The days of dealing with uneven coverage are over. As someone who sometimes deals with dry lips during the chilly season, I find the Laneige lip mask to be an absolute godsend. It delivers maximum hydration and does all the work while you get your beauty sleep. (And yes, this is the same brand HuffPost readers adore for its hydrating face cream.)The formula features a blend of berry mix complex and plant butters meant to help you wake up to a softer feeling on ur lips that lasts. Vitamin C also helps to shield your lips from external aggressors — like the sun, X-rays, and other sources. This set comes with five lip mask minis in yummy flavors including Mango and Gummy Bear. Promising review: ""My daughter absolutely loves this stuff. Her lips went from chapped and peeling all the time to moisturized in a week. She doesn’t even need chapstick anymore."" — BrittDawnW Unlike many hair glosses available, Living Proof's formula stands out for one important reason: it boasts a lightweight silicone-free formula that leaves behind no residue. Yes, you read that correctly! This hair treatment also features light-enhancing technology that layers your strands with a supreme level of shine meant to last up to three washes. Promising review: ""I have no idea what is in this but it's the best hair product I have ever used. My hair looks so shiny, healthy, and frizz-free with this product. That is saying a LOT because i have very dry, thick and frizzy hair. Further, this product keeps me away from heating tools because my hair holds its shine and shape until my next wash. This product is truly incredible."" — staceyanna123 There's a reason why this Urban Decay setting spray is a permanent fixture in my makeup bag — it works like a charm! Known as a cult-favorite makeup essential, this super-fine mist keeps makeup fresh all day. It's transfer-resistant and smudge-proof for up to 16 hours, so your makeup look will stay right where you need it to be. Also, despite the bottle's size, a little goes a long way! One bottle should last you for several months to a year, depending on how often you set your makeup — making the price a very fair investment. A popular hair care staple, Briogeo's hair mask can give dry, damaged tresses the TLC they desperately need. It strengthens hair strands from root to tip, deeply moisturizes, softens and helps prevent future breakage — all without the heavy feel. The mask also has a vanilla birthday cake scent that serves as the cherry on top of a nourishing wash day experience. If you're sensitive to fragrance, I recommend you skip. The Lancôme Beauty Sleep Routine 2024 Holiday Skincare Gift Set is one luxurious way to take revitalizing your skin to the next level with high-end products that back up their price tag with trusty formulas. The set is definitely the best way to get more bang for your buck. Best of all, the set is complete with full sizes of the brand's Advanced Génifique Serum and Rénergie Lift Multi-Action Night Cream — a beloved duo that can aid in reversing dullness and firming the skin. No matter your hair type, moisture is essential for achieving a healthy mane. Moroccanoil's value set puts the goal in motion with its full-sized shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner and mini hair oil treatment. The system is designed with ingredients to help smooth frizz, boost shine and provide overall nourishment. Apologies if you're late to the party, but press-on nails are so in! Granted, they're not like our grandmother's press-on nails from back in the day. These new and improved sets, including this glitzy Glamentic offering, have superior staying power and allow you to jazz up your manicure as you see fit. The best thing about this set is that it's not a one-and-done option. The nails are reusable and last up to three weeks! Promising review: ""I have jumped on the press on bandwagon lately and have been using another brand. I tried glamnetics for the first time and their quality is so much better. it's such an easy process and took me probably 20 minutes total from prep to finish. the other brand I used last me about two weeks so let's hope these do as well."" — skydieiak Prepare to enter the world of beauty pampering from head to toe, courtesy of L'Occitane's 24 Days Of Beauty Advent Calendar. Packed with hair care, skincare and body care finds, this set features top-quality ingredients that combat dryness and deliver nourishment, making it worthy of this season's hype. (Looking for more advent calendars, do checkout the best advent calendar roundup on the entire internet curated by HuffPost Shopping reporter, Erica Kam.) If you desire a multifunctional face product that hydrates, brightens and reduces the look of hyperpigmentation, consider your search over. Glow Recipe's Niacinamide Dew Drops serum has been a staple in my routine over the past six months, surpassing my expectations. The gel formula is lightweight and immediately melts into my skin. The watermelon in the gel hydrates my skin and gives my canvas a glowy finish. As for the niacinamide, it has helped to reduce the hyperpigmentation along my chin area, which has made me feel more confident rocking a fresh face. Trust me, you don't need to think twice about adding this serum to your routine. If you want versatility, high color payoff and seamless blending, you've met your match. This Sephora Collections palette, which boasts 29 mattes, shimmers, and metallics, has the color combinations you need to bring your desired eye makeup looks to life. The shades feel smooth as butter across your lids and don't require multiple layers for a highly pigmented finish. Gentle and effective cleansing is a must for healthy skin. Dieux's gel cleanser offering — formulated with glycerin, betaine and a gentle cleansing complex — works to remove impurities from the skin sans stripping. It's specifically formulated to address acne and the appearance of deep pores. Best of all, this product is available with or without fragrance, making it perfect for all skin types, including sensitive skin. Promising review: ""I always keep going back to this cleanser. my skin loves this so much. whenever I'm using it I see less breakouts. I also enjoy that it's fragrance-free as I have really sensitive skin."" — AnaG8616 By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Throughout the presidential campaign, Trump has repeatedly leveled personal insults against Harris, including calling her “lazy” — a racist trope to demean Black people. He has also described his Democratic rival as “low IQ” and called her a “stupid person.” Apart from condemning the insults against his wife, Emhoff also took time to denounce Trump’s reported praise of Adolf Hitler. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly told The Atlantic that Trump said he wanted his military leaders to be more like Hitler’s generals. Kelly also recalled Trump saying “Hitler did some good things,” according to a book by CNN reporter Jim Sciutto. Emhoff said “we should all be chilled to the bone” over the alleged remarks. “We cannot have a president who has admires Adolf Hitler, we just can’t,” Emhoff said. “We need to move forward, we need to turn the page.” The next four years will change America forever.

The animals are being fed by a volunteer while nearby residents try to figure out how to wrest the property from a mysterious absentee owner, according to the outlet. The state of the former president’s first house at 85-15 Wareham Place in Queens ― a faux Tudor where he lived until age 4 before the family moved ― seems to reek with irony. The Republican nominee has promoted lies that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were kidnapping and eating cats and dogs, culminating in a meme-worthy declaration to that effect during the debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. “They’re eating the cats,” he said at one point. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), has been criticized for declaring a few years ago that “childless cat ladies” like Harris were ruining the country. A sign warns people not to take kittens from the property and bags of dog poop, thrown by passersby, occupied the front doorstep, Curbed wrote. The next four years will change America forever.

Giuliani said they “shouldn’t have been taken out of the jungle.” On the “Flyover Conservatives” podcast, the former New York City mayor and onetime personal attorney for Donald Trump admitted that debunked claims pushed by the former president and his running mate, JD Vance, about Haitian immigrants eating Springfield residents’ pets “may not be true” but had done the job of bringing attention to immigration concerns. Giuliani then claimed to “know the Haitian community backwards and forwards” from his time “in Haiti negotiating when I worked for Ronald Reagan, something similar to ‘stay in Mexico.’” Trump campaign surrogate Rudy Giuliani says immigrants “shouldn't have been taken out of the jungle” pic.twitter.com/DY4vo4Vakm After a riff on the practice of animal sacrifice in Voodoo and the eating of animals, Giuliani suggested of the immigrants, though, “it’s not their fault.” Then came the shocking statement: They live back 200 years ago. They just shouldn’t have been taken out of the jungle and placed in the middle of small town America. That’s ridiculous. Or big town America, for that matter. These people are insane, what they’re doing. They’re insane. The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris shared the moment on X, formerly Twitter. (See above.) Watch the full context of Giuliani’s comments from the 49-minute mark here: Critics were stunned by the idea: This is deeply racist. Rudy Giuliani saying immigrants “shouldn't have been taken out of the jungle” is shocking. It’s not just offensive; it shows a total lack of empathy. Comments like this dehumanize people looking for safety and ignore the real reasons they migrate. Imagine being Giuliani and having to live with himself every day.🥶 The next four years will change America forever.

Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount (and when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why). HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. If your dentist has been giving you grief about your oral hygiene lately, listen up: We found a deal you won’t want to miss. The Oral-B Genius X Limited rechargeable electric toothbrush is the best electric toothbrush many reviewers say they’ve ever had, and right now, it’s 50% off, the lowest price it’s been all year. This rarely goes on sale, so don’t pass up the opportunity to score a discount while you can. It’s only for a discount through the weekend! Even with the huge discount, you might be (understandably) skeptical about spending $100 on a toothbrush, but trust us when we say this appears to be worth the splurge. Reviewers have said this investment into their oral health has been “worth every penny” and even helped them save money on dental bills in the long run. The Genius X Limited is more high-tech than your average electric toothbrush. Not only does the brand claim that it can remove up to 100% more plaque than your standard manual toothbrush, but thanks to AI brushing recognition, you can use Bluetooth track your brushing habits with the Oral-B app. It can actually give you personalized coaching to make sure you’re brushing everywhere you need to, for how long you need to, with the right amount of pressure. Talk about a toothbrush that works for its money. It has five cleaning modes, a visible pressure sensor so you don’t press too hard and risk damaging your teeth and gums and a two-minute timer so you’re always brushing long enough. Your purchase comes with a convenient travel case and one replacement brush head — according to the brand, each brush head should last you up to 90 days with regular brushing. Reviewers also say that charging this toothbrush makes it last longer than others they’ve used in the past, about two weeks. Compared to the price of potential expensive dental treatments, $100 sounds like a great bargain — but don’t just take it from us. Below, read some of the reviews from shoppers who have been blown away by what the Genius X Limited has done for their oral health. I dare you not to add it to your cart right away. “I was at first hesitant to spend that much on a toothbrush but it’s worth every penny. It works at least 10x better than my $20 oral b electronic toothbrush. The motion sensing is very cool and helpful. After just one brush my teeth feel almost like they do after a professional cleaning as opposed to how they felt after brushing with my cheap electronic toothbrush.” — Anne E La Perla “I’be been getting cleanings every 3 months due to uncomfortable plaque build up. I pay for every other visit because my insurance only covers one every 6 months… My dental hygienist recommended this tooth brush and I was not disappointed! I’ll be changing my appointments back to every 6 months! My teeth feel cleaner than after visiting her! It was worth every penny. The strength of the toothbrush sounds rough but it is soft on sensitive gums. I love the app and watching as I clean each section. The time it took to brush my teeth was over twice as long and I can’t believe the spots I was missing. The round head makes it easy to get to the back teeth and into spots I didn’t think you could reach.10/10 recommend. You’ll save on dental bills!” — Danielle “First off, it feels like the polisher the dentist uses on your teeth after a cleaning. It feels like it’s actually getting everything off, and my teeth feel completely clean after using it. I love that it has an app that tracks when you brush as well as how thoroughly and shows you where you need to brush more. It’s made remembering to brush much easier since it’s almost a game to make sure you do it consistently. A nice bonus is the travel case it came with. It holds the main part of the toothbrush as well as slots for two brush heads. I fully charged it before going on vacation last week and it lasted for a week of daily use, so it’ll last at least that long before needing charged again.” — Derek “I’ve never had an electric toothbrush because I wasn’t willing to shell out $100+ on something I could spend $1 on and get the same result as long as I was a skilled enough brusher. The dentist always comments on my receding gum line on some of my teeth and is always half-heartedly recommending an electric toothbrush. I like going to the dentist but haven’t in over a year. I was starting to expose the root of a few teeth because I’m brushing too vigorously with a lot of pressure. It never bothered me before but 2 months ago I started experiencing tooth sensitivity and noticed that the teeth that were sensitive were showing deeper recession. I could feel the temperature of hot coffee, cold water, minty tooth paste and mouth wash... everything. TBH I didn’t even want to brush my teeth anymore because I didn’t want to touch those roots. I decided to splurge on this toothbrush hoping it would save my teeth from ruin and having them fall out and needing implants at 30. After the first brushing I was blown away. This machine was going to do a better job of cleaning my teeth no matter how meticulous or skilled I was with a manual toothbrush. It’s also going to make sure its done in a gentle way that isn’t going to erode your gums. After two weeks of use I no longer have sensitivity on my teeth and I wouldn’t be surprised if the pockets on my gum line were less deep too. I’m a big fan of the red ring that pops up when you’re applying too much pressure. I think the app is fun and I like watching the quadrants turn bright white. If you’re stubborn like I was and being a hold out on electric toothbrushes.... stop. Hold off on upgrading that phone of yours and instead spend the money here. This thing is going to do a better job at preserving your teeth than you ever could. I worked at an orthodontist office and taught kids how to brush their teeth. I thought I was a pro at it. To an extent maybe I was but this toothbrush makes it so easy that it won’t let you brush the “wrong” way. Give Oral-B your money. It’s worth it.” — E.

Dyson is typically known as the gold standard brand for home tech products, but we found a cordless stick vacuum that so many are saying is a solid contender to the sought-after brand’s vacuums. The Shark Pet cordless stick vacuum allegedly “better than a Dyson,” and several reviewers have been happily switching to this Shark for a fraction of the lux brand’s pricing. It’s got comparable features to the high-priced alternative — an LED light to spotlight and better see dirt and debris, an anti-tangle brush, up to 40 minutes of battery life and plenty of swappable attachments to make sucking dust from any crevice easy.

The vacuum picks up pet hair effortlessly, and the light feature is a fantastic addition—it helps me find hidden dust and fur. My favorite attachment is the one you can use on furniture. It works well on both my hardwood floors and area rugs. My only complaint is that it doesn’t stand up on it’s own, you either have to prop it up to something or detach the handle and latch it onto the bottom stick piece. Overall, a great choice for pet owners!” — Matthew Reeves  “[…] I cannot recommend it enough and it is absolutely worth making the switch. My partner and I both have depression and ADHD which makes it very hard for us to find the motivation to clean. Since getting this vacuum I am not kidding, I have vacuumed more in the past year than I have the rest of my adult life (I’m 32! Yes, this is embarrassing!). We keep this near the kitchen within easy reach and eye sight, and it’s small enough not to be in the way. We also have carpeted stairs which were the worst to have to deal with - both mentally and literally - and now I vacuum them regularly just because it’s so easy. We have had multiple full size/traditional “pet” specific vacuums before and this specific model has equal or better suction power and is so much more convenient than all of them. And it fits under the couch!” — June (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review.)  “This Shark is a dream! It vacuums well in flooring and carpet, has great, consistent suction, is easy to maneuver, and even my kids love using it! Vacuum holds a charge for a long time - I can get my whole house vacuumed and still have a charge. Easily converted to the dust buster to clean my car too! Picks up all the “chunks” off the floor. Highly recommend!” — daisycake  “[…] This is exactly what we needed and I would foresee getting a few years or more life out of this vacuum. Versatile enough to be used on hard flooring, carpet, and automobiles or more. It comes at a very reasonable price point considering the quality and the brand reputation. I would think that for pet owners with hard flooring this would work great for most pet situations. The functionality is as promised and I like the weight and feel of it overall. I’m very happy with this purchase.” —U’s Reviews (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review.)  “This one works better than my Dyson highly recommend this vacuum I bought several floor cleaning products from Amazon The robot, vacuuming mop, and the upright vacuum and mop by timeco I used to buy the insurance for my products Don’t waste your money they have you use the manufacturer warranty that’s on your product comes with Anyways, so when you have a problem, you have to go to the manufacturer for help you buy the Amazon insurance for two years. Your product has a two-year warranty, which they make you go to if anything goes wrong with your product.” — Nancy Higuchi111  By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-looking-weighted-blankets-ud_l_6724c8dae4b01f6919d9c85b","Surprise! These Nice-Looking Throws Are Also Weighted Blankets","griffin wynne","2024-11-01","At the risk of sounding like an insufferable person hearing a now-popular band playing on the radio at a Starbucks: I liked weighted blankets before they were cool. As a person with anxiety and sensory sensitivity, I find the added support of a heavy fabric both physically and emotionally comforting. Whether I’m falling asleep or just watching TV, being tucked in extra snuggly helps my body and mind relax. However, as an early adopter of the weighted blanket, I can also fondly say that my first-ever weighted blanket was ... ugly. She (the blanket) served me well and did her job providing sensory support, yet she looked like something from a doctor’s office. She was clinical, sterile and rendered in a sad shade of gray with an awkward-fitting cover. She stood out from the rest of my boho-style bedroom decor, screaming “I’m basically a medical device!” whenever you looked at her. As weighted blankets become more popular, I’m overjoyed to see them available in much cuter styles. These days, there are weighted blankets that don’t even look like weighted blankets — they just look like elegant throw blankets you’d get at a cool home decor store. It’s an item meant to make you feel cozy, so it’s only natural that it should be easy on the eyes, too. If you’ve never used a weighted blanket and don’t know which weight to look for, the Sleep Foundation recommends using a throw that’s 5% to 12% of your body weight, noting that most people like a blanket around 10% of their weight. To help you catch some z’s or feel super comfy on the couch while still looking stylish, we rounded up our favorite weighted blankets that just look like nice blankets.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/powerful-blender-ninja-foodi-ano_l_6724c72be4b00acf55d992cc","This Tiny Blender Is The Most Powerful One Our Food Editor Has Ever Seen","kristen aiken","2024-11-01","Culinary school successfully brainwashed me to believe that when it comes to blenders, Vitamix reigns supreme. And in many cases, that’s true ― especially if you’re blending things in large batches. But if you primarily use your blender for single servings of smoothies, you’re well aware of how much space a dirty blender jar takes up in your sink, taunting you as you procrastinate washing it. If only there were a tiny blender that could whip up smoothies in single batches! And imagine if that blender jar could flip upside down, transforming into the cup from which you drink your smoothie! And then imagine if there were a lid you could screw on top, so you can take your smoothie with you to go. Good news: there is one. You can get it for $80 right now, and I own two of them. I’m always skeptical of anything with the word “foodie” in the name, but a couple years ago I tried out the Ninja Foodi Smoothie Maker and Nutrient Extractor. I expected very little, but from the moment I gripped the suction cups of the machine’s tiny base to my countertop and turned it on, I could feel the blender’s sheer force as it sent vibrations through my entire kitchen. Air shot out of the bottom, sending random garlic peels flying across the countertop. And when the smoothie was finished, my protein powder was whipped into a delightful cloud and the seeds from the raspberries were so highly pulverized, they were nearly undetectable. I was sold. This particular model takes up just a few inches on your countertop, and it comes with a host of attachments and whirligigs that can make not only smoothies, but frozen smoothie bowls, pestos and nut butters, just to name a few examples. And frankly, I’ve been preferring the Ninja over my Vitamix for all these uses. I love it so much, I bought a second one to keep at my mom’s house for when I’m visiting. If you’re making a smoothie or a frozen bowl (an acai bowl, for example), there’s absolutely no guesswork involved ― just press the corresponding button on the machine, and it knows exactly how long to blend it ― the machine will turn off when it’s done. (Just one warning: the machine isn’t quiet!) But if you want a more manual option, the “pulse” button allows you to control exactly how long the blender runs. When it’s time to clean up, it couldn’t be easier ― just fill the blender jar halfway with water and a few drops of soap, and turn it on for a few seconds. It’ll come out perfectly clean after a quick rinse, and you’re good to go. If you or someone you know is constantly complaining about cleaning a giant blender, or simply can’t manage to get the chunks out of smoothies, I highly recommend this one, even though I still don’t like the name of it. And Amazon reviewers agree about its performance ― check out some of their most promising reviews below. This tiny blender will almost literally blow you away, and it has a 4.5-star average rating, with more than 9,000 Amazon reviews. The set contains: a 14-ounce smoothie bowl maker with built-in tamper that easily powers through frozen ingredients; two 24-ounce nutrient extraction cups to blend smoothies and other liquids, plus lids for all three containers. The 1,200-peak-watt motor has suction cups at the bottom to firmly attach to your countertop, and offers six programs for one-touch blend, pulse, smoothies, extractions, bowls and spreads. To make life even easier, all the parts (aside from the motor) are dishwasher safe. Promising reviews: “I bought this blender about 9 months ago - after I had already bought - and returned - FOUR other blenders. All but one of those other blenders had significantly more wattage - 1400, 1800, and even 2200 - but NONE could handle blending my smoothies as well as this one! Not only that, but this model is far more compact and lightweight than all the others - some of which were quite heavy. So this Ninja is easily storable in the cabinet and takes up little room.” — Batlady “Nothing could’ve prepared me for how powerful this blender was. Decided to buy this as I needed a new blender. Am shocked at how powerful this thing is. ... Super powerful was actually almost a little scared haha. It is loud though but what blender isn’t and that’s fine with me. It has suction cups on the bottom so it stays in place really nicely. It also has its own self timer/ setting for smoothies so can walk away and let it do it’s thing. No annoying missed chunks that didn’t get blended. Super quick. Love the clickable/lockable top piece to make sure top doesn’t fall off.” — A By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

(AP) — Three days after historic flash floods swept through towns in Spain and killed at least 205 people, the initial shock was giving way to anger, frustration and a wave of solidarity on Friday. Spanish emergency authorities raised the death toll to at least 205 victims, 202 of them in Valencia alone. Many streets are still blocked by piled-up vehicles and debris, in some cases trapping residents in their homes. Some places still don’t have electricity, running water, or stable telephone connections. The damage from the storm Tuesday and Wednesday recalled the aftermath of a tsunami, with survivors left to pick up the pieces as they mourn loved ones lost in Spain’s deadliest natural disaster in living memory. “The situation is unbelievable. It’s a disaster and there is very little help,” said Emilio Cuartero, a resident of Masanasa, on the outskirts of Valencia. “We need machinery, cranes, so that the sites can be accessed. We need a lot of help. And bread and water.” In Chiva, residents were busy Friday clearing debris from mud-filled streets. The Valencian town received more rain in eight hours on Tuesday than it had in the preceding 20 months, and water overflowed a gully that crosses the town, tearing up roads and walls of houses. The mayor, Amparo Fort, told RNE radio that “entire houses have disappeared, we don’t know if there were people inside or not.” So far 158 bodies have been recovered — 155 in Valencia, two in the Castilla La Mancha region and one more in Andalusia — after Spain’s deadliest natural disaster in living memory. Members of the security forces and soldiers are busy searching for an unknown number of missing people, many feared to still be trapped in wrecked vehicles or flooded garages. “I have been there all my life, all my memories are there, my parents lived there ... and now in one night it is all gone,” Chiva resident Juan Vicente Pérez told The Associated Press near the place he lost his home. “If we had waited five more minutes, we would not be here in this world.” Before and after satellite images of Valencia illustrated the scale of the catastrophe, showing the transformation of the Mediterranean metropolis into a landscape inundated with muddy waters. The V-33 highway was completely covered in the brown of a thick layer of mud. The tragedy has unleashed a wave of local solidarity. Residents in communities like Paiporta — where at least 62 people died — and Catarroja have been walking kilometers (miles) in sticky mud to Valencia to get supplies, passing neighbors from unaffected areas who are bringing carry water, essential products, shovels or brooms to help remove the mud. The large number of people coming to help has led the authorities to ask them not to drive there, because they block the roads needed by the emergency services. In addition to the contributions of volunteers, associations such as the Red Cross and town councils are distributing food. And as authorities repeat over and over, more storms are expected. The Spanish weather agency issued alerts for strong rains in Tarragona, Catalonia, as well as part of the Balearic Islands. Meanwhile, flood survivors and volunteers are engaged in the titanic task of clearing an omnipresent layer of dense mud. The storm cut power and water services on Tuesday night, but about 85% of 155.000 affected customers had their power back on by Friday, the utility said in a statement. “This is a disaster. There are a lot of elderly people who don’t have medicine. There are children who don’t have food. We don’t have milk, we don’t have water. We have no access to anything,” a resident of Alfafar, one of the most affected towns in south Valencia, told state television station TVE. “No one even came to warn us on the first day.” Juan Ramón Adsuara, the mayor of Alfafar, said the aid isn’t nearly enough for residents trapped in an “extreme situation.” “There are people living with corpses at home. It’s very sad. We are organizing ourselves, but we are running out of everything,” he told reporters. “We go with vans to Valencia, we buy and we come back, but here we are totally forgotten.” Rushing water turned narrow streets into death traps and spawned rivers that tore through homes and businesses, leaving many uninhabitable. Some have looted shops and the authorities have arrested 50 people. Social networks have channeled the needs of those affected. Some posted images of missing people in the hope of getting information about their whereabouts, while others launched initiatives such as Suport Mutu — or Mutual Support — which connects requests for help with people who are offering it; and others organized collections of basic goods throughout all the country or launched fundraisers. Spain’s Mediterranean coast is used to autumn storms that can cause flooding, but this was the most powerful flash flooding in recent memory. Scientists link it to climate change, which is also behind increasingly high temperatures and droughts in Spain and the heating up of the Mediterranean Sea. Human-caused climate change has doubled the likelihood of a storm like this week’s deluge in Valencia, according to a partial analysis issued Thursday by World Weather Attribution, a group made up of dozens of international scientists who study global warming’s role in extreme weather. Spain has suffered through an almost two-year drought, making the flooding worse because the dry ground was so hard that it could not absorb the rain. The next four years will change America forever.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. I have a very large extended family, so for years, we’d have at least 75-100 people at every holiday meal. Each smaller family unit was put in charge of a specific dish to bring, and for decades, mine has been assigned the task of making all the mashed potatoes. Mashed or other potatoes are easily one of the best sides at Thanksgiving or Easter, but peeling more than a few spuds at a time, bent over the sink, can be really, really hard on hands, wrists and backs. My mom would rope all four of us kids into helping, and we’d form an extremely reluctant and sour-faced little potato assembly line with our vegetable peelers and go through bags and bags of potatoes — that is, when she could get us to help at all. We all pretty much hated Thanksgiving and other big holiday mornings until I discovered the Starfit Rotato Express and bought one for my parents’ house. #blindtok #thanksgiving #rotato #potatoes #kitchen #gadget I absolutely love this thing The Rotato is pretty much what it sounds like: a small appliance that peels potatoes by rotating them, in this case with a small blade that’s enclosed in plastic for safety. And let me tell you, you just don’t know joy until an electric peeler saves you and your siblings from hand-peeling dozens and dozens of pounds of potatoes on a holiday morning. Now one person just plops a potato at a time on the Rotato, pushes a little button to see its peel come off in a thin, glorious ribbon, then repeats the process. We’ve gone from resisting to helping to arguing over who gets to man the Rotato, and now we’re done peeling so, so much faster. The great thing about this little kitchen gem is that you don’t need a large family like mine to find it handy; it’s great for people who have mobility issues, arthritis, or other challenges that make peeling potatoes difficult or uncomfortable, not to mention people who just like machines doing things for them, or just really hate peeling potatoes. In the video above, a TikTok reviewer who is legally blind recommends it for others like herself. Plus, real-life chefs love it, too. It’s just plain fun to use, and de-skins a whole list of other fruits and veg as well, like pears, lemons, limes and apples. It now also comes in an updated model called the Rotato 2.0, but my family’s been using our Rotato since 2016 and it’s held up just fine. Despite the fact that some parts are plastic, it has been truly durable. Each machine comes with six replacement blades (more can be ordered separately), and you can power it via wall outlet or with batteries. You just might wonder how you lived without it. Promising reviews from Amazon shoppers: “We got this for my mom who has bad arthritis in her hands but loves her potatoes. I mean daily potatoes at least once a day. She loves this machine. I am giving it five stars because she is always using it and hasn’t complained yet. Trust me if there was a complaint I would have heard about it by now. Many many times. 😂 that alone is really all the review you need. Mom hasn’t complained once and uses it daily.” — Melissa W “This is an extremely useful product. Well made and easy to use. I purchased this peeler for my mother who always complained about peeling potatoes. Now she [is] very happy and just cannot believe what this product can do. Wish she had this years ago. My mother and I are so happy. Thanks to ‘Starfrit.’” — CharlieBooksNYC “I love this peeler. It saves so much time when making apple pie. I always still have to peel them a little bit myself at the top and bottom but definitely worth the money.” — Jacintha Ham “Great gadget! I’ve always hated peeling potatoes. If you’re the same BUY THIS! Of course it takes up some valuable cupboard space, but not much, and it’s so worth it. It works on anything that needs peeling. I watched a woman peel EVERYTHING imaginable with this in a YouTube video. Pretty much works on everything, but the potatoes is what sold me. There’s a little at the top & bottom it can’t reach, but I just cut it off. And sometimes the blade pops off when removing potato - easy to pop back on. LOVE THIS THING. Never peeling potatoes again by hand again.” — DesertCat “I have looked at these potato peelers for a long time but not sure they would work. Well, yes they do! I have arthritis in both hands, so peeling anything is a chore and sometimes painful. This really helped me. I only need to snip the ends off and cut any bad spots out, and WALAH! We will be having potatoes more often now! Love this little gadget!” — Laura Outler “Don’t let the lower price dissuade you. It’s every bit as good as the more expensive brand my friend had last year. I use mine at work and home. I set on the counter, or a potato in while I’m tending to other opening duties at the cafe... No more losing my grip on potatoes or my fingers swelling, going numb from peeling. (Carpal tunnel, joint pain). Even if I didn’t have hand issues, I would highly recommend this. It’s very fast. Occasionally, use a toothpick under the tiny blade to remove potato debris. This is my favorite and most used time saver in the home and work kitchen.” — Batznblkcatz By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The montage showed Trump naming various things that he loves: from women and Christmas to Puerto Rico, God, Muslims and Mexican people.

I Hope This Explains Why.","carolyn hamilton","2024-11-01","In the 13 months Jeff lived while dying of pancreatic cancer, we walked a 1-mile loop in our small mountain town every day, sometimes twice a day, mostly holding hands. In the spring and summer, he always tore a leaf off the vine of hops that grew around the banister at the end of our alley, handed it to me, and I chewed it, a little ritual we thought was funny and fun. On good days, he raced me up High Street and he always won because I was laughing too hard to run. And at some point in the loop, every time, I asked him questions that I hoped would close the space between us, bringing me even closer to him and his experience. I asked him things like, “Are you nervous about anything?” to which he said, “Not being able to see,” because his chemo had affected his vision. Questions like, “Who do you want to speak at your memorial?” and, “Do you think I was a good partner?” And “Is it hard for you — all these hard questions?” to which he replied, “No, I like the chance to help.” One afternoon, just before we crossed the train tracks on our way home, I asked, “What do you want me to write in your obituary?” “Just tell a story,” he told me, with his characteristic brevity and trust. So I did, and writing his obituary felt like a collaboration. I didn’t want it to end. But of course it did, and now, a year and a half later, I am telling a different story. There is a part of me that wants to warn you about it — because what I’m about to tell you may shock or even disturb you — and a part of me that wants to trust you with it, but all of me wants to tell this story because what is love without sharing and what is the truth without telling? As Jeff lay dying in the ICU, his eyes already darkened from blue to galaxy black, I watched him peer into the unknown, into whatever lay beyond the popcorn ceiling of that hospital. For 30 years, I watched him peer into the unknown, sticking his whole curious head into dark spaces, like caves in the south of France and basements in vacant houses. In 1995, Jeff launched his body from the top of a speed ski track in Vars, France, into the unknown and became the first person to ski 150 mph. He referred to his sport as “drag racing on skis.” Zero to 150 mph in 16 seconds. But because he was a man of nuance, he loved the sense of acceleration even more than the speed itself. For the decade he raced, I often stood at the base of speed tracks, looking up the 1 kilometer to where he assembled his body into his aerodynamic tuck and committed to the run. During events, I stepped just in front of all the other spectators, so no one was in my periphery. So there was no distraction. So there was, in essence, no space between me and him. I wanted to feel all I could. Jeff loved the unknown. As a child in Auburn, California, he explored caves for hours only to emerge from the earth just 15 yards from where he entered. As a young man, he slept on top of Mount Whitney in a lightning storm, and flew 700 feet from California’s tallest bridge at midnight, tethered to steel by bungees around his ankles, to the American River below. In Europe, he once skied 100 mph naked side-by-side with a friend for fun, and he stepped over all the electric fences on French hillsides to pet and kiss the goats. But when he became a husband, and then a parent, he shifted his love for the unknown to accommodate for less risk because he wanted to be around for all of it — all the love. Just before Jeff died, we talked about the unknown at our kitchen table in the context of his impending death, and in particular, what I saw as my upcoming million unknowns without him. “The unknown is beautiful,” he told me. “The unknown is terrifying,” I replied. Because his heart was kind, and because his diaphragm wasn’t working, he repeated, his voice more float than traction, “The unknown is beautiful, Carolina.” “You think it’s beautiful because you believe things will work out. I think it’s terrifying because I don’t believe things will work out,” I told him. “I guess we’re both right,” he said. In the ICU, on the last morning of his life, breathing was so hard for Jeff that I pictured his mind deciding that breathing should not be involuntary: It should be one choice after the next. In this newest unknown of his life, he opened his jaw like a drawer, slid it forward for more breath, shut it, and then did it again. Each breath was another chance, another choice to inhale beauty, and pain, and the breath of his daughters, Eleanore and Frances, and me, the loves he did not want to leave. In his last 16 hours, as with most of his life, Eleanore, Frances and I held onto him. We left no space between us in that hospital room. He was our framework, our scaffolding, our being, our body. I climbed into the bed, set my head under his jaw and draped my arm over his chest. Eleanore gripped his right arm; Frances gripped his left hand. And we told him stories. How he once found us a hidden ancient Roman bridge to sit our bodies down on so we could feel the ruts and imagine the flow of centuries. How he taught us to fly off rooftops and land in feet of soft snow. We told him how lucky we were that his hands held our hands everywhere. When Eleanore was 5 years old and terrified at her first (and last) soccer practice, Jeff walked onto the field, took her hand and they ran after the ball together. Once, in the ocean, Jeff held Frances’ and my hands as we floated just above a manta ray and her liquid wings. We whispered to Jeff that if he ever let go of our hands, it was to point out new ways to go, off-trail, off-piste: up a moraine in Yosemite to Hanging Basket Lake, down tight alleys in tall cities, into magical redwood forests, through ideas, and into hard work, joy, commitment and community. And we also told him the story of his last year, as if he did not know; how he opened, and continued to open, even when, at 55 years old, his life contracted, and pain and death closed in. How he chose his own metaphor when it came to cancer — how he chose to “compete” with it, not battle it. At the midpoint of Jeff’s year of cancer, I developed a sty under my right eye, a sac that hung low and red and heavy. After its excision, my face was bruised and scabbed along the incision line. I loved it. I told him I wished it would never go away. When he asked me why, I said, “because finally the outside of me shows the inside of me.” “Pain?” he asked. “Yes, pain.” A few nights later, when his pain became overwhelming but he didn’t want to take OxyContin, he stepped under the showerhead to let water wash some of the agony away. I lay down on the tile beside the shower and I asked him, “Are you afraid to die?” “No. Dying is the easy part. You’ve got the hard part,” he told me. He was standing in a shower, but really, he was stepping off a worn human trail of thinking — showing me how to see, and feel, and know things differently. I know when Jeff’s body ended. The breathlessness that followed his breath stretched across the 60 seconds of 4:00 a.m. The timelessness of death began then. But two nurses, obeying the hospital rules, had to prove to the state of California that he was dead, so they leaned over us and listened for his heart and felt for his pulse. Finally, at 4:07 a.m., they declared what we already knew. Our small family spent the next hour washing his arms and ankles and bruised shins. We praised his nose and neck and hands in a humble merging of borrowed rituals. We dressed his feet in socks, his legs in sweats, his chest in a T-shirt. We lifted his body onto that gurney, zipped that bag around him, and followed him down the hall to that van and through the dark to the mortuary downtown. We helped wheel him through a foot of new snow into that garage. We left his body there to be swallowed by fire. And we waited a week for what they said would be his ashes. Jeff had asked Eleanore and Frances to promise that they would launch back into their lives after he died. He told them both, separately, “Mom is strong; she’ll be OK.” And so, brokenhearted, but keeping their promise, our brave daughters left home, one to London, the other to Nashville. I stayed. I shoveled snow in the second biggest winter in Tahoe history, hacked at ice in the driveway, ate soup our friends delivered. I set the box of his ashes, labeled “Jeffrey Hamilton,” on the dresser by our bed. I lifted it up when I needed to feel the weight of him — not just the weight of the loss of him. I tried my hardest to put him inside my mind, as he asked me to. “Put me in your mind, Carolina. What you build in your mind is so powerful. If you put me there, I’ll be there,” he told me. We were left with my mind because he did not believe in heaven, and because he did not believe in heaven, I could not put him there. But in two conversations before he died, he opened to a different way. “Are you sure there is nothing after life?” I asked him. He fixed his eyes on me and said, “No, I am not sure. I don’t know anything.” In an earlier conversation, he said, “If there is a place I can miss you forever, I want to be there. Because I will miss you forever.” So, in my midnights, when I peer into the dark of our bedroom and cry out that I miss him, I picture him missing me. I picture him in my mind. I picture him not knowing for sure there was nothing else. But picturing is weightless. And more than believing the most magnetic, weightless idea, I crave his body — his hand on the back of my neck, his foot on my lap, his legs, steady and playful, even on ice, showing me how to trust. I crave the way his body enveloped his girls to show them how to hold a catfish by its mouth, and then, later, position a putter, and then, later, drive a tractor. On Feb. 14, a month after he died, as I shoveled more snow in the driveway, I thought, I will transfer his ashes to the urn today. He and I did not care one bit about Valentine’s Day, so doing this big thing on this day felt like it could be our inside joke — something unexpected that we could share. My idea quickly turned into momentum. I ditched the shovel, marched into our house, lifted the cardboard box given to me by the funeral home weeks before, set it on the kitchen table, and ripped into it. I was terrified of this unknown, of the way Jeff would look, rendered. I had put off this act for weeks, and I had even asked his sister to help me transfer his ashes whenever I had the courage to do it. But on this day, I knew I wanted to do it alone, with no one in my periphery — just Jeff and me. No space between us. I clawed at the box and cried. I was afraid but also raging. I heard myself speak to him in a current of words, like “Baby, my love, I am here, right here,” and then, suddenly, there he was: a dune of gray and white. I pulled the dog tag from the zip tie and tore at the rigid plastic bag. I opened the bag and stared into him. The body of his body was not ash at all. Everyone was using the wrong word. He was more bone than flake, more rock than air. I stood over him, looking into him, and I felt a surge of autonomy and intimacy at the exact same time, as if I’d been set free by my hunger for him. I dug my hands into the pile of him, just like he dug his hands into beaches to sculpt sand mermaids with our girls. I felt him, and moved my fingers to sift him, letting him fall back into the bag. I ached for more of the body of him, and so, without a single thought about what I should or should not do, I leapt the fence of protocol and all its barbed rules, and I wet my finger with the tip of my tongue and I set that finger into the pile of him. I felt him settle there on my fingertip — part grace, part mischief, all love — and then I lifted him to my mouth and I tasted him. He was salt. “My god,” I cried out loud in my kitchen, “My god, Jeff Hamilton, you are the ocean!” I cried tides and wept words. He was the ocean. He was ocean-sized. He was the salt of every being through time. He was the salt of every being to come. I couldn’t stop. I sunk my fingers into him again and gathered part of him up in one primal pinch and set him in a small mound on my tongue. This time, I shut my mouth, and I worked my jaw, and I chewed what was left of his bones. They did not cut my gums or my tongue, but, instead, forgave, and relented to the work of my jaw and the hunger of my heart. Jeff always preferred the truth, so here it is: I ate him because I could not not eat him. And this is also true: With the first grind of him against my teeth, the howling inside me stopped. My ache settled. My hollow filled. My cry dried. And I hummed. As I moved my jaw, I heard Jeff, and felt him, and followed him, and embodied him, and I hummed a low hum. My inhale was hum. My exhale was hum. I hummed while I walked to the island in our kitchen. I hummed as I opened the bottom drawer. I hummed as I found a measuring cup, and I hummed as I walked back to the box, and scooped one precious quarter-cup of him at a time into the ceramic vessel I bought online. When Jeff was still alive, with just 13 more months to live, I sent him a daily morning email. It was long, more like a list. In a succession of 10, 20 or 30 lines, I thanked him for the little and big things I noticed about him the day before, like, “Thank you for teaching me how to play darts — ‘Keep your feet steady and just push.’” And “Thank you for saying, ‘What prepares you for a thing is not blind optimism but knowing that it might be hard.’” And “Thank you for the chance to feel your lips on my cheek when you came to bed. Big loving kisses.” It was my habit to watch him, be awed by him, and write to him, so just before he died, I asked him if I could still write to him every day after he was gone, or if that would be weird. He said yes, of course, and no, it wouldn’t be weird at all. So on Feb. 15, I wrote the Valentine’s Day story to him. I needed to understand what happened alongside the person who had always helped me understand. What I learned as I wrote to Jeff was that somewhere on this planet there must be an ancient knowing that found a way to hum through me, and tell me, without words, that my act of eating Jeff’s ashes was proportional to my grief. I learned that I reconfigured our relationship to accommodate the fact that one of us was dead. And, after I finished writing, I knew that for one hour in my kitchen, I hummed the hum of the universe, the hum of the merging of dead and alive, gone and here, known and unknown. I hummed the hum of my beautiful man showing me the way to him, off-trail, off-piste. I hummed the hum of love. For the next six months, I wrote every day for hours. I wrote a series of stories to Jeff about love and loss. I couldn’t stop. Writing was the way I closed the infinite space between him and me. I shared that first story about what I did with his ashes almost immediately with very close friends, beginning with Jeff’s sister. I called her one night, and as I read, she listened, and when I stopped, she sobbed. In that moment, I felt seen, as if she was peering through my skin to my pain, my loss, and my love. I continued to share my writing, one-on-one, with dear friends, my parents and siblings, and Jeff’s mom. Jeff has been dead for 22 months, and in that time, I have hauled him into my daily life because I don’t want him to become an idea. I want him closer than that. The truth is, Jeff gave me a kind of grief map a month before he died. “If I died, what would you do?” I asked him “I would want to feel it all — I would want to feel all the grief,” he said. So I don’t feel wrong about walking straight into my sadness, leaving no space between Jeff and me in this new reality. Every morning, when I first open my eyes, I slip my hand over to his side of the bed under what would have been his hip and I say what I said for 30 years, “Good morning, Jeffrey,” and then I say what he always said, “Mornin’ Sweet.” It shocks me how much I sound like him. Every day, I press record on my phone and talk into it, to the Jeff who lives in my mind. I ask for advice, tell him about our girls, and, looking into the sky, I ask him where he is. And usually I cry because hearing my voice and not his makes me miss our back-and-forth. One year exactly after that first Valentine’s Day without him on this planet, I decided to start taking daily self-portraits because the person who knew me and loved me and laughed with me best was gone, and now I needed to see myself. I caption each photograph, keep them in a folder on my desktop, and that is where they sit, unseen by anyone but me, telling me my true story of being a widow. They are not pretty, and I love how not pretty they are. I exchange hard and beautiful daily truths with my sister and two dear friends. I regularly interview Jeff’s mom, who lost her husband to Alzheimer’s on the day Jeff was diagnosed. Our recorded conversations give space and attention to her grief, and they bring me closer to her and to Jeff. And, every day, I read aloud one thank you note from the 375 I emailed him. In the minutes it takes me to read them, we are together, seeing each other. I don’t just grieve for Jeff. I celebrate him by finding joy, being strong, helping my community, and guiding and being inspired by our daughters. I am teaching myself how to live alone, manage and clear feet of snow, locate irrigation issues, and drive our mower, which was easier to learn than I thought it would be. I planted another generation of the sunflower and hollyhock seeds Jeff harvested for me, and I continue to clear and plant spaces for new growth, which I sometimes refer to as “rage-planting” because it is such a muscular act, made possible by a pickaxe, a broken heart, and belief in beauty. Slowly, I am speaking the intimidating language of finances. And, because Jeff showed me how to be brave, I practice being brave like him every day. Sharing my story with the world in this very public way means I have to be brave. I will tell these most private truths with the widest circle yet. So, to prepare this piece for you, an audience of strangers, I will admit that I am picturing six familiar faces. The first is Jeff for all the reasons. I also picture the faces of three peripheral friends whose husbands have died since Jeff died, and I hope this story frees them to tell their own stories, as soft, frightening, raw, unpredictable, mundane, or sacred as they are. And I picture the faces of our daughters, Eleanore and Frances, who stayed open as I told them this heavy story — heavy enough to shut anyone down. I told them in person, but separately. Their collective response amounted to compassion and love. They met my story with reverent words like, “Being an artist means sometimes not being polite at all, Mom, but disrupting the conversation with the truth.” And “What you did seems ancient.” Jeff said, “Tell a story.” I did, I am, and I always will. Feeling it all, telling the truest stories I can about what I feel, and trusting people with those stories is the way I grieve, the way I live, and the way I hum the hum of love.

Earlier this year, he was separately found guilty on 34 felony charges of falsifying business documents to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, Hostin noted. “So when you think about that, that’s the guy that’s going to protect women? That’s the guy that’s going to protect women’s rights?” she said. “Does he think that women are so unsophisticated that we don’t know what he’s saying?” Another co-host, Joy Behar, replied that Trump thinks women are “stupid” and treats them with “no respect.” “He thinks we don’t understand our own rights,” she said. As the hosts turned to the issue of abortion, Goldberg reminded viewers of “what is at stake” in this year’s election. “Every woman needs the ability to go get herself taken care of,” Goldberg said. “You men, we need you to stand up and say: ‘Listen, it’s none of your business. It’s my family and I. You can’t do this to my wife or my partner or my lover.’” She added: “Women, we’re sticking together on this. If you’re a one-issue voter, you need to include this in your head because this affects you. This affects you and your children directly.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Gingrich claimed the message was symptomatic of Democrats’ amorality. “And the more you watch them, to say, ‘Oh, why don’t you lie to your husband?’ as a publicly advocated ad? That is sick!” he told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. “And I think we ought to have the courage to say this is a sick, dishonest party.” Only that is not the message of Vote Common Good’s online entry. The video encourages women not to cave to domestic intimidation ― subtle or otherwise ― and to vote their conscience. In the clip, two women share knowing looks at a polling place as one tallies her ballot in favor of Kamala Harris. “Did you make the right choice?” a male companion in a U.S. flag-branded cap asks the woman. “Sure did, honey!” she responds. “In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want and no one will ever know,” narrates the Oscar-winning actor. Prompted by Hannity, Gingrich went off on the ad. “These people are dishonest,” he said. “And so, for them to tell people to lie is just one further example of the depth of their corruption. I mean, how do you run a country where you’re walking around saying, ‘Wives should lie to their husbands, husbands should lie to their wives’?” “I mean, what kind of a totally amoral, corrupt, sick system have the Democrats developed?” he prattled on. “If you think about it at that level, it is astonishing, the decay.” Gingrich continued his diatribe about the video, which has triggered other conservatives such as Fox News’ Jesse Watters. “Instead of having dignity and patriotism and a sense of morality, these are really sick people,” Gingrich said.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/election-2024-senate_n_6724a52be4b01f6919d9b542","The Struggle For Senate Control Goes Down To The Wire As Spending Shatters Records","marc levy","2024-11-01","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Billions of dollars in advertising are raining down on voters across the Rust Belt, Rocky Mountains and American southwest as the two major political parties portray their opponent’s candidates as extreme in a struggle for control of the U.S. Senate. In three races alone — Ohio, Pennsylvania and Montana — more than $1 billion is projected to be spent by Nov. 5. The race in Ohio could break the spending record for Senate races. The race in Montana will go down as the most expensive Senate race ever on a per-vote basis. And, late in the game, Democrats are sending millions more dollars to Texas, a GOP stronghold where the party has new hopes of knocking off two-term conservative stalwart Sen. Ted Cruz, an upset that could help them protect their majority. Republicans need to pick up two seats to capture a surefire majority, and one of those — West Virginia — is all but in the bag for the GOP. Other races are more volatile and less predictable. For Democrats, the brutal math of this year’s election cycle is forcing them to defend eight seats in tough states. Losses by established incumbents could amount to an extinction-level event for Democrats who represent reliably Republican states. The election also will test the down-ballot strength of both parties in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the premier presidential battleground states known as the Blue Wall for their relatively reliable Democratic voting history. Wins there by Republicans would dramatically alter the Senate playing field. All told, data from political ad tracking firm AdImpact projects that more than $2.5 billion will be spent on advertising in Senate races in this two-year campaign cycle, slightly more than the 2022 total. That includes a half-billion dollars in Ohio alone, another $340 million in Pennsylvania and $280 million in Montana, population 1.1 million, or less than one-tenth of the population of either Ohio or Pennsylvania. The most expensive Senate race ever was Democrat John Ossoff ’s victory in a Georgia contest that went to a runoff in 2021 and decided Senate control, according to data from the campaign finance-tracking organization Open Secrets. Generally, campaign strategists say Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is polling ahead of his party’s Senate candidates in Senate battleground states, while Democratic candidates in those states are polling ahead of their presidential nominee, Kamala Harris. That means there is a slice of voters who could vote for Trump but not back Republicans in Senate races — or who could split their tickets with Democratic Senate candidates. Such splits have been rare. In Maine, in 2020 voters backed Democrat Joe Biden for president and re-elected Republican Sen. Susan Collins, for instance. Republican strategists said they expect the party’s major super PACs to spend until election day in seven states where Democrats are defending Senate seats: Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where polls show competitive races, but also Nevada and Arizona, where Republicans are encouraged by strong early voting numbers. Republicans are most confident about flipping the seat in deep-red Montana, where Republican Tim Sheehy is challenging third-term Democratic Sen. Jon Tester. They are also optimistic about reliably red Ohio, where Republican Bernie Moreno is challenging third-term Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Torunn Sinclair, a spokesperson for a pair of Republican-aligned super PACs, said one — American Crossroads — is pulling $2.8 million out of Montana, while the pair are plunging several million more into Pennsylvania. There, Republican David McCormick is trying to knock off three-term Democratic Sen. Bob Casey in a presidential battleground undercard that both sides say is close. McCormick, a former CEO of the world’s largest hedge fund, has hammered the message in two debates that Casey is a “sure thing” to back the Biden-Harris administration’s agenda. In recent days, Casey began running an ad in conservative areas that touts his “greedflation” legislation to pursue price-gouging. The ad says “Casey bucked Biden to protect fracking” and “sided with Trump” on trade and tariffs. Republicans say Casey’s ad showing Trump is similar to a TV ad that Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin is airing and speaks to both Democrats’ need to protect themselves against Harris’ vulnerability in their states. “They’re hoping to peel off enough Trump voters to win,” Sinclair said. Still, Casey ran a similar ad in 2018′s midterm election when he won easily — even though that ad didn’t mention Trump — while Casey’s campaign notes that he has long split with Democrats by opposing free trade agreements and supporting fossil fuel-power projects. Democrats, conversely, say they are forcing competitive contests late in the campaign in two red states, Texas and Nebraska. Ousting incumbent Republicans from one or both of those seats could help Democrats to at least a 50-50 split in the Senate should Democrats lose in Montana or Ohio. In Texas, U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, a former professional football player, has proven adept at raising small-dollar donations in his challenge to incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. Allred has outraised every Senate candidate nationally, except Tester and Brown. The ad spending advantage for Allred has been 3-to-2, according to AdImpact, with the Democratic-aligned Senate Majority PAC touting a new seven-figure digital ad buy and a separate $5 million TV ad buy attacking Cruz on a key issue for Democrats, abortion rights. On top of that, Democrats hope Harris’ rally in Houston on Friday with Allred and Beyoncé can help Allred by boosting Black voter turnout. In Nebraska, independent Dan Osborn — a tattooed former labor leader who supports abortion rights — appears to have consolidated Democratic and independent voters while making some inroads with Republicans, Democratic strategists say. While Osborn is running as an independent and hasn’t said which party he’d caucus with, he’s getting support from a liberal super PAC that has helped him amass a significant spending advantage over Republican Sen. Deb Fischer. In both states, Republicans acknowledge that they’ve had to spend money unexpectedly to shore up their incumbents’ prospects, but they also say they expect to win comfortably. In Ohio, Brown has tried to personalize his appeal by appearing in most of his own ads and speaking directly into the camera. “I’m Sherrod Brown and I have a question,” Brown says, looking into the camera and leaning his elbow on what might be a wood-working shop table. “Have you ever heard Bernie Moreno talk about what he’s going to do for Ohio?” Brown also makes a personal appeal to potential swing voters, saying he has spent his career fighting for workers and veterans and working with law enforcement and “presidents of both parties to do what’s best for our state.” Elsewhere, strategists expect first-term Florida Sen. Rick Scott will fend off a challenge from Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and that Democrat Angela Alsobrooks in deep-blue Maryland will beat former Gov. Larry Hogan to fill a seat being vacated by Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin. The next four years will change America forever.

Heidi Klum’s 2024 Halloween costume is... E.T.! The supermodel, known for her impressively intricate Halloween getups, paid homage this year to the iconic title character from Steven Spielberg’s 1982 film “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.” While she’s been doing extravagant costumes for years — see the giant worm of 2022 — she apparently had to do something this time around that she’s never done before: wear an adult diaper. “Maybe I never need to use the diaper, but at least that way I don’t have to think about it,” Klum said, according to The New York Times, explaining that it’s hard to get in and out of the look. Klum hosts a big Halloween bash in New York City every year. This year’s event was at the Hard Rock Hotel. She told People magazine at the event that she chose the alien because it’s been “part of most of our lives” and she’s always been a big fan of the character. Her husband, Tom Kaulitz, dressed up as E.T. with her. They started getting ready at 11 a.m., Klum said.

Byron Donalds Over Trump's Women Comment","ben blanchet","2024-11-01","CNN host John Berman sparred with Rep. Byron Donalds (Fla.) as the Republican failed to address questions on Thursday following Donald Trump’s pledge to protect women “whether the women like it or not.” Berman hit back at Donalds after he claimed that CNN played a clip lacking “context” from Trump, who used a Wisconsin rally this week to attack immigrants just before expressing his desire to protect women. “His advisers were telling him not to use that type of language and say, ‘I am going to be your protector.’ And that is the context in that speech,” Berman noted. “John, you need to stop,” Donalds said. “No, no, no! That was what he was doing. And then he said ... ‘I’m going to protect them, the women, whether they like it or not,’” continued Berman, who added that Trump’s advisers “clearly knew” that his language about women was an issue. He then turned to a clip of Nikki Haley who, prior to Trump’s remarks on protecting women, criticized the campaign for pushing “bromance” and “masculinity stuff” and warned that it would alienate his female supporters. “So, you’re telling me there’s no concern from Nikki Haley or clearly, as Donald Trump said, from people close to him, his campaign, about the type of language he’s using?” Berman asked. Donalds didn’t answer the question and accused CNN of “selective editing.” After more contentious back and forth, Berman played a longer clip, but still, Donalds spun it. “If you don’t want to answer my question, can you address Nikki Haley’s comments then?” Berman said. “John, Nikki Haley’s comments are irrelevant at this point,” Donalds interjected. “OK, you think Nikki Haley’s comments are irrelevant? That’s your answer? That’s your answer to Nikki Haley, then, that Nikki Haley is irrelevant?” Berman replied. You can check out more from the tense CNN interview below.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/harris-haley-trump-voters_n_67240596e4b0871068feb2ef","Harris Courts The 250,000 Voters Who Rejected Trump In North Carolina Primary","s.v. date","2024-11-01","APEX, N.C. — Georgia’s former lieutenant governor Geoff Duncan likes to talk about a “whisper caucus” of fellow Republicans who tell him quietly that they, like him, plan to vote for Kamala Harris next week. John Robertson might just be a solid member. He doesn’t like to talk about politics with friends and neighbors to avoid arguments. He has voted for Republicans in the past. And he is absolutely done with Donald Trump. Robertson was among the 36,358 voters in Wake County who backed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in North Carolina’s presidential primary. Eight months later, he is supporting the Democratic vice president over the coup-attempting former president. “The Republican Party is not what it used to be. It’s not my father’s Republican Party,” Robertson said as he stood in the early voting line Thursday at the John Brown Community Center. “It’s no longer Republican.” Brittany Samuel, a 38-year-old nurse, was another Haley-Harris voter in line to cast her ballot. “He’s a criminal,” she said about Trump, whom she voted for in 2016 but not in 2020. “And I just don’t feel that a criminal should be running our country.” Samuel and Robertson were willing to talk about their decision to vote for Harris. Many others, North Carolina “Republicans for Harris” leaders said, would just as soon keep their choice to themselves. At a news conference earlier Thursday in downtown Raleigh, Duncan appeared with former Republican Reps. Joe Walsh and Susan Molinaro, and former Trump White House national security aide Olivia Troye to urge Republicans who similarly did not want Trump to regain the presidency to join them in voting for Harris. “We know it’s going to be close,” Duncan said. “We know it’s going to come down to just a handful of votes, and we know exactly where those handful of votes are going to come from. And this is certainly one of those areas.” Duncan added that, given all the Republicans who approach him to tell him that they agree with what he says about Trump but that they will only express that view at the ballot box, he is optimistic that Harris will win. “I think the whisper caucus is going to show up in epic proportion on Tuesday,” he said. As the last candidate standing against Trump in the GOP presidential primaries, Haley became the vessel for opposition to Trump within the Republican Party — even after it was clear she had a nearly impossible path, following her loss in both the New Hampshire primary in January, then in her home state of South Carolina a month later. By the end of the primaries in June, she had won 4.4 million votes, 20% of those cast. Of those, 1.2 million were in the seven states that will likely decide the November election, which has made the voters who cast them a key focus of the “Republicans for Harris” effort. North Carolinians cast 250,838 votes for Haley in the March 5 primary, just under a quarter of all votes cast on the Republican side that day. It was the second-biggest anti-Trump turnout in the primaries among the seven swing states, with only Michigan registering higher. “Republicans for Harris” officials believe that if she can win over three out of 10 of those quarter-million Haley voters, that would provide Harris the margin she would need to win in that state. In North Carolina on Wednesday, Harris had one of those Haley voters introduce her at a rally — a public affirmation of how important her campaign believes anti-Trump Republicans are to assembling a winning coalition. Jennifer Bell said she voted for Trump in 2016 because she was a Republican and Republicans voted for their candidate in presidential elections. She said she quickly came to regret that choice. “Any Haley voters for Harris?” Bell asked from the stage before a crowd of 8,000. “Conservatives for Harris? Yes, we’re all a family now.” Bell, a 49-year-old engineer, told HuffPost later that she is appalled by what has happened to the party she grew up in. “The Republicans used to the party of intellect, the party of business savvy. That’s all gone,” she said, adding that she makes a point to wear her “Republicans for Harris-Walz” T-shirt whenever she goes outside to spread the word. “If you don’t want to see Trump elected, you have to vote for Harris. ... Hopefully there was a conservative Republican out there in the crowd that maybe I got to change their mind.” The overwhelming majority of those who attended Harris’ rally at an open-air amphitheater on the outskirts of Raleigh were longtime Democrats. They said they were glad their candidate was reaching out to the other party. “I think it’s a fabulous idea,” said Jill Bliss, who is 70 and a retired public school librarian. Her husband, Bill Bliss, 72, and a retired advertising executive, said he couldn’t understand some Democrats’ anger about Harris welcoming the endorsements of former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Wyoming congresswoman Liz Cheney ― both conservative Republicans. “When Democrats said, ‘No, you can’t forgive him, kick him out’ — I don’t think that’s the right way to do it,” he said. In 2016, the Trump campaign said they had determined the existence of “shy” Trump voters, those who would not tell friends or family or pollsters of their intention to vote for him to avoid criticism. Eight years later, it is Harris supporters who think — and hope — that there are in pro-Trump areas shy Harris voters, people who are fed up with the former president but would prefer to keep that view a secret. “I equate it to the 2016 stealth Trump vote, which nobody predicted,” said Robert Orr, a former justice on the North Carolina Supreme Court and a “Republicans for Harris” co-chair in the state. “I think in 2024, it’s a stealth vote for Harris.” A Christian group backing Harris, in fact, has created an ad targeting a subcategory of that group, women whose pro-Trump husbands expect them to vote MAGA, too. In the ad, narrated by actress Julia Roberts, two women catch each other’s eyes in the polling place and, out of view of their husbands, smile and cast ballots for Harris. Former first lady Michelle Obama at a rally last week in Michigan made that same point. “If you are a woman who lives in a household of men that don’t listen to you or value your opinion, just remember that your vote is a private matter,” she said. “Regardless of the political views of your partner, you get to choose.” It was a message repeated by Liz Cheney on Sunday in an interview with CBS. “I think you’re going to have, frankly, a lot of men and women who will go into the voting booth and will vote their conscience and will vote for Vice President Harris,” she said. “They may not ever say anything publicly but the results will speak for themselves.” Of course, not every Haley voter will be persuaded. Shiva Gangu said he voted for Haley in March in large part because he thought Trump’s various criminal cases — he was found guilty by a jury in May of a felony and continues to face dozens of other felony charges for his Jan. 6 coup attempt — would be his undoing. “Trump was going through what he was going through,” said Gangu, 48, as the early voting line inched toward the door.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-mass-deportation-promise_n_6723d828e4b01f6919d97998","Donald Trump's Mass Deportation Plans Would Ensnare U.S. Citizens And Tear The Country Apart","paul blumenthal","2024-11-01","Former President Donald Trump’s most significant policy plank in his third presidential campaign is to implement a system of mass deportation to remove up to 20 million noncitizens from the United States, a plan that apparently aims to not only remove people living here illegally but also to chase away ― or accidentally round up ― U.S. citizens as well. He is promising to deploy the military and deputize local police officers to round up millions of people, detain them in makeshift camps and then ship them off to other countries ― whether or not the destination is the person’s country of origin. This plan is billed as targeting only those who have come to the country or reside in it illegally, with a special emphasis on supposed migrant gang members. It offers a story of those who deserve to be here and those who don’t. Those who are part of the national community and those who exist outside its bounds and, perhaps, its laws. But 79% of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. have been living and participating in American communities for more than 15 years. They have married U.S. citizens, hold jobs that prop up their local and national economies and have children and grandchildren who are citizens. Ripping these people out of the country and away from their families will ripple through every community in the country. “Communities are like a fabric ― the way that the threads are interwoven,” said Heidi Altman, federal advocacy director for the National Immigration Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Fund, an immigrant rights nonprofit. “If you snip at one, eventually the whole of the fabric comes loose.” This plan to tear communities apart will also ensnare U.S. citizens, green card holders and others here legally, either by accident or with intent. Trump and his advisers are already saying that’s what they’ll do. Tom Homan, Trump’s former acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was asked in a “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday whether there is a way that Trump’s mass deportation plan could remove undocumented people without separating them from their families. “Of course there is,” Homan said. “Families can be deported together.” What Homan is saying, without saying it directly, is that mixed-status families, with some family members who are U.S. citizens and others who lack legal status, can choose to self-deport if they wish to remain together. There are currently 4.7 million mixed-status households in the U.S., according to the Center for Migration Studies. Among those households are 5.5 million U.S.-born children living with one undocumented household member and 1.8 million U.S.-born children living with two undocumented adults. In total, there are 9.7 million Americans who live in households with at least one undocumented resident. Trump and Homan propose an impossible choice: your citizenship and your home or your family. Similar mass deportations and detentions in the country’s history have done the same. The incarceration of Japanese immigrants and Japanese-Americans during and after World War II ensnared citizens and noncitizens alike. So, too, did the imprisonment of Germans, Italians and people born under the Austro-Hungarian Empire during both world wars. Trump’s inspiration for his mass deportation program, President Dwight Eisenhower’s Operation Wetback, similarly resulted in the deportation of significant numbers of U.S. citizens to Mexico. But none of those programs was of the scale or scope that Trump imagines. There are an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., according to the 2022 American Community Survey. Other surveys and estimates have found similar numbers. But Trump and his allies talk about deporting 20 million to 30 million people. There is no source for such a number. That would invariably mean targeting people with some kind of legal status, whether temporary or permanent. “They seem to be gleefully suggesting that they would include people here with some legal status in these roundups,” said Matthew Lisieki, a senior research and policy analyst at the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank that focuses on global migration. A deportation program that removes 11 million people or even more than 20 million would affect every single community in the country, invariably sweeping up even larger numbers of U.S. citizens and legal residents, taking them away from their families and putting them into jails, incarceration camps and, potentially, off to another country. As Homan’s answer on “60 Minutes” indicates, that’s a feature, not a bug. Trump has already proposed invoking laws that could be used to sweep up unnaturalized U.S. residents who have legal status. The Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which Trump says he will use, allows the president to effectively suspend due process for anyone of a particular nationality or national origin when the U.S. is at war or is invaded by that nation. Invoking this law may prove challenging since the U.S. is not currently in a declared war, much less one against any of the Latin American countries that represent the point of origin for most undocumented immigrants in the U.S. And though Trump claims that the migration of people into the country amounts to an “invasion,” federal courts since the 1990s have largely rejected efforts by states claiming that the word “invasion” in the U.S. Constitution should be interpreted to include the voluntary migration of people across borders. Still, it is possible that the courts today would take a different approach and declare that the president’s invocation of an invasion by immigrants is a “political question” that the judicial branch will not interfere with. That could give Trump a free hand to implement a brutal and sweeping deportation program. “There are no explicit limitations on what kinds of regulations the president can promulgate under the law,” said Katherine Yon Ebright, a counsel at the progressive Brennan Center for Justice and author of a paper on the Alien Enemies Act. The law has been invoked three times during conflicts with actual foreign nations: during the War of 1812 and both world wars. In each conflict, the president has not only directed deportations and detentions but also promulgated restrictions on noncitizens who had come from the foreign belligerents. During the War of 1812, noncitizens of British descent were banned from living along the East Coast and were forced to move inland. Those of German and Austro-Hungarian descent were banned from living in or entering Washington, D.C., during World War I. And during both World War I and World War II, noncitizens of Japanese, German and Italian descent were subject to extreme levels of surveillance, including the opening of their mail. These are just some of the things that the Alien Enemies Act would seemingly allow a president to direct the executive branch to do ― without due process and without discrimination of legal status. The law’s focus on nationality and countries of origin also makes its application prone to sweeping up U.S. citizens and permanent residents based on their heritage or race. “The Alien Enemies Act is not concerned with the legal status of an unnaturalized immigrant,” Yon Ebright said. The invocation of the law would mean “anyone who isn’t a U.S. citizen would be vulnerable to an abuse of this law,” she added. But, as history shows, it wouldn’t spare U.S. citizens. “What we’ve seen historically when the Alien Enemies Act is invoked is U.S. citizens accidentally, and also incidentally, getting swept up into internment or expulsion,” Yon Ebright said. “It creates this risk that if you are of the ethnicity that’s being targeted and the government is moving quickly, it could mistake you for someone who isn’t naturalized, and they could try to deport you based on that mistake.” This gets at another major reason why Trump’s mass deportation plan would ensnare permanent and temporary legal residents and U.S. citizens. And that is how the government knows who has legal status and who does not. “Generally speaking, it’s very difficult and very hard to identify who’s in the country legally or not,” said Adriel Orozco, senior policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, an immigrant rights nonprofit. The most common way status is currently identified is through the use of inter-operable local and federal law enforcement databases that collect information on people who have had some contact with government agencies. This can occur through being arrested, paying tickets or other legal interactions with government offices where legal status is indicated. Local law enforcement shares arrest and interaction data with federal agencies, which can then identify the legal status of individuals who have had encounters with government agencies or police officers. There are significant problems with relying on these databases, particularly at the scale and speed Trump talks about. “What we already know from many years of having seen ICE utilize those databases is that there are often errors,” Altman said. They are “prone to racial profiling” and “other unconstitutional police practices” without any “effective safeguards or checks put in place,” according to Altman. “We already know that to be a fairly chaotic system of enforcement that ICE utilizes today that could be supercharged,” Altman added. Already, these databases produce false positives that lead to arrests, detentions and deportation proceedings. False positives arise when two or more people have the same name, and possibly the same birthdate, or if a person who once was entered into a database as undocumented has since obtained legal status or become naturalized. A federal judge in California ruled in the 2019 case Gonzalez v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that the databases ICE uses to detain people ahead of deportation proceedings were so riddled with errors that they could not be used without violating the Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizure. “Errors in the databases ICE reviews to make its probable cause determinations for removal have, on multiple occasions, led to arrests of U.S. citizens and lawfully-present non-citizens,” the judge’s decision states. The decision shows that the use of these databases led to ICE issuing orders to detain 771 U.S. citizens from May 2015 to February 2016. Many of the errors resulted from sloppy recordkeeping by local law enforcement officers and the failure to keep federal databases updated. This failure to update databases or check them against databases that do have updated legal status information is why multiple Republican secretaries of state purged the voter registrations of thousands of actual U.S. citizens when they claimed to be removing noncitizens from the rolls. Similarly, when a parent is naturalized, their minor children also gain legal status, but those children may not have any documentary proof of this status. This has already led to people being improperly detained for extended periods as they face great challenges to prove their citizenship. For example, Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen claimed in August he removed 3,200 noncitizens from the rolls who had illegally registered to vote, but a court found more than 2,000 of those registrations belonged to U.S. citizens. Similar problems have been found in Ohio, Texas and Virginia. Databases of gang members that are maintained by local law enforcement pose even greater problems for identifying undocumented residents. These databases are notoriously inaccurate, with people put on them for wearing particular hats or colored clothes, appearing in photographs or hanging out with gang members, living in particular neighborhoods, being of a particular race or even being assaulted by gang members. When Trump was in office, immigration officials ramped up the use of these inaccurate gang databases to identify and deport undocumented residents. Considering Trump has falsely claimed in his campaign speeches that “migrant gangs” have “conquered” entire cities, such an effort would likely be radically scaled up. This could lead to removal of people with legal status as well as those who don’t. Residents who have legal status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program ― so-called Dreamers who were brought across the border by their parents as children ― have been incorrectly identified as gang members by local police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That would be one way to strip them of their legal status. Trump’s top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, has promised to “turbocharge” efforts at denaturalizing U.S. citizens. When in office, Trump ramped up denaturalization efforts with one Homeland Security budget document proposing up to 700,000 investigations into naturalized U.S. citizens. Civil denaturalization can be done to people who obtained their legal status illegally or are the child of someone who did so, who deliberately lied about a fact in their application for citizenship, obtained citizenship through military service but was then dishonorably discharged or by becoming a member of a subversive group. This last reason could implicate U.S. citizens incorrectly placed on gang databases or otherwise identified as gang-affiliated by law enforcement. Databases can only be used to identify the legal status of residents who have had interactions with law enforcement or certain government agencies. If Trump intends to ramp up deportations to the level he claims, his efforts would need to target workplaces and neighborhoods. This would, invariably, involve racial profiling by placing checkpoints or performing sweeps in heavily Latino neighborhoods or worksites. Such sweeps would undoubtedly ensnare U.S. citizens and inflict fear in everyone ― citizens and noncitizens alike ― within these communities. The economic and social costs of these plans would be dramatic and touch all Americans. Nearly 5 million families would be torn apart or forced to self-deport with their loved ones, leaving behind the communities they share and participate in with citizens and noncitizens alike. The remaining households would see a 48% drop in income, with many falling into poverty, affecting the larger community around them. A substantial percentage of the 1.5 million mixed-status households with a mortgage would be forced into default, which would prove a shock to the broader housing market. “We are seeing at the raising children level and at the overall median household income level that this program would have economically devastating impacts, in addition to the moral and social devastation of kids losing families, siblings losing siblings, and parents losing other members of their support system,” Lisieki said. This would all ripple out into local economies as businesses that the targeted residents operate would shutter and as positions in the essential jobs that 74% of undocumented immigrants hold ― in sectors such as health care, construction and agriculture ― would be left vacant amid what is already a shortage of labor in the country. And the loss of jobs in these critical sectors would explode inflation for things like housing and food as the industries would lose swaths of their workforces. Federal, state and local governments would lose nearly $100 billion in tax revenue that had been paid by undocumented workers. The economic effects are just one element of removing large numbers of people who have been living in the country for years, if not decades. There is a social dynamic that is often left unsaid. The mass deportation of millions of people would create a domestic enforcement regime never seen before in the United States. Deportation camps and processing facilities would appear across the country. As happened during Trump’s first term, when ICE conducted raids, fear would spread through communities, with children afraid to go to school and parents afraid to go to work ― whether or not they are here legally. This would severely affect the mental health of children, which could lead to drug and alcohol abuse and suicidal ideation. It will inevitably be marred with violations of due process and human rights and almost certainly with violence. This is what Trump is promising, after all: “Getting them out will be a bloody story.”",-0.105751241449115,0.236074750165864

The box is also biocote-protected to reduce odors and stains. You can get it in three colors. Promising review: ""This bento box has made taking lunch to work an all new pleasure. It is manufactured of top quality materials, fits a sizable amount of food, is easy to assemble and very easy to clean when I return home. I have enjoyed it so much, that I plan on buying many more for Christmas gifts."" — DavidP We're getting down to the wire with advent calendars by now, but Amazon Prime users can still get this one in time for December 1 if you order it ASAP (like, right now). And while this is technically more of an early holiday gift, this set is so popular with HuffPost readers we couldn't resist including it. This National Geographic gemstone advent calendar for children was a breakout bestseller on Prime Day in October — interactive and educational, it lets kids discover new gemstones each of the 24 days, with the grand finale of excavating their final stone themselves out of a dig brick. The stones come with a collector's pouch to keep them safe, plus five jewelry settings so they can wear their gems around afterward. Games are a fun stocking stuffer, but if you're shopping for someone who already has the classics like Cards Against Humanity, then this Where On The Scale? game is a fun option. Players have to guess where each other's answers rank on a scale between extremes. There's also a separate ""adults only"" pack of cards, so players can add those to the mix when they want or leave them out when playing with kids or the whole family. Promising review: ""I love this game because it’s a great way to get to know the other players and their thought processes. I played with my entire family and we laughed a LOT. There’s also an adult version in the game, which can get really hysterical. Highly recommend!"" — Hope This wallet can appeal to people of all genders with its simple, timeless herringbone pattern and leather patch, which features the iconic Boston Scally logo. At 4-by-3 inches, it's the perfect size for your recipient to tuck into a pocket or toss in their bag. The wallet has four card slots and an opening on the top to hold cash. Skin care can be a great gift for those that love to buy and use beauty products, but a lot of skin care products can be on the pricy side. These under-eye pads by Azure Cosmetics are an affordable stocking stuffer that will still let your gift recipient nourish and moisturize their dry winter skin. You can choose from a range of under-eye pad ingredients, including gold, retinol and the vitamin C and collagen version pictured here, depending on what you think your recipient might prefer. Promising review: ""Love these eye patches have used and shared with my sisters. See instant visible difference after using them. I use them daily in my routine to keep my eyes looking refreshed and fine lines are more diminished. I’m 57 my sister 60 and 62. We love them"" — Leigh Gilchrist A pen may seem like a boring gift at first glance, but this is no ordinary pen. In addition to the regular ballpoint pen function, you could be gifting your recipient a screwdriver, ruler, bottle opener, phone stylus, LED flashlight, level and more in this nine-in-one tool. This is a great gift for the practical-minded person in your life, and could make an especially nice stocking stuffer for the man you don't know what to buy for. It comes in three colors. Promising review: ""Husband has really been loving this! Super useful. I also find myself reaching for it 😂 I recently made a gallery wall & the leveler option was super helpful."" — Amazon Customer Personally, I've always thought of bidets as a luxury limited to fancy hotels (at least in the United States), but it turns out you can get an attachment to use at home, like this Neo 110 from Luxe Bidet which is under $30. And while you might think a toilet attachment is an odd gift choice, multiple reviewers can attest to buying the attachment for others or receiving it as a gift and liking the bidet experience so much they bought several more. The bidet has a water pressure control knob and comes with all the things your recipient will need to easily install the attachment. Promising review: ""I love my luxe bidet, I love it so much I've bought 5 of them! I use two myself and have given 3 others as gifts. They are super easy to install, and are amazing at cleaning. I can't live without one anymore."" — Sam If you're shopping for someone who prefers an organized space at their bedside or in their office, this nightstand or desk organizer may come in handy. Available in four colors, the wooden organizer features — among other things — a U-shaped charging port for their phone, a watch holder, key holder, jewelry holder and a couple different tray areas where they can store their wallet, car keys, AirPods and so much more. Available in three colors, this velvet travel jewelry box has two larger compartments, six slot rolls and one elastic pocket on the underside of the lid. The box's measurements are less than 2-by-4 inches, so it can easily fit inside a suitcase or carry-on. The organizer zips shut with gold hardware for both security and elegance. These aromatherapy shower steamer cubes dissolve in water and release the scents of essential oils for a shower experience that's just a little more luxurious. You can choose between calming scents, like lavender and eucalyptus, or earthier ones, like pine and cedar orange. The steamers can also be used as exfoliating body scrubs. Promising review: ""I sent these to my best friend for Valentine's/Galentine's Day (who Now lives several states away) as a way to give her a little calm, rest, and relaxation - a little break from her busy life as an advertising exec, wife and mom of two little boys. She was delighted and said the shower steamers are just lovely! She told me, ""if I close my eyes, it almost felt like a moment at the spa…almost"" ;)"" — Jules A surprise bestseller among our gift guides last year, this electric lighter is lightweight and portable with a thoughtful, safe design to prevent accidents. It's flameless, wind- and splash-proof so you can use it even in bad weather. This lighter is rechargeable with a type-C USB cord, which is included with your purchase, and displays the battery life with LED lights. This is perfect for the outdoorsy person on your list, someone who loves to light candles (you can even bundle this with a candle for an extra-thoughtful gift — we have one option included later in this list) or anyone who can appreciate a practical purchase. It comes in six colors so you can gift one that suits their decor or personality in general. Burt's Bees is responsible for some of our favorite drugstore lip balms, and we're willing to bet that this assortment of 12 flavors will delight a fellow fan. Each one contains the brand's signature blend of responsibly sourced beeswax and fruit extracts, and the options you'll find inside include shortbread cookie, vanilla bean and salted caramel. This calendar also ships with Amazon Prime, so you can still get it in time as long as you don't wait to place your order! A 4.4-star average rating with 271,000 reviews? Say less. These mega-popular Tozo earbuds offer 10 hours of continuous playtime from a single charge, are compatible with wireless charging and have high stereo sound quality. They're also waterproof and extremely durable, with reviewers sharing stories about accidentally putting them in the washing machine and finding that they still work perfectly. You can get them in six colors. Make sure you clip the 10% off coupon to get an extra discount applied at checkout. Promising review: ""I recently lost my old pair of these and I immediately went on to buy another set. These are my go-to every day wireless earbuds for my bus commute (and everything else I need headphones for). For context, I have very small ears and almost none of the ""airpod style"" headphones will stay in. I hate the real apple airpods, they constantly fall out and really hurt my ears because they are too big. I have tried a few other brands, returning all of them to amazon within 5 minutes of trying them on, before I tried these. they are so comfortable, very small, and stay in my very small ears faithfully without any issue. sound quality is excellent, bass is good, and noise cancelling is great. the battery life is great and lasts me at least a few days of heavy use (3-6 hours daily) between case charges. If I happen to lose the pair I currently have, I will be buying another."" — Cosmicray817 This remote-controlled oil diffuser is also a humidifier, meaning it can provide both relaxing aromatherapy and relief for dry winter air. The tank can hold up to 500 milliliters of water and the fan operates at less than 23 decibels, so no sleep needs to be sacrificed while it's in use. The machine can also cycle through seven different LED lights, can be set to a timer or left on the steady ""on"" mode and has an auto-switch-off feature to prevent overheating. For the aromatherapy aspect, reviewers say you only need a few drops of essential oils to be able to smell them. Promising review: ""I love this brand. I have re-ordered it several times as gifts as well as to use for additional rooms. It allows you to choose your color, which helps with the ambiance of that particular room. I love the little remote so that I can turn the lights off, or turn it completely off once I’m ready to go to sleep, without having to get out of bed. It also has a feature of small/big waves, which allows for very fast amazing scent in a room in a matter of a minute. The cleaning is really easy too, with a few a-tips and vinegar it’s back to brand new state. I clean mine once every 2-3 weeks with some water and a little vinegar as the orange or bergamot essential oil will stain the sides and bottom after a while."" — Andrea A candle is a simple crowd pleaser that won't break the bank. This scent from Yankee Candle — which has notes of cinnamon and other baking spices — is holiday-appropriate but versatile enough that your gift recipient can light it year-round. The 22-ounce jar the candle comes in is reusable, though there's plenty of burn time to get through before that point (110 to 150 hours, to be exact). Promising review: ""I've been a fan of Yankee candles from the very first time I purchased the Home Sweet Home scent over 15 years ago for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season and it has become a yearly tradition for me to purchase them for me and give as gifts. The scent fills my house when lit and even more impressive is the fragrance in my sitting area when it's not lit. I've never had a candle more potent and long-lasting so I can say enough about this being my number one choice for aroma therapy."" — D. Rose This trio set of Jack Black lip balms includes three different flavors (shea butter, natural mint and pineapple mint). These lip balms are also wildly popular for their moisturizing abilities, with a 4.7-star average rating across more than 23,000 reviews, so you know you're in good hands. Many fancier lip balms tend to be marketed toward feminine customers with their packaging and flavors, but everyone can use a remedy for chapped lips, so this is a more unisex option that's still nicer than your average three-pack of Chapstick or Blistex. Promising review: ""A lot of people have already said this, but this seriously is the BEST lip balm I've ever tried. I don't breathe well through my nose so my mouth compensates so I have chronicly chapped lips that over the past year started peeling and scarring. After a day of using this I noticed a difference, my lips look much smoother and plumper and generally less disgusting. If I forget to reapply after eating my lips do shortly go back to peeling, so I'm not out of the woods yet, but as long as I remember, things are looking good! I'm also pleased that I can put this on before bed and wake up with my lips STILL moisturized. Fantastic. I'm sure I'll buy like 800 more of these, for myself and for gifts for pretty much anyone with lips."" — Nichole Wilson If you're shopping for someone who's on team iced coffee, not hot, the HyperChiller HC2 beverage chiller may be of use to them. While it doesn't necessarily keep drinks cold long-term, it can chill them so they're especially refreshing. This chiller is great for folks who want iced coffee quickly, but have a coffee machine that only makes it hot. You can also use it to quickly chill wine, tea or other beverages without ice. Just fill the HyperChiller with water, store it in the freezer, and when you're ready to use it, pour in your desired drink and swirl the liquid around for 60 seconds. Pour your drink into a cup and voila — you now have a cold drink ready for its first sip. Promising review: ""I LOVE this thing. I bought a second one for my mom as a birthday gift and she is also obsessed. I am an iced coffee year round kind of gal and the option to cool down my coffee before I add milk and ice is a game changer. We also use it for London fogs. For once, I actually knew what to get my mom for her birthday and she talks about how great it is all the time. No more quickly diluting beverages from mixing hot drinks with ice!"" — Tay V A great stocking stuffer for the gardener in your life, the gloves in this three-pack come in three colors and are coated with durable polyurethane. They're breathable but still abrasion-resistant, have knit wrists to keep them from sliding down your hands and are even ergonomically designed with hand fatigue in mind. For loved ones who spend a lot of time going to live sports, concerts, airports, or other noisy areas, give them the gift of protecting their hearing with these Vibes earplugs. They're not noise-canceling — instead, the earplugs filter out noise using filter-specific frequencies to keep your ears protected in noisy places without compromising your ability to hear what's going on. They come with a portable carrying case and three silicone ear tip sizes, so your recipient can find the one that works best for them. They're available in four colors, and thanks to early Black Friday deals, all four are under $30 for a limited time. Promising review: ""The compact case that comes with the ear plugs is so convenient I take them with me all the time. They are comfortable and effective in filtering out distorted, loud levels of noise. I wear them at concerts, movies, in restaurants when other voices are too loud, at sporting events in noisy arenas, and on airplanes they filter out the humming sound of the engines. I have given them as gifts and the recipients are so grateful to have them."" — Amazon Customer Those who work from home might be familiar with the concept of making coffee or tea to start your day, getting distracted by work, and going to sip your hot drink that... isn't so hot anymore. This deskside mug warmer solves that problem, keeping hot drinks at a palatable temperature of 120 to 140 degrees. It turns off and back on automatically when you lift the mug and set it down again, so you don't have to remember to shut the warmer off once you're done with your drink. For best results, use it with a flat-bottomed mug (if your gift recipient doesn't already have one, you can even buy the warmer with a mug of its own). Dry hands and lips abound during the winter, so what better gift than some hand and lip care? This Malin + Goetz gift set comes in a box you can hang like an ornament from the tree, and contains a full-size hand cream and full-size lip balm. Both are meant to nourish and replenish dry, cracked skin, and are a great gift for recipients of any gender. The hand cream has a bergamot scent and the lip balm is mojito-scented, for a unique and fun twist. Introduce your recipient to the fun of crocheting with this beginner-friendly kit by The Woobles, which makes a cute little penguin. The kit comes with everything needed to get started, from yarn to a crochet hook to a step-by-step tutorial with videos for both right- and left-handed newbies. (Amazon's price for this is usually a little over our threshold, but early Black Friday deals have dropped it to below $30, so shop it while the sale lasts.) How gorgeous is this Himalayan salt lamp? No two are exactly the same size, shape or color because they are hand-carved, which only makes opening this gift more exciting. This lamp comes with a dimmer switch to control the amount of light, and has a wooden base. You may have heard people claim that Himalayan salt lamps have health benefits before. While there's little evidence ot support this, there's no denying that salt lamps can still be a beautiful aesthetic addition to a home, and their soft glow can provide a nice, calm ambiance. If you're buying a gift for someone who travels a lot, or is always losing their keys, wallet or other important items — hey, no judgment here — an Apple AirTag is one of the easiest solutions for Apple product users. It connects with an iPhone or iPad with just one tap, so your gift recipient will always know where the item they've attached it to is. When you're looking for something, you can also ""ping"" the AirTag so it plays a sound and helps you track it down. This is useful for luggage, keys, wallets, cars, pets and more, as thousands of reviews can attest to.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/daughters-harbin-hot-springs_l_672142c2e4b0b049cc425288","I Take My Young Daughters To A Clothing-Optional Hot Spring Every Year. Here's Why.","jess d. taylor","2024-11-01","The first time I took my daughters to a clothing-optional hot spring, my youngest, who was 6, opted to wear her swimsuit — for about 10 minutes. Once she jumped into the sparkling blue pool surrounded by other naked people of all ages and shapes, she whipped her suit off, tossed it onto the deck, and exclaimed, “I’m naked!” Several gleeful echos floated across the water: “Me too!” The pure freedom and elation she felt while skinny-dipping for the first time is part of the reason I keep bringing my two daughters, who are now 12 and 8, on this annual retreat to Harbin Hot Springs in Lake County, California. We always go with dear friends, another mom and her two daughters, similarly aged. Given that it’s only an hour from where I live, I’ve been visiting this place for two decades. My daughters get comfortable with the nakedness right away, perhaps because there are so many kinds of naked people: young kids like them, trans people, middle-aged folks like me, gay couples and plenty of older folks, some of whom have been making the pilgrimage since they were young. Seeing so many kinds of normal naked bodies reminds me of how brilliant writer and activist Lindy West’s quest for body acceptance involved looking at pictures of other fat women on the internet until they ceased to make her uncomfortable. An oasis nestled on a hill with wide decks overlooking rolling treetops, Harbin Hot Springs has been a spiritual retreat center since the ’70s; the vibe is peaceful and buoyant. Stripped also of technology (no cell phones allowed), people mill about on towels and benches, snacking, doing yoga, chatting softly, reading books and slipping in and out of the warm mineral water of the heart-shaped pool, one of two pools where children are allowed. There’s an air of presence and reverence that the kids eventually sink into. The experience is all about pleasure, and I want my daughters to know that all bodies, regardless of size, age, gender, skin tone, disabling conditions or prevalence of cellulite, are deserving of pleasure and capable of experiencing pleasure. Youth and beauty do not have a monopoly on enjoying hot soaks and cold plunges, on doing rhythmic laps or floating peacefully, on drying off naked in warm sunshine. It’s also a great opportunity for my daughters to feel an embodied sense of what grownups mean when they talk about “safe spaces.” I appreciate that Harbin’s policy is that parents must remain with their children at all times, in and out of the pools. Thus far, we have not encountered anything threatening or inappropriate, but still, I am hyper-attuned to the people around us, knowing that predators can be found anywhere (even in the most sacred spaces, as the Catholic Church has made horrifyingly clear). Kids are only allowed in two out of the seven total pools, which creates a welcome separateness for those adults who’d rather not be exposed to the occasional rowdiness of children. “I want my daughters to know that all bodies, regardless of size, age, gender, skin tone, disabling conditions or prevalence of cellulite, are deserving of pleasure and capable of experiencing pleasure.” My kids and their friends swiftly forget their own nakedness and are remarkably unselfconscious in this space — the opposite of how I felt as a kid, when certain adults in my life thought that scrutinizing my body was their right. Pinching my stomach, my dad would remark, “That’s where the brownies go.” When I discovered Harbin in my 20s, I was emerging from the normalized fat-shaming of my ’80s childhood, having overcorrected (as so many do) by forcing my body to become leaner than was sustainable. I reflexively compared myself to every female I saw: thinner, fatter, more toned, saggier, on and on. Like so many women, I’d been taught to turn the scrutiny I’d received onto others, with the harshest criticism always reserved for myself. Now that I’m in my 40s, the pressure on women has expanded to include relentless optimization. I appreciate that strong is the new skinny, and yet I also find myself alternately elated and exhausted by the constant chatter about weight training, protein, creatine and perimenopause. Lately, I feel drawn to body neutrality — what if a body is just a body, a vessel for experiencing the world, not to be necessarily loved or hated? As part of my own body acceptance journey, I decided when I became a parent that I wouldn’t make disparaging comments about my body in front of my daughters — not whine about feeling fat after too much dessert, not frown at how I look when a pair of jeans fits too snug. The unconscious criticism stops here, I vowed. When I’m exercising in the living room and my youngest remarks that my butt looks jiggly, I neutrally confirm her observation and go about my burpees. Jiggly? Sure. Strong? Definitely. Another payoff of our Harbin trips is how the experience follows us back home, inviting discussions of all sorts of body-related stuff: pubic hair, cellulite, age spots, acne, nipples, menstruation, body autonomy and consent, the list goes on. “Mom, there are women with boobs so much bigger than yours!” they exclaim, and then we’re talking about what breast-feeding can do to breasts, why I sometimes wear bras with some padding but never with underwire anymore, how some women choose to augment their breast size with implants or reductions. They bring up facets of their own bodies that we can talk about without judgment or pathology, like the fact that my 12-year-old is now taller than me and can fit into some of my clothing. My favorite place at Harbin is the altar next to the cold plunge, where people leave tokens and treasures, flower petals and seashells, next to a statue of Quan Yin, a Chinese goddess associated with compassion. The only sounds that can be heard are the gurgling of spring-cold waters flowing into the tub and the deep sighs of people emerging from the frigid water. Some people avert their eyes, others offer warm smiles. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life. Our reporters rely on research, expert advice and lived experiences.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cheese-charcuterie-board-accessories-target_l_6717a362e4b0dc414dfae04e","The Best Accessories For Your Cheese Board From Target","griffin wynne","2024-11-01","What elevates a cheese plate to the level of “charcuterie”, you ask? Technically speaking, the French term denotes any type of preserved meat. Yet, colloquially speaking (especially on the internet) a charcuterie board has become shorthand for a good-looking tray of cheese and meat, often with some fun extras like nuts, olives or chocolates. It looks great on a table, can work as its own centerpiece and is as fun to make as it is to eat. If you’re hosting this holiday season or just want to spice up a weeknight dinner, preparing a fancy cheese or charcuterie board is easier than it seems. With a few ramekins and some specialized knives, you can transform a bunch of small bites into an interactive and eye-catching tray. To help you make the best at-home cheese board, we rounded up some favorite essentials from Target. Short of the meats and cheeses, you’ll find everything you need to wow your guests. HuffPost receives compensation from one or more retailers on this page, and HuffPost and its publishing partners may also receive a commission for purchases made via links. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. When it's not in use, the paddle-like shape of this expansive board may give you a little giggle, but truly a rustic-looking tray makes even deli slices of American cheese look like expensive and fancy. Let your guests graze and try all types of bites with this 34-inch-long option. For a smaller party or more limited serving surface, this 10-inch circular option fits the bill. It's great for presenting cheeses and meats but could be used for serving personal pizzas and even cutting fruit. Find it in light rubberwood or medium-hued acacia fabrications. Ramekins may be the easiest way to up your cheese plate game and to appease anyone who doesn't like different foods touching. Fill them with dips, spreads and small bites to give a little color and dimension to your board. This set comes in blue or white, and can go in the freezer, microwave and dishwasher. They're also oven-safe to 500 degrees. Get the perfect amount of your favorite hard and semi-hard cheeses with this handy plane slicer. The pressure you give it lets you decide the thickness of the slice and when the party's over it can go in the dishwasher. Literally elevate your cheeses with this lifted acacia wood tray. It's long and lean (28 inches, to be exact) and will be right at home as the centerpiece of your table or on a buffet. It's ideal for showing off charcuterie as well as deserts, breakfast pastries and more. Olives? Nuts? Dips? Jams? Any cheese-complementing treats you'd like to present will be right at home in this melamine serving trio. Designed with Studio McGee, it's the perfect addition to any home charcuterie set, giving you the ability to enjoy three separate treats. It's dishwasher-safe with an easy-carry top handle. Because trays are easy to carry, you can make a cheese board in the kitchen and then move it around without disrupting your hard work. Best, this stylish acacia serving tray can be used when you're not hosting as well to eat a meal in bed or on the couch, mark your coffee station or just as table decor. When you want the cheese that's across the other side of the platter but you don't want to reach over the whole table, it's time for a spin. This lazy Susan looks super lovely but is a fun and accessible way to lay out your treats. Clocking in at a mere $1.25 each, this 4-pack of mini bowls in a no-brainer when looking to up your cheese board game. They come in black, white and gray are microwave and dishwasher-safe so you can use them for hosting or for everyday dining. Marble handles and gold-finish stainless steel blades make this 4-pack of cheese knives an instant upgrade to any cheese plate. Use these implements to slice harder cheeses, spread gooey Bries and more. With a sneaky drawer that holds four included cheese knives, this all-in-one set is a great option for upgrading your home cheese board without buying a ton of new items. It's made from non-porous bamboo that's resistant to knife cuts. With three ramekins, three mini serving spoons, and four stainless steel markers, this 13-inch board comes with everything you need to serve your charcuterie selections. Focus on making your board a thing of beauty without hunting around for a bunch of different serving options. Another eye-catching addition to your appetizer table, this 3-tier stand is equal parts functional and stylish. Each porcelain tray is microwave and dishwasher-safe, and gives you the ability to separate different food options or to style your bites as you please. This versatile tray gives you five removable dishwasher-safe sections that come together to corral other small bites too like veggies, dried fruits, nuts, chocolates and more. The melamine set is perfect for picky eaters who don't want their bites touching or for bringing a cheese tray to a party or gathering.

Kennedy Jr. would be in charge of “women’s health” if the former president is reelected to the White House. “He’s gonna work on health and women’s health and all of the different reasons,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Nevada. “Because we’re not really a wealthy or a healthy country … I told Bobby, ‘I want you to take care of health, I want you to look at the food and the food supply and what we put on the food.’” The comments reflect Kennedy’s growing role in a potential administration and his rising standing in the Trump orbit after he dropped his independent bid for the presidency and endorsed his onetime competitor. But calls for a senior position have troubled health advocates, who point to Kennedy’s long history as a skeptic of widely accepted science surrounding vaccines. Those concerns grew this week after the co-chair of the team planning Trump’s potential transition said Kennedy had persuaded him in a 2.5-hour meeting that vaccines caused autism, a widely debunked stance. The Harris campaign was quick to share footage of Trump’s plans for Kennedy on Thursday, and Harris herself tweeted a short response to her opponent’s pledge: “No.” No. ❤️ https://t.co/mHXJZ0Jba5 The effort builds on the vice president’s campaign to showcase Trump’s behavior toward women and his work to undo the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that protected access to abortion nationwide. Trump said at a separate rally on Wednesday that he would take steps to protect women once he is back in the White House “whether the women like it or not.” “This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices,” Harris told supporters in Arizona at her own event on Thursday. “He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what’s in their own best interest and make decisions accordingly.” The next four years will change America forever.

The divisions in the country were significant back then, people didn’t think Trump had a chance back then,” Luntz told CNN’s Sara Sidner. “He’s been gaining and gaining.

I’m gonna give people a seat at the table and not call them the enemy within,’” said Sidner, referring to the former president’s alarming rhetoric toward political foes. “Why do you argue that this might be the big issue?” Luntz later said he doesn’t know who’s going to win the election, adding that “nobody should” call it because it’s “way too close to call.” “However, the momentum is clearly, in what I see and what I hear, is in his favor,” he said of Trump. “And so every word, every phrase, every misstep, every gaffe matters as those last remaining persuadables make their decision.” The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/need-noise-for-sleep-health_l_67222a16e4b03a564e7cdeb9","So THAT'S Why You Need Noise To Fall Asleep","ashley broadwater","2024-11-01","The fact that noise helps some people sleep is nothing new. Health providers say brown noise (bass-heavy notes) and white noise (a static-y sound) can help people fall asleep by masking outside noises and promoting relaxation. You may have also come across dating app profiles where people say a “must” is having a fan on at night, perhaps for the cool air and/or the noise. Other people might opt for a TikTok, YouTube or Spotify playlist. But why? Why is background noise the sleep aid of choice for many of us? According to doctors and sleep experts, there are actually several reasons we may need or want noise to sleep ― and it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Here’s what’s going on: When your mind is racing with thoughts like: Oh, my gosh, I‘ll never finish that assignment, and wow that thing I said at work was embarrassing, and I hope my friends don’t hate me for having to flake again, and shoot, I forgot to order groceries … well, it makes sense that literally anything else would be needed and relaxing. “For those who struggle with anxiety, silence can make their minds race, so having some background noise can be calming,” explained Shelby Harris, director of sleep health at Sleepopolis. Besides providing comfort, sounds can distract us from anxious thoughts. “People who are anxious or who have racing thoughts may use sound and music to avoid looking inward and processing what their mind is telling them,” said Dr. Neal Harish Patel, a family medicine physician with Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Southern California. “Some people may avoid the silence because it forces them to have to sit uninterrupted with their stream of thoughts.” All kinds of disruptions can be present at night, from roommates getting home late to blaring police sirens. These sounds are especially noticeable at night when we’re trying to block it all out and fall asleep. So again, a more pleasant noise, like a soothing melody or a lighthearted TV show, can be welcome and calming. “White noise is particularly helpful for my patients with tinnitus, who find it preferable to focus on a sound that is distinct from the ringing they usually experience,” said Daniella Marchetti, a clinician at Rise Science and a certified sleep specialist. “It can also be beneficial for people living in urban areas that may have considerable noise pollution. It also has benefits for night shift workers, who may need to drown out daytime noise to sleep.” She recommended keeping the noise level at 60 decibels or less. That’s comparable to the volume of a normal conversation or a business office. Not sure if you have this condition? Adult signs of ADHD include spending money, procrastinating and hyper-focusing to the extreme, just to scratch the surface. If those sound familiar, try to see a mental health provider who can give you more details and/or a diagnosis. Harris explained how attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be at play here. “People with ADHD often find that steady sounds help them focus and relax,” she said. Medication, supplements, practicing sleep hygiene, nighttime rituals and even some apps can also help people with ADHD fall asleep. When our lives are often filled with constant busyness and noise — the printer, strangers chatting at a restaurant, running around town — silence is a stark contrast. It’s jarring. “If you think about our society and the way communities are built, we are constantly surrounded or engulfed in sounds,” Patel said, listing the TV, talking, cars passing, the fridge buzzing and more. “People use external noise because they become accustomed to low levels of sound in the background and become uncomfortable in silence.” Silence can feel “wrong,” in that way, which can make it harder for our brains to turn off, relax and drift off. Did you grow up with a bunch of siblings? Or maybe you’re fresh out of college, where you constantly heard your roommates bustling about? Noise at night can feel familiar; we can get used to falling asleep to it. “Some people just get used to sleeping with noise because they grew up in loud environments,” Harris said. Noise at night can be familiar because of our own doing, as well. “Our brains, just like anything else, can be trained,” Patel said. “Therefore, if a person starts to use noise to help them sleep, they will become accustomed to needing some type of stimulus to sleep.” Similar to the reasons above, a lack of noise often means a lack of people around, which can feel lonely. “Some people are very afraid to be ‘alone’ and therefore feel that having a voice fill the silence is a way to feel like there are people ‘around,’” Patel said. This may especially be the case for individuals who have lost their partner, are living on their own for the first time or are extroverted. It’s worthwhile to note that the type of noise matters when it comes to sleep quality, according to Harris. TV shows can have loud moments, she said, and music can keep your mind so busy, it can’t drift off. So she recommended opting for other noises that may help more. “White noise is often a good choice because it masks annoying sounds and creates a consistent background that helps you fall asleep and stay asleep,” she said. “Pink and brown noise, which have softer and deeper sounds, can also help you relax more.” Marchetti agreed about the benefits of white noise. “White noise is purported to mask disruptive noises in the bedroom environment and be a non-pharmacological approach for promoting sleep and improving sleep quality,” she said, adding it can also work as a cue for sleep and distract from intrusive, anxious thoughts. “Studies show that white noise applied at 60 decibels or less (the volume of a quiet conversation) shows a decrease in nocturnal awakenings, increased sleep time and increased sleep efficiency.” Patel shared more examples of helpful (versus unhelpful) sounds. “If someone is going to use noise in the background, white noise, chants/repetitive words, Tibetan bowls, binaural beats (alpha and theta waves) are better than TV noise, music or audiobooks,” he said. If you struggle to give up the habit of falling asleep to a TV show or movie, you can keep it — you may just want to make some adjustments. Marchetti recommended not looking at the TV, or covering the screen, and setting a timer so it turns off in 30 minutes. “The blue light from the TV screen is enough to inhibit melatonin promotion efficiently,” she explained. The experts also recommended keeping the volume low to where it covers noise (like cars driving by) but doesn’t keep you up. “You don’t want it to be so loud that it affects your ability to sleep,” Patel said. Harris said you can play around with it. “Don’t be afraid to experiment with different types of noise and volume levels to see what works best for you,” she added. Don’t forget other sleep hygiene practices, either, like blocking out light, relaxing for 30 minutes before bed, exercising and limiting caffeine intake (especially in the afternoon and evening). Avoiding nighttime habits that may make your anxiety worse (despite being tempting), like doomscrolling and checking your email, are beneficial, too. This all creates a calming bedtime routine, which “can really help signal to your body that it’s time to wind down and get ready for sleep,” according to Harris. Additionally, Marchetti mentioned cognitive behavioral approaches. These help people reduce anxious thoughts about falling asleep that can, in turn, keep them awake. While she recommended a quiet environment generally, she acknowledged that won’t work best for everyone. At the end of the day, it’s about what works for you.

But if you are ready to “enroll” or “renew” your TSA PreCheck, know this ― it can be too easy to get fooled into paying more than you should, especially when the link looks legitimate. Too many of us end up getting scammed by government impersonators that use official-sounding language. The Federal Trade Commission reported that consumers lost $76 million when paying cash to government impersonation fraudsters in 2023, up from $40 million in 2022. In fact, last week the FTC issued an alert warning consumers to be on guard for TSA PreCheck scams in particular, noting that “only a scammer will ask you to pay online to enroll” in TSA PreCheck. When you are first applying to be approved for PreCheck, you do actually need to complete an online form ― but it’s a big red flag if a website says you can complete and pay for it online. That’s because travelers who are applying for TSA PreCheck for the first time cannot pay the application fee online and should not be asked to provide payment information like your credit card number. Instead, you will finish enrollment and do fingerprinting and documentation at a physical enrollment location. Payment for first-time applicants “happens during the actual appointment,” said R. Carter Langston, the TSA press secretary. “They will charge a credit card or do a point of sale at that point, not before, and certainly not online.” So if you are enrolling for PreCheck, your guard should be up if you get redirected to a website promising that you can do this whole process online. Do not click on unsolicited texts or emails urging you to enroll now for a limited-time offer. Scammers win when they get you to act fast, so you think less. Consumers “should be very wary of any unsolicited communications like emails or text messages that request them to click on the link or provide sensitive personal information,” said Michael Jabbara, the senior vice president and global head of fraud services for Visa. To be safer, type in the official website for TSA PreCheck when enrolling. You can start your application by going to: tsa.gov/precheck. There are deceptive renewal practices as well. Your TSA PreCheck membership lasts five years before needing to be renewed. The real TSA does send legitimate renewal reminder emails to travelers, and unlike first-time enrollment, you can pay to do your renewal online. But it’s all too easy to get fooled by a spoofed website that looks legitimate but is actually fraudulent. Know that official TSA PreCheck sites use .gov, not a .com web address. “It is always important to look at the actual URL to ensure that you’re being directed or redirected to a site that ends in .gov. And that ensures that, at least for the TSA PreCheck, a trusted traveler program, that you’re basically paying the fee that the federal government has developed,” Langston said. “That fee is based on the administrative costs as well as the background check costs associated with the membership.“ As the FTC advises, “Start your renewal at tsa.gov/precheck instead of clicking a link.” There are websites that can trick travelers into paying more than needed to as well. To avoid getting overcharged by a website claiming to be the best site to do your renewal, look up the official enrollment and renewal partners TSA uses. TSA has only three enrollment providers, and those are CLEAR, Idemia and Telos, and their prices are listed on TSA’s official website. TSA cannot refund PreCheck applications that were not done through them. That’s why “it’s so important that people go to the right place at the very beginning and aren’t duped into clicking on something that takes them to a non-.gov site,” Langston said. If you do however pay for a fake TSA PreCheck program, you should report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. Jabbara also said you should contact your bank immediately and let them know that “you have either been charged fraudulently or that you have been scammed into giving away your payment information.” If you have given sensitive information like your social security number or date of birth, he recommends contacting credit bureau agencies and freezing your credit.

Jimmy Kimmel Hits Trump With A Joke Just Like The One That Really Set Him Off","ed mazza","2024-11-01","Jimmy Kimmel’s joke about Donald Trump on Thursday just might touch a nerve with the former president given the ongoing feud between the two. Trump this week put on an orange vest and rode around in a garbage truck for a photo op. “The garbage is driving the truck,” Kimmel cracked. But Kimmel did spot an upside for the former president, who is awaiting sentencing after being convicted on 34 felony counts in New York and is embroiled in multiple other criminal cases. “That vest will come in handy when he’s on the side of the highway picking up trash with the other inmates,” Kimmel said. The jab isn’t too different from a joke Kimmel told earlier this year that shook the former president so much he’s been complaining about it ever since. That came in March, when Trump fired off an angry message on his Truth Social website aimed at Kimmel, who was hosting the Oscars. Kimmel read it on the air live during the show, then said he was surprised Trump was still watching. “Isn’t it past your jail time?” Kimmel cracked in what would become one of the most viral moments of the event. Trump, who reportedly tried to have Kimmel censored when he was president, has brought up the joke frequently and randomly, including in a Truth Social post in early October and at a rally in September where he completely botched the punch line.

He continued, “OK, so you dressed up as a garbage man because you say Biden called your supporters ‘garbage’ and you’re saying they’re not garbage but you’re taking out the garbage, which is someone else but you won’t tell us who it is, and also no one should call anyone ‘garbage’ but you just did because you’re the garbage man. So, in other words, the perfect metaphor.” Trump’s garbage photo op arrived after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” at the GOP nominee’s Madison Square Garden campaign rally on Sunday. President Joe Biden, in response, said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.” A White House spokesperson later said the president was referring to the rhetoric shared at the event in New York City. Trump, who missed the door handle and nearly slipped while entering the garbage truck, told reporters he would divulge “who the real garbage is, but we won’t say that.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The poll, sponsored by the Des Moines Register and conducted by J. Ann Selzer, nailed the final results of the presidential race in Iowa in both 2016 and 2020. While Iowa is no longer considered a swing state and rewards only six electoral voters, the Register survey remains closely watched as an indicator of how white voters across the Midwest may vote. The poll found Harris earning 47% of the vote to 44% for Trump. “It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,” Selzer told the newspaper. “She has clearly leaped into a leading position.” Selzer and the Register surveyed 808 likely Iowa voters from Oct. 28 to Oct. 31. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Harris’ lead in the poll is the result of a massive gender gap. She leads by 20 points among women, 56% to 36%. Trump has a lead among men, but it’s relatively smaller, 52% to 38%. It’s a pattern that’s repeated itself to varying extents nationwide, but notably, a six-week abortion ban went into effect in Iowa this summer. While the poll is highly respected, it is also an outlier. Iowa has seen little polling so far this cycle, but an Emerson College survey released Saturday showed Trump with a 53% to 43% lead, and a September poll from Cygnal sponsored by a conservative group found Trump with a 51% to 43% lead. The last iteration of the Des Moines Register poll, from September, found Trump leading Harris, 47% to 43%. The next four years will change America forever.

Russell Bruce Moncrief, 75, the owner of Moncrief Bail Bonds, which has locations in multiple Florida counties, is accused of human trafficking and racketeering, among other charges, according to the announcement. According to Moody, Moncrief targeted women in county jail and others who had been arrested on prostitution and/or drug charges. After bailing the women out, Moncrief maintained his power over them by threatening to revoke their bonds. Moncrief also allegedly offered to bail out some women on the condition that they have sex with another person outside of the jail. The attorney general alleged that Moncrief “sold women he bonded out to other buyers.” The Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation identified at least 26 possible victims and a number of potential witnesses in the course of its three-year investigation, according to an arrest report cited by ABC affiliate WFTV. Moncrief’s charges come a year after the arrest of a local defense attorney, John Gillespie, on similar allegations, TV station WKMG reports. “Victims of Gillespie alleged that they had to have sex with Bruce Moncrief ... in exchange for being bonded out of jail or in exchange for others being bonded out of jail,” said a Florida law enforcement release cited by WKMG. According to court records Gillespie was found incompetent to proceed and remains in Orange County Jail. An attorney representing Moncrief did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for a statement, but told WKMG that the defendant “he denies any and all of these allegations.” The next four years will change America forever.

On Friday, he also floated repealing the CHIPS Act, which provided for major investments in electronics manufacturing, when a student journalist asked him about it, before reportedly apologizing and claiming he misheard the question. Harris sharply denounced both of these ideas during a campaign stop Saturday in Wisconsin. Vice President Harris: Mike Johnson calling to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the CHIPS Act speaks to Trump's intention to implement Project 2025. Let’s talk about manufacturing.

But many who helped draft it are still part of Trump’s orbit. “We have talked repeatedly about their intention to get rid of the Affordable Care Act — now, to get rid of the CHIPS Act,” Harris said Saturday. “Let’s talk about manufacturing, which is a critical issue for many of the states that will make the difference in this election.” The next four years will change America forever.

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) would handle being shot at caused outrage from high-ranking Democrats. “The people that I find most loathsome, and the wormiest, slimiest people in this, is what I call the truth-teller caucus,” Carville said Friday in a video for Politicon. “They’re the people … burdened with the obligation to ‘the truth’ — and you see these asswipes everywhere.” Carville was referring to journalists who “talk about polling averages” and interview Pennsylvanian diners to “get some wisdom” about the presidential election — while equivocating Trump’s violent comments with minor gaffes or policy quibbles from his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Carville slammed this “centrist approach,” before delivering an extremely sarcastic hypothetical to argue his point. “Let’s say Donald Trump wants a nine-person firing squad to execute Liz Cheney,” he said. “OK, is the middle position a four-person firing squad or a five-person firing squad? Now, it’s a very important question, because we got to take ideas from both parties and meld them together.” Carville’s “nine-person firing squad” example was a reference to comments Trump made about Cheney during a Glendale, Arizona tour stop Thursday held by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. At the event, Trump denounced Cheney as a “war hawk” and suggested that she wouldn’t endorse using the U.S. military for foreign interventions if she had to face that danger herself. “Let’s put her with a rifle, standing there, with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face,” Trump said. Harris called the comment “disqualifying” on Friday, while Cheney herself — who has joined Harris on the campaign trail in an effort to quell bipartisan strife in order to defeat Trump at the polls — said such remarks are precisely “how dictators destroy free nations.” Carville, who accurately predicted President Joe Biden would exit the race to make way for a new Democratic nominee, previously confessed he’s “scared to death” about the presidential election — and warned that Trump will make good on his threats to arrest his political opponents. Just days ahead of Tuesday’s election, Carville spoke directly to the media. “I do hope the people supposedly telling us what’s going on in this country develop the intestinal fortitude, the background, the historical knowledge … [and] sense to know that everything is not fucking equal in this country,” he said, “and everybody’s opinion is not fucking equal.” “Some people have better, more informed, more humane opinions than other people do,” he continued. “What he hell don’t you go out and fucking report that?” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Gerard Butler, 8, had just received the minibike as an early birthday present the weekend before the crash. He began riding it home after feeling scared by police activity in his neighborhood, his mother, Regina Sanders, told CBS affiliate WTSP. An officer in a patrol vehicle leaving the scene of a different call struck the boy a at around 6:30 p.m. on Oct. 28, Sarasota Police Chief Rex Troche said in a press conference. The police department also shared the graphic body camera footage online. In one video, the unnamed officer can be seen turning left at an intersection, passing a stop sign without appearing to make a complete stop before accelerating and hitting the child. The officer then gets out of his patrol car, and Butler can be seen lying on the ground a great distance from the vehicle. “The cops, you just see them flying, at least hitting 60 miles, and they don’t care about the stop signs, just flying through the roads,” Sanders told WTSP. “I was inside and I just heard something scraping and then you just see the little minibike on there.” In the video, the officer calls for backup and emergency medical aid as a crowd of panicked neighbors forms. Police make some attempts at CPR in the interim, but cannot find a defibrillator. The child was taken to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital and was treated for serious injuries, according to an earlier release by police. Sanders told WTSP earlier this week that her son had undergone two brain surgeries and a knee surgery and is scheduled for jaw surgery. In a Wednesday update from ABC affiliate WWSB, Sanders said her son has only been able to move his legs slightly and cough since he was admitted to the hospital. “I’ve never been through anything like this before,” Sanders said. Police told WTSP the officer involved was uninjured but is shaken by the incident. He is on restrictive administrative duty as the investigation continues.

In a two-minute video released Saturday, titled “Brighter Future,” Harris’ final message is one of optimism. “Throughout this campaign, I’ve seen the best of America, and I’ve seen what is holding you back and weighing you down,” Harris says at the start of the ad. “High costs, fundamental rights taken away, and politics that have driven fear and division. You deserve better. As president, I will bring a new generation of leadership.” In the ad, Harris says she’ll bring down price gouging, and fight to “protect your healthcare and your benefits — not take them away.” Harris is likely referring to her opponent, former President Donald Trump, and comments he’s made about slashing health care. “We believe in each other. We believe in our country,” Harris says in the ad. “We’re not falling for these folks who are trying to divide us.

But on Friday, the liberal pundit defended the GOP presidential nominee for imagining how former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) would react to having guns trained at her, and argued on his show, HBO’s “Real Time,” that Trump’s remark expressed the same antiwar notion that liberals used to share. At a campaign event with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in Glendale, Arizona, on Thursday, the former president called Cheney a “war hawk.” Both Cheney and her father, former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, have endorsed his opponent, Kamala Harris. “Let’s put her with a rifle, standing there, with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face,” Trump said. He went on: “You know, they’re all war hawks when they’re sitting in Washington in a nice building, saying, ‘Aw, gee, well, let’s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy.’” Maher argued the former president’s fantasy about Cheney getting shot at was just a poorly worded argument for non-interventionist foreign policy. “I woke up today to the headline that Trump had called for a firing squad for Liz Cheney,” he said Friday. “And this is what I really don’t like about the media — no, he didn’t. You don’t have to move me to not like Donald Trump more than I already do.” “Just to be clear, this is exactly what hippies always said,” the host added. “This is exactly what peaceniks always said. This is ‘Fortunate Son,’ the song. It’s like, you know what? It’s very easy to sit in your building and send young men to die.” Maher received some pushback from one guest on his show, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who acerbically countered that Trump must know “what it’s really like from Vietnam” — in reference to the fact that Trump’s “bone spur” diagnosis helped him avoid being drafted into the military. Maher conceded that Trump “expresses himself horribly,” and Raskin argued that there has “been a lot of violence” following Trump’s political rise — which shouldn’t be ignored. The MAGA leader has reportedly made more than 100 threats to his perceived enemies, and has begun repeating that there is “an enemy within” the U.S. government that he hopes to eradicate. He has even pondered using the military to quell potential civil unrest from the “radical left.” Trump’s Cheney comment sparked outrage among high-ranking Democrats, including Harris, who argued such remarks are “disqualifying,” as well as Cheney herself, who said this is “how dictators destroy free nations.” Maher, who has long warned about the dangers of a second Trump term and predicted that he wouldn’t promptly concede the 2020 presidential election, ultimately found himself in a predicament Friday — by defending the same billionaire who once sued him.

The lifestyle guru, who lives near the “Deadpool” star and his wife, fellow actor Blake Lively, in Bedford, New York, revealed that Reynolds is “not so funny” off-screen. Stewart appeared on “Rent Free,” a promotional game show from credit card loyalty program Bilt Rewards, to guess how program members responded when asked, “What celebrities would be the most fun to hang out with?” She correctly guessed that Reynolds made the cut, then skewered him as a choice. “You want to know something?” she said in a clip shared Saturday by TMZ. “He’s not so funny in real life. No, he’s not so funny. He’s very serious.” She said she would remove Reynolds from the list of celebs and replace him with “somebody else” ― specifically, George Clooney, “because he’s fun.” She conceded that Reynolds has some talent, though. “He’s a good actor,” she said. “He can act funny. But he isn’t funny.” Stewart added: “I’m going to get in trouble. He’s my neighbor.” After the comments went viral online, Reynolds responded on social media with remarks that could support or refute Stewart’s argument, depending on your perspective. “I’d disagree with her,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “But I tried that once.

Erwin’s blistering takedown comes about two weeks after HuffPost first reported that Sheehy, who made millions running an aerial firefighting company that relies heavily on lucrative federal contracts, has repeatedly claimed, with little evidence, that a significant number of boots-on-the-ground firefighters are standing around while wildfires rage. In the 2023 book “Mudslingers: A True Story of Aerial Firefighting,” Sheehy described an encounter with firefighters battling blazes in Idaho in 2015. He wrote that one firefighting pilot told him of the blaze: “We don’t want it to go too fast. ... There’s a lot of overtime pay to be earned out there! We put it out, it’s back on salary!’” That conversation “smacked less of concern or common sense than it did laziness — or, worse, greed,” Sheehy wrote. “I wouldn’t call it malevolence; anyone who climbs into a plane or picks up a shovel to fight wildfires clearly has a capacity for goodness and a desire to help. That said, even in positions that are demonstrably service-oriented, there is the potential for self-interest, if not outright corruption, leading to a response that is not necessarily in the public’s best interest.” “If there is no fire, there is no money,” he added. “And the faster that a fire is extinguished, the sooner the money dries up or goes elsewhere. It might seem ridiculous to worry about a shortage of work to keep the wildfire industry busy given the extraordinary expansion of the season in recent years, not to mention the gnawing sense that firefighters will forever be overmatched against nature. But old beliefs and protocols die hard, and clearly there were some in the industry who saw nothing wrong with milking every fire for what it was worth despite the risks and the blurring of ethical boundaries.” It’s not the only time Sheehy has hurled such accusations at public servants who work in the same field as him. Sheehy is the founder of Belgrade, Montana-based Bridger Aerospace, a company that has a fleet of firefighting aircraft, and he has consistently highlighted his company’s work in campaign ads and speeches. At a book signing in Huntsville, Alabama, in April, months after launching his campaign against three-term incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, Sheehy told attendees, “There’s a very real dynamic in wildfire that a lot of those people don’t want to put the fire out.” “They don’t want to put the fire out because that’s where they get their overtime, that’s where they get their hazard pay,” he added. Wildland firefighters are notoriously underpaid for a job that is becoming increasingly dangerous amid worsening climate change. In an October post on X, formerly Twitter, Tester called Sheehy’s comments “insulting.” On its website, the National Federation of Federal Employees notes that its advocacy for wildland firefighters includes “fighting for a permanent, competitive pay fix, enhanced mental health and physical wellbeing resources, adequate housing, and more.” In Thursday’s press release, Erwin said that NFFE represents many federal wildland firefighters across the country, including in Montana. And he highlighted the myriad challenges these workers are facing. “Wildland firefighters have been doing more with less for decades, and the current shortage of firefighters places them and other first responders at greater risk while they work longer deployments fighting hotter and bigger fires each year,” Erwin said. “Sheehy and his arial company have profited heavily from taxpayer-funded contracts to fight wildfires while many wildland firefighters struggle to pay the rent because of low pay.” He slammed Sheehy’s remarks as “elitist and self-serving.” “Federal wildland firefighters and other first responders deserve better, as do all the residents of Montana,” Erwin said. When HuffPost reached out to Sheehy’s campaign last month, a spokesperson called HuffPost’s reporting on the GOP candidate “embarrassing” without addressing specific questions about his comments — a tactic his campaign has increasingly turned to in recent months amid a seemingly endless stream of controversies. While polling previously showed Sheehy with a commanding lead over Tester, a poll released last week showed the two in a dead heat.

They wouldn’t try and repeal the health care law known as Obamacare. They wouldn’t repeal a critical program creating tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs. But in the last week of the 2024 campaign, several top Republicans let slip comments indicating their desired agenda if they return to power next year, including dismantling popular government programs that have bipartisan support in Congress. On Friday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said House Republicans would seek to repeal the CHIPS and Science Act a bipartisan law whose federal investments in semiconductor factories have ushered in a manufacturing renaissance, adding thousands of new jobs, including in many battleground GOP districts across the country. “I expect that we probably will but we haven’t developed that part of the agenda yet, we gotta get over the election first,” Johnson told Syracuse University student journalist Luke Radel while campaigning with Rep. Brandon Williams (R-N.Y.) in his central New York district on Friday. BREAKING: I asked @SpeakerJohnson if he’ll try to repeal the CHIPS Act if Trump wins and they have control of Congress.“I expect that we probably will.”@RepWilliams responds: “I will remind him night and day how important the CHIPS Act is.” #NY22 @CitrusTVNews 🚨 pic.twitter.com/tUGwZMNMJM Williams, one of the most vulnerable GOP incumbents this cycle who was elected by just one percentage point in 2022, awkwardly pushed back against the speaker, calling the law “hugely impactful” for his community. “I would remind him night and day how important the CHIPs Act is,” Williams said of Johnson, who stood at his side, noting the law is helping finance a $100 billion Micron chipmaking facility in the Syracuse area. The speaker attempted to walk back his comments soon after in a statement, apologizing “profusely” to Williams and claiming that he misheard the reporter, even though the question was clear as day. He also said the law, which poured $54 billion into the semiconductor manufacturing industry, “is not on the agenda for repeal.” But the damage was done, and Democrats immediately pounced on his comments. “What I would like to thank Speaker Johnson for is his honesty and his forthrightness about what they plan to do with a Republican majority in the House of Representatives,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.) said Friday evening in an interview on MSNBC. “I want everyone in Buffalo to know you heard it straight from the horse’s mouth.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), a main proponent of the CHIPS Act, also weighed in with a post on social media. “The Republican Speaker of the House just told the tens of thousands of construction workers building New York and America’s future they want to send them pink slips ASAP,” Schumer wrote. Johnson also sparked a firestorm earlier in the week when he criticized the Affordable Care Act during an event in Pennsylvania and promised that “health care reform’s going to be a big part of the agenda” if Republicans are in power next year. After an attendee at the event asked him, “No Obamacare?” Johnson responded, “No Obamacare.” “The ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that,” he added. The speaker later said his comments were misinterpreted, saying in a statement that he “offered no such promise to end Obamacare” by acknowledging that “the policy is ‘deeply ingrained’ in our health care system.” But Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign pointed to his remarks as more evidence of the GOP’s intended goals if they win a majority next year. “Health care is on the ballot this November. Speaker Mike Johnson is making it clear — if Donald Trump wins, he and his Project 2025 allies in Congress will make sure there is ‘no Obamacare,’” Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. Another Republican also got into hot water over comments about the Affordable Care Act on Friday. In Pennsylvania, GOP Senate candidate David McCormick, who’s running to unseat Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), said he opposes a popular provision of the law that allows dependents to stay on their parents’ health insurance plan up to the age of 26. “Is that Obamacare, a result of Obamacare? I’m not for that. I got to get my kids working,” McCormick told a voter about the provision, according to audio posted Friday by the progressive outlet The Heartland Signal.

Asked by the woman if he wanted to repeal the law outright, McCormick said he wanted to reform it and “reduce the cost for folks on Obamacare.” These are only the latest self-inflicted wounds from top Republicans giving Democrats fodder in the closing days of the 2024 election. The backlash to racist comments about Puerto Rico made by a comedian at a Trump rally in New York City’s Madison Square Garden has grown steadily this week. And billionaire Trump donor Elon Musk caused another political headache for the GOP nominee’s campaign after he said that he would subtract trillions from federal spending — and acknowledged the cuts would result in “some temporary hardship” for the country. Musk claimed that he could easily cut $2 trillion out of the federal government’s more than $6 trillion in annual spending. That kind of reduction would almost certainly require draconian cuts to popular programs like school lunches and national parks, as well as necessities like transportation and food assistance ― things the GOP puts on the chopping block to some extent in every Congress.

The Dallas-based company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a Texas federal court. TGI Fridays Executive Chairman Rohit Manocha in a statement said the “primary driver of our financial challenges resulted from COVID-19 and our capital structure.” Sit-down chain restaurants have more broadly faced challenges in recent years as diners choose to get food delivered or visit upscale fast food chains like Chipotle and Shake Shack. A U.S. bankruptcy judge in September approved a reorganization plan for seafood chain Red Lobster after years of mounting losses and dwindling customers. Founded in 1965, the popularity of TGI Fridays peaked in 2008 with 601 restaurants in the U.S. and a $2 billion business, according to Kevin Schimpf, director of industry research at Technomic. Its sales in the U.S. were $728 million in 2023, down 15% from the prior year, according to Technomic. It now counts 163 restaurants in the U.S., down from 269 last year. It closed 36 in January and dozens more in the past week. TGI Fridays Inc. said it only owns and operates 39 restaurants in the U.S., which is just a fraction of the 461 TGI Friday-branded restaurants around the world. A separate entity, TGI Fridays Franchisor, owns the intellectual property and has franchised the brand to 56 independent owners in 41 countries. Those remain open.

The Greek or me?” Trump asked the audience, which reacted with a smattering of applause. Antetokounmpo, a Black center who rose to fame in the NBA over the last decade as one of the sport’s greatest players of all time, earned the nickname “Greek Freak” on the court. He has, however, discussed how his background complicated his early years, as he was made to feel like he did not truly belong in either Nigerian or Greek culture, despite being born in Athens. Three of Antetokounmpo’s brothers have also been drafted into the NBA. In commenting on the player’s race and immigrant story, Trump evoked his mockery of opponent Vice President Kamala Harris, having repeatedly challenged her multiracial background as the child of Black and Indian parents. It’s worth noting that Trump has no Greek ancestry. His family is of German and Scottish heritage. Trump: Your team is very good. I would say the Greek is a seriously good player, do you agree?

And tell me, who has more Greek in him? The Greek or me? I think we have about the same, right?” The same — that is to say, none.

Nature lovers are mourning the matriarch of the world-famous bear family after she was fatally struck by a vehicle Oct. 22 on a highway in western Wyoming. On Saturday night in the picturesque ski town of Jackson, dozens are expected to brave frigid weather to attend a candlelight vigil, and hundreds more will watch online. Wildlife photographers, biologists and community members will come together to share fond memories of the 28-year-old grizzly known for frequenting tourist-heavy spots and roadsides in Grand Teton National Park. A PBS documentary crowned her “Queen of the Tetons” and an Instagram account dedicated to her has amassed more than 60,000 followers. “She was a living legend, and she became this ambassador for her species and a kind of rallying symbol for people working to conserve American public lands,” said Jack Bayles, a wildlife tour guide who is organizing the ceremony in Jackson’s town square. Named for the tag affixed by researchers to her ear, No. 399 was the oldest-known reproducing female grizzly in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem. She has been credited for helping the region’s grizzly population rebound from just over 100 in the 1970s to around 1,000 today. She had 18 known cubs in eight litters over the years, and some have been spotted with cubs of their own. Her ashes were spread this week in the Pilgrim Creek area of Grand Teton National Park, where she spent much of her life, park officials said. “399 will always be part of this special place,” Grand Teton National Park Superintendent Chip Jenkins said in a statement. “However, there is still work to do to ensure her descendants and all grizzly bears continue to thrive in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem. It’s up to all of us to make sure they do.” Grizzlies have teetered on and off the endangered species list. They remain federally protected, but some state officials in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho have sought to remove federal protections as their population has replenished. The states want to regain management of grizzlies and allow limited hunting. Conservationists argue the species still requires protection as food scarcity caused by climate change has driven grizzlies further from their habitats in search of food. On his tours of the Tetons, Bayles said he often draws attention to barren huckleberry bushes affected by rising temperatures, which he said might help explain why No. 399 was about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of her habitat in the park when she was fatally struck. Grizzlies need to eat nearly nonstop in the fall to store enough fat to sustain their winter hibernation. At the vigil Saturday, the tour guide said he plans to sing a few songs that he and his wife, Gina, used to play while they were out looking for her and her cubs. A male yearling cub, known informally as “Rowdy” or “Spirit,” was with No. 399 when she was killed and has not been located in the nearly two weeks since. “There is no indication it was struck in the collision,” Joe Szuszwalak of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said. “Given the bear’s age and the time of year, the yearling has a strong chance of surviving independently, and there are no current plans to capture it.” The next four years will change America forever.

(AP) — An orphaned squirrel that became a social media star called Peanut was euthanized after state authorities seized the beloved pet during a raid on his caretaker’s home, authorities said Friday. After anonymous complaints, officers from the state Department of Environmental Conservation took the squirrel and a raccoon named Fred from Mark Longo’s home near the Pennsylvania border in rural Pine City on Wednesday, Longo said. On Friday, the DEC and Chemung County Department of Health confirmed both animals’ fate. “On Oct. 30, DEC seized a raccoon and squirrel sharing a residence with humans, creating the potential for human exposure to rabies. In addition, a person involved with the investigation was bitten by the squirrel. To test for rabies, both animals were euthanized,” the agencies said in a statement, CBS News in New York reported. “The animals are being tested for rabies and anyone who has been in contact with these animals is strongly encouraged to consult their physician.” Neither agency responded to The Associated Press’s requests for comment. Peanut amassed tens of thousands of followers on Instagram, TikTok and other platforms during the seven years since Longo, who runs an animal sanctuary, said he took him in after seeing his mother get hit by a car in New York City. Peanut’s Instagram account shows the squirrel leaping on to Longo’s shoulder, jumping through a hoop, holding and eating waffles and wearing miniature hats. “It is with profound sorrow that we share the heartbreaking news: on October 30th, the DEC made the devastating decision to euthanize our beloved Peanut the squirrel and Fred the raccoon. Despite our passionate outcry for compassion, the agency chose to ignore our pleas, leaving us in deep shock and grief,” an Instagram post said Friday, accompanied by a video montage of the animals interacting with their smiling caretakers.

This Year's Vote Is No Laughing Matter.","madeleine smithberg","2024-11-02","I spent many years in the hilarious trenches of late night television. I booked and produced “human interest” guests (and all the cooking demonstrations) for “Late Night With David Letterman,” and I went on to co-create “The Daily Show” and run it as executive producer for the first seven years. I discovered and hired Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell (both after watching a videotape from the short-lived “Dana Carvey Show” called “Waiters Who Are Nauseated by Food”). I led “The Daily Show” from its launch in 1996 through the 2002 elections. It was quite a ride. There was an exact moment when “The Daily Show” transformed from a ragtag kind of adorable footnote of the national political dialogue into the “cable comedy show of record.” That moment was election night 2000. Specifically, it was 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. We were in the middle of two hours of live coverage. Arizona was too close to call. Florida and New York had gone to Democrat Al Gore, while Louisiana and Texas were solidly for Republican George W. Bush. The stakes felt very high, both for the country and for me and my team. Anytime a show goes live, it is simultaneously exhilarating and terrifying. I like to think of it as walking a tightrope without a net … above the Grand Canyon … naked. Or flying on a Boeing jet. There is no room for error, yet endless opportunities for disaster. I loved it. Nothing makes you feel more alive than finding and creating comedy in the exact moment that it is happening. Though we did not know it at the time, American politics, and our place in it, were about to change forever. It would end up being a bad night for democracy, but a pretty good one for our little cable comedy show. History was unfolding before our eyes, and we were somehow being folded into it. During the summer of 2000, much to our shock, we were the guests of honor at the Republican National Convention. Former GOP nominee Bob Dole actually became a regular contributor to our show. On election night, we were relieved that our year of hard work on “Indecision 2000” (we could never have predicted how accurate that name would become) was finally about to end (or so we thought). As we entered the second hour of our program, it looked as though Gore was going to easily take the night. Then, in what seemed like an instant, Florida’s vote flipped from Gore to Bush. The country, the world and “The Daily Show” would never be quite the same. Along with everyone else, we scrambled to adjust to a change we could never have anticipated — and we had almost an hour left of live coverage — and it had to be funny. What had happened to the country was playing out in real time on my silly, funny, fake news program. It felt anything but funny. In the weeks that followed, a confused electorate learned quickly about “hanging chads” and the fragility of American democracy. For those of you who have no idea what I am talking about, hanging chads were little pieces of paper that were not completely punched out on ballots, largely in Florida, turning the outcome of the 2000 election into utter chaos. They got a lot of media attention. It is hard to believe that a nation as big and powerful as the United States could be rendered dysfunctional by tiny scraps of paper, but it happened. It was as if we at “The Daily Show” had been summoned to take over the reins for a shocked and exhausted media that had no idea how to report the absurd non-outcome with a straight face, something we did not have to even attempt to do.

We scattered fast-food containers and empty coffee cups around the desk. We applied makeup to Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert to accentuate their disheveled appearances. We filled a couple of ashtrays with cigarette butts, some of them smoldering. Our job as the conscience of American media had officially begun. I am so proud of the program that I co-created and helped to build. Format-wise, very little seems to have changed since I left. It is great to see Jon back in the chair. I feel nostalgic for the comparatively innocent days of Bush versus Gore. The Supreme Court then struck us as out of line; the current court is sticking its toe into fascist waters. The task facing Jon and the talented team seems far more daunting than what we had to try to make funny back in November 2000. I really do not see a way of spinning the current situation into anything even resembling humor. Donald Trump impersonations aside, there is not a laugh to be had when looking at the stakes for Tuesday. We are witnessing a situation of actual good versus evil, and the odds are chilling. I am living in a state of constant stress and am relieved simply not to have the job of trying to make it funny.

Instead, I Found Myself Grieving.","jaime lewis","2024-11-02","A few months ago at a truck stop on a summer family road trip, my 14-year-old son announced that, after five years of being vegetarian, he would start eating meat again. I nearly spat a mouthful of 7UP across the table. “What?” I asked, soda dripping down my chin. “Why?” My reaction surprised him. “Doesn’t this make your life easier?” he asked. “I thought you would be happy.” I thought I would have been, too. As an omnivore, I had dreaded cooking two dinners every night after he declared himself a vegetarian. At the time, he was 9 years old. I chalked his decision up to the chaos we all felt at the beginning of a global pandemic — the sense that the ground beneath our feet was crumbling. I figured the first time he smelled bacon sizzling in the oven, his conviction would dissolve. But that is not what happened. Instead, he sniffed the air and rather piously declared that he loved animals too much to eat them. While I’m happy to serve as our family cook, feeding a 9-year-old vegetarian wasn’t in the job description. I suppose I could have played the “as long as you live under my roof” card, which many parents do. But when I looked into the eyes of a young boy sincerely trying to use what little autonomy he had in the world, I didn’t have it in me to say, “Too bad, kid. You get what you get.” He clearly wasn’t going vegetarian to exert control or to make dinnertime hell for me, my husband and our daughter. I’d seen kids pull such stunts before, but this was different. He wanted to live according to his values. I admired that. And although he could make himself a quesadilla, scrambled eggs or pasta, if he was going to eat anything besides pale foods, it would be up to me to cook it. At first, my shopping list included lots of tofu and plant-based, meat-like products. I became obsessed with weaving protein into my son’s diet, constantly pushing almonds on him like I was selling knockoff watches from inside a trench coat. During lockdown, when he spent 99% of his day at home, it felt imperative that I personally compensate for whatever he lacked on the food pyramid. Fortunately, he was game, although he drew a hard line at eggplant and squash — no matter how well they were seasoned, employed or disguised. As he grew older and COVID-19 loosened its grip on our lives, my son’s meals increasingly took place between or en route to basketball games, music lessons and rehearsals for the school play. In recent years, he has consumed so many trays of Trader Joe’s frozen chana masala and black bean taquitos that I live in fear of their discontinuation. On occasion, my husband and I would give him $20 to walk downtown for dinner with a friend. Once, he spent it on a giant bucket of buttered popcorn; another time, two scoops of gelato. Aloud, I told my son that these weren’t the kinds of “meals” for which we provided cash. Secretly, though, I rejoiced in not having to cook for him those nights. Parenthood is riddled with such paradoxes. I want what’s best for my kids, but what I’m able to do for them is limited. I want control, but responsibility? Not especially. From what I can tell, a child’s sense of agency lights up between the ages of 9 and 13, like a meteor blazing through the ozone layer toward Earth. As parents, we can try to adjust the angle of its impact, but at a certain point all we can do is brace ourselves. Sitting at the truck stop restaurant that day when my son said he wanted to go back to meat, I saw a boy on the precipice of manhood. He still had the round face of a child, but he’d grown taller in recent months. When I had laughed and grabbed his arm that morning, I felt an unexpectedly sturdy bicep. But when I caught him yawning in the rearview mirror that morning on our road trip, his mouth formed the same shape as that of the infant in my arms 14 years ago. Yes, his decision to eat meat would make my life easier, and I told him as much. But I grieved the loss of the earnest little guy who wanted to protect the animals. That part I kept to myself. We left the restaurant and walked into the parking lot, my son’s eyes meeting mine as we opened car doors across from each other. “You didn’t answer my question,” I said, squinting against the sun’s reflection on the roof of the car. “What made you decide to eat meat again?” He stood holding the door open for several moments, thinking deeply, I assumed. “I don’t know,” he said at last, with a shrug. “I guess I just wanted to.” I considered pushing for more information. After all, aren’t the words “I don’t know” the most predictable deflection a teenager has? Surely there was more to it, but he spoke before I could press further. “Are you mad at me, Mommy?” he asked. “He still calls me Mommy,” I thought to myself. Even though he tries not to, even though all his friends call their mothers “Mom,” even though I’ve told him change is OK. I took in his unruly curls and open, guileless face. This was no deflection, I realized. He was asking for my blessing. I held my breath, then exhaled — the sacred sigh of every mother forced to remember, once again, that time marches on. “Nope,” I said, smiling to reassure him. “Not mad at all. I’m glad you’re figuring out who you are.” He grinned back at me and nodded, then sunk into the backseat, pushed his earbuds in and closed his eyes for the long ride ahead.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/puerto-rico-election_n_6725366ee4b00acf55d9d5b8","Puerto Rico Might Elect Its First Pro-Independence Governor","alex,er c. kaufman","2024-11-02","VEGA BAJA, Puerto Rico — Eliezer Concepción worked for years at his roadside mechanic shop to save enough money to buy a piece of his hometown before it was too late. In 2020, he finally purchased a dilapidated house in this beachside enclave roughly 45 minutes west of the sprawling capital of San Juan. It took him two years to renovate a dwelling destroyed in 2017’s Hurricane María into a functioning Airbnb. But he saw it as a way to earn extra money by tapping into the Caribbean island’s $10 billion tourism industry — and to keep the cash circulating locally. For years, Puerto Rico’s controversial tax haven laws have drawn wealthy Americans looking to avoid income taxes and sparked a property gold rush that pits lower-paid, Spanish-speaking natives against cash-rich Anglophone newcomers. But Concepción, 43, was determined to keep at least his piece of the town in the hands of a real Vegabajeño. “My neighbors are all selling,” Concepción, 43, said on a July afternoon, leaning back in the leather chair of the tiny office of his auto body shop. “But I wanted a good chance for someone from here to buy and rebuild.” It’s getting harder to reject the routine cash offers from real estate speculators. Since the privately held LUMA Energy took over operations of Puerto Rico’s electrical grid from the bankrupt state-owned utility PREPA in 2021, the power goes out weekly, if not daily, and bills keep going up. A lack of consistent air conditioning or refrigeration deters guests, leaving Concepción’s vacation rental business struggling. He wonders how long he can hold out — and how Puerto Rico’s historic election next week could forever change the dynamics in what is considered the world’s oldest colony. While they are full U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans living on the island can’t vote for the president, and the lone delegate they send to Congress has no real legislative powers. That makes the gubernatorial race the territory’s most important election — and this year’s is unlike any other in the 76 years since the U.S. began allowing Puerto Ricans to vote for their own governor. That’s because, when Concepción goes to the polls next week, he’ll be among the first American citizens since the Civil War with a real shot at electing a governor from a party pushing for independence from the United States. Juan Dalmau, the gubernatorial nominee from the once-marginalized Puerto Rican Independence Party, is now in second place, and polls show the race tightening amid the island’s fury over remarks a speaker made last Sunday at former President Donald Trump’s rally in Manhattan calling Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” The front-runner, Jenniffer González-Colón, is a Republican and Trump ally representing the New Progressive Party, the pro-statehood party that has ruled Puerto Rico continuously since 2016. Jesús Manuel Ortiz González, the nominee from the traditional opposition Popular Democratic Party, which advocates retaining Puerto Rico’s territorial status, struggled to break through but is now competing with Dalmau for second place in the most recent poll. The central faultline in Puerto Rican politics has long been the territory’s relationship with the mainland U.S. After seizing the island as a colony in the spoils of Washington’s victory in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the U.S. violently suppressed Puerto Rico’s independence movement for decades. As Europe began dismantling its empires after World War II, the U.S. granted the Philippines its independence but cut a separate deal with Puerto Rico, giving the island limited autonomy as a “commonwealth” and U.S. territory. Puerto Rican rebels, under the command of the Harvard-trained lawyer and independence leader Pedro Albizu Campos, attempted an armed uprising in 1950. But the U.S. military, in a singular act of deploying the Air Force against its own citizens, bombed a rebel stronghold in the mountains, leveling almost the entire town. Even waving a pro-independence flag became an offense punished with years of jail time. From that point on, local control of Puerto Rico passed between the two main political parties duking it out each election cycle. On one side was the Popular Democratic Party, known by its Spanish acronym PPD, which supported the commonwealth status quo. On the other was the New Progressive Party, or PNP, which called for U.S. statehood. The pro-independence PIP remained a minor third party akin to the Green Party, earning at most a tiny single-digit percentage of the vote each election. That arrangement worked for much of the rest of the 20th century, when federal support helped industrialize Puerto Rico and raise living standards. In 1996, however, Clinton-era reforms saw the federal government phase out the tax credit that had drawn manufacturers to the island. As factories closed, Puerto Rico’s government tried to make up for the jobs by hiring more teachers and police officers. But as the industrial tax base evaporated, Puerto Rico borrowed more and more money by issuing bonds that Wall Street expected would be backed up by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. By 2016, Puerto Rico’s debt and unfunded pension obligations reached a combined $126 billion. The island went bankrupt. Not an independent country, Puerto Rico could not get help refinancing from international lenders. Not a fully incorporated part of the U.S., either, the territory could not access the bankruptcy protections from which states and municipalities like Detroit benefit. Instead, Congress — which legally considers Puerto Rico and the four other permanently populated U.S. territories “possessions” — passed a law called the PROMESA Act, after the Spanish word for “promise,” which gave a White House-appointed board of financial overseers veto power over all the spending of the island’s elected government. The fiscal control board — known pejoratively among locals as “la junta,” the term for a ruling council in military dictatorships — instituted harsh austerity measures, closing hundreds of schools and slashing pensions in a place with worse poverty than the poorest U.S. state. Then came Hurricane María, a catastrophe from which Puerto Rico’s infrastructure has yet to recover. While the precise death toll is debated, most scholars agree the aftermath of the storm killed thousands who might have otherwise survived if they had had access to refrigerated medicine or clean water after the blackout disabled groundwater pumps. In the summer of 2019, text messages between then-Gov. Ricardo Rosselló and his inner circle showed the pro-statehood leader making jokes about the bloated bodies of Puerto Ricans killed during the storm two years earlier. As many as 1 million Puerto Ricans flooded the streets in protest, demanding his resignation. The chaos didn’t stop when Rosselló stepped down in disgrace. He tried appointing Pedro Pierluisi, a former coal lobbyist, as governor. But state courts intervened and instead selected Wanda Vázquez Garced to lead the island from 2019 to 2021 (Pierluisi then won the 2020 election to succeed her, and is the island’s current governor). In 2022, just as protests over the LUMA contract were growing, federal authorities arrested Vázquez in a corruption scandal. To Dalmau, the events showed Puerto Rico was primed for radical change. Sure enough, when he ran for governor in 2020, he won 14% of the vote — seven times the largest share of ballots the Independence Party had ever won and the first time it had earned a double-digit share of the vote. Like Albizu Campos, Juan Manuel Dalmau Ramírez is a Harvard-trained lawyer. Dalmau, 51, served in Puerto Rico’s Senate before becoming the standard-bearer for the Puerto Rican Independence Party, or PIP, in the 2020 election. His surprisingly strong performance wasn’t the only sign the two-party duopoly on Puerto Rico’s politics was crumbling. That same year saw upstart parties that eschewed the status question field competitive nominees. On the right, the Christian-democratic Dignity Project party sought to unite the largely Catholic island around conservative social reforms, like tighter abortion restrictions and a ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. On the left, the Citizens Victory Movement endorsed more liberal social policies but advocated primarily for ending Puerto Rico’s colonial arrangement with the U.S. In a bid to cleave voters from both traditional parties, neither new party openly backed statehood or independence. In 2020, the Citizens Victory Movement came close to winning the race for San Juan mayor, arguably the island’s second-most influential position after governor. This year, the Independence Party and the Citizens Victory Movement formed a coalition called Alianza, or “Alliance.” The Citizens Victory Movement’s energetic organizing, combined with the Independence Party’s experience running in elections for decades, has launched Dalmau into second place in recent polls. Dalmau’s pitch for breaking off from the U.S. is really something closer to a conscious uncoupling. He envisions weaning Puerto Rico off federal funding over a 25-year period and striking a deal to give members of the Puerto Rican diaspora — twice as many Puerto Ricans live in states like New York and Florida as on the island — the option for dual passports. The recently privatized power grid will need to come back under government management, but Dalmau wants to attract big companies with tax breaks like the ones the U.S. government once used to develop a manufacturing industry in Puerto Rico. “Our platform is going to support a democratic decolonization process,” Dalmau told HuffPost in July after a press conference at a landmark building in the upscale San Juan neighborhood of Miramar. “Puerto Ricans are a nation.” “People lost their fear that you can vote for an independentista, and the next day Puerto Rico will become independent.” During the world wars, the U.S. military’s outposts in Puerto Rico helped Washington maintain control over the Caribbean and routes to the Panama Canal. During the Cold War, Puerto Rico served as a vital defense hub and a model for the benefits of American capitalism over communism once Fidel Castro took power in neighboring Cuba. But now, Dalmau said, Puerto Rico no longer hosts major military operations, and its debt crisis is an ongoing embarrassment to the U.S. “Puerto Rico has become a burden,” he said. Puerto Ricans are split over the island’s future relationship with the U.S. A survey released last month by El Nuevo Día, the territory’s newspaper of record, showed 44% of voters back statehood and a combined 44% favor sovereignty. Of the latter set, 25% support a compact of free association with the U.S. — a deal akin to what Palau and Micronesia have, allowing the former U.S. Pacific territories to represent themselves at the United Nations but still benefit from federal funding — and 19% back independence. Either way, Dalmau has sought to play down the independence issue, particularly as voters prepare to cast ballots simultaneously in a nonbinding referendum over whether Puerto Rico should become a state, independent or something else. For the first time in the long history of failed plebiscites over Puerto Rico’s status, where one side or the other often boycotted the vote to make the results meaningless, this referendum does not include the option for the status quo. Rather than peg his candidacy to independence, Dalmau has pitched himself as a crusader against what he called the “two-headed monster” of the traditional two parties. “People lost their fear that you can vote for an independentista, and the next day Puerto Rico will become independent,” Dalmau said. “People tell me, ‘I was PNP, I was PPD, we have to get these people out of office.’” Jenniffer González-Colón, who leads the gubernatorial race, has sought to revive old fears of independence by linking Dalmau to socialist authoritarians in Latin America. Ads running on TV show him alongside Venezuelan strongman Nicolas Maduro, Cuban leader Miguel Díaz-Canel and Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega. Ironically, it’s her party, the pro-statehood PNP, that has the closest connections to Venezuela’s embattled regime. As part of a massive corruption investigation, federal authorities arrested the former PNP governor, Vázquez, in 2022 on bribery charges. Among those charged with her was Julio Martin Herrera Velutini, a banker who financed her failed election campaign in 2020. The Department of Justice accused Herrera Velutini of bribing Vázquez as part of a deal to take control of Puerto Rico’s financial regulator to hide a multimillion-dollar portfolio of dirty money linked to the Venezuelan regime. Like Dalmau, González-Colón — who currently serves as Puerto Rico’s resident commissioner, a nonvoting delegate to the U.S. Congress — ran on changing the contract between the island and LUMA Energy after it took over the territory’s electrical grid three years ago under a privatization effort the fiscal control board promoted. Her tough-talking ads on radio and television helped her defeat incumbent governor Pierluisi in the PNP’s primary earlier this year. A spokesperson for González-Colón declined HuffPost’s request to meet in Puerto Rico over the summer and initially offered to set up an interview remotely a week later. But multiple subsequent emails and phone calls went unanswered. On the campaign trail, González-Colón has claimed credit for the increase in federal funding the Biden administration has provided to Puerto Rico, and promised to hold LUMA accountable for ongoing blackouts. But González-Colón, a Republican in her stateside politics and a close ally of former President Donald Trump, was among the strongest supporters of privatizing Puerto Rico’s electrical system. While the Biden administration has promoted solar energy, González-Colón joined her fellow Republicans in advocating for Puerto Rico’s controversial natural gas buildout. “I see her as arrogant. She talks tough,” said José Rosario Borres, 53, a retired school janitor from the southern coastal town of Santa Isabel. “She kept lying and lying. It’s written in black and white history. When you lie to Puerto Ricans, you disrespect us and underestimate our intelligence.” Rosario Borres, who depends on an electric wheelchair due to Guillain-Barré syndrome, said he needed cheaper, more reliable power. On a July afternoon, he came to an evangelical church in Santa Isabel to see U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm unveil a new program to provide solar panels to low-income households. He said he voted for Pierluisi in the primary. Now, he said, he may not vote at all. If he does, he said, his vote may go to Dalmau. “I’d rather vote for Juan than the PPD,” he said, referring to the status-quo commonwealth party that served as the statehood party’s traditional opposition. In Cataño, a densely populated city neighborhood across the bay from scenic Old San Juan, Lissette Avilés Ríos, a nun and environmentalist, criticized González-Colón’s support for fossil fuel projects, including a controversial natural gas import terminal operating with federal permits. “She was pushing for more natural gas as the resident commissioner all while she was planning a run for governor,” Avilés Ríos said. Back in Vega Baja, Angel Manuel Ciordia, 75, said he would vote for González-Colón because he believes statehood is the best path forward for Puerto Rico. But he said it’s unlikely to make any difference if Trump wins back the White House. “It all depends on who the president is,” said Ciordia, a retired radio executive, during an interview outside his home. “Trump doesn’t want us.” Historically, Republicans championed statehood for Puerto Rico. In recent years, however, liberals have seized on the issue, conflating the movement with the push to admit the District of Columbia as its own state. The GOP has dismissed the effort as a bid to inflate Democratic power in the Senate, since D.C. is a liberal stronghold, though there’s little evidence to suggest that socially conservative Puerto Rico would yield similar partisan outcomes. Recent GOP rhetoric suggesting Puerto Rican statehood would yield two liberal senators appears to have taken hold among voters. A YouGov poll released Thursday showed 79% of Democrats and just 41% of Republicans supporting statehood. Asked whether they would back Puerto Rico’s independence, Democratic support plunged to 56%, while Republican backing rose slightly to 46%. Overall, however, 59% of Americans said they would support admitting Puerto Rico as a state if that’s what voters on the island wanted. Just 16% opposed statehood, and 25% said they did not know enough to answer. Some voters themselves seemed to shrug off the sovereignty stakes of the election. “I just want the government to help fishermen,” Miguel Santiago said outside a bar on Vega Baja’s main beach. He didn’t have strong opinions about either top gubernatorial candidate but said the effects of climate change are shrinking the fish populations, and those whose livelihoods depend on large catches need the government to provide more subsidies and curbs on imported seafood. William Gibson, 60, a retired teacher sunbathing on the beach, said he had decamped permanently for Colombia. But he rolled his eyes when asked about González-Colón and said he would not cast a ballot for her. In July, Concepción worried that Dalmau could not possibly compete with the well-funded campaigns from the traditional two parties. “Dalmau has a good message, but that isn’t what people see,” he said at the time. “They hear radio ads. They see TV ads. They get what the people with money to pay for them want us to see. And that’s not the Independence Party.” He hadn’t yet decided how he would vote. But he said González-Colón was “smart and more in touch with the people” than the incumbent from her party, Pierluisi, and he was leaning toward voting for her. “Look, I’ve seen her with friends of mine, regular people,” he said. He grew quiet for a moment, then exhaled. “She at least looks like someone who can listen to people.” Since then, however, Dalmau has racked up endorsements from some of Puerto Rico’s biggest celebrities, including the music superstars Bad Bunny and Residente, and scored major interviews with influential local reporters. Meanwhile, comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s “garbage” remark at Trump’s rally went viral, stirring voters’ resentments of Trump for his mishandling of the 2017 hurricane and redrawing the connection between González-Colón and the presidential candidate she supports. At the high school that one of Concepción’s four children attends, Dalmau won students’ mock election. Reached again on Friday afternoon, Concepción said he had changed his mind. It was time to try something different. He said he planned to vote for Dalmau and other candidates running under his Alianza banner. The next four years will change America forever.

All the walking. All the doors knocked on, to open just a crack or slam shut. All the campaign literature that ends up in the trash. All the hours doing this, repeating this routine, having the same conversations — it ultimately comes down to securing votes. Even a single vote. That’s the best any canvasser can hope for. “Hi, my name is Brian. I’m with For Our Future Pennsylvania, and I’m looking for Ms. Dionna,” says 38-year-old Brian Phelps, announcing himself as a volunteer canvasser with the local chapter of the labor union-backed super PAC. Ms. Dionna, like the vast majority of people Phelps is trying to speak with today, is not on the other side of the door. Not home or moved. Phelps makes a note in his canvassing app and moves on to the next house in this stretch of Hunting Park, a mostly lower-income neighborhood in North Philadelphia where Democratic-aligned groups are trying to turn out the vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. Phelps has traveled here from Maryland to assist with the massive on-the-ground effort to reach what algorithms and analysts have determined are the most persuadable and lowest-propensity voters — the people who, with a nudge from a canvasser, might turn out for Harris on Tuesday. It’s Phelps’ first day on the doors in Philadelphia, and things aren’t off to a great start. His first hour was basically a bust. “Even when they’re not home, we’re doing the work,” he says, trying to stay upbeat. “We’re Democrats. We do the work.” There are thousands upon thousands of doors being knocked right now in Pennsylvania, neighborhoods being canvassed and re-canvassed, in a state that will determine the outcome of the election. This work is undertaken by a variety of groups, some that are able to legally coordinate with the Harris campaign and some, like For Our Future, that are not. But their objective is the same: turn voters out for Harris, vice presidential nominee Tim Walz and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, who is fending off a challenge from Republican David McCormick. The Harris campaign alone is on track to knock on 5 million doors by Election Day, according to a senior campaign official. That number represents almost 40% of the population and nearly the total number of households in the state, though it’s likely many of the contacts are repeats. For Our Future has also knocked on over half a million doors since September. For these door-knockers, a day’s work, in a swing state where literally every single last vote matters, often comes down to just a single conversation. “The vast, vast, vast majority of doors, nobody answers. That’s just most of the experience,” says Jamie DeMarco, a state-level director with the Chesapeake Climate Network Action Fund, who was training canvassers last weekend in the Germantown headquarters of For Our Future. “You’re shifting through that haystack to find that needle of that person who only an in-person conversation could move.” Most of the people who sign up to canvass don’t need to be convinced of the stakes of this coin-flip election, but DeMarco drives them home anyway in the 30-minute training he gives to volunteers before they’re let loose: “We are here today because whoever wins Pennsylvania has a greater than 90% chance of winning the White House. And the past two cycles, Pennsylvania has determined the victors. It has flip-flopped and been determined by just a few tens of thousands of votes every time.” Trump won Pennsylvania, the swing state with the most Electoral College votes, by less than a percentage point in 2016, while Biden won it by slightly more than a percentage point in 2020. Now Harris and Trump are virtually tied here, a few days out from the election. “If somebody wins in a landslide, then what you did on the ground, knocking on doors, probably wouldn’t have made the difference either way,” DeMarco says. “But when someone wins by less than a percentage point, you know the ground game is what made a difference.” As impossible as it might be to believe, there are still undecided voters out there, even this close to the election. A recent swing-state poll pegged the percentage of likely voters in the commonwealth who haven’t made up their minds at just over 2% — more than the winning margin in the last two presidential elections. These are the people that both sides, in theory, are trying to identify and get to the polls. But Democrats, by many accounts, are having more conversations like the ones Phelps was attempting to have last weekend on people’s doorsteps. Trump’s campaign, unlike in past elections, doesn’t seem to have an equivalent operation in swing states. It has instead outsourced in-person voter outreach to partisan groups like Turning Point Action and Elon Musk’s America PAC, while the campaign itself has made recruiting activist “poll watchers” the focus of its grassroots efforts. That reality is borne out in the data — by a wide margin, more registered voters reported being contact by the Harris campaign than the Trump campaign in recent weeks, according to the latest Gallup survey. Why is only one side investing in trying to talk directly to swing voters? It’s easier to throw money at commercials and mailers — or, with respect to Trump’s campaign, mobilize volunteers with an eye toward possibly contesting the results. The doors, meanwhile, can be a slog. They require patience, precision and a good pitch that is reinforced at the top of the ticket. It often takes hours just to identify one persuadable voter. Then you have to convince that person to actually vote for your candidate. And even then, there’s little guarantee that conversation will materialize into someone actually voting. There are people who will say anything to get someone off their doorstep. Just ask Phelps and his canvassing partner, Veronica Bell, a 63-year-old paid organizer with For Our Future. Bell has been knocking doors since 2016, and working full-time on this election since April. For a time, Bell was affiliated with the Democratic Party, “but I wanted to be more in service to my neighborhood,” she says, so she turned to a more local operation. And Bell is as good at this work as they come: She knows the city, is outgoing and friendly, not too pushy but pushy enough. Bell knows when to keep a conversation going and when to move on. “Ya’ll were just at my door yesterday, and I told ya’ll yes,” a woman snaps at Bell and Phelps through a doorbell camera. It’s not uncommon for homes in highly targeted neighborhoods to be canvassed multiple times. “Thank you,” Bell says, already looking up her next address. “We got 10 days!” Bell has a few hard and fast rules for canvassing: Knock once or twice, then step back from the door and wait for someone to answer. Don’t unlock a gate or enter an apartment building. Don’t ask a child to open a door. Assume you’re always being recorded on doorbell cameras. No lit in mailboxes. The vast majority of addresses that pop up in MiniVAN, the mobile canvassing app, do not provide Bell and Phelps with the opportunity to make a pitch for Harris and Casey. But the outlook improves once they get through the first two dozen houses. “Will you be supporting Kamala Harris?” Phelps asks a guy who looks like he was just sleeping. “I don’t know.” “We’re 10 days in! Who are you voting for?” “I don’t know.” “You don’t know, but you’re going to vote?” “Yeah.” “Look up Kamala, see what she stands for. Because you know what the other guy stands for? A lot of lies. Don’t believe it. You wonder how he gets to be on the ballot when he’s tried for 34 felonies. I know a guy who had two felonies 30 years ago and he couldn’t work for the post office.” Bell leaves him with some literature and thanks him for his time. And then it’s on to another block. And another. They’re nearly ready to break for lunch when they meet Tahir Hightower, a 39-year-old cook and entrepreneur who says he doesn’t like either candidate. Hightower may be the closest they come all day to a persuadable voter. Only, Hightower isn’t necessarily someone who doesn’t know about the candidates. He just doesn’t see how voting for either one might help him or the country. It’s arguably tougher to get someone to see the utility in voting than selling someone on the merits of a particular candidate. “I’ve seen Kamala, but she says the same thing that Obama said, and nothing’s really changed,” Hightower tells Bell, who asks him if he’s seen Project 2025, the widely unpopular right-wing blueprint for a second Trump term. “I did. But I don’t think he’s bad,” Hightower says of Trump. “How do we know what to believe? I’m not saying I’m OK with him. I’m just undecided.” Bell asks him if he has daughters and sisters. Hightower says he does, and Bell tries to close the pitch with reproductive rights. “We’re talking about the right to have a say-so over your own body. Government should not tell you that,” she says. “You’re right about that. So Donald Trump is against that, that’s what you’re saying?” “Yes. You told me you read Project 2025. Read some more.” “I ain’t letting that stuff scare me.” “10 days.” “I know.” “Think about your daughters and your sisters.” “I am,” Hightower says, signaling that he’s ready to end the conversation and go back inside. “I’m thinking about it. I just don’t know.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/political-astrologists-predictions-who-will-win-presidential-election_n_6722d811e4b0871068fdfd1b","Who Political Astrologists Are Saying Will Win The Election","paige skinner","2024-11-02","Based on his gut, statistician Nate Silver believes former President Donald Trump will win the election. Based on his 13-key system, historian Allan Lichtman predicts Vice President Kamala Harris will win. And based on some planets and moons, astrologers are making their own predictions. Dayna Lynn Nuckolls, who has been a professional astrologer for 17 years, makes her predictions based on a subject’s birth charts or sometimes a bazi chart, which is a type of Chinese astrology. In 2016, she said she predicted Trump would win, and though she didn’t make that prediction public, she said it gave her confidence to begin posting her predictions on social media. This election? Nuckolls says Harris will win. “Kamala Harris is having her Saturn return, her Jupiter return and her Mars return,” Nuckolls told HuffPost on Thursday. “She has the chart of the moment. She in so many ways ― who she is, what she represents, as someone who was born in the mid-1960s ― her chart is the promise of this moment that a Black woman, a child of immigrants and someone who is disrupting the status quo of identity and power in this country, she has the charge for that, and this is her moment.” Nuckolls said that both Harris and Trump are performers. “Both of them are very Venusian, according to their sidereal birth chart, which means you never really know what they really think or feel,” she said. Trump is “sidereal Leo rising,” Nuckolls said, which makes him want to be the center of attention, while Harris’ Saturn and sidereal Aquarius have been beneficial because she doesn’t take any of Trump’s bait. Trump’s age puts him in his seventh house year, which is the house of “open enemies, conflict and competition.” “Because of the way that the sky is right now, and because of the way Kamala Harris’s chart is, in very explicit ways, her chart matches who that competition is and who that open enemy is,” Nuckolls said. There might be reason to believe Nuckolls’ prediction, considering that in January, she predicted that President Joe Biden wouldn’t be on the ballot. Kayla Murphy, a professional astrologer with more than 36,000 followers on the X social media platform, also predicted in March that Biden wouldn’t make it on the ballot and that Harris would be the Democratic nominee. Murphy told HuffPost on Thursday that she has gone back and forth on who she believes will win, but she predicts Harris will be the winner, even if there is a “third variable” at play. Murphy said there will be a Mercury station, “a shadow period the day after the election,” which is similar to “what we experienced with the 2020 election.” “We obviously know that there was a lot of debate around, Was this correct? Were things counted incorrectly?” Murphy said. “Was there, like, someone trying to cheat or rig the election here? So I would not be surprised if we saw similar themes, regardless of who does end up winning.” But she said that right now, Saturn is in Pisces, which “historically has always been a Democratic win.” Real Astrologer Laurie, a professional astrologer with more than 30 years of experience and who has more than 238,000 followers on TikTok, predicted as early as 2023 that Trump would never be president again, and in January, she said if President Joe Biden were to win in November, “it won’t be for long.” She wasn’t convinced he would be the candidate. On Oct. 21, Laurie stuck by her prediction in a TikTok post that has been viewed more than 280,000 times. “From the beginning, I’ve said Trump wouldn’t lead anything again in his lifetime,” she said in the TikTok post. “The second prediction I made in general for the U.S. election was that the party that held the executive power would retain the executive power, that I was not convinced that Biden would be the candidate and that Harris had the better transits.” In August 2020, Amy Tripp, who goes by Starheal on social media, tweeted on X that Harris would run for president in 2024 because it “coincides with her Saturn return.” And 10 days before Biden’s July 21 decision to relinquish his reelection bid, Tripp accurately predicted he would step down on that date. She told Rolling Stone that she predicted July 21 because that was when the full moon, which is “a time of awareness, when something is revealed,” will be at 29 degrees in Capricorn, which “rules the government and old age.” The next four years will change America forever.

We’re going to completely replicate what was going on back then,’ but I think that Kamala has a similar effect on people in terms of her charisma and her sense of humor,” Murphy said. “I think she does — whether people like her or not — bring a lightheartedness to the table that I think people miss in the Obamas.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/presidential-election-results_n_6721248ee4b0b049cc4240d0","When Will We Know The Result Of The 2024 Election?","paul blumenthal","2024-11-02","Four years ago, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans had to wait days to find out the results of the presidential race. For the first time in decades, voters woke up on Wednesday morning still in limbo, unsure which way the country would turn. Now, with just days until the 2024 election, it’s on many minds — will that happen again? Whether the election outcome is known on election night or a few days later will be determined by the combination of two things: how close the margin is and what the rules are for opening, processing and counting mail and early ballots in the key swing states. The biggest factor in the 2020 delay was the dramatic increase in mail voting, as people tried to protect themselves and their communities from illness. But the increase — 65 million mail ballots were cast — ran up against laws in certain states that restricted, and delayed, when those ballots could be opened, processed and counted. It was obvious from the outset of the pandemic that, absent a landslide win, the winner of the 2020 presidential election would not be known on election night. This was, and is still, totally normal. Election results have never actually been finalized on election night. But the public is accustomed to television (and now online) news sources projecting winners based on incomplete results on election night, leading to the perception that the results are conclusive. While the official 2020 result remained in limbo, it was possible to predict which way the election would tilt based on partisan voting behaviors. Since Democrats took pandemic precautions more seriously and then-President Donald Trump spent months discouraging and demonizing mail voting, the outstanding ballots were known to tilt heavily in favor of Joe Biden. This dynamic created a “red mirage” on election night, where the in-person votes cast and counted on Election Day quickly skewed heavily in favor of Trump, while the mail ballots, which were counted later, would cause a “blue shift” in the vote total in favor of Biden. In predictable fashion, Trump exploited this situation in 2020 with a torrent of lies. He declared at 2 a.m. after election night that “a fraud on the American public” had taken place by election workers counting the pro-Biden mail ballots after counting the more pro-Trump in-person votes. “Frankly, we did win this election,” he added. It was the first step in what would become the Big Lie of his attempt to deny, and overturn, the election. He first sought to block the counting of the mail ballots and, when that failed, to prevent states he lost from being counted in the Electoral College vote, which culminated in the attack on the Capitol he fomented on Jan. 6, 2021. Today, those same dynamics remain in effect in many of the key swing states, although there have been some changes. The biggest change is obvious: Far fewer voters in key states are casting mail ballots than in 2020. This could make reporting results quicker in some of these states. On the other hand, some states — specifically Republicans in those states — continue to disallow mail ballots to be processed and counted prior to Election Day. That makes the count slower and helps produce the conditions for the red mirage and blue shift. This is how and when (eastern time) polls in each of the seven swing states close — and what factors will determine when we learn which ones ultimately tilted for either Vice President Kamala Harris or Trump. The swing state with the earliest poll closing time was also one of the last to be decided in 2020. Georgia officials declared Biden the winner of the state on Nov. 19 — two weeks after the election. After multiple audits, state officials determined Biden beat Trump by just 11,779 votes. The long wait for a final result back then was driven by the pandemic-induced deluge of mail ballots and the razor-thin margin. Georgians cast a record 1.3 million ballots by mail in 2020. So far this year, that number is way down, with slightly more than 300,000 mail ballots requested. These ballots can be processed prior to Election Day and counted beginning at 7 a.m. on Election Day. This could speed up the reporting and projection of a final result, but, if that result is as close as it was in 2020, that speed will depend on how many mail ballots are returned on or just before Election Day. With days left before the election, less than 45% of mail ballots have been returned, according to the University of Florida’s Election Lab. Another sign for who will win an Electoral College majority may come from a state not currently seen as a decisive swing state. Florida also reports its results at 7 p.m. and, because it allows mail ballots to be processed and counted before Election Day, it is highly efficient in reporting full results. If Florida — which swung for Trump in 2016 and 2020 — is too close to call at this point, it’s almost a given that Harris is having a good night. Like Georgia, the winner of the North Carolina presidential race in 2020 was not called for a week after election day. Trump won it narrowly by about 74,000 votes. What delayed the final tally back then was, like in Georgia, the large number of mail ballots and the narrow margin between the candidates. But mail voting is down significantly from four years ago, with around 413,000 ballots requested this year compared to a little more than 977,000 returned and accepted in 2020. However, North Carolina Republicans have also heavily restricted the ability of election workers to process and count not only mail ballots, but in-person early votes via new laws passed in 2023. Where election workers could previously process and count both mail ballots and in-person early votes before Election Day, they now must wait to do both until the polls close at 7:30 p.m. on Election Day. This is significant, as a huge chunk of the state’s vote count comes from early in-person voting. So far, nearly 1.9 million North Carolinians have voted early in-person — or around one-third of the state’s total turnout in 2020. “Those who watch election results in North Carolina have come to expect a large chunk of results very soon after polls close,” Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said in a statement in February. “That will not happen this year.” One other change made in North Carolina that will affect when a winner will be declared is to the mail ballot receipt deadline. In 2020, mail ballots in the state could be counted if they were postmarked on or before Election Day and received within the next nine days. Republicans in the state legislature, however, required that mail ballots only be counted if they are received prior to the close of polls on Election Day. The possibility of outstanding ballots stuck in the mail for nine days after the election is one reason why Trump was not declared the winner until 10 days after Election Day. That can’t happen this time. Pennsylvania delivered the necessary electoral votes for Biden to officially clinch the race in 2020 when it was finally called four days after the election. Like many other states, it took time to project a winner in the state due to heavy mail voting during the pandemic, and because Republicans refused to change the law to allow election officials process and count ballots before Election Day. Republicans in the state legislature have maintained that stance. State Senate Republicans refused to consider a bill to allow pre-Election Day ballot processing that had passed the Democratic-controlled House on a party line vote in May, meaning officials can only start counting ballots after polls close on Election Day. So far, Pennsylvania voters have requested more than 2 million mail ballots. That’s down from 3 million in 2020, but is still a lot for election officials to process beginning on Election Day. This means that vote-counting could take time in the state many view as the keystone for the electoral college winner. Unless Harris or Trump runs away with the state, don’t expect a call on election night. In 2020, Michigan was called for Biden in the evening of the Wednesday after Election Day. Among the swing states that year, Michigan counted its crush of mail ballots somewhat faster because poll workers in some cities could process those ballots beginning the day before the election. Poll workers in Michigan should be able to count ballots even faster this time after voters and Democratic Party legislators enacted sweeping constitutional amendments and laws reforming the state’s election code in response to Trump’s effort to undo the state’s election. The most crucial change among them is that large jurisdictions can now begin processing and tabulating mail ballots up to eight days before the election. This means that Wayne County, home to Detroit, can pre-process ballots early to allow them to be quickly counted on election night after the polls close, which is at 8 p.m. for most of the state, but 9 p.m. for a small part of the upper western portion. Election workers already did this in Wayne County during a primary election in August. The county was able to report up to 80% of its mail ballots by 10:30 p.m. on election night thanks to this change, according to VoteBeat. This should allow the state’s reporting to avoid the optics of an extremely lopsided overnight Blue Shift (not that there’s actually anything wrong with that) that Trump and Republicans used for their false claims of fraud. Another change that should speed things along in Michigan is the expansion of in-person early voting. Although voters could vote early in person in 2020, they had to do so with an absentee ballot that would be subject to the same limitations on processing and tabulating as mailed ballots. Now, early in-person votes can be immediately scanned into the system on Election Day and reported as soon as the polls close. Wisconsin, on the other hand, made no such changes. That’s largely due to the fact that Wisconsin’s legislature remains firmly in the hands of Republicans, who, for whatever reason, do not want to speed up the counting of ballots on Election Day. In 2020, Wisconsin was called for Biden in the afternoon of the day after Election Day — a few hours before Michigan. The number of mail ballots should be lower this year than in 2020, but the counting process will be the same. That could delay the reporting of a winner until the next day if the election is as close as it was in 2020 or 2016, both years in which the state was decided by under a point and a half. Determining a winner in Arizona, however, may take longer. In 2020, Biden was projected to win the state in the afternoon on the day after the election, but other calls in recent close races in the state have not been so quick. The Senate race between then-Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally in 2018 took a week to resolve. It took six days after the 2022 gubernatorial election before Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, was declared the winner over Republican Kari Lake. The main reason why election calls can be drawn out in Arizona is because a very large portion of the state’s voters hand-deliver their absentee ballots — which they call “early ballots” — on Election Day. These “late early ballots” accounted for nearly 20% of all votes cast in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous county, in 2022. Arizona law requires election workers to wait to open and process these ballots until the polls close and all voters have left the polling location. This can delay this process from beginning for an hour or more. Arizona Republicans added an additional step in February that will likely draw out this process even further. County election officials now must count and report the number of ballots at the voting location before those ballots are then transported to a central processing location. For these reasons, Maricopa County supervisors warned that achieving a full count of the likely 2 million-plus votes counted there will take between 10 and 13 days. That doesn’t mean it won’t be possible for the press to project a winner before then, but don’t hold your breath. Nevada is the final swing state to see its polls close on election night. The race there is expected to be extremely close, and a call for a winner is highly unlikely for a few days after the election. The state adopted all-mail voting with in-person options following the pandemic, which means that, like Arizona, ballots received on or after Election Day will take time to process and count. Nevada also allows ballots postmarked by Election Day to count if they are received within four days of the election. So, while election officials can open and process ballots prior to Election Day, these late ballots could push any call in a tight race off for days. The next four years will change America forever.

The 2022 gubernatorial race between Democrat Steve Sisolak and Republican Joe Lombardo was similarly not decided in Lombardo’s favor for four days. Meanwhile, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D) was not declared the winner of her race against Republican Adam Laxalt until five days after Election Day in 2022. If the race is as close as polls say, do not expect a call until at least the weekend.

I’m done!” Hewitt had said on Washington Post Live’s “First Look” show, removing his earpiece and storming off. “This is the most unfair election ad I have ever been a part of,” he told Capehart and another Post writer, Ruth Marcus. “You guys are working. That’s fine. I’m done.” Hewitt’s reaction arrived after Capehart suggested Trump was “laying the groundwork for contesting” this year’s vote results, following the GOP presidential nominee’s recent claim that there had been “cheating” in Pennsylvania. Hewitt, who said that he voted for Trump last month, interrupted Marcus as she predicted the former president would “rev up his supporters to contest elections” and also go to court to make “whatever arguments he can, no matter how far-fetched.” “We are news people, even though we have opinions, and we have to report the whole story if we bring up part of the story,” Hewitt said. “Yes, he’s upset about [Pennsylvania’s] Bucks County, but he was right and he won in court,” Hewitt said of Trump. “That’s the story.” Hewitt was referencing a Pennsylvania judge agreeing on Wednesday to extend an early voting deadline in Bucks County. The Trump campaign had sued over reports of long lines and voters being turned away as they waited to apply in person for a mail-in ballot. Capehart said he didn’t “appreciate being lectured about reporting” when Hewitt has shared “lots of things that aren’t basic fact” on the Post show. That response led to Hewitt’s meltdown, and the program subsequently experienced technical difficulties before Capehart brought it to a close. “Everybody, if you’ve been watching ‘First Look,’ you know that these conversations can be interesting, contentious,” Capehart said. “You just saw Hugh Hewitt leave the conversation, which is lamentable, unfortunate. It is what it is.” Hewitt, who has contributed columns for the Post since 2017, told the newspaper’s editorial page editor that he was leaving Friday, as Fox News Digital reported. “I have in fact quit the Post, but I was only writing a column for them every six weeks or so,” Hewitt told the outlet. A spokesperson for the Post, which declined to directly address Hewitt’s exit when contacted by multiple outlets, said, “As the newsroom’s live journalism platform, Washington Post Live is known for its dynamic conversations and thought-provoking perspectives on top issues of the day, such as this morning’s ‘First Look’ program.” The next four years will change America forever.

Here are a few more reviews from people who love it: “Loved this sweater sooo much! Sized up for an oversized office sweater and bought it in two more colors.

Overall it was a good buy for me.” — C Simmons “Super soft, and the turtleneck is not too tight. I’m 5’7” and a medium fits true to size for me, the sleeves are slightly long but I like that. The holes in the knit are a little big, so I just wear a black bra or shirt under so it hasn’t really been an issue.” — Stacey Vasquez “I bought this in four colors: black, lavender, beige and blue—two last year and two this year.

From frequent hand-washing and sanitizing to face masks, there are many ways people can practice strong hygiene and ward off disease when they’re on the road. But after returning home from vacation, there’s another step many still overlook: cleaning their suitcases. “There are two types of people in this world — one who unpacks as soon as they get back from a trip and one who leaves it sitting there for a few days,” Jamie Adams, the “cleanfluencer” behind Jamie’s Journey, told HuffPost. “But how many people take the time to clean their luggage when they get back?” Experts recommend giving your suitcase a good cleaning between every trip you take. “Your luggage picks up more dirt and germs than you might realize, from conveyor belts to hotel rooms,” said Courtney Landry, a product development manager with Norwex. “The exterior of your suitcase becomes a host to millions of bacteria as it travels, collecting dust, dirt and debris.” Cleaning your luggage when you return home is not just about keeping dirt away but about protecting your health by warding off bacteria and other harmful pathogens. Microbiologist Jason Tetro, aka “The Germ Guy,” emphasized that a piece of luggage can be a vehicle for the spread of infection. “Put it this way ― ask yourself if you have cleaned your hands before you touched your face,” he said. “Most likely the answer is no. What was on that handle that could potentially make you sick? You won’t know. No one can, really. So, it’s best to take the precaution and ensure that you are not putting yourself at risk. Luggage touches everything on the journey, so the best thing to do is keep the surface clean and safe.” Don’t forget that suitcase interiors can also get dirty. “The shoes and clothes we wear can bring in dirt and bacteria ― and in some climates, bugs ― inside the suitcase,” Adams said. “So make sure to add cleaning the inside of your luggage to your post-trip un-packing routine!” In addition to protecting your health, cleaning the inside and outside of your luggage will also keep it fresh and help extend the lifespan of your suitcases. “Luggage is quite an investment, so I want to take care of it,” said Patric Richardson, author of “House Love: A Joyful Guide to Cleaning, Organizing, and Loving the Home You’re In.” “I want the suitcase to last, and it’s just nice to have a clean suitcase,” he added. “It makes going on vacation and getting home more pleasant.” Luggage manufacturers typically offer cleaning guidance for their products, which customers should consult, but if you can’t find specific instructions, the experts who spoke to HuffPost also offered their best practices. “The best way to clean the outside parts of luggage would be to get some soapy water or a multi-purpose cleaner and a scrub brush,” Adams said. She recommended getting a bowl or bucket of water and mixing dish soap like Dawn or any multi-purpose cleaner like Mr. Clean with water. “Then, gently scrub the entire exterior with the soapy water,” Adams advised. “Pay special attention to the handle and wheels! The handle is a main touch point that can harbor a lot of bacteria.” In addition to scrubbing the handle and wheels with soapy water, she also recommended running a disinfecting wipe over those areas, as well as the zipper and any other spots you want to treat. “For the most part, the outside parts are like your hands, except that instead of a sink, you can use the tub,” Tetro said. “Soap and water is really all you need to keep them clean and safe. If you would rather not use the tub, then you can always use a disinfectant. Make sure you leave the product on the surface for a minimum of three minutes.” The soap and water approach works for both hard- and soft-shell luggage, though you might want to use a little less water if your suitcase exterior is made of fabric. “The great thing about suitcase fabrics is they’re really durable,” Richardson said. “I dip a towel into a mixture of dish soap and water, and I just kind of wipe it all down. Then I take another towel with clear water and wipe it down again to rinse it.” Be prepared to use some elbow grease on visible spots that require extra care. “There’s no worse feeling than picking up your suitcase from baggage claim and spotting a big scuff or dark stain,” Landry said. She suggested using multipurpose cleaning solution on a damp microfiber cloth. Cleanfluencer Sharon Garcia is a fan of Fabuloso for tougher stains or dirt buildup. At the end of the process, consider putting your suitcase outside for quick drying if it’s warm out, or just let it air out in your house for a bit before putting it away. Do what you can to keep your luggage clean and fresh until you need it again. “I always store my clean luggage in giant trash bags in the garage to protect it from dust and pests,” Garcia said. “This ensures my luggage remains clean and ready for the next adventure!” “The best way to clean the interior of a suitcase is to first use a blow dryer or a handheld vacuum to get rid of dirt or sand that may be sitting in the bottom of the suitcase,” Adams said. “Then scrub the inside with a damp, soapy microfiber cloth.” As with the exterior, use disinfecting spray or wipe the interior down with a disinfecting cloth. “Nothing beats a disinfectant wipe for this purpose,” Tetro said. “It’s quick, reliable and fast. Just make sure that it is compatible with the fabric. You can also spray rubbing alcohol onto the surfaces and let it dry. Alcohol is a great sanitizer for both hands and fabrics.” If you’ve spilled your travel shampoo or soap, try to attack those spots as well. “I use vinegar and water and spray it thoroughly until it’s very damp,” Richardson said. “Then I wipe it clean with a dry towel. Vinegar can cut through soap. And if there’s a moldy smell or anything from packing your suitcase with damp items, that will help as well.” Don’t forget you can often remove your suitcase inserts and wash and dry those separately as well. Otherwise, leave your luggage open to air-dry and prevent moisture buildup. “One of the biggest issues I’ve encountered with luggage post-travel is the funky smells it can hold,” Landry said. “I’ve made it a routine to unpack everything within 24 hours after returning home from travel, giving my suitcase a chance to breathe.” She recommended using an odor-eliminating spray for extra freshness. As you clean your suitcase, take stock of your travel supplies. Assess whether you need new shoe bags or toiletries, for instance. “Part of the cleaning ritual for me might involve putting in a couple of new toothbrushes and travel-sized toothpaste for the next trip,” Richardson said. “Now if someone calls to whisk me away to somewhere glamorous, I’m refreshed and ready to go.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/election-day-not-national-holiday-united-states-ano_l_6723ebe3e4b0871068fea921","Why Is Election Day On A Tuesday?","kelsey borresen","2024-11-02","Many Americans know that Election Day is a Tuesday, but few know why. Even people you’d expect to know, like politicians, have been stumped by this very question. The answer dates back to 1845, when Congress passed a law declaring that federal elections would be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Before that point, states could hold their presidential elections on any day within a certain 34-day window. But this arrangement began to raise concerns as travel and communication improved in the 19th century: Results from states that voted earlier could sway the outcome in states that voted later. OK, so why Tuesday? Keep in mind that in the mid-1800s, the U.S. was largely an agricultural society. Tuesday was chosen because it was most convenient for farmers traveling by horse and buggy at the time. “In 1845, when Congress established a national election day, it had to be a Tuesday because farmers went to church on Sunday, went to market on Wednesday, and may have needed a day, Monday, to get to their polling place,” Gil Troy — an American presidential historian and McGill University professor — told HuffPost. (And in case you’re curious, November was chosen as the month for similar reasons: It was after fall harvest was over but before the cold winter weather set in.) But these days, Tuesdays are actually quite inconvenient for many Americans, particularly those who can’t take time off work to cast their ballots — a problem that disproportionately affects Black, Latino and lower-income voters. In the 2016 presidential election, 14% of registered voters cited “being too busy or having a conflicting schedule” as the main reason they didn’t cast their ballots, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data. In previous elections, that percentage was even higher. Issues also arise when a person’s polling place is far from their workplace or when there are long lines to vote during peak times — like in the morning before work or in the evening after work. “Whether accurate or not, elected officials likely think that making it easier to vote would advantage one party ... at the expense of the other party.” Interestingly, 27 of the 36 countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (made up largely of advanced democracies) conduct their national elections on the weekend. South Korea and Israel hold theirs during the week, but have made the day a federal holiday. One major reason: It comes down to tradition, Troy said. “It is very, very hard to change core American traditions which Americans see not only as propping up their democracy but perpetuating its legitimacy,” he said. “Change often comes slowly, subtly. Reformers will be far more successful adding a few days or options or opportunities than trying to undo Election Day.” That’s not to say no one has tried. A number of bills — like the Weekend Voting Act — have been proposed in Congress over the years, often by Democrats. But they never go far and die in committee without a vote. “Whether accurate or not, elected officials likely think that making it easier to vote would advantage one party — traditionally it is believed to help the Democrats — at the expense of the other party, the GOP,” said Vincent Hutchings, a University of Michigan political science professor. “Again, it is not clear that this is demonstrably true but it is a widespread perception. So, since this effort does not receive bipartisan support, it is difficult to enact.” Plus, some experts say moving to weekend voting could substantially increase the cost of running elections. “Because Saturday and Sunday are Sabbath days for devout Jews and Christians, elections would probably have to be held over the two-day period — creating a need for more poll workers and a process for securing ballots overnight,” Victoria Shineman, a University of Pittsburgh political science professor, wrote in The Washington Post. Politicians, like House Democrats in 2019, have also floated the idea of turning a weekday Election Day into a federal holiday, but to no avail. A 2018 Pew survey found that the majority of Americans (65%) would be in favor of turning Election Day into a national holiday — that includes 71% of Democratic-leaning voters and 59% of Republican-leaning voters. “It is very, very hard to change core American traditions.” Others have suggested making Veterans Day (Nov. 11), which is already a paid national holiday, Election Day. In addition to honoring the sacrifices veterans have made, it would “remind Americans that voting is a national duty, an obligation both to one another and to the nation; and it would strengthen American democratic political culture, by way of new rituals and traditions,” Jill Lepore — a Harvard professor of American history — wrote in an essay for Politico. While some states have made Election Day a civic holiday (though it primarily applies to public workers) and most have laws that require companies to give employees some time off to vote, none of the legislative efforts to enact these changes on a national level have been successful. It’s hard to say. In theory, it seems that any move that would make it easier for Americans to vote would increase participation. But experts say improving voter turnout is a complicated issue that no single “silver bullet” strategy can solve. Countries that have weekend or holiday elections do tend to have better turnout overall. However, those numbers may be attributed to a combination of factors — not solely because their elections occur on non-work days. Consider this: Even if Election Day were moved to a weekend or turned into a national holiday, retail and service industry employees would still need to work. “The types of workers least likely to reap the benefits of a federal holiday are those who already struggle to vote,” Shineman noted. Such a change would mostly benefit white-collar workers instead of the lower-income workers it’s designed to help. “If you make election day a federal holiday, you’ll have all the people who work in these types of jobs still having to work, being inundated with customers who have the day off and they won’t have child care because the schools will be closed,” Suzanne Lucas, who previously worked in human resources, wrote in a piece for Inc.com. “Some businesses may close, but their hourly paid employees will either have to use a PTO day or not get paid.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-does-coffee-make-you-pee-so-much-goog_l_671a79e2e4b00589e7dc35fe","Why Does Coffee Make You Pee So Much?","julie kendrick","2024-11-02","To paraphrase the old adage about beer, you never buy a cup of coffee ― you only rent it. As you wait in the line for the bathroom of your favorite coffee house, you might wonder why this particular bevvie has such a powerful effect on your bladder. Check out what the experts have to say about that journey from first delicious sip to mad dash to pee, and every stop in between. Everything you swallow goes straight to your stomach. Depending on how much is already in there — if this is your first sip of the day or if you’ve just eaten a big meal — it can hang out in the stomach anywhere from five minutes to upward of an hour. Liquids are quicker to digest than solid food, so your body gets to work on an empty-stomach cup of coffee right away, sending it through your intestines, kidneys and on the way to your bladder. And this is where caffeinated coffee is different from some other beverages, according to Lisa Anderson, associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of Minnesota. “The small intestine uses osmosis to absorb the liquid, using energy to pull in sodium and other electrolytes so the liquid follows those particles,” Anderson told HuffPost. “With caffeinated coffee, the caffeine, polyphenols and other coffee molecules are all lipid-soluble, which means they pass easily across the lining of the gastrointestinal tract.” We’ve finally come to the moment of truth, when it’s time to talk about your new word for the day, “micturition,” which Anderson told us is a science-person word for peeing. “Once the fluid has made its way to the bladder, sensors there begin to notice that the bladder is filling up,” Anderson said. “That sets off signals to the micturition center (see, there it is) in your brain stem, which sits by other centers that tell you things like when you’re thirsty, hungry or need to vomit.” Coffee gets the process moving faster because the caffeine it contains provides an extra boost of stimulation to the detrusor muscle, a smooth muscle in the bladder’s wall. (It stays relaxed so the bladder can store up urine, and it contracts when it’s go time.) With your brain and your bladder working together, you suddenly ask the person sitting next to you in the coffee shop, “Would you watch my stuff for a minute while I go to the bathroom?” This fast-track process goes even faster if you have an overactive bladder, Anderson said, citing studies of people with that disorder. Drinking eight ounces of water with caffeine made them go to the bathroom much sooner than when they were drinking just eight ounces of plain water. One more fun fact about the size of your bladder: That short line to the men’s room isn’t only about the patriarchy. It turns out that men “can hold more fluid in their bladders, and hold it for longer,” Anderson said. While anything you drink is eventually going to need to be eliminated, it’s the caffeine in coffee that, um, expedites the process. “Caffeine is a bladder irritant, and when the bladder is irritated, it starts to contract,” said Dr. Rena Malik, a urologist and assistant professor of surgery and director of female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “That contraction is what gives you that sense of what we urologists call ‘urgency,’ which is the sudden desire to go to the bathroom that you can’t delay.” Malik noted that studies have shown that while caffeine does increase urgency, those who consume quite a lot of it — in drinks or food — may build up some resistance. In her practice, she sees a wide variety in each person’s body. “I have some patients tell me that drinking even just a cup of coffee makes their morning miserable, and others can drink quite a lot and not suffer any ill effects.” While coffee is a fluid, caffeine is a diuretic, which means that your kidneys may be pulling more fluid from your system than you’ve just consumed, without hydrating you at all. So, if you feel like you’re peeing more than you just drank, you may be entirely correct. And you need to get some plain old water into your system, stat. The more caffeine you drink, the worse it can get. “The diuretic properties of caffeine kick in at higher levels of consumption,” Anderson said. “You usually need to ingest more than 400 mg of caffeine for it to have a significant impact on your body’s fluid balance.” That’s roughly the amount of caffeine in four cups of brewed coffee, which is also the recommended limit for daily consumption. Malik said a quick way to tell if you’re dehydrated from all that coffee is to check the color of your urine. “If it’s really dark yellow, you need more fluids in your system,” she said. “If it’s almost clear, you’re drinking too much. But if your urine is a lemonade-yellow color, your fluid levels are most likely in a good balance.” If you’d like to cut down on the frequency of your bathroom breaks, you don’t have to go cold turkey on the caffeine, Malik said. “It’s OK to take it slowly, so if, for example, you drink two cups of coffee every morning, try having one regular and one decaf and see what happens.” Finally, if you feel as if most of your life is spent in a toilet stall, Malik urges you to consult a urologist. “People might think, ‘This is just the way I’ve been my whole life,’ but you don’t have to suffer. A urologist can help you look at all your options, including lifestyle changes, medications and procedures.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Chances are you’re not maximizing their full potential,” said Elizabeth Kosich, a certified image consultant and founder of Elizabeth Kosich Styling. They also help extend the life of spring and summer favorites “well past their shelf life,” Kosich added. Stylist Christina Kroll agreed, saying she takes her inspiration from Scandinavians: “Their motto is, ‘There is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing.’ They are experts at layering tights with style for the winter.” Here’s how to wear tights to create the look you are going for, from elegant to edgy, while staying warm and comfortable. “The first rule of wearing tights is that there are no rules,” Kosich said. Because tights have such a wide range in color, textures and patterns, it’s OK to push the limits,” she said. But there is some helpful guidance you can follow. One tip is to choose tights that balance out the color palette of your outfit. “Pair tights in a bright accent color if a dress is neutral, or a more subdued hue that grounds and balances if the dress is vibrant,” Kosich said. Tights can be used to create the feel you’re going for. “Subtle patterns like textured polka dots or delicate lace can elevate a simple dress, while fishnets offer an edgier vibe,” said stylist Stephanie Venita Stimmler. “Tights let you take liberties with shorter hemlines” because they offer more coverage than bare legs, Kosich explained. They make it possible to “wear a micro mini or short shorts” even if you normally shy away from these styles or worry about staying warm when temperatures drop, she said. “Keep [mini skirts] premium and sophisticated in wool, suede or leather materials, and tights should be either in a statement color or tone-on-tone hue that adds texture to the outfit’s composition,” she advised. Stylist Cassidy Montalvo said she loves the trend of tights with “baby doll style mini dresses and ballet flats ― more of an ode to the ’60s, but very feminine and chic.” Tights were traditionally an afterthought, but they can be the main attraction. “Use tights to create an outfit’s focal point that adds a pop of color, texture or both,” Kosich said. She suggested wearing printed tights ― “think florals, python, leopard” ― to “add dimension to airy dresses.” As an alternative, “keep it minimalist with a solid opaque tight in a vibrant jewel tone paired with a monochromatic skirt,” she said. Kroll recommended wearing skirts that “give room to show off” tights because they “can ‘make’ an outfit, akin to accessorizing with purses and jewelry.” Kroll said Americans tend to shy away from wool tights because they think they will be too itchy. She recommended looking for merino wool tights, which are a staple in Scandinavia throughout the winter. Kroll likes wool tights “that feel like a second skin and can be worn under anything.” Merino wool is made with thinner fibers and can actually pull moisture away from your body and keep you from sweating and overheating. Tights don’t have to be a fashion statement — sometimes you just want to stay warm and pull an outfit together. “If you are looking for a nude color tight, I would always go for an opaque style to make sure the color blends naturally and doesn’t stand out too much if the color is off from your skin tone,” advised stylist Kendra Sharpe. Additionally, “fleece tights with flesh color lining” are great for very cold days, said certified image consultant Amrita Harbajan. It’s also possible to stay neutral without going for nude. “Neutral shades like black, navy and gray are versatile and can complement a wide range of colors,” Stimmler said. Montalvo added that neutral tights are a “more professional look” and look tailored. She added that matching the color of your tights to your shoes will make your legs look longer. Almost any kind of shoe can be worn with tights. Kroll is partial to high heels: “Either combine a colorful heel with a muted tight or vice versa — a muted heel color with a colorful tight,” she advised. Another good option is low-cut boots that give “space to show off flattering tights” and “look super chic” with skirts and sweaters, she said. Kosich suggested going for “juxtapositions that create balance” and are unusual. “The more unexpected the pairing, the more chic,” she said. For example, “Go for like sneakers with micro fishnets, combat boots with semi-sheer florals,” Kosich recommended. If those bold looks aren’t for you, she suggested going “for more classic yet chic pairings like Mary Jane flats with oversized fishnets, velvet smoking slippers with back-seamed tights, and classic pumps with tone-on-tone pin dot hosiery.” Sharpe said that while there are exceptions, normally “a closed-toe shoe of any kind is the right way to go.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Before anyone knocks on your door, you start thinking about different ways to use this carved pumpkin after the night’s festivities — pumpkin pie, pumpkin bars, pumpkin soup. Can it be a decoration and food? We spoke to food safety experts about decorative pumpkins and when you can use them as food. “You use a pumpkin as an ingredient or as a decoration, but not as both,” said Darin Detwiler, a professor of food policy at Northeastern University and author of “Food Safety: Past, Present, and Predictions.” Buying a pumpkin, carving it, having it as a decoration and then turning it into food may seem like a good way to avoid food waste, but food safety should be considered to avoid any risks of food-borne illnesses. “Pumpkins are a low-acid vegetable, so once they are cut and set at room temperature, pathogens that may be present will grow rapidly on the flesh,” explained Kimberly Baker, a food systems and safety program team director at Clemson University. “The longer the pumpkin is at room temperature, the more pathogens that grow and can make someone sick if they were to eat the pumpkin.” Once you turn a pumpkin into a jack-o-lantern, it should only be used for decorative purposes for various reasons. We may not follow typical food safety protocols when bringing a pumpkin home. “Often, we are not washing hands before carving, washing the pumpkin, carving them on clean food-safe surfaces or using clean equipment for carving,” Baker said. A cut or carved pumpkin needs to be kept cold to ensure it doesn’t become a host for bacteria. “Once you cut into it, you must keep it below 40 degrees Fahrenheit to be able to use it [for culinary purposes] later,” said Norman Hunt IV, a chef and certified ServSafe manager at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana. “Keep in mind that vegetables, including pumpkins, once cut, are considered a TCS — time and temperature controlled for safety — food,” explained Jonathan Deutsch, a food and hospitality management professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia. “That means that it should be cooked immediately or kept refrigerated and cooked within a couple of days for optimal food safety.” When a jack-o-lantern is left outside, there is a risk bacteria can grow. “In most of the country, October days can get quite warm, encouraging microbial growth. And critters in urban, suburban and rural environments can all climb in and around jack-o-lanterns,” Deutsch said. “It is not safe or advisable to cook and eat leftover jack-o-lanterns, even if it looks to be in good condition.” If you’re thinking, I’ll place my jack-o-lantern indoors so there’s no chance of animals and bugs. There’s still a food safety risk. “Keeping a pumpkin indoors does not make a difference for the safety of eating the pumpkin,” Baker explained. “Pathogens can come from any contact surface, inside or outside, and cause the pumpkin to become contaminated.” Cooking a pumpkin isn’t a solution, either. “Depending on the pathogens, some may not be killed or may leave a toxin behind even if the pumpkin is cooked,” Baker explained. Don’t forget that there are other ways to decorate a pumpkin, whether painting it, using stickers, or other creative methods. “To minimize food waste, one could decorate the pumpkin without cutting it so it can be used as food,” Baker said. “Decorations can be fastened to the outside without puncturing the skin.” Emilie Berner, a chef-instructor at the Institute of Culinary Education, adds, “I’d recommend they get a smaller pumpkin (less waste) or don’t carve it at all and decorate it creatively with paints, stickers, pom-poms, etc.” If you use paints or glitter, she says, “Make sure to cut all of that away before cooking, and don’t drag it through your pumpkin with your knife as you’re working with it.” If you change how you decorate your pumpkin this year so you can eat it, rinse it with water before cooking with it to reduce risks of cross-contamination. “Pumpkins are often associated with contaminated soil and irrigation issues due to proximity to animals,” Detwiler said. “Improper cleaning and lack of hand-washing are key factors that place them into the ‘danger category.’” The truth is most carving pumpkins aren’t the best for eating because they usually don’t have the best flavor or texture, even though they can be consumed. “These pumpkins have a woody texture, a thin wall, and do not have the full flavor as a pie pumpkin that is bred for use as a food,” Baker said. Experts recommend choosing smaller pumpkins to roast for pies or to add to soup (sugar pumpkins are a good option). According to Deutsch, “These are usually much fleshier, sweeter and have a smoother texture when cooked.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Consider saving the seeds and roasting them. “Pumpkin seeds can be roasted and eaten if the seeds are removed at the time of carving and immediately washed and roasted or refrigerated before roasting,” Baker said.

Baker suggested, “Use the carved pumpkin in compost to help fertilize new plants in the spring garden.” Hunt added, “If you know someone with chickens, [pumpkin] makes a great treat!” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) on Friday reminded Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) that he’s a politician and not her doctor as she went after GOP officials for their defense of the state’s strict abortion bans. “I don’t want my governor, I don’t want AG Paxton, I definitely don’t want Ted Cruz telling me what to do with my body if my doctor has a recommendation because the last time I checked, I don’t need any of them to be my doctor,” she told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, referring to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. “I don’t want them to be my elected officials,” she added. Crockett appeared on MSNBC as Hayes highlighted the death of Nevaeh Crain, a Texas teenager and one of at least two pregnant women in the state who died after doctors delayed treating miscarriages, ProPublica reported. “When people talk about women’s lives being on the line in this election, it’s not a slogan, it’s not hyperbole,” said Hayes. He added that women are seeing “preventable deaths right now” due to GOP-backed abortion bans in multiple states following the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide. Hayes later turned to Republicans getting “slippery” on the abortion issue, including Cruz, who he noted has been “anti-abortion his entire career” and is currently in a tight race to defend his Senate seat in Texas. The MSNBC host played a clip of Cruz giving a nonanswer on abortion during a debate last month with his Democratic opponent, Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas). “Why is this an issue you won’t address, about saying whether you support or oppose exceptions like rape and incest?” asked moderator Jason Whitely after Cruz repeatedly dodged the question. “Jason, I’m curious, why do you keep asking me that?” said Cruz, before pivoting to talk of Allred’s opposition to state law requiring parental notification for minors wanting abortions. Hayes asked Crockett if she has “any doubt in her mind” over where Cruz is on abortion. “I have zero doubts,” Crockett said. She later continued, “When you can’t answer a question, that is the answer, right? And the idea that we should just trust you, we shouldn’t trust you. Not when people are dying. You guys are not going to save us. You are going to, again, inflict more pain.” Crockett: I don't want my governor, I don't want AG Paxton, and I definitely don't want Ted Cruz telling me what to do with my body..

Do you want to see me knock the hell out of people backstage?” asked the GOP presidential nominee, who called it a “pretty stupid situation” after rallygoers chanted “fix the mic” during his speech. He later added: “I get so angry. I’m up here seething. I’m seething. I’m working my ass off with this stupid mic. I’m blowing out my left arm. Now I’m going to blow out my right arm and I’m blowing out my damn throat, too, because these stupid people.” He went on to rant about retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, his former chief of staff, before continuing to fume over the apparent microphone issues. Trump also complained about the low height of microphone stands at his events and showed how he would work around such issues, bobbing his head up and down in what many observers suggested was an imitation of oral sex. Trump's closing argument to Wisconsin: four straight minutes complaining about his microphone pic.twitter.com/SieYxQgFhY Trump’s Milwaukee remarks came just one day after he suggested at an Arizona event that former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) would be less of a “radical war hawk” if she experienced guns being “trained on her face.” Cheney — who has endorsed Trump’s 2024 rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris — condemned his imagined scenario, saying: “This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death.” Harris slammed Trump’s remarks about Cheney as “disqualifying,” adding that anyone “who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president.” Trump has a history of using such rhetoric at his rallies. He suggested that a protester could “get the hell knocked out of her” at an event in California last month. The next four years will change America forever.

In central Gaza, Palestinians recovered the bodies of 25 people killed in a barrage of Israeli aerial attacks that began Thursday, hospital officials said. The latest violence comes against the backdrop of a renewed diplomatic push by United States President Joe Biden’s administration, days before the presidential election, to reach temporary cease-fire deals. Israel’s emergency services said seven people were injured before dawn Saturday in attack in the central town of Tira. Three projectiles crossed into Israel from Lebanon, Israel’s military said, and some were intercepted. The Magen David Adom service said two of those injured were in moderate condition from the attack, and the others had milder injuries. A photo the service released showed damage to what appeared to be an apartment building. Israel has stepped up its offensive against Hamas’ remaining fighters in Gaza, pulverizing areas in the north and raising fears of worsening humanitarian conditions for civilians still there. In Lebanon, Israel has broadened its strikes in recent weeks to bigger urban hubs, like the town of Baalbek, home to 80,000 people, after initially targeting smaller border villages in the south, where Hezbollah conducts operations. Iran-backed Hezbollah doubles as a major political party and provider of social services in Lebanon. Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles from Lebanon into Israel in solidarity with Hamas immediately after the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. The yearlong cross-border fighting boiled over to full-blown war on Oct. 1, when Israeli forces launched a ground invasion of southern Lebanon for the first time since 2006. In Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley — where small villages, olive groves and wineries nestled between the country’s mountain ranges had largely been spared the worst of Israeli bombardment until recently — Israel conducted a series of heavy airstrikes Friday, killing at least 52 people, driving more families to flee with whatever they could carry and sending thick plumes of smoke over the horizon. Intensified Israeli airstrikes on and around the northeastern city of Baalbek after Israel issued evacuation warnings have prompted 60,000 people to flee, emptying nearby villages, said Hussein Haj Hassan, a Lebanese lawmaker representing the region. In Lebanon, rescuers searched for survivors after airstrikes killed nine people and brought down a building that had housed 20 people in the town of Younine. Further Israeli strikes killed 12 people in the town of Amhaz and 31 others across at least a dozen villages in Lebanon’s northeast, bringing the total death toll to 52, the Health Ministry said. The bombardment left 72 people wounded, the ministry added. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the deadly strikes. In Lebanon’s capital, Israeli planes pounded the southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight and early Friday for the first time in four days, spreading panic after a rare lull. The Israeli military, which warned residents to evacuate at least nine locations in Dahiyeh, said it hit Hezbollah weapons manufacturing sites and command centers. There were no reports of casualties from Dahiyeh, where fears of Israeli bombings drive a mass outflow of residents each night. Bulldozers rumbled through clouds of dust and smoke Friday, clearing rubble from the pulverized roads where Israeli warplanes had reduced dozens of buildings to their skeletal remains. Formerly home to families and businesses, mid-rise apartment blocks were left open to the breeze, walls blown off and furniture buried. Hezbollah supporters in several locations raised the group’s bright yellow banner atop the rubble. Since the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted in 2023, more than 2,897 people have been killed and 13,150 wounded in Lebanon, the Health Ministry reports, not including Friday’s rising toll. Health authorities say that a quarter of those killed were women and children. Overall, United Nations agencies estimate that Israel’s ground invasion and bombardment of Lebanon has displaced 1.4 million people. Residents of Israel’s northern communities near Lebanon, roughly 60,000 people, have also been displaced for more than a year. Hezbollah has kept up firing rockets into northern Israel, with projectiles launched from Lebanon on Thursday crashing into agricultural areas and killing seven people, including four Thai farm workers. Israel also pressed on with its bombardment of Gaza on Friday, where a barrage of airstrikes hit central Gaza’s Nuseirat refugee camp and killed at least 21 Palestinians — including an 18-month-old and his 10-year-old sister — according to health officials at the nearby Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. Israeli strikes also hit a motorcycle in Zuwaida and a house in Deir al-Balah, killing four more people, hospital officials said, bringing Friday’s overall death toll in Gaza to 25. Israel said it targeted Hamas infrastructure and a militant operating near the Nuseirat refugee camp, but did not comment on the strikes outside the camp. It said it was aware of reports of civilian casualties and was investigating. In a separate announcement, the army said an airstrike on a vehicle in Gaza’s southern town of Khan Younis killed a senior member of the Hamas political bureau, Izz al-Din Kassab, and his assistant, Ayman Ayesh. Hamas confirmed the death of Kassab, who was not well known to the public. Israel alleged he was a coordinator between militant groups in Gaza. As American diplomats left the region after a flurry of meetings with Israeli officials, there were no signs of a breakthrough on a cease-fire in either Lebanon or Gaza. On Friday, Hamas doubled down on its longstanding demands for a permanent cease-fire and complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, saying Israel offered only a temporary pause in the war and an increase in aid shipments in the latest negotiations. There was no immediate comment from Israel. “The proposals do not meet the comprehensive needs of the Palestinian people in terms of security, stability, relief, and reconstruction,” said senior Hamas official Bassem Naem, speaking first to the Hamas-run Al Aqsa TV before confirming the group’s position to The Associated Press. Israel’s blistering war in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants killed roughly 1,200 people in Israel and took some 250 hostages back to Gaza. Health officials inside Hamas-run Gaza do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of the dead in the enclave are women and children. Israeli forces have recently shifted their attention to Hamas militants who they say have regrouped in northern Gaza, renewing an offensive that has trapped tens of thousands of people under intense bombardment without enough food or water. Israeli airstrikes have repeatedly hindered an emergency polio vaccination campaign, which the World Health Organization announced it planned to finally resume on Saturday — but only in Gaza City. Towns further north, like Jabaliya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, remain inaccessible as Israel tightens its siege. The next four years will change America forever.

Some of us have been told since grade school that we have to be twice as good, and work twice as hard, to make it. And even then, our credibility is questioned and we get overlooked for leadership roles. The overarching message I get again and again is that Black women just can’t be that good — that their talent is somehow a facade. Take, for instance, the post-debate assessments of the two vice presidential nominees, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), and of their respective running mates, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The differences across the four nominees were telling. Vance was slick on camera, but ran up a high count of mistruths, according to fact checkers. Walz was generally agreed to have been not as smooth as Vance, but authentic and decent at staying on message. However, in my opinion, neither Vance’s nor Walz’s performances ― nor Trump’s, for that matter ― stood up to Harris’. It was triggering when I heard conservative conspiracy theories that Harris’ Tiffany & Co. earrings were actually listening devices, or that she was given the questions ahead of time. The most egregious claim came from a Dallas preacher claiming that Harris used witchcraft to win the debate. The unspoken premise here is that Black women simply cannot lead or excel without assistance. If they perform well, it means something is wrong or something was rigged. Part of this could be a result of tall poppy syndrome, where people are discounted because of their excellence, not in spite of it. In a CNN panel in September, undecided women voters in Georgia weighed in on the fiery Trump-Harris debate. While polls showed that Harris dominated, some viewers took issue with her performance, not her policies. As a former executive media trainer, I happen to know that Harris’ debate performance was stellar. From establishing authority and rapport with an opening handshake to her disciplined and immaculate message delivery — bio, data, contrast, then bait — Harris was self-possessed, focused and clear. Yet one woman on an “undecided” panel concluded that Harris was a good spokesperson and not much else. She said Harris could represent our country, but that her great showing in the debate didn’t qualify her to lead as president. I’m not sure how this woman, and any others who discount Harris’ excellent debate performance, missed Harris’ trademark powerful Senate hearing takedowns in the past. This was not talk for talk’s sake — it was action. Many of us have realized, from her career as a prosecutor and California’s attorney general, that backing down is not in Harris’ DNA. And that is reinforced by decades of experience. Why should being an eloquent, focused and compelling communicator disqualify her from being a leader? I see this weird contradiction often. My own journey as a Black woman in corporate leadership has been littered with similar critiques: “too composed,” “too strategic,” “too articulate,” “too polished.” It implies that we shouldn’t really have these qualities to begin with. And if we somehow do, it’s a scam. I hear the stories daily. Black women are constantly questioned, demoted or discounted, not for being incompetent but for performing too well.

It’s unnerving when no matter how many credentials you have, some people will still denigrate you as a “DEI hire,” implying that you only got there because the institution needed a Black person to create the impression of diversity.

Being a skilled speaker comes with the territory for a former California attorney general, U.S. senator and now vice president of the United States. There could never be enough polish for these roles. Great leaders must be great spokespeople — it’s how they convey ideas in appealing ways, and get others to share their vision. Some great leaders just happen to be Black women, and it’s OK if that makes some people uncomfortable. Black women like Harris persevere despite the criticism. We simply won’t back down with our polish and leadership qualities, and that’s exactly the kind of leadership our country needs.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/breonna-taylor-hankison-trial-convicted_n_6725892fe4b01e8b242502fd","Jury Convicts Former Kentucky Officer Of Using Excessive Force On Breonna Taylor During Deadly Raid","dylan lovan","2024-11-01","LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — A federal jury on Friday convicted a former Kentucky police detective of using excessive force on Breonna Taylor during a botched 2020 drug raid that left her dead. The 12-member jury returned the late-night verdict after clearing Brett Hankison earlier in the evening on a charge that he used excessive force on Taylor’s neighbors. It was the first conviction of a Louisville police officer who was involved in the deadly raid. Some members of the jury were in tears as the verdict was read around 9:30 p.m. They had earlier indicated to the judge in two separate messages that they were deadlocked on the charge of using excessive force on Taylor, but chose to continue deliberating. The six man, six woman jury deliberated for more than 20 hours over three days. Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer, celebrated the verdict with friends outside the federal courthouse, saying: “It took a lot of time. It took a lot of patience. It was hard. The jurors took their time to really understand that Breonna deserved justice.” Hankison fired 10 shots into Taylor’s glass door and windows during the raid, but didn’t hit anyone. Some shots flew into a next-door neighbor’s adjoining apartment. The death of the 26-year-old Black woman, along with the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked racial injustice protests nationwide. Bernice King, the daughter of Martin Luther King Jr., called the verdict “a long-awaited moment of accountability.” “While it cannot restore Breonna to her family, it represents a crucial step in the pursuit of justice and a reminder that no one should be above the law,” King said in a social media post Friday night. A separate jury deadlocked on federal charges against Hankison last year, and he was acquitted on state charges of wanton endangerment in 2022. The conviction against Hankison carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. He will be sentenced on March 12 by U.S. District Judge Rebecca Grady Jennings. Hankison, 48, argued throughout the trial that he was acting to protect his fellow officers after Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired on them when they broke down Taylor’s door with a battering ram. This jury sent a note on Thursday to the judge asking whether they needed to know if Taylor was alive as Hankison fired his shots. That was a point of contention during closing arguments, when Hankison’s attorney Don Malarcik told the jury that prosecutors must “prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Taylor was alive” when Hankison fired. After the jury sent the question, Jennings urged them to keep deliberating. Walker shot and wounded one of the officers. Hankison testified that when Walker fired, he moved away, rounded the corner of the apartment unit and fired into Taylor’s glass door and a window. Meanwhile, officers at the door returned Walker’s fire, hitting and killing Taylor, who was in a hallway. Hankison’s lawyers argued during closing statements Wednesday that Hankison was acting properly “in a very tense, very chaotic environment” that lasted about 12 seconds. They emphasized that Hankison’s shots didn’t hit anyone. Hankison was one of four officers charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2022 with violating Taylor’s civil rights. Hankison’s verdict is the second conviction from those cases. The first was a plea deal from a former officer who was not at the raid and became a cooperating witness in another case. Malarcik, Hankison’s attorney, spoke at length during closing arguments about the role of Taylor’s boyfriend, who fired the shot that hit former Sgt. John Mattingly at the door. He said Walker never tried to come to the door or turn the lights on as police were knocking and instead armed himself and hid in the dark. “Brett Hankison was 12 inches away from being shot by Kenneth Walker,” Malarcik said. Prosecutors said Hankison acted recklessly, firing 10 shots into doors and a window where he couldn’t see a target. The next four years will change America forever.

They said in closing arguments that Hankison “violated one of the most fundamental rules of deadly force: If they cannot see the person they’re shooting at, they cannot pull the trigger.” Neither of the officers who shot Taylor — Mattingly and former Detective Myles Cosgrove — were charged in Taylor’s death. Federal and state prosecutors have said those officers were justified in returning fire, since Taylor’s boyfriend shot at them first.

On Sunday, the 47-year-old singer was speaking to the crowd when he accidentally fell through an open hatch onstage during a show with the British rock band at Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium. In a clip shared on X (formerly Twitter), the Coldplay frontman is seen walking backwards on the stage when he suddenly plummeted through the hidden entrance. The startling moment left the crowd gasping as Martin briefly struggled to hoist himself up out of the unexpected opening. After picking himself up, Martin told the audience: “That’s not planned!” He then quipped, “Holy shit, that was nearly a YouTube moment!” before expressing gratitude to one of the crew members for “catching” him amid the plunge.

U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sided with the state in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in the Iowa capital of Des Moines on behalf of the League of Latin American Citizens of Iowa and four recently naturalized citizens. The four were on the state’s list of questionable registrations to be challenged by local elections officials. The state’s attorney general and secretary of state argued that investigating and potentially removing 2,000 names would prevent illegal voting by noncitizens. GOP officials across the U.S. have made possible voting by noncitizen immigrants a key election-year talking point even though it is rare. Their focus has come with former President Donald Trump falsely suggesting that his opponents already are committing fraud to prevent his return to the White House. In his ruling Sunday, Locher pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision four days prior that allowed Virginia to resume a similar purge of its voter registration rolls even though it was impacting some U.S. citizens. He also cited the Supreme Court’s recent refusal to review a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision on state electoral laws surrounding provisional ballots. Those Supreme Court decisions advise lower courts to “act with great caution before awarding last-minute injunctive relief,” he wrote. Locher also said the state’s effort does not remove anyone from the voter rolls, but rather requires some voters to use provisional ballots. —- Hanna reported from Topeka, Kansas, and Goldberg, from Minneapolis.

Numbers from the American Cancer Society show that colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women in the United States, when skin cancer is excluded from the statistics. While colorectal cancer can be fatal, there has been a drop in death rates from the disease in recent decades. The American Cancer Society attributes the decrease in deaths to the wider use of screenings and patients’ willingness to commit to lifestyle changes post-diagnosis. Along with age and family history, there are a number of factors that can put people at a higher risk of getting colorectal cancer. Those factors include having diets heavy in red meat and processed proteins, as well as eating too little fiber and overconsuming foods that are high in fat. Tobacco use, excessive alcohol drinking and weight issues can also be contributing factors. In addition to leading the popular teen drama “Dawson’s Creek” from 1998 to 2003, Van Der Beek also appeared in the medical series “Mercy” and played a sensationalized version of himself on ABC’s “Don’t Trust the B in Apartment 23.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Over the weekend, the 27-year-old actor, announced in an Instagram post that she participated in early voting for Democratic presidential candidate Harris for the 2024 election. “There is so much on the line this election,” she wrote on Friday alongside a photo of an “I Voted Early” sticker on her jeans. “I believe the government has no right over my body as a woman, and that the decisions over my body should come ONLY from myself and my doctor. Kamala Harris will protect that for us.” The “Equalizer” star went on to open up about her sexuality, describing herself as a “gay woman.” “I believe in the need for legal protections that protects the LGBTQ+ community as a gay woman,” she continued. “We need protections in this country and to have access to the care we need and deserve.” Moretz wrapped up her message by calling on her 24 million-plus followers to vote early. “Are you voting early? Let’s get a plan together to get to your polling place with your friends!” she added. “Go to IWillVote.com to figure out the best plan for you.” The “Kick-Ass” actor has been romantically linked to model Kate Harrison since 2018 after the two were spotted kissing at Nobu in Malibu, California.

Leaning into lies about a stolen 2020 election during a Sunday rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania, the former president told supporters that it was a mistake for him to relinquish the presidency in January 2021. “I shouldn’t have left,” he said. “I mean honestly, because we did so well.” Over the past four years, Trump has continued to maintain that the 2020 results were “rigged,” opting to ignore more than 60 court decisions debunking voter fraud claims made by him and his allies. An October report from the Associated Press found that it is “virtually impossible to pull off a large-scale vote-rigging operation that could tip a presidential race.” ""I shouldn't have left"" -- Trump now says he shouldn't have left office on January 20, 2021 pic.twitter.com/RfCKvUS4YA Trump’s baseless claims of a stolen election have resulted in real-life discord. On Jan. 6, 2021, a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in hopes of blocking the election from being certified by Congress. The Republican presidential candidate has already been trying to lay ground for supporters to refuse a potential loss in 2024 as well. Earlier this week, in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump declared that the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania was “cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before.” Elsewhere during his Sunday rally speech, Trump also struck a threatening tone toward journalists in the crowd. While speaking behind panes of bulletproof glass (which was implemented after the assassination attempt on him in Butler, Pennsylvania), he said, “To shoot me, someone would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that.” He also accused news networks CNN and MSNBC of being “crooked as hell.” “The media is so damn bad,” he said. “It’s unbelievable.” Following his remarks, the Trump campaign claimed that his comments were not a threat toward the media but were referring to the two assassination attempts he’s faced.

While making a final campaign stop in Pennsylvania on Saturday for Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden called Harris’ rival someone “you’d like to smack in the ass” while slamming Trump’s policy goals during the event in Scranton. “There’s one more thing Trump and his Republican friends want to do. They want to have a giant tax cut for the wealthy,” Biden told members of the local carpenters’ union in his hometown. He then seemingly referenced Trump’s supporters, continuing, “Now, I know some of you guys are tempted to think it’s macho guys.” “I tell you what, man, when I was in Scranton, we used to have a little trouble going down the plot once in a while. These are the kind of guys you’d like to smack in the ass,” Biden added, gritting his teeth as the crowd laughed. Last week, Biden responded to the racist comments made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at an Oct. 27 Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” “In my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent honorable people,” Biden said of Puerto Ricans during a call with the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino on Tuesday night. “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters… his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.” In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Andrew Bates, a senior deputy press secretary at the White House, said Biden “referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage,’” alongside a transcript released by the White House press office. The transcript rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading “supporter’s” rather than “supporters,” which aides said indicated Biden was criticizing Hinchcliffe and not the American citizens who support Trump. Biden also later personally clarified his comments in a post on X. “Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” he wrote.

Kennedy Jr., despite the universal recognition by health groups of the safety and benefits of adding fluoride to drinking water. In a social media post Saturday, Kennedy, widely known for his anti-vaccination views and his now-defunct White House run, said a new Trump administration would push to ban the practice by cities quickly. “On Jan. 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,” Kennedy said, before asserting, without evidence, it caused various ailments. NBC News on Sunday reported that Trump, who has said Kennedy would play a big role in health care policy if he wins the presidential election, appeared to have no qualms with Kennedy’s post. “Well, I haven’t talked to him about it yet, but it sounds OK to me,” Trump said when asked about that plan. “You know, it’s possible.” Fluoridation has been shown to help prevent tooth disease. The American Dental Association calls fluoridation “a safe and effective way to prevent tooth decay and has played a major role in in [sic] improving the public’s dental health for more than 70 years.” Other health care groups supporting fluoridation include the American Medical Association, the World Health Organization and the Centers on Disease Control, which called it one of the major achievements in public health in the 20th century.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-election-2024-trump-rally_n_6727d272e4b0cfb9cc69d53a","Trump Talks About Reporters Being Shot And Says He Shouldn't Have Left White House In 2020","jill colvin, darlene superville, bill barrow , jonathan j. cooper","2024-11-03","LITITZ, Pa. (AP) — Donald Trump gave a profane and conspiracy-laden speech two days before the presidential election, talking about reporters being shot and suggesting he “shouldn’t have left” the White House after his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. In remarks Sunday that bore no resemblance to his standard speech in the campaign’s closing stretch, the former president repeatedly cast doubt on the integrity of the vote and resurrected old grievances about being prosecuted after trying to overturn his defeat four years ago. Trump intensified his verbal attacks against a “grossly incompetent” national leadership and the American media, steering his Pennsylvania rally at one point on to the topic of violence against members of the press. The GOP nominee for the White House noted the ballistic glass placed in front of him at events after a gunman’s assassination attempt in July at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and Trump talked about places where he saw openings in that protection. “I have this piece of glass here,” he said. “But all we have really over here is the fake news. And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much.” It was the second time in recent days that Trump has talked about guns being pointed at people he considers enemies after he suggested former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic, wouldn’t be willing to support foreign wars if she had “nine barrels shooting at her.” His remarks also reflect that with less than 48 hours before Election Day, Trump continues to promote falsehoods about elections and argue that he can only lose to Democrat Kamala Harris if he is cheated, even though polls suggest a tight race. Some of his allies, notably former chief strategist Steve Bannon, have encouraged him to prematurely declare victory on Tuesday even if the race is too early to call. That’s what Trump did four years ago, kicking off a process of fighting the election results that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. His campaign later sought to clarify his meaning in talking about the media. “President Trump was brilliantly talking about the two assassination attempts on his own life, including one that came within 1/4 of an inch from killing him, something that the Media constantly talks and jokes about,” campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. “The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else.” Harris, meanwhile, told a Michigan church congregation on Sunday that God offers America a “divine plan strong enough to heal division,” The two major candidates offered starkly different tones with the campaign almost at an end, as Harris said voters can reject “chaos, fear and hate.” She was concentrating on Michigan, beginning the day with a few hundred parishioners at Detroit’s Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ. It marked the fourth consecutive Sunday that Harris, who is Baptist, has spoken to a Black congregation, a reflection of how critical Black voters are across multiple battleground states. “I see faith in action in remarkable ways,” she said in remarks that quoted the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah. “I see a nation determined to turn the page on hate and division and chart a new way forward. As I travel, I see Americans from so-called red states and so-called blue states who are ready to bend the arc of history toward justice.” She never mentioned Trump, though she’s certain to return to her more conventional partisan speech in stops later Sunday. But Harris did tell her friendly audience that “there are those who seek to deepen division, sow hate, spread fear and cause chaos.” The election and “this moment in our nation,” she continued, “has to be about so much more than partisan politics. It must be about the good work we can do together.” Harris finished her remarks in about 11 minutes — starting and ending during Trump’s roughly 90-minute speech at a chilly outdoor rally in Pennsylvania. Trump usually veers from subject to subject, a discursive style he has labeled “the weave.” But outside the Lancaster airport, he went on long tangents and hardly mentioned his usual points on the economy, immigration and rote criticisms of Harris. Trump also referred to John Bolton, his former national security adviser and now a strident critic, as a “dumb son of a b—.” And he repeated familiar and debunked theories about voter fraud, alleging that Democrats could only win by cheating. Public polls indicate a tight and competitive race across the battleground states that will determine the Electoral College outcome. “It’s a crooked country,” Trump said. “And we’re going to make it straight. We’re going to make it straight.” Harris pushed back at Trump’s characterizations of U.S. elections, telling reporters after the church service that Trump’s comments are “meant to distract from the fact that we have and support free and fair elections in our country.” Those “good systems” were in place in 2020, Harris said, and “he lost.” The vice president said she trusts the upcoming vote tally and urged voters, “in particular people who have not yet voted to not fall for this tactic, which I think includes, suggesting to people that if they vote, their vote won’t matter.” Separately, the vice president tacitly acknowledged the significant population of Arab Americans in Michigan, and that community’s voters who are angry at the Biden administration for its continuation of the U.S. alliance with Israel amid the Netanyahu government’s war against Hamas in Gaza. “I have been very clear that the level of death of innocent Palestinians is unconscionable,” Harris told reporters Sunday after the church service. “We need to end the war, and we need to get the hostages out. And as president of the United States, I will do everything in my power to achieve that end.” Trump, for his part, acknowledged that he was sidestepping his usual approach with his conspiratorial speech. He repeatedly mentioned how he disregarded the advice of his aides, telling their side of the story in a mocking voice and insisting that he had to talk about election fraud. Co-campaign manager Susie Wiles, long credited with bringing order to Trump’s often-chaotic political operation, watched the former president silently from off stage. Trump at one point suggested that he wouldn’t deliver this version of his speech again: “I hope you’ve enjoyed this,” he said, “because I’m only doing this one time.” ___ Superville reported from Detroit, Barrow from Washington and Cooper from Phoenix.

Epstein spilled details on his decade-plus relationship with the New York real estate mogul during an August 2017 interview with Wolff, who published audio excerpts from the conversation on The Daily Beast on Saturday. In the recordings, which were reviewed and authenticated by The Daily Beast, the late businessman describes his one-time friend in disparate terms, calling him both “charming” and a “horrible human being.” The tapes will be discussed in further detail on Wolff’s “Fire and Fury” podcast on Monday. “He’s charming. In a devious way, he’s charming,” Epstein said in the recordings. The Fire and Fury author has caused shockwaves with his recordings of Epstein talking about Trump. Here is their true story.https://t.co/Hcs4srLWjV pic.twitter.com/hmcpb06jqh “To some extent it’s a typical tragedy where he believes his own bullshit,” he continued. “He has delusions of grandiosity, then he takes it on board.” During the conversation, which took place two years before Epstein died by suicide in 2019 after being hit with child sex trafficking charges, he also characterized Trump as an untrustworthy womanizer with a nasty temper. “He does nasty things to his best friends, best friends’ wives, anyone who he first tries to gain their trust and uses it to do bad things to them,” Epstein said. Elsewhere in the interview, the late millionaire claimed that, despite Trump being “functionally illiterate,” he was still a “brilliant” businessman. “With respect to real estate deals, he’s brilliant. He’s a salesman. He knows real estate really well,” Epstein said. “Anything else but that? He knows nothing. No history, no strategy. … He certainly can’t read a balance sheet, which is funny.” While Trump once called Epstein a “terrific guy” in a 2002 interview with New York magazine, he distanced himself from the ex-banker after his 2019 arrest. “I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,” Trump told a team of White House reporters at the time. The former president’s campaign team attacked Wolff’s reporting in a response given to The Daily Beast, calling the story full of “outlandish false smears” that amount to “election interference.” The next four years will change America forever.

The ad, paid for by Vote Common Good, a religious nonprofit aimed at urging religious people to vote Democrat, begins with two male friends walking into the voting center together. “Come on, boys. Let’s make America great again,” one of the men says to another, referencing former President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. As the ad shows one man contemplating his vote while in the voting booth, the narrator, actor George Clooney, says, “Before you cast your vote in this election, think about how it will impact the people you care about the most. Remember, you can vote any way you want and no one will ever know.” After the man votes for Harris, his daughter runs up to him and they hug. The man assures his friend that he did his “patriotic duty.” “What happens in the booth stays in the booth,” Clooney says at the end of the ad. “Vote Harris/Walz.” The ad is a gender-swap from a previous ad narrated by actor Julia Roberts aimed at women. That ad, also paid for by Vote Common Good, shows women decked out in patriotic gear voting for Harris. After she’s done voting, a man in a ball cap with a bald eagle on it, who is perceived to be her husband, asks her if she made the right choice. “What happens in the booth stays in the booth,” Roberts says at the end of the ad. “Vote Harris/Walz.” Trump criticized Roberts for her role in the ad. On Saturday, he called into “Fox and Friends” and said he was “disappointed” in Roberts. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pennsylvania-democrats-puerto-rico-voters-tony-hinchcliffe_n_67271b10e4b07ebc5a298924","Pro-Trump Comic’s Puerto Rico Insult Raises Democrats' Hopes In Pennsylvania","daniel marans","2024-11-03","NAZARETH, Pa. — Pennsylvania Democrats believe comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s insulting remarks about Puerto Rico at Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Oct. 27 are already helping turn out Puerto Rican voters who might have otherwise stayed home in this critical swing state. Out of the seven battleground states that will decide the winner of Tuesday’s election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Pennsylvania has the largest population of Puerto Ricans. The Keystone State’s nearly 500,000-person Puerto Rican population is concentrated in North Philadelphia, the Lehigh Valley, Reading and Hazleton. The same day Hinchcliffe’s remarks shook the political firmament, Harris had been campaigning in the Puerto Rican community in North Philadelphia. “I have heard from the Puerto Rican community directly about how much they were offended” by Hinchcliffe’s remarks, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) said Saturday while campaigning for Anna Thomas, a Democratic running for Pennsylvania state representative. “I think it woke up the community in a way that is going to turn them out in even greater numbers for Kamala Harris.” Pressed to explain why these remarks might resonate with voters who are not already firmly in one corner, when so many other Trump or Trump-related comments have failed to damage him, Shapiro said, “This is my sense from being all over the state: that it broke through, and it resonated in a way with the community, where it made them say, ‘Well, wait a minute, that guy’s not for us. That guy doesn’t respect us.’” “They keep saying, ‘Oh, he’s only a comedian.’ It still hurts.” State Rep. Josh Siegel (D), who represents Allentown, a city that’s a Puerto Rican hub, and Lamont McClure, executive of Northampton County, had similar assessments at the campaign event on Saturday. “It’s had an undeniable impact on the ground here in the Lehigh Valley,” Siegel said. Reached by phone on Saturday, Philadelphia City Council member Quetcy Lozada (D), who is Puerto Rican, said her office had received messages from people who voted for Trump and wanted to know if they could change their votes. (They cannot.) Lozada, who accompanied Harris to a Puerto Rican restaurant while she was campaigning in North Philadelphia, has also heard from many constituents who say their friends and relatives were either leaning toward Trump or were not planning on voting until they heard about Hinchcliffe’s insult. It’s a marked change from the mixed results Lozada had gotten some days while door-knocking for Harris in parts of North Philadelphia before Hinchcliffe’s remarks. “I’ve seen a huge level of anger and feeling of disrespect,” Lozada said. “I think we will see folks who were undecided up until just this week turn out for Harris. We are going to see Puerto Ricans come out in record numbers to demand to be respected. And they’re going to demand that through their vote.” Strategists from both major parties are still reeling from a critical moment in Trump’s xenophobia-filled rally on Oct. 27 that Democrats hope could provide a marginal advantage in the final days. While delivering a comedy set filled with racist jokes, Hinchcliffe, a comedian based in Austin, Texas, described Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean.” In a rally full of nativist and racist remarks, Hinchcliffe’s comments nonetheless stood out for the politically important constituency they offended. Republican-elected officials from Florida and other Puerto Rican-heavy states and districts rushed to condemn the remarks. Puerto Rican pop stars Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Ricky Martin responded that night by sharing a Harris video appeal to Puerto Rican voters. The Trump campaign took the rare step of distancing him from the insulting comedy set, saying that the “joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.” But Trump’s Puerto Rican critics have faulted him for failing to apologize or to condemn Hinchcliffe’s remarks right away while taking the podium. “I specifically asked the audience, ‘OK, what about if Trump today, all of a sudden, decides to apologize … Would that be OK? Would you take that in consideration?’” Victor Martinez, host of a Spanish-language morning radio show popular throughout Pennsylvania, said on CNN on Tuesday. “Overwhelmingly, everybody was like, ‘Nope, too late.’” Seeking to capitalize on the blowback Trump has gotten, the Harris campaign dispatched the vice president’s sister, Maya Harris, and Puerto Rican musical theater artist Lin-Manuel Miranda to rally Puerto Rican voters at the Puerto Rican Beneficial Society in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on Thursday. Harris is due to hold a rally in neighboring Allentown on Monday afternoon. HuffPost spoke with several Puerto Rican voters outside of a CTown Supermarket on Bethlehem’s south side, across the street from the Puerto Rican Beneficial Society. Nilsa Vega and Neidel Pacheco of Hellertown, a borough south of Bethlehem, both said they had never voted before, but Hinchcliffe’s remarks were the reason they planned to vote for Harris on Tuesday. “That hit the spot right there,” Vega said. “They keep saying, ‘Oh, he’s only a comedian.’ It still hurts.” Pacheco saw Trump’s decision to pose in a garbage truck at a campaign stop in Wisconsin the following day as an additional insult. “If he didn’t have nothing to do with it, what’s he doing in the garbage truck?” Pacheco asked. Sergio Martinez, a warehouse worker from Bethlehem, said he had never voted before and is torn about whether to vote now. He thinks Trump “kept the country strong — as far as economy-wise — and kept the borders a little tighter.” The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steps-per-day-moderate-activity-an2_n_6727aab3e4b0c08c52a58591","Forget 10,000 Steps A Day — This Is The Number You Should Focus On Instead","am i doing it wrong?","2024-11-03","How many steps have you taken today? Most of us have been confronted by that question at some point in our lives, and many of us use our step count as a metric to gauge how active we are. For years we’ve been told that getting at least 10,000 steps is crucial to maintaining our health, but how did that number get chosen and is it really accurate? That’s what we — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — discussed with Heather Milton, an exercise physiologist at NYU Langone Health in New York, when she stopped by our studio to give us tips and tricks for exercising better. “We always hear about 10,000 steps, and I actually read that that number is based on this pedometer that was designed in Japan [in the 1960′s],” Michelson said. “The [Japanese character] for 10,000 looks like a person walking, so... it just sort of became known for that.” Even though that specific figure wasn’t based on medical or scientific research, it has remained the benchmark for our daily step goal for decades. “There has been more recent literature that looked at [10,000 steps] per day, and how that’s related to 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity per day,” Milton told us. “The idea is if you’re getting the right intensity of that [10,000-step] walk, then you’re getting the CDC and ACSM recommended amount of aerobic exercise per day, because it equates to about 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity.” However, not all steps are created equal. “When you’re counting steps, does that mean like I got up and walked to get water and came back? That’s probably not moderate intensity,” she said. That’s why Milton emphasized that in order for us to get the most out of our walks, our pace should be brisk enough to keep us from being able to easily chat while we’re doing it, which she referred to as “the talk test.” “If you and I were trying to have a conversation, would you only be able to answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to my questions? Or could we be chatting like this?” she asked. “There’s a threshold dose or intensity dose that then lends towards increasing your health, and if we’re looking at heart rate ranges, [that’s] about 60... 64 to 76 technically... percent of your max heart rate. That zone is your moderate intensity zone.” Aside from intensity, different step counts can provide different results based on other factors, like age. A 2019 study involving 16,741 women who ranged in age from 62 to 101 found that “4,400 steps a day was associated with a 41% reduction in mortality compared with walking 2,700 steps a day, [and walking] around 7,500 steps was associated with a 65% reduction.” Another study showed progressively decreasing risk of mortality for people under 60 when they logged 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day. Because there’s so much to consider when attempting to use step count to determine our fitness, Milton suggested we stop concentrating so specifically on our steps and instead focus on a different number: 30. Not only is 30 the number of minutes of moderate activity we want to aim for each day, it’s also the maximum number of minutes we should allow ourselves to remain seated or sedentary at any given time during the day. “Sedentary time is a whole other risk factor for health,” she noted. Inactivity can contribute to countless medical issues, including obesity, high blood pressure, certain cancers and mental health issues, so the less sedentary we are, the better our health and well-being may be. “The sweet spot for breaking up sedentary time [is moving] every 30 minutes,” Milton said. “If you’re walking, your steps are contributing to that [and that’s] helping your health from a different domain.” That’s why she likes using steps as a “simple tool — an objective measure of if [my client] got some activity or didn’t that day.” “So, for the general population, if you have a Fitbit or another device that’s counting your steps, you can see how low they are,” she said. “Then you can set goals for increasing it over time.” If we see a meager end-of-the-day count, that could indicate we were sitting or sedentary for much of the day. “10,000 [steps] may not be what you want to set [your goal to],” Milton said. “It may just be to increase it by 200 [steps]. Then you can increase slowly over time, so you’re getting more active time. It may not be structured exercise, but it is physical activity. And that can help with your metabolism and your overall health.” The Mayo Clinic notes that we can also break up sitting time by finding ways to walk while we work, like taking a walk with colleagues instead of sitting during a meeting, using a standing desk (or working while standing at a counter) for parts of the day, or standing for a bit while we do an activity we’d normally do sitting, like talking on the phone or watching TV. During our conversation with Milton we also learned why we might be warming up all wrong (and how to do it better), the truth about spot training, and much more.

Still, Trump doesn’t believe it, having expressed his skepticism last month during a campaign stop at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania, where he cooked fries and handed out food in the drive-thru. Throughout his campaign, Trump and his supporters have waged sexist attacks against Harris. In July, Trump said if Harris is elected, she would be “like a play toy” with world leaders. Last week, the former president’s supporters paid for a billboard in Ohio of a fake photo showing Harris about to engage in a sex act, along with text that read, “Kamala can’t talk right now. She’s at a baby shower.” The billboard was removed.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-indian-americans-excited_n_6726f1d9e4b0c08c52a56fcc","Indian Americans Are Excited For Harris. But Her Identity Is Not The Main Factor.","daniel marans","2024-11-03","BASKING RIDGE, N.J. — Retired librarian Rajesh Agrawal first came to New Jersey from Uttar Pradesh, India, to attend Montclair State University with her husband in 1963. A widowed grandmother now living in the Indian American hub of Edison, New Jersey, she has lived a slice of the American dream, having raised two American daughters — one a pediatrician, the other a teacher. For Agrawal, electing Vice President Kamala Devi Harris — whose mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was an Indian immigrant — as president would fulfill a longstanding wish. “I always dreamed that one day an Indian will be the president of the country,” Agrawal said. “And it’s happening now!” If Harris defeats former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, she will be the first woman president, the second Black president, the first South Asian American president, and the first Asian American president of any kind. Perhaps because there are still only 4.4 million Indian Americans in the country, of whom 2.1 million are eligible to vote, the community’s response to Harris’ nomination has elicited limited attention. Their response has been positive. Harris is the choice of the overwhelming majority of Indian American voters, according to polls; many Indian Americans are celebrating the opportunity to have one of their own in the White House. But Agrawal’s comments are more the exception than the rule among Harris’ Indian American supporters, who emphasize that their support for her candidacy is rooted, first and foremost, in policy, not identity. And Harris’ historic status as the first Indian American vice president has not been enough to overcome divergent partisan allegiances and ideological views within the Indian American community. Karan Virmani, the chief financial officer of a logistics company and a co-chair of the New Jersey chapter of South Asian Americans for Harris, said Harris’ nomination had inspired his 15-year-old daughter to become more active in politics. She recently helped lead a push to make Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, a school holiday in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. “She didn’t think she could” affect politics, Virmani said. “Now she believes she can. She believes her voice is important.” Similarly, Radhika Sharma, a technology worker who co-chairs the South Asian American Caucus of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee along with Parul Khemka, has an “emotional response” when she sees Harris speak. “It is a sense of pride,” she said. Sharma was quick to add though: “The crowd that I deal with, they’re very conscious not to get biased by just the fact that her heritage is common with ours. They still want to rate her or judge her based on her merit.” “I really just want the best person for the job.” Nina Agrawal, Rajesh’s pediatrician daughter, said Harris’ identity was a plus, but nothing more. “I really just want the best person for the job,” Agrawal, a Manhattan resident, said. “But I think it’s kind of cool that she is both Black and Indian. It’s a sign of the country changing.” Sharma, Nina and Rajesh Agrawal, and Virmani were among the roughly 100 attendees at a mid-October canvass kickoff in a northern New Jersey park organized by South Asians for Harris in partnership with the South Asian American Caucus of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. Harini Krishnan, the national organizing chair for South Asians for Harris, flew in from California to help with the event, which was timed to coincide with an early celebration of Diwali, though the holiday officially took place on Thursday. New Jersey is home to more than 430,000 Indian Americans, who make up nearly 5% of the state’s population — more than any other state in the country. The Garden State is not in contention in the presidential race, and Democratic Rep. Andy Kim is the runaway favorite for an open U.S. Senate seat. Those present at the event were mainly there to knock doors for Democrat Sue Altman, who is running to unseat Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R) in a northwestern New Jersey seat that is home to nearly 69,000 Asian Americans — 9% of the district’s population. The centerpiece of the event was an early Diwali ceremony in which Kim and Altman were both given the honor to light the diya (oil lamp) before delivering speeches about the stakes of their campaigns. Polling data suggests Sharma’s view is common among Indian Americans. Just 23% of Indian Americans called Harris’ Indian identity “extremely” or “very” important to them, compared to 41% who said her identity as a woman is “extremely” or “very” important to them, according to a September NORC survey commissioned by the groups AAPI Data and APIA Vote. Likewise, there is not much evidence that Republican Indian Americans are prepared to make an exception for Harris because of their shared Indian roots. Indian Americans favor Harris over Trump 69% to 25%, according to the NORC poll. That suggests Harris is picking up some Indian American independents, since 55% of Indian Americans identify as Democrats or Democrat-leaning and 26% identify as Republicans or Republican-leaning. Other data, however, actually show Harris losing ground with Indian Americans relative to President Joe Biden. Harris is on pace to receive 60% of the South Asian American vote compared to Biden’s 68%, according to an October survey commissioned by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. New Jersey state Sen. Vin Gopal (D), the first Indian American in New Jersey’s state Senate, pointed to two other reasons why Indian Americans might lean Democratic overall: the party’s support for educational opportunity and its defense of the United States’ democratic institutions. “India is the world’s largest representative democracy,” said Gopal, who now chairs New Jersey’s Senate Democratic Conference. The attendees at the South Asians for Harris canvass kickoff in mid-October most often cited traditional liberal priorities when explaining their support for Harris, such as gun regulations, access to affordable health care and abortion rights. “No child should be left behind, but nobody should be left behind,” said Neha Saraiya, a pediatrician who practices medicine in the Princeton area. “As they say, when we all fight, we win – so we all win together, instead of creating these deep divides.” In keeping with these overall policy preferences, Congress’ small but growing Samosa Caucus is made up entirely of Democrats: Reps. Ami Bera (Calif.), Pramila Jayapal (Wash.), Ro Khanna (Calif.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (Ill.) and Shri Thanedar (Mich.). Virginia state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in suburban northern Virginia’s 10th Congressional District, is expected to grow their ranks come Tuesday. “People’s political views and their world views are still where they’re going to be.” But Gopal does not expect Harris’ Indian heritage to nudge Indian American conservatives into her corner anymore than they moved him to consider the Republican presidential runs of former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal — the country’s first Indian American governor — and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. “People’s political views and their world views are still where they’re going to be,” Gopal said. Hartaj Singh, an Edison high school student whose father dropped him off at the Basking Ridge event along with platters of hot samosas from the family’s restaurant, said that in his predominantly Indian American school, he was one of the few proud Democrats. “Ninety-five percent of it is like, ‘Trump is actually good for the economy,’” said Singh, who is fired up about the dangers that the Republican policy blueprint, Project 2025, poses to the country. “Then you pull out studies, and they’ll say, ‘My parents told me that.’” Singh also said some classmates have questioned Harris’ status as an Indian American because her father is Jamaican and suggested instead that former Republican presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy is a “real example of an Indian.” Singh’s experience speaks to the diversity of the Indian diaspora community in the United States — the regions of India they come from, the political parties with which their families are aligned in India, their religions and the types of work they have found in the United States. In Sharma’s view, Indian American business people skew more conservative than their peers with highly credentialed jobs in the health care, technology and education sectors. Sharma has also observed that some of the hardcore supporters of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s brand of Hindu nationalism are more likely to support Trump, a fellow nationalist who had a strong relationship with Modi. “At least visibly, they’ve shown a lot of affinity toward each other,” she said of the two leaders. Priti Pandya-Patel, founder and chair of the New Jersey GOP’s South Asian Coalition, used to own ambulatory health care facilities. She said she was drawn to the Republican message after growing fed up with how Democrats’ interventions in health care had diminished the quality of care she was able to provide. Pandya-Patel, who now consults for health care companies, identifies as a moderate Republican who supports abortion rights. Her pitch to Indian American voters is instead that Republicans offer lower taxes and an end to illegal immigration. “Would you think it’s fair that somebody else just can cross the border, come in, they get Social Security, they get all this? And you had to wait 10 years, 15 years, to come to this country legally?” she recalled saying to prospective converts to the Republican cause. (Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to receive Social Security benefits.) Pandya-Patel also echoed what Singh had heard from his classmates about Harris lacking a strong Indian identity. “I have never even seen her wear Indian clothes or identify herself as Indian,” Pandya-Patel said. “This is a testament to the hard work that so many leaders here and across our state and across our country have put in over the years to be able to say, 'We have a voice that cannot be ignored.'” There is at least one known photo of Harris as a young adult wearing a sari (traditional South Asian garment) while sitting with her sister and grandparents. And Harris, who is affiliated with a predominantly Black Baptist church in San Francisco, wore a garland around her neck at her 2014 wedding to Doug Emhoff — a nod to her Indian heritage. Harris has not made her Indian American, Black American or female identities central to her presidential run. But in Harris’ present campaign and over the course of her career, she has also not been shy about the importance of her Indian immigrant mother and her mother’s culture in shaping who she is. In a moderated conversation at a summit convened by the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies in May, Harris recounted the story of her mother’s immigration to the United States to attend college and her memories of family visits to Chennai, India, every two years. “Given who my grandfather was and about the fight for independence in India, my mother then … took to the streets to march for civil rights in her sari,” Harris said. “That’s how she met my father. And all of that has had a profound influence.” In an op-ed out Saturday in The Juggernaut, a South Asian news outlet, Harris also recalled absorbing some of her grandfather’s progressive values while accompanying him and his fellow retired friends on their morning walks. “My grandfather and his friends would passionately debate the importance of democracy and a government that treated people equally and with fairness … and a government that was not corrupt,” she said. “That influenced my life in more ways than I can ever explain, even though I didn’t realize it at the time.” Gopal, whose family name reflects shared south Indian heritage with Harris, rejected the suggestion that Harris has downplayed her Indian heritage. At the same time, he acknowledged that politicians like himself and Harris must sometimes balance emphasizing their personal background with speaking for constituencies where South Asian Americans are invariably a small minority. “That’s up to each and every person,” he said. Indeed, at the Oct. 13 canvass kickoff, the most impassioned remarks about Harris’ identity and the significance of her candidacy for Asian Americans of all backgrounds came from Kim, a Korean American, who wore a purple Indian kurta (long tunic) for the occasion. “I just hope that we take a moment to recognize that this hasn’t always happened in the past, the ability for us to be able to mobilize the South Asian community, the Asian community, to be able to have Diwali events leading up to Election Day,” Kim said. “And this is a testament to the hard work that so many leaders here and across our state and across our country have put in over the years to be able to say, ‘We have a voice that cannot be ignored.’” He went on to recount how a number of New Jersey Democrats told him during his first congressional run in 2018 that an Asian American could not win in a predominantly white district. And last year when Kim announced his Senate run, he said someone looked him in the eye and told him that he was “not the right kind of minority” to run statewide. “How offensive is that?!” he exclaimed. “This idea that I can only appeal to Asian Americans, that I’m not going to be able to win both to the Black community, the Latino community, the white population, or others — it shows just how much effort we need to move forward to be able to build upon what we have. And I want to tell you, one big way that we’re going to do that this year in New Jersey — we’re going to have a South Asian Black woman at the top of the ticket and an Asian American man running for Senate!” he declared, prompting cheers and applause from the crowd.

Here's Why It Doesn't Feel Safe To Have A Second Child.","bailey gaylin moore","2024-11-03","On nights my husband, Donald, dreams of our daughter, he wakes up in a sweat and rushes to the nursery, only to find an empty office, our books and a collection of houseplants staring back at him. There was never a crib there. We have never even had a positive pregnancy test. I’m 36, which also means each passing year makes her likelihood of existence even dimmer. But he dreams of a daughter anyway, and in those dreams, she feels as tangible as an empty office desk or a prayer plant before dawn, leaves folded together in some kind of devotion. She’s a ghost trapped in his subconscious, an apparition only made stronger by our decision not to have a second child. It’s not for the same reasons most millennials offer — we aren’t leaning into wanting more personal or financial freedom. It’s not even fear of future environmental disasters that stops us. Instead, our decision is shaped by the lack of safety our home in Missouri can offer me if I were to become pregnant again. The fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022 solidified our decision to avoid pregnancy altogether, especially after Missouri was the first state to make abortion illegal just a handful of minutes after the announcement — a decision announced by the attorney general and reinforced by the governor. We were in Vermont when it happened, so I felt safe enough for the moment. My husband was working as the director for a low-residency MFA program, and my son and I had joined him as a small summer vacation while he worked 17-hour days. On our way back to Missouri, I tried to hold on to the image of the people we’d seen in the streets of Montpelier holding signs for reproductive rights: “PRO-CHOICE IS PRO-LIFE,” “WE ARE NOT OVARY-ACTING,” an image of a hanger with the words reading: “NEVER AGAIN.” A group of women dressed in bloodred cloaks and white bonnets walked with their heads down, mouths tight in silent protest on the lawn of Vermont’s state capitol. It was a stark contrast to what greeted us back home in Columbia, Missouri. A group of Christians preached about sacred unborn lives to unhoused people just trying to sleep on park benches. In front of our small Planned Parenthood, a woman sat in a lawn chair with her ible and a protest sign facing toward the door, a black gate separating her from the building. There was a late June sprinkling of rain, but she never budged, even though that Planned Parenthood hadn’t performed an abortion since the summer of 2018, when new state legislation required a physician to be available 24/7 and mid-Missouri couldn’t find an OB-GYN willing to do the task alone. By October of that year, only one clinic remained in St. Louis, making it a 400-mile round-trip drive for pregnant people in more distant parts of the state to get an abortion if needed — a nearly impossible requirement for those coming from impoverished areas. In 2024, Missouri ranks 40th in women’s health and reproductive care, a number that also reflects one of the “highest pregnancy-associated maternal mortality rates in the United States.” After reaching the age of 35, the likelihood of maternal mortality is even higher. Geriatric pregnancies are more at risk for fetal genetic disorders, high blood pressure and miscarriage. As the age of eggs increases, so does the possibility of danger for both the fetus and the pregnant person. Abortion bans exacerbate that danger. In August 2022, when Mylissa Farmer from Joplin, Missouri, felt her water break in her 18th week of pregnancy, she was refused emergency treatment at two hospitals in Missouri and Kansas because her baby’s heartbeat was still detectable, despite the fact that the pregnancy was no longer viable and her health was endangered. She eventually received treatment by driving well over 400 miles away to Illinois. After an investigation in 2023, both hospitals who denied her abortion services were deemed to be violating federal law. Thankfully, Farmer survived the traumatic ordeal; many are not so lucky. None of this was a factor for my first and only pregnancy. I had my son when I was 17, a decade before I met Donald. I wasn’t in a relationship with the father. Having been raised as a Southern Baptist deep in the Ozarks, this was controversial. I had to write a letter to my church, where I ran Bible study, apologizing for getting pregnant out of wedlock. I also had to get an ultrasound at the Pregnancy Care Center, which was a conservative-leaning program masking itself as an alternative to Planned Parenthood. If you mentioned you were thinking about an abortion, they’d write your name down and proselytize to you. I felt trapped, like I was the last person who had access to my own body. A month later, when the Pregnancy Care Center featured me in their newsletter because I had chosen to keep the baby, I wanted to reach out to the editor to make a small correction: I felt forced to have a baby, by religion and Ozarks culture. My husband fell in love with “Elm” as a potential baby name while I was visiting Colorado, perusing necklaces made of gold-plated leaves in the souvenir section of a Rocky Mountain gas station. On the phone, I read him the meanings of each tree: Aspen for transformation, Oak for stability, Elm for strength. It was 2019, and we were poor graduate students far from the thought of having a baby. Our focus was on finishing school and providing a space for my teenager. Five years later, Donald was offered a tenure-track professorship at University of Missouri-Columbia, providing the security we would need to have another child. My son is in college now, and we are suddenly empty nesters in a quiet house where something is noticeably missing. When Donald wakes up from another dream, a looming guilt settles over me, even when he assures me that he’s found comfort in thinking perhaps a version of us has Elm in another world, a parallel universe where a geriatric pregnancy wouldn’t imply danger in a red state — in our home. I don’t love the name Elm, but I love how he loves it — how it implies he wants to have a daughter who is strong. I also love that my husband loves me enough to acknowledge the trauma that came with my first pregnancy and why I have complicated feelings about withstanding another, more dangerous one. Even though he reassures me that my body’s safety, both mentally and physically, is most important, the guilt remains. The fear of what my body could do to me outweighs it. Even still, there are times when I think of Elm existing — not in a parallel universe or another plane, but this reality. In my mind, we’ll sell our side-by-side desks and replace them with a crib, a mobile with birds or whales or geometric shapes dancing above. We’ll find somewhere else in the house to write and make room for a new life. On Nov. 5, 10 states including Missouri will be featuring bills voting on abortion rights or the further protection of abortion rights already in place (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota). Missouri will vote on Amendment 3, or the “Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative,” an act that was nearly shut down in the state Supreme Court with a 4-3 ruling. If Amendment 3 passes, abortion rights would be restored across the state, following the same path as our Kentucky and Kansas neighbors. This election is so much more than a presidential one — it’s one that could show abortion opponents that the majority of our people want and need access to reproductive care, even in states that consistently vote red.

But Not Everyone Wants To Celebrate.","jonathan nicholson","2024-11-03","Voters in four states and the District of Columbia will have a chance to adopt ranked choice voting through ballot measures on Tuesday, setting the stage for a potentially massive expansion of an alternative voting system in which voters rank candidates rather than only picking their top choice. On Tuesday, voters in Colorado, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada and D.C. will choose whether to adopt the system. The dominant political parties in each location have fought against the adoption of ranked choice voting, which is already used in Alaska, Maine and a handful of municipalities around the country, including New York City and San Francisco. In ranked choice, voters indicate who would be their first choice, second choice, third choice and so on down the ballot. If no one gets a majority of first-place votes, the votes are retabulated: The candidate with the fewest first-place votes is eliminated, and the second-choice votes of that eliminated candidate are added to the remaining candidates’ tallies. This goes on until a candidate gets a majority of votes. It’s been hyped as a way to avoid extremism and to allow voters more than a binary choice between a bad candidate and a worse one. But it’s also controversial. This year, Alaska is holding a vote on whether to repeal ranked choice voting, which it first used for statewide elections in 2022. And in Missouri, language to prohibit ranked choice voting is part of a proposed constitutional amendment placed on the ballot by the GOP-dominated state legislature. And there is some research saying a few of the proposed benefits of ranked choice voting, such as better quality of candidates and more diverse candidates, has been oversold. A 2024 study by a New York University data science assistant professor Jonathan Colner, found only a temporary effect in the 47 cities in 13 states where ranked choice is used for local elections. “Though there is an initial increase in the number of candidates following RCV implementation, this effect quickly dissipates. Furthermore, the candidates who make up this initial increase are generally of low quality,” he wrote. The change also did little to diversify the mix of candidates in terms of race or gender, he said. “Instead, RCV appears to disrupt the local political environment, stimulating temporary increases in candidate entry before becoming part of the status quo.” Deb Otis, the research and policy director at FairVote, a nonprofit which supports ranked choice voting, disagreed. “The elevator pitch is that ranked choice voting gives voters better choices, better campaigns and majority winners,” instead of the win going to someone with only a plurality of votes, she said. It also keeps independent candidates from being seen purely as spoilers for major-party rivals. “When you have a third-party or an independent candidate running, voters get told that that candidate might be a spoiler, or they might be wasting their vote if they’re not voting for a frontrunner,” she said. “It puts voters in a really challenging position, and it causes political parties to do really strange things, like boosting independent or third-party candidates from the other side to try to help their own side.” Despite the seeming complexity ranked choice adds to voting, Otis said voters are used to ranking things, just not candidates. “I have a list of my favorite foods, and if the item I want is sold out, I will order my second choice. I won’t go home hungry. I know what my second choice is,” she said. It’s not that simple, though, according to ranked choice voting’s critics. The issue has split Colorado’s Senate delegation. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), despite sponsoring a bill to make ranked choice voting easier for state and local governments to implement, has come out against Proposition 131, the RCV referendum in the state. Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and the state’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, are in favor. “I have said that ranked choice voting in some form, and in some elections, could have a beneficial effect. But, ranked choice voting is new and comes in many forms. I am unconvinced that the largely untested, extreme version we have been asked to consider will work in Colorado — or anywhere else,” Bennet said in a statement. Bennet also said RCV could increase the reach of big donors, citing the campaign for Prop 131. “We have been battered by a one-sided barrage of millions of dollars of TV advertisements to persuade us to abandon our current, world-class election system for an untested experiment,” he said. The proposition would create an open primary system, where the top four candidates in a conventional vote would advance to the general election regardless of party. Voters would then rank those remaining four names. Colorado has turned increasingly Democratic over the last 20 years. But the state’s Republican Party does not see ranked choice voting as a tool to help it break that hold, and is also urging voters to reject the change. The state GOP said it would help elect liberal Democrats and is being pushed by people “whose goal is to eliminate parties and move to a centrist system.” A Democratic operative familiar with the state’s politics told HuffPost the proposition has rare bipartisan opposition, as the state Democratic Party is also opposed to it. “Look, the Colorado Republican Party is nutso,” the operative said. “But they wouldn’t say that we need to turn our system on its head just because they can’t get their shit together.” In D.C., where voter registration is overwhelmingly in the Democrats’ favor, the local Democratic Party is also opposed to a ranked choice vote initiative. D.C.’s initiative would also allow independents to vote in either party’s taxpayer-funded primaries, which is not currently allowed. “Allowing non-Democrats a voice in Democratic elections will cause our Party’s values and goals to be diluted. Rank Choice Voting and Semi-Closed Primaries may compromise the integrity of our party, potentially leading to nominees who do not fully align with our core values,” the party said on its website. FairVote’s Otis said RCV can actually make parties more competitive by allowing less ideological candidates to emerge. She pointed to Glenn Youngkin, the Republican governor of Virginia, who was selected the nominee in an RCV primary. “The party put forward the most competitive ticket that they’ve had in years, and went on to win the governorship” in a Democratic state, she said. The concerns about big money and its role in boosting ranked choice voting may be harder to answer. Of the two big campaign committees fighting over Prop 131, the pro-RCV group has vastly outspent its opposition counterpart —$14.3 million to only $284,540 through mid-October, according to state campaign finance data. In fact, in the waning days of October, Kent Thiry, a former CEO of dialysis giant DaVita, was reported to have given $1.45 million to the “yes” campaign, in two separate donations. Thiry has pushed previous election changes in the state and is part of a larger group of individuals who have spent more than $50 million on the RCV efforts in Colorado and the other states, according to a Colorado Public Radio analysis.

And for them, it’s personal: These candidates have said they felt inspired to run to counter Florida Gov. and former Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis’ war on queer and trans rights, abortion and all of the things he views as “woke.” Ashley Brundage, a Democratic candidate for the Tampa-area House District 65, said that DeSantis’ support of “culture war bills” — like the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law, which banned classroom discussions of gender and sexuality, or its law barring trans people from using government-owned bathrooms that align with their gender — are what pushed her to run for office. If elected, Brundage, a business owner and mother of two, would become Florida’s first openly trans woman to be elected to the state legislature. She will face incumbent Republican state Rep. Karen Gonzalez Pittman. The Florida House Republican Campaign Committee released campaign mailers that stoked fears about Brundage’s qualifications and used unflattering images of her, including a photo of the candidate in a bikini. The state GOP has also used anti-trans rhetoric to drum up antagonism against trans athletes. Brundage said she hopes DeSantis, who signed off on the “Spirit of The Community” award that Brundage received from the Florida Commission on the Status of Women in 2022, attends her would-be swearing in celebration in January. “Obviously, just getting elected will change the way they have conversations,” Brundage told The Advocate. “Ron DeSantis’ neck will be hurting in every room he moves into, checking if I’m in the room.” Brundage added that greater trans and queer representation in the state’s House of Representatives would “systematically” change “the entire political operation.” Currently, Florida has only two out LGBTQ+ members in the state government, both Democrats, both elected in 2020. Shevrin Jones is the first Black and first gay state senator and Michele Rayner is the first Black lesbian state representative. But now at least five LGBTQ+ candidates — including three trans candidates, any of whom would be the first trans Florida lawmakers — are running on more than boosting LGBTQ+ representation in government. They’re focusing on progressive issues including protecting reproductive rights, expanding access to affordable health care and improving infrastructure as climate change threatens Florida’s future. Florida Democrats have a unique opportunity this election to break state Republicans’ chokehold. The party will need to secure at least five seats in the state House and two in the state Senate, as well as maintain their current seats, to undo the Republican supermajority. While other states saw a blue wave during the 2022 midterms, Florida saw an increase in Republican turnout, and the state went for Donald Trump in 2020 and 2016. Election experts have suggested Florida, which was once thought of as a swing state in presidential races, might now permanently lean Republican. And that has been a boon for DeSantis, who has governed since 2022 alongside a veto-proof GOP legislature. Over the last two years, that reliable Republican power has allowed DeSantis to sign several anti-LGBTQ+ bills and enact a number of sweeping policies affecting the lives of immigrants, people of color, working class people, and other vulnerable communities. But Nikki Fried, the chair of the Florida Democratic party, told WCJB that she feels confident voters will help bring a streak of blue to the state government this year, because they’re fed up with DeSantis’ leadership and believe the Republican Party has “gone too far.” “I fundamentally believe not only are we going to break the supermajority for the seats that we need, but we’re going to have a lot of surprises on Nov. 5 because people are frustrated with extremism,” Reid said. Nate Douglas, a Black, gay candidate for Florida’s House District 37, which includes Orlando and University of Central Florida, is running in one of the most competitive state House races. The 23-year-old Gen Z candidate has said that the overturning of Roe v. Wade, environmental issues and DeSantis’ anti-LGBTQ legislation pushed him into politics. “There is absolutely no room for bullies in our education system,” Douglas told LGBTQ Nation. “The gross fact is that the biggest bully that we have right now in our education system is Governor Ron DeSantis and his legislators in the State House who passed the Don’t Say Gay bill.” At the age of 19, Douglas, a sustainability policy researcher and recent graduate of University of Florida, was elected to the Orange Soil and Water Conservation District, a local agency responsible for environmental conservation and protection. Now Douglas aims to unseat Rep. Susan Plasencia — and has already raised more than double the funds of his Republican opponent. While Plasencia voted against a now-defunct bill last year to restrict trans people from updating their gender on their drivers’ licenses, she voted in favor of Senate Bill 254, which banned gender-affirming medical care for minors and many adults in Florida, and also backed other anti-LGBTQ+ bills. Agenda PAC, a committee aiming to hold anti-LGBTQ elected officials accountable, has labeled Plasencia one of 10 lawmakers on their “hate squad.” “Right now, we’re seeing a large push for authoritarianism, where we have the state government telling people how they can live their lives, who they can love, how they can express themselves,” Douglas told The Advocate. It has felt very shameful, and it felt scary as well.” Among the LGBTQ+ candidates in Florida are both political newcomers and seasoned advocates for LGBTQ+ rights. Vance Ahrens, a Navy Veteran and trans woman, is running for state Senate District 19 the first time. She’s hoping to unseat Randy Fine, a Republican state House member who sponsored SB 254. He’s also defended a bill that would ban drag performances, though he claimed that the bill would have no impact on the LGBTQ+ community. “If it means erasing a community, because you have to target children, then damn right we outta do it,” Fine said of the bill. The Supreme Court later blocked Florida’s drag ban — which DeSantis signed into law — from going into effect. Other candidates, like Nathan Bruemmer, the former head of the state’s LGBTQ+ Democratic Caucus; Joe Saunders, a former state lawmaker and professor; and Jim Brenner, who worked as former Secretary of State John Kerry’s economic policy adviser; could also usher in a new wave of LGBTQ+ elected officials. Bruemmer, a candidate for House District 61 and a trans man, has spoken out against some of the policies that DeSantis — and state agencies stacked with DeSantis appointees — have put in place to make life harder for trans people. In January this year, Florida’s Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles quietly issued a memo that barred residents from updating or changing their gender on state driver’s licenses. This memo, which also grounded its reasoning on a very narrow definition of legal sex that makes no provision for transgender people, had immediate impacts on the lives of trans Floridians. Bruemmer told Jax Today that trans people who can’t obtain accurate identification documents will face greater rates of harassment and violence. The next four years will change America forever.

The imprisonment of Reza Valizadeh was confirmed to The Associated Press by the U.S. State Department as Iran marked the 45th anniversary of the takeover of the American Embassy and hostage crisis on Sunday. It also followed a threat by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a day earlier to provide “a crushing response” to Israel and the U.S. as long-range B-52 bombers reached the Middle East in an attempt to deter Tehran. Valizadeh had worked for Radio Farda, an outlet under Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that’s overseen by the U.S. Agency for Global Media. In February, he wrote on the social platform X that his family members had been detained in an effort to make him return to Iran. In August, Valizadeh apparently posted two messages suggesting he had returned to Iran despite Radio Farda being viewed by Iran’s theocracy as a hostile outlet. “I arrived in Tehran on March 6, 2024. Before that, I had unfinished negotiations with the (Revolutionary Guard’s) intelligence department,” the message read in part. “Eventually I came back to my country after 13 years without any security guarantee, even a verbal one.” Valizadeh added the name of a man who he claimed belonged to Iran’s Intelligence Ministry. The AP could not verify if the person worked for the ministry. Rumors have been circulating for weeks that Valizadeh had been detained. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, which monitors cases in Iran, said that he had been detained on arrival to the country earlier this year but later released. He was then rearrested and sent to Evin prison, where he now faces a case in Iran’s Revolutionary Court, which routinely holds closed-door hearings in which defendants face secret evidence, the agency reported. Valizadeh had faced arrest in 2007 as well, it said. The State Department told the AP that it was “aware of reports that this dual U.S.-Iranian citizen has been arrested in Iran” when asked about Valizadeh. “We are working with our Swiss partners who serve as the protecting power for the United States in Iran to gather more information about this case,” the State Department said. “Iran routinely imprisons U.S. citizens and other countries’ citizens unjustly for political purposes. This practice is cruel and contrary to international law.” Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty separately said that Valizadeh “has been detained in Iran.” “We have had no official confirmation of the charges against him,” it said in a statement. “Reza, a U.S.-Iranian national, left RFE/RL in November 2022. We are profoundly concerned about the continued arrest, harassment and threats against media professionals by the Iranian regime.” Iran has not acknowledged detaining Valizadeh. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. The Voice of America, another U.S. government-funded media outlet overseen by the Agency for Global Media, first reported that the State Department was acknowledging Valizadeh’s detention in Iran. Since the 1979 U.S. Embassy crisis, in which dozens of hostages were released after 444 days in captivity, Iran has used prisoners with Western ties as bargaining chips in negotiations with the world. In September 2023, five Americans detained for years in Iran were freed in exchange for five Iranians in U.S. custody and for $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets to be released by South Korea. Valizadeh is the first American known to be detained by Iran since then. Meanwhile, Iranian state television broadcast video Sunday of different cities across the country marking the anniversary of the embassy takeover. Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard, also spoke in Tehran, where he repeated a pledge made the day before by Khamenei. “The resistance front and Iran will equip itself with whatever necessary to confront and defeat the enemy,” he said, referring to militant groups like Hamas and Lebanon’s Hezbollah backed by Tehran. In Tehran, thousands of people at the gate of the former U.S. Embassy chanted “Death to America” and “Death to Israel.” Some burned flags of the countries and effigies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They also carried images of killed top figures of Iran’s allied militant groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Palestinian Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar. The crowd in the state-organized rallies chanted that they were ready to defend the Palestinians. ___ Associated Press writers Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, and Michael Weissenstein in New York contributed to this report.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-womens-jeans-on-amazon_l_672541ebe4b01e8b2424ff8a","Some Of The Highest-Rated Women’s Jeans Are Secretly Sold On Amazon","laura white","2024-11-03","A good pair of jeans never goes out of style. Everyone should have at least one reliable pair in their closet — or even a few for good measure. If only shopping for denim were as easy as wearing it. Luckily we’ve done the leg work (ha) for you here and rounded up the top-rated styles on offering at Amazon. From skinnies and trousers to straight legs and baggy cuts, we’ve got a pair for you on our list. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. It’s hard to go wrong with a straight leg, mid-rise jean. The cut is timeless and works with everything from your favorite tee to a cute going-out top. These Lee jeans feature a figure flattering straight leg and sit easy on the hips for all day comfort. “These are probably the [best-fitting] pair of jeans in my closet,” says reviewer Audrey, adding that “they have a little bit of stretch, but still feel sturdy.” Shop this style in nearly twenty washes, sizes 00-18 and in regular, short and long inseam. The Levi’s Wedgie jean has a bit of a cult following for its butt-enhancing tailoring. The extra high rise and snug fit through the hip and thigh do a great job of highlighting your — ahem — assets. The cotton blend denim has a bit of stretch and is available in a dozen washes. Shop this style in sizes 24-32. Vintage fans will love this jean for its throwback fit. The 100% cotton construction of these Levis is a bit of a throwback too. Most denim these days has a bit of spandex or elastane, but cotton ages beautifully and avoids those stretched out spots that spandex infused styles can suffer from after a few hours of wear. A fun variety of washes include a vibrant poppy corduroy, washed out lavender and acid washed green, along with all the classic shades as well. Sizes 24-34 are available and select washes are available in plus sizes 35-38. These jeans fall right in the sweet spot: not too skinny, not too baggy, just a perfect mid-rise, straight-leg cut. Naturally Lucky Brand named this pair the Sweet jean. Even better, this style is made in the USA from 100% cotton. Reviewer Savannah said they “went from not liking the straight leg jeans to absolutely adoring it, thanks to this pair.” Shop this style in sizes 25-33. Most sizes come in either 30- or 33-inch inseams. Sometimes a little stretch is a big help in bridging the gap in a slightly loose waistband or giving your thighs a little extra comfort. This pair of skinny jeans features a Goldilocks amount of stretch (3% elastane) for a solid fit. The medium and dark washes are classics and these jeans come in three inseam lengths: short, regular and long. Shop this style in sizes 0-20. If you’re looking for a classic pair of black jeans with a vintage inspired fit, this is the pair for you. Madewell’s ‘90s straight jean has a flattering high rise and linear tailoring that will give you legs for days. These heavyweight, low-stretch (1% elastane) jeans “fit well and feel like they will hold their shape” wear after wear, according to reviewer Sanny. These jeans are available in sizes 24-33. Wide leg denim is having a renaissance. The relaxed fit can look effortlessly cool, but if you’re not careful you can wind up swimming in denim. This pair strikes the right balance in non-stretch denim with a generously cut leg and slim fit through the waist and hips. This jean is available in seventeen washes in varying shades of blue, black, cream and brown. Shop this style in sizes XS-XL with a 29.5 inch inseam. If you grew up in the south you might be familiar with the phenomenon that is “Wrangler booty.” Wrangler’s sturdy denim and signature “W” embroidery on the back pockets is known to give cowboys — and anyone copping their style — a perfectly lifted bum. The brand’s Bold Boot jean is no exception. This tried-and-true style has a flattering boot-cut silhouette and a higher rise in the back for added coverage. This style is available in sizes 0-18 in 30, 32 and 34 inch inseams. Make these jeans your own thanks to a wide number (fifteen, to be exact) of washes. Levi’s 501 style just might be the quintessential jean. If they’re good enough for Bruce, Beyonce and Marilyn Monroe, they’re definitely good enough for the rest of us. The mid blue wash denim has a vintage vibe and the relaxed, straight leg fit is timeless. 501s look great worn relaxed on the hips or sized down for a more fitted look. This jean is available in sizes 24-32. Dickies, a heritage workwear brand for over 100 years, may not spring to mind when jean shopping, but what are jeans if not the oldest style of American workwear? This straight leg stretch jean is just a hair away from being a skinny cut and is perfect for dressing up or down. It also features a “flex tummy panel” that smooths the midsection and 46% stretch material for structure and comfort. This pair is available in a deep rinsed indigo blue and stonewashed blue in sizes 2-16. Early-aughts trends are back, and along with this era’s resurgence inevitably comes a waistline that sits below the belly button. While many of us still shudder at the thought of such a minuscule rise – those tiny zippers!? – leave it to Levi’s to introduce a low rise cut that is actually wearable. The 100% cotton Low Pro jeans feature a low(er) rise and relaxed fit with a slight boot cut. This jean is available in a variety of washes, but popular shades seem to sell quickly. Sizes 24-32 are available. Sometimes you just need a soft and stretchy pair of jeans that still look as sharp as a tack. As reviewer Bonnie put it: “Love these jeans. They are super soft, and the fit is absolutely perfect. No other pair of jeans in my closet can live up to these.” This sleek pair features a perfect kick flare and an 8.5-inch mid rise. Shop the Mavi Molly jeans in two washes, in sizes 24-34 and 30-, 32- and 34-inch inseams. In 1976 designer Gloria Vanderbilt changed women’s fashion when she launched one of the first pairs of designer jeans, and the customer-favorite Amanda jean is a longtime bestseller. The slightly tapered cut is versatile yet classic and comes in three inseam lengths: 29, 31 and 33 inches. It comes in dozens of washes, but the classic black is our favorite. Sizes 2-18 are available. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-oral-care-products-amazon-ud_l_67252baee4b01f6919da08d8","These Are The Oral Care Products That HuffPost Readers Swear By","alex,ra polk","2024-11-03","Amazon has some of the best dental products around. Not only are these items from top brands like Philips Sonicare, Crest, Waterpik and the like, but they sometimes feature cheaper price tags than the ones in brick-and-mortar drugstores. And, most importantly, a select handful are adored by both Amazon reviewers and HuffPost readers. Scroll on for eight of the best oral care products on Amazon according to you, HuffPost readers (and on-site rave reviews). From brushes that are gentle on teeth but tough on plaque to travel-friendly whitening pens, the following buys might save you a few extra trips to the dentist. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The reviews are in: These extra-soft toothbrushes live up to the hype. The gentle polyester bristles are even infused with silver that, according to its Amazon description, ""naturally eliminates the buildup and debris that linger on most toothbrushes."" They have a 4.6-out-of-5-star rating and over 6,000 ratings on Amazon. Reviewer Muschtini gives the two pack five stars and writes, ""I have receding gums and this is the first toothbrush in over a decade that doesn’t hurt me. The cleaning power is unmatched by any other “regular” toothbrush. Perfect size, durable, and easy to hold."" We discovered these toothbrushes courtesy of our friends at BuzzFeed, and our readers can't get enough. With almost 90,000 Amazon ratings and a 4.6-out-of-5-star grade, it's no secret that Crest Whitestrips boast legions of fans. Each strip is made with hydrogen peroxide that whitens without damaging enamel when used correctly, leaving your teeth 20 levels whiter in just 22 days. Reviewers rave that it's ""a great way to whiten your teeth without breaking the bank"" and make teeth ""significantly whiter and brighter."" Experts have previously recommended ADA-approved products like these classic teeth whitening implements to our readers. Philips Sonicare's bells-and-whistles toothbrush does cost a pretty penny, but its hi-tech specs and adoring reviews indicate that this may be money well spent. This model features three cleaning modes as well as pressure sensors that prevents abrasive brushing. Plus, it has a two-minute timer to ensure you brush for dentists' recommended brushing time. Amazon reviewer Elle loves that this electric toothbrush doesn't need to be charged often even tells you when it's time to replace its head. ""[T]he device itself seems to be very durable and it works great for travel as well because it’s portable,” the reviewer also wrote. Readers also love this more affordable option from Philips Sonicare. While it doesn't have as many nifty features, this “power” toothbrush checks all the necessary boxes for clean, healthy teeth. This includes a 2-minute timer, 14-day battery life and soft rounded bristles. Plus it has a 4.6-out-of-5-star rating on Amazon and over 20,000 reviews. ""...this newer model is cheaper and is still leagues ahead of manual tooth brushes,"" Amazon reviewer Nick wrote. ""I definitely recommend it to anyone that hasn't delved into electric tooth brushes, they just make your teeth feel much cleaner! It's a noticeable difference."" Readers always take advantage when this economical pick goes on sale (as it is right now). If you're a busy bee looking for a quick fix, look into whitening pens — specifically this top-reviewed pair from Venus Visage that readers love. Each pen uses carbamide peroxide (a compound that breaks down into hydrogen peroxide) and has a lifespan of 20+ uses. Reviewers express their love for the value, noticeable results and that it doesn't hurt gums. Waterpik is a household name in the world of water flossing. Rather than string, water flossers remove plaque and food between teeth with streams of pressurized water. The Aquarius water flosser, for example, has 10 different water pressure settings 360-degree tip rotation for fast, ample cleaning in just 90 seconds. Although it takes a up a bit of counter space, according to Amazon reviewer Academia Macadamia, it's worth it. They write, ""I like this model because it works amazing and is a better value price-wise compared to the others."" This is a frequent favorite of HuffPost readers. If you can't sacrifice counter space or need a flosser for travel, this portable irrigator is for you. It delivers the same high-pressure water streams as other brands but in small, rechargeable packaging. It even comes with a travel case. Amazon reviewer Krystal loves that it's ""so compact, easy to store and transport."" Say goodbye to bad breath with the help of this top-rated tongue scraper. Its high-grade stainless steel keeps it clean for longer while its rubber handles and curved design make it easy to maneuver around the mouth. With a 4.6-out-of-5-star Amazon rating and 11,585 ratings, we think it's a must have. We've previously spoke with dentists about how this nifty thing works, and readers took a shine to it.

You want to be able to wear them on repeat without them looking like you’ve been wearing on repeat. Since the quest for the perfect T-shirt, sweatpants and other wardrobe essentials tends to be a long one, it’s natural to get pretty darn excited when you find something you love. Rounded up here are the basics that HuffPost readers can’t stop buying, and best of all, you can get them all on Amazon. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. If you’re a hiker or trail runner, these cargo pants deserve a place in your closet. They’re made with SPF 50 (sun protection is a must if you’re an adventurer) and are super stretchy and sweat-resistant. They're available in two inseams and in sizes S–3XL. They come in five different colors and are available in a women’s style too.Promising Amazon review:“Super comfortable, light and they look great. They’re true to size. Definitely will be buying more. I hope they get more color varieties.” — Andres Garcia Already counting down the days until the cozy vibes of fall? Plan ahead by stocking up with a pack of knit socks. Made with a blend of wool, cotton and polyester, these pairs are warm but won’t make your feet sweat. Choose from solid colors or colorful prints and one size.Promising Amazon review:“I bought these for my daughters and myself. They are perfect under boots (all types and especially work-style boots). They give a feminine look that is soft and pleasing. So comfortable and they have held up well through multiple washings!” — Chrissy K. Carr More than 10,000 people have bought and rated this sports bra, collectively awarding it a 4.3-star rating. It’s easy to see why. It offers medium support (enough to keep everything in place without feeling restricting), is made of breathable, moisture-wicking nylon and is seamless so it won’t dig into your skin. Get it in sizes S–XL.Promising Amazon review:“I finally found one that is true to size, looks good and comfortable. I would recommend this! They last long as well. I have had one since basic training in 2018 and thought I should probably upgrade.” — Heather Reese If your T-shirts have sweat stains under your pits, it’s time to get some new ones. There’s a reason why Fruit of the Loom has been a household name for generations. You won’t find a more comfortable tee at this price. They’re made with moisture-wicking fabric and odor protection — which means no evidence you ever sweat a drop. Sizes range from small to 4XL.Promising Amazon review:“As far as I’m concerned, Fruit of the Loom is still the best. They are the most comfortable, softest and, in my experience, last an incredibly long time and not to mention, they are usually half the price of [other options]. If you like a comfortable T-shirt that is not too thick, I highly recommend.” — Real Biker There are times when you want to wear underwear that’s cute and lacy and there are times when you just want it to be comfortable without feeling like you’re wearing granny panties. This pack of cotton undies is a best-seller (almost 31,000 people have rated the undies) because they come in a wide range of sizes, are made with breathable cotton and spandex and last many, many wash cycles. Get them in sizes S-5XL.Promising Amazon review:“No kidding, I have always worn cotton undies, but they stretch and shrink and change a lot. Also, they are not made uniformly. Molasus looked good to me on the screen. In real life they are the nicest, best fitting, softest fabric and provide great stability when on your body. They are all cotton but with just the right amount of stretch. Colors are very attractive. They are made uniformly and all look identical. Fit is fantastic. This review is for the two packs of five received. I just ordered another pack of five. Love them.” — Delight People who bought and rated these tees love that the fabric is thin enough to layer under other clothes without feeling weighed down. They’re so soft that you’ll find yourself wearing them at night to bed too. Choose from a six-pack of all-white T-shirts, all black or a mix of gray, black and navy, and sizes S-3XL.Promising Amazon review:“These are my go-to shirts for work. They last a good while, fit great and are very comfortable. They do tend to shrink on the first wash, however, so be sure to wash them in cold water.” — Spencer The stretchy fabric and high-waisted cut of these leggings make them super flattering. There are three styles to choose from: capri, full-length and full-length with pockets for your phone (along with two sizes). There are 25 different colors and prints to choose from too.Promising Amazon review:“I love, love, love these leggings. I actually saw an influencer on IG rave about how great these leggings were. She stated that one size fits all. I'm a little skeptical of influencers trying to push products, but I was pleasantly surprised. These leggings are well made. They are soft and fit comfortably. You can use them for working out or just being out and about. They aren't super sheer which is nice that you don't have to worry about wearing an oversized shirt with them. I would highly recommend these.” — Diane Enderby Even when you’re just lounging around the house, you still want to look cute, right? The thick waistband and tapered cut makes these joggers (available in sizes S-3XL) more flattering than your average pair of sweats. They come in 24 different colors, so if you love them, stock up in a few different colors. Promising Amazon review:“Love the fabric (not too hot, not too thin and enough stretch), high waist and pockets made them perfect for my travel day. Unfortunately, after a year the pant legs don’t necessarily stay exactly where I want them to, but I still love them and get compliments on them. They’re versatile enough to be able to wear them with a T-shirt, or add a blazer and baseball hat for a pulled-together look.” — Lisa Love Working out with your phone tucked in an open pocket is a risk up there with carrying your laptop by your fingertips. Your valuables (including your keys and Airpods) will be much safer inside zipper pockets, like the ones these joggers have. Made with a blend of polyester and spandex, you can work out in them comfortably. Choose from 17 different colors and sizes S-3XL.Promising Amazon review: “I bought my first pair of these probably about a year ago. I now have seven pairs. The first pair is still in excellent shape. I can't even tell which are the new ones and which are the old. They are very comfy and launder well. I’m pretty sure I read on the tag not to tumble dry, but I tumble dry them all the time, from day one and they are just fine. I love that not only does the waistband have the drawstring but it is also 2"" wide with very strong elastic. This allows them to stay put while I'm running, cycling, etc without digging into my waist. The pockets are all zippered and the zippers are proving to be as durable as the rest of them.” — Mark H. Baggy T-shirts aren’t exactly flattering, but tying them to make them tighter doesn’t always work (and stretches out the fabric). Behold, the perfect solution: twisted T-shirts. It gives the same relaxed fit up top as a baggy T-shirt while the twisted front makes it more form-fitting and flattering around the middle. Choose from 23 different colors and sizes XS-XXL.Promising Amazon review: “I love these tops. They are flattering even if you have a tummy.” — CherryBridge9 This crop-tank sports bra hits mid-torso, serving as both a bra and workout top. (Gotta love a twofer!) Made with removable pads and medium support, it’s the perfect go-to for every type of sport or workout activity. Choose from 29 different colors and sizes XS-3XL.Promising Amazon review: “I love this sports bra/tank top so much I’ve bought it in multiple colors! It is long enough to be a crop-type tank top with high-rise shorts. The material is buttery soft with a thickness that does not add heat! The built-in bra and style provides support and is very flattering. This tank is part of my teacher/mom summer uniform and I recommend adding it to your wardrobe too!” — Teachermomx3 Matching sets are the secret to living in what is essentially PJs while being the most stylish person in the room. This wide-arm shirt and wide-leg pants combo is super chic and bound to be the comfiest outfit you’ll own. It’s dressy enough to wear to work or out and about while being cozy enough to sleep in. Choose from six different colors and sizes S-XL.Promising Amazon review: “Took this outfit with me to France in May and it was perfect for packing. You can dress it up or down!” — Melissa Gildan's most popular T-shirt, this cotton option feels great on and is thick enough to be worn alone. Its classic fit gives you loose comfort, with a rib collar and tear-away label for extra ease. The midweight fabric makes it great for all-year wear. Promising review: ""These shirts are thick, soft, and true to size. I own 5 different colors currently and will definitely be purchasing more. Top Quality Product 10/10 I highly recommend."" — Jack Pickens The name says it all. Comfort Colors makes incredibly comfortable and colorful cotton basics. If you don't know about their beloved T-shirts, get the multipack — you'll be glad you did. With a relaxed fit and a heavyweight ring-spun cotton construction, they promise to get softer with every wear without losing their shape. This retailer allows you to choose the colors of your multipack and also has an option for collections of pocket tees. Promising review: ""Love fabric and color selection. Order the 4 pack for the wife and kids. This is my 3rd order and very satisfied with the product."" — Bounsong C. These midweight crewneck T-shirts are made with a European cut for a slimmer feel. They have an extra-secure inner collar band to ensure the neck stays taut, and they come in a great selection of solid colors for all sorts of styles. Promising review: ""Best quality T-shirts I have ever bought for my Husband. Really good selection of colours and a good fit too. The banding around the neck stops it from getting stretched and loose, unlike cheap T-shirts, brilliant idea."" — Mrs. Pamela A. Lowth Ah, the pocket tee: a timeless piece that looks great on its own or with layers. This set comes with six cotton/poly blend shirts and is available in two color combos. Find them in sizes S-3XL. Promising review: ""I recently purchased these T shirts, and I absolutely love them. They fit GREAT and are so comfortable that I had to check to make sure that I had a shirt on."" — Tony Walker While they’re described as sleepwear shirts, many reviews say these short-sleeve Henleys are also great for daily outdoor wear. They come in long and short sleeve options, in many colors in sizes S-5XL with tall options. It's made from a lightweight jersey fabric that's designed to be quick-drying and feel super smooth on the skin. Promising review: ""I bought the shirts for my husband because we were going to be going away. They are very nice quality and they wash very nice. Also they did not shrink they do not get wrinkled and they’re not see-through. I think they’re great value for the money. I plan on buying him a couple more. I recommend these shirts."" — VA DZ Whether you're looking for something to wear under another shirt or just prefer room around your neck, this set of six V-neck tees is made from soft breathable cotton that's designed to keep its shape through washes. The shirts are moisture-wicking to keep you cool and dry with durable stitching and a lay-flat collar that's easily hidden when layering. These come in S-XXL in white, black and multicolor packs. Promising review: ""As far as I am concerned these are the only t shirts worth buying. They are high quality COTTON - don’t shrink up-wash and dry like a dream and stay WHITE!!!!"" — Chris Hutchin Breathable and soft jersey cotton make this multipack of shirts super wearable. They're made from 100% ribbed cotton and have a banded neckline that will keep its shape through wash and wear. Promising review: ""I grabbed two packs of these. Working around the house or lazy day I want comfortable and simple. These shirts deliver the same comfort you'd expect from the big brands at a lower price point. If you like to chill or work in cotton tees grab a pack."" — Bob Mariani Calling all tall wearers and those who like to tuck their shirts in. These moisture-wicking ""stay tucked"" shirts from Fruit of the Loom are long in the torso, allowing for a full range of movement without popping out of your pants. The soft-covered seams along the neck and shoulders make them extra comfortable, and the flat collar makes them great to layer under dress shirts. Promising review: ""Bought for husband's work shirts. They're sooo comfy I have even stolen them for bed. Super long covers his dad belly perfectly even enough to Tuck into jeans Very light weight but durable enough for construction work! Will buy again"" — scoobie Many reviewers noted grabbing these dry-fit crewnecks for active hiking and trekking travel in hot climates and liking them so much that they wore them back home. Whether you're working out or just hanging out, these polyester and spandex blend shirts will keep you dry and comfy. Promising review: ""I bought this set of shirts for a safari in Tanzania. In fact, another gentleman on our trip had purchased the same set. They are light and comfortable. They wash and dry easily. No fabric 'pilling' after laundry and the seams have held up very well. We were pleased with our purchases."" — Ray A cotton-polyester blend makes this set of T-shirts breathable and quick-drying. They're made with odor protection to keep you from getting funky, and the longer hem will keep them tucked in and covered, even when you move and groove. Promising review: ""I order these tshirts to wear under my other shirts. They are thin and lightweight and don't bunch up under my other tshirts. I ordered enough to have some to wear under my pjs in the winter when it's really cold. These are so nice and wash and dry on hot. Because they are all cotton, they can easily be stretched a little if I want them loose under my clothes I wear a med to large tshirt and I ordered these in medium. They are soft and fit well. These work for male and female."" — Happy Shopper The definition of versatility, these soft cotton Hanes shirts can be worn alone or as a base layer throughout the day. The double-needle stitching and shoulder-to-shoulder taping make the shirts feel a little extra high-end, but the crewneck and relaxed fit keep it casual and easy. Promising review: ""I only buy these Tshirts because I love the Cotton feel and the thickness. I am a bigger person so I buy the xx sizes. I have never been unhappy with Hanes. Love it and I will continue to buy these shirts. Cotton feels better rather than the stretchy stuff especially when you live in a hot, humid climate like I do."" — Denise KS If you're a Ralph Lauren fan, you probably need little convincing to snag this trio of soft, breathable shirts. They're great for layering but can also be worn alone and are made from 100% combed cotton that feels great on the skin. Promising review: ""These shirts are comfortable, long lasting, and great for throwing something on to go for a walk to the park or to the beach! They are great undershirts too!"" — Eric Kisela These soft, heather-dyed shirts are designed to look and feel like your old favorite shirt, without the pit stains and holes. They're made from a cotton/polyester blend with a wrinkle-resistant finish, keeping them fast-drying and super durable. Promising review: ""The fit of these shirts is spot on. They were purchased in size XXL and are true to size. I’m 6’ 2” tall and weigh 220 pounds and these shirts fit me really well. I usually have issues with shirts having a tight fit in the shoulders when I move.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. There is an iconic reviewer photo that any shopping writer who covers pets is probably familiar with. It shows a reviewer’s cat leaping, paws-out, into the air with the gusto you’d think only happens in cartoons. Not so. The culprit? The Cat Dancer, a cult-favorite cat toy that reviewers call the “greatest cat toy ever” and “worth its weight in gold.” On first glance, the toy may not look like much: a springy piece of steel wire with cardboard rolls at the end. But its simplicity is part of its genius, according to an expert, and its design is more thoughtful and cat-informed than you might think. “The Cat Dancer toy brilliantly taps into a cat’s hunting instincts,” Stephanie Merlin, a certified feline behavior specialist and cat wellbeing educator, told HuffPost. “Domestic cats still possess the natural drive to chase and capture prey … [and] the quick, erratic movements of the cardboard [mimic] the behavior of small prey.” Plus, as opposed to the colorful fabric wands often associated with cats, “The wire is nearly invisible to cats, especially since their eyesight is better at a distance,” Merlin explained. As a result, your cat can focus on the cardboard’s prey-like movement, getting into the proverbial zone for hunting and playing. The Cat Dancer’s ingenuity also lies in its stimulation of your cat’s taste and auditory senses. Many of us associate dogs with a love of chewing and licking, but cats enjoy doing so, too. “The cardboard is satisfying to bite,” Merlin added, “[and the] auditory element when shuffled across the floor or moved through the air increas[es] the excitement.” All in all, a stimulating and interactive toy like the Cat Dancer can help keep your kitty’s mind sharp and help combat boredom and stress, according to Merlin. It’ll also help your cat “channel those wild instincts safely,” Merlin noted, instead of acting out or damaging your belongings. Plus, playing with an interactive toy like the Cat Dancer will help strengthen your bond with your feline, according to Merlin. I concur with 29,000 other 5-star ratings on Amazon: My cat goes absolutely nuts for this toy. She loves stalking it, leaping dramatically in the air (and sometimes catching it!) before settling down and gnawing blissfully on its cardboard ends. I also love how much enjoyable exercise it gives her: She’s noticeably satisfied and tuckered out after a session with this. Plus, she sleeps better at night — meaning I don’t get woken up early in the morning. I’m convinced that the Cat Dancer is a true no-brainer addition to any cat owner’s toy arsenal, a mainstay that’s more than earned its place. It needn’t replace all your other toys — it’s good to have different options for your kitty to play with — but the Dancer is one of a kind for its stimulation of cats’ natural instincts, its hardiness and its versatility. That’s not even to mention its incredible affordability, costing less than $5 for a toy that’s more than worth its salt. If you use it so much that you do have to replace it, no problem — that’s the beauty of it being $4 and so clearly beloved. Reviewers report that they usually replace theirs with a fresh one every four to five months. Grab a Cat Dancer toy for your cat from Amazon now, or read on for what reviewers have to say: “Who knew that a small piece of rolled up brown paper at the end of a length of wire would be so compelling to the feline brain? Our cats lose their minds when this toy comes out and go full predator. It’s got to be the springy movement. I’ve secured one end to the top of a wicker hamper and kept them (and myself) entertained for days.” — Scenic Ways “I’ve never seen my cats go crazier with a toy! They are also a little bit older and it’s hard to get them jazzed about playing and this toy instantly intrigues them and gets them going. It’s also so cheap and you barely have to move your arm when playing which I love. Going to buy this for every cat I know!” — Cherise Alexander “We’ve bought my cat other expensive highly rated toys. Battery operated birds. Catnip pillows, toy mice, etc. Nothing piques his interest EXCEPT THIS. My 12 year old, neutered, overweight cat actually swats at this thing and pounces on it like the cats in the picture. It’s nice to see him energetic and enthusiastic about something. Worth every penny.” — Rigby “I bought this cat toy based on a recommendation from a friend. Based on the looks of it, I didn’t have high expectations but figured for the price, why not try it. Now I recommend this to every cat owner I know. My cat is older and would hibernate all winter. This toy actually brings her out of hibernation and gets her active again. She wants to play with it all of the time. For something so simple, it is one of my best Amazon purchases!” — A. Sloan “My cats absolutely adore this toy. It’s super worth it. They chase after it vigorously― the best toy to capture silly pictures and videos of your cats with. Your cats will thank you after you play with this!” — wileyone By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. You may have heard of the Stanley Quencher tumbler, which has had buyers lining up at 3 a.m. to get their hands on limited-edition colors before they sell out. Stanley cups are inarguably a cult-favorite item right now. But we’re obsessed with another popular water bottle that we’re convinced will unseat the Stanley as the best on-the-go hydrator this year (and not only due to the revelation earlier this year that the Stanley tumbler may “pose a risk of lead exposure” when damaged in a specific way, according to Today.com). The Owala FreeSip water bottle promises, among other things, to be manufactured completely lead-free. This “magical” bottle is such a game-changer that multiple HuffPost editors and Amazon reviewers report that after trying it, they stopped drinking from their Stanleys entirely. “I haven’t really used my Stanley tumblers since buying [an Owala],” said Janie Campbell, a former HuffPost shopping editor. The first feature that sets the Owala apart from the rest? Its innovative FreeSip spout, a “genius” dual drinking spout that acts as both a straw and a regular thermos-style opening. “You can either sip from an internal straw or tip the bottle to swig its contents without having to make any adjustments,” Campbell explained. By contrast, the Stanley bottle has a long slender straw that protrudes uncovered from the cup, leaving it exposed to dirt, bacteria and the elements. The Owala circumvents that problem with an internal straw and a durable, sleek lid that keeps its mouthpiece covered until you’re ready to pop it open and drink. “I started going to the gym last year and one day while working out I realized that the straw on my [previous water bottle] was basically exposed to all the germs everywhere,” Gabe Castaneda, a video editor at HuffPost, told me. “That’s when I started to look into other water bottles and Owala came up. I love that the mouthpiece is covered all the time… I now have two 24-ounce Owalas and love them.” The Owala’s other most impressive feature is the lid’s secure locking mechanism, which makes it fantastic for travel and completely leakproof. (Yes, really.) “The Stanley is a great product for staying hydrated at home, but its big drawback is that it will leak if tipped and you can’t just shut a lid and toss it in a bag to take with you,” Campbell said. “The Owala is an absolute game-changer for that: Its lid securely shuts with an audible confidence-inducing click, and it really does keep liquid from escaping when I need to throw it in a gym bag or if I accidentally knock it over.” Go ahead and toss the Owala into purses, backpacks, the back of your car or onto your bed or couch — you can feel confident that you won’t be dealing with a headache-inducing spill. That’s not the end of the Owala’s cool features. You’re sure to enjoy the lid’s loop carrier, which lets you carry the bottle around with just a finger if you choose. The Owala also excels at keeping drinks as cold or hot as you want them thanks to its double insulated stainless steel construction. One Amazon reviewer wrote that it kept ice frozen for an incredible two full days. Plus, it’s easy to clean, according to Castaneda, since there aren’t any hidden crevices. The bottle’s design also strikes an impressive balance between being cool and fun yet mature, with a number of vivid, classic colors that highlights its features. We doubt you’ll regret trying this superstar out. Check out what these gushing Amazon reviewers have to say about this crowd-favorite: “Forget your Stanley, Hydroflask, Yeti, favorite dupe, etc. because this is the best bottle on the market and it’s not so overhyped right now that you won’t have to take out a mortgage to afford it. I love the ability to pop the mouth protector with a simple button. The duel mouthpiece that serves as a straw for sipping or mouthpiece for tipping, is absolutely genius. The double insulated walls allow for warm or cold beverages to stay warm or cold with ease. I bought 7 of these things to give as the greatest, most affordable, and practical gift over the holiday season. Highly highly recommend.” — daniel “This is the go to water bottle for all my colleagues at the hospital: keeps beverages cool, so many great color choices, doesn’t leak, the built in straw and opening to drink is genius. Fun to decorate with stickers to personalise. Speaking as a Yeti and Stanley owner, this is waaaaaay better.” — MH5 “Hands down this is my new favorite every day carry water bottle. I was a hardcore Stanley mug lover for so long until i found this one. The mouth piece is just so much nicer, more comfortable and easy to drink from using the dual sip/swig feature. The shape of the bottle fits your hand nicely and it has kept ice cold for more than 24 hours.I’m a huge water bottle junkie and this is by far the best one i’ve found. Makes a great gift for anyone as well. HIGHLY recommend.” —  Captain Amy ″First let me say I fell into the “Stanley” fad and had to get that $46 thermos (that leaks), but thankfully someone at work recommended this and I am absolutely in love with this!!!! First....it does NOT LEAK no matter what happens, how you carry it, if it tips over, if you shake it.....never leaks. Second it is super easy and comfy to carry with the handle that tucks away when not being carried, and lastly the straw system is unlike ANY OTHER STRAW SYSTEM and it’s GREAT!!! If you try this item you will not regret it. It is the most well made and comfortable to drink out of bottle I have purchased EVER. Love love love this. 1 million stars for this!!!″ — Nan Markert “Everyone is Stanley this, Hydroflask that. But Owala is where it’s at. This free sip thing they’ve got going on is magical. I can sip, or I can chug - and in this Texas heat sometimes you just need to chug that ice water. It’s super cute with my stickers on it, the locking handle is awesome because I can toss this thing in my car seat or onto my couch or bed and it WON’T LEAK. I’m telling you - everyone needs an Owala bottle.” — Caroline Moore By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

In the aftermath of the 2020 election, then-President Donald Trump’s quest to hold on to power, first by challenging his loss and then by an ever-increasing pressure campaign on those responsible for confirming the results, culminated in a historic act of political violence: the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Now, coming up to the finish line of the next presidential election, there are indications that Americans are again worried about the possibility of political violence. In a Scripps News/Ipsos poll released Oct. 24, 62% of Americans surveyed said that violence related to the election was “somewhat” or “very” likely, with a majority of both Republicans (59%) and Democrats (70%) agreeing that was the case. There have already been worrying instances of actual violence against people and processes as the election draws near: Ballot boxes have been set on fire in several states, and there have been threats of violence at polling stations. And there have been two apparent assassination attempts against Trump. U.S. intelligence has also warned about the possibility of violence and unrest. Reports from various news publications revealed that intelligence agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, had sent local law enforcement agencies a number of bulletins warning that domestic “violent” extremists were a threat to the election and its aftermath, with candidates, election workers and others considered targets. The bulletins also warned of violence at polling places, ballot boxes and political events, according to NBC News. “If there’s a very close election, there are a lot of people who are feeling extremely angry or extremely threatened, and particularly if it’s looking like Trump loses, he has supporters who are likely to engage in a lot of threats and intimidation and possibly some physical violence,” said Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a nonpartisan think tank. The rhetoric that Trump, at least, has used on the campaign trail hasn’t helped. The Republican presidential nominee has said he would prosecute his political enemies and would use the military to quash protests, and he has consistently used violent language when talking about groups he disparages — the migrant “invasion” that is “poisoning the blood” of America, for example. And perhaps most important, he has already been laying the groundwork to once again question the validity of the election if he loses. Which, in the very likely event of a close election that could takes a few days to determine, could be a hazard. “The uncertainty is probably the biggest risk factor,” Kleinfeld said. “Obviously, if we get a strong turnout and everybody clearly knows who won, that would be wonderful. But the likelihood is a lot of litigation, dissension and mis- and dis-information.” The presidential race is uncomfortably close. Polls have Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, neck and neck, often either in a dead tie or within a percentage point or two of each other. And there are many indications that, barring an (unlikely) early landslide of results, Americans probably won’t know who won until several days after the election. In particular, the increased use of mail-in ballots and, to some extent, early voting has created delays in counting ballots in some states that could slow the vote counts. Swing state Pennsylvania, for example, prohibits election officials from opening and beginning to process mail-in ballots until the morning of Election Day. As of Oct. 30, the state had received requests for more than 2 million mail-in and absentee ballots. That’s over 2 million individual, physical ballots that will have to be removed from envelopes, checked for accurate voter information and tallied — work that cannot start until Tuesday morning. “[It’s] just very unlikely that we’ll know for days, possibly even a week or two,” says Kleinfeld. She also points out that, due to changes to the Presidential Transition Act in 2022, if the results are unclear and neither candidate has conceded by five days after the election, both candidates will be allowed to begin their transition to the Oval Office, “which will make them both look like they’re the legitimate winner to their supporters who aren’t used to seeing that happen,” Kleinfeld noted. “So I think you’re likely to have a period of real uncertainty with a lot of fear, anger ― and, as a result, you’ll see, probably, armed mobs at the homes and the workplaces of people who those individuals think could make a difference. And you’re likely to see a lot of intimidation against election officials, which we’re already seeing, but it’s likely to go up if there’s people that those individuals think ... they can pressure,” she added. However, she cautioned that the number of bad actors is fairly low. “The vast majority of Americans, while they are worried about political violence, don’t believe that it’s right, good — that political violence is justified.” A PRRI survey from early September found that fewer than 1 in 5 Americans agreed with cited measures of political violence, including the statement that “true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.” And even among those polled by Scripps/Ipsos, the vast majority said that they would accept the election results even if their preferred candidate loses. Only 8% said they were willing to accept violence in order to secure their preferred election outcome. Kleinfeld noted that simply spreading information and reassuring voters that the election is safe and fair — and straight-up normalizing the fact that we likely won’t know the results for a while — can be an important tool in staving off violence. “It’s certainly a best practice and can really reduce the likelihood of people getting agitated, concerned that something nefarious was happening,” she said. “None of this is inevitable,” she added. “By making the polls in the post-polling period more joyful and normalizing that when our country is this close, we don’t know on election night the way we used to, the less likely it is to have violence.” Legal experts have been working hard to affirm public faith in the election. “We’ve seen an assault in two dimensions, in the court of public opinion and in the court of law, and that is the basic structure that we also saw in the 2020 assault on democracy,” Norm Eisen, special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee majority during Trump’s first impeachment trial and an “ethics czar” in the Obama administration, said on a press call organized by the Defend Democracy Project earlier this week. “That is the identical pattern that has commenced in 2024 and that we expect to continue in the post-election process. And part of the reason that we can be confident that the system is strong enough once again to withstand these predations is because that’s what’s happening.” The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/advice-family-estrangement-politics-ano_l_6723db99e4b00acf55d94798","The Advice Therapists Give People Considering Severing Ties With Family Over Politics","brittany wong","2024-11-03","Family estrangements ― a term used broadly to describe situations in which someone cuts off all communication with one or more relatives ― seem to be more common than ever. Over one-quarter of adults responding to a U.S. survey by the Cornell Family Reconciliation Project reported being estranged from a family member. When applied to the general population, that means tens of millions of Americans may potentially be estranged from a relative. In the polarized years since Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, Americans are increasingly subscribing to a kind of political tribalism, even within their families. In 2019, 35% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats said they would be unhappy if their child married someone from the opposing political party ― a sharp uptick in disapproval since people were polled on the subject 50 years ago, The Atlantic reports. As Trump now goes head to head with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, mixed political families are just as splintered: People are hiding whom they’re voting for from their spouses and parents, just to keep the peace. Daughters talk about how they’re canceling out their conservative fathers’ votes and how disappointed they are that their dads are voting for Trump, a political figure they see as misogynistic. In the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, which pitted Trump against Joe Biden, HuffPost spoke to a number of Americans, Republicans and Democrats alike, who’d lost family members to partisan politics. “I do miss them,” said Jerry, whose left-leaning brother and sister dropped him from their Facebook friends list and changed their phone numbers. “It was not always like this. We were at one time a tight group, but since our parents’ passing away in 1999 and 2011, politics has consumed them,” he said. “And there’s no way they would ever vote conservative or I would vote liberal.” In a high-profile example of this trend, former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois was shunned by multiple family members who believed he’d joined the “Devil’s Army” by voting to impeach Trump. “What a disappointment you are to us and to God!” they wrote in a handwritten two-page letter featured in a New York Times profile of the politician. “It is now most embarrassing to us that we are related to you.” “A blunt social media post, a slip on the family text thread, a careless remark during a holiday celebration — the smallest offense can shatter a sibling bond made brittle by intense political partisanship.” Deborah Duley, psychotherapist and founder of Empowered Connections in Maryland, said she sees clients struggle with this on the regular. “It seems that their family members feel more empowered in the past few years to say what they want regardless of how hurtful this could be towards their family member,” said Duley, whose counseling practice specializes in women, girls and the LGBTQ+ community. The Supreme Court’s decision in 2022 to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion has been an especially thorny subject among family members of different political stripes, Duley told HuffPost. The pandemic has also exacerbated the divide, given how politicized arguments about mask usage, vaccination status and individual risk assessments became. “A blunt social media post, a slip on the family text thread, a careless remark during a holiday celebration — the smallest offense can shatter a sibling bond made brittle by intense political partisanship,” said Fern Schumer Chapman, author of “Brothers, Sisters, Strangers: Sibling Estrangement and the Road to Reconciliation.” Can these bonds ever be recovered? Is walking away ever the best option for your mental well-being? In this season of familial rifts, we asked family therapists like Schumer Chapman and Duley to share some of the suggestions they give to clients considering cutting ties with family members over politics. Here’s what they had to say. Ibinye Osibodu-Onyali, a therapist in Houston, asks clients in this situation to weigh the pros and cons of cutting a family member off. “We explore questions like, if we were to put politics aside, will the relationship still be worth saving? Are there other parts of the relationship that you would miss? Is it possible to still respect your family members despite their political opinions?” Joshua Coleman, a psychologist and author of “Rules of Estrangement: Why Adult Children Cut Ties and How to Heal the Conflict,” believes that some people are too quick to end relationships with friends and relatives with whom they disagree. “It’s usually better to just agree to disagree and focus your time and attention on what’s valuable about that person, especially when you consider that estrangements often fracture out into other relationships such as siblings, cousins, or grandparents,” he said. Maintaining the relationship typically requires one person to take “the high road, show leadership toward healing, and not allow himself or herself to be pulled into conflict,” Coleman added. If the parties involved are able to separate the person from their ideology, there’s room to preserve the relationship, Osibodu-Onyali said. “Sometimes it might be worth it to try and understand why the other person has come to believe what they believe rather than trying to convince them to believe what you believe,” she said. “Only then can families move forward.” If you find your sibling’s politics offensive, restrict or block social media accounts, Schumer Chapman advised. “Then for offline conversations, have an exit strategy for the moments when things get tense,” she said. “Use strong boundaries as a shield so you’re in control and the toxicity doesn’t get to you.” A restrictive arrangement is a better choice between having no sibling relationship and having some contact with a brother or sister, she said. Duley says you may want to minimize contact as much as possible, including skipping any “extra” events such as recurring family game nights. “Other suggestions included avoiding them completely, shortening [your] time at a holiday dinner ― maybe you leave early or come late ― and thinking about taking a break from this relative completely until further notice,” she said. Politics has always come between family members, but there’s no doubt that the tenor of these conversations post-Trump has become more intense; many people really feel like they can’t accept someone whose morals and values are so at odds with their own. It’s the idea that the personal is political. As one person tweeted recently, “Disagreeing over politics only applies to sh*t like ‘I want our local tax dollars to fund x street vs y new project.’ Compassion cannot be allowed to be political, otherwise — well, look where that landed us. This is why I’m estranged from my family: Self care.” Is estrangement ― or at least distancing ― ever a form of self-care, especially if a family member’s actions and words are taking a toll on your well-being? Duley believes so. “I have always been in favor of cutting any toxic person out of your life no matter their relation to you,” she said. “Toxicity all feels the same no matter who the person is to us so to protect our mental health, cutting off from certain people can sometimes be warranted and even encouraged.” Sometimes estrangement is the best option, especially if you’re constantly being hurt by the family member in question. “Just because it’s your father does not mean they can treat you disrespectfully over a disagreement,” she said. “Are they calling you names? Putting you down? Being purposefully mean and unkind over your opinions and actions? If so, it’s time to make a decision about protecting yourself.” Of course, as all the therapists stressed to us, distancing is not a decision to be made lightly. Duley recommends asking yourself the following questions before cutting ties: “If you can answer these questions honestly, they will give you enough information to decide whether or not to keep this person in your circle,” she said. “If they are unable to be rational and calm, distancing yourself can be the solution such as unfollowing them on social media or restricting their access to you through family events.” An estrangement doesn’t have to be permanent. If at any point you’re looking to repair things with your family member, Schumer Chapman recommends writing an email or letter. In the letter, emphasize your desire to reestablish relations and propose parameters for the relationship, like banning certain topics. Then chat about what your relative needs you to compromise on, too. To illustrate what this might look like, Schumer Chapman shared the story of a progressive woman she interviewed who managed to end estrangement with her brother, a survivalist type who lives in Idaho. “She’s adopted strategies that her cousins’ family uses to transcend their deep political differences. What they do is put their children’s needs first,” Schumer Chapman said. “As the woman told me, they always think about what’s best for the little ones.” They also deliberately pursue activities that bring the family together, such as kids’ sporting events.

Front desk staffers are prepped and ready to help hotel guests. While not all hotels offer the exact same amenities (or level of care), there are some nearly across-the-board requests they can assist with — and you’re probably unaware of some of these offerings. Below, hotel front desk staff from across the country share how they can help you have a relaxing or luxurious stay: Online dining guides and social media make it easy to just use your phone to find a good place for dinner, but front desk workers carry a wealth of real-life knowledge in this realm. Jessica Kaup, the guest services supervisor for the Union Station Hotel Nashville Yards, said she’s always happy to recommend local restaurants to guests and can even give tailored advice to folks, whether they’re looking for the best eateries within walking distance, the best places to eat with kids or restaurants that are good for those with dietary restrictions. “All of us have our spots that we recommend for all of those things,” said Kaup, who added that sometimes front desk staff can even help you get a reservation at a hard-to-get-into restaurant. The fun part about asking for restaurant recommendations is “no matter which person you ask, you’re going to get a different answer, and you’re going to get a total different vibe,” said Ericka Nelson, the director of operations at Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants and general manager of the Kimpton EPIC in Miami. “I don’t remember five years ago this request being quite as popular as it is now, and I see it all the time where a guest is coming in for some sort of a celebration, and they would like the front desk to decorate the room for their anniversary, their birthday, their graduation, whatever that is,” Nelson said. Front desks will often have basic supplies to make a room look special, whether that’s balloons or rose petals or something of the like. If you want something more, it may cost extra, Nelson noted. Some hotel front desk staff are also willing to use the decor you provide to bedeck a room for you. “I really like setting up for events,” said Elena Fermin-Rivers, the rooms comptroller at Omni Boston Hotel at the Seaport. For example, “We had this group that came in and she dropped her little carry-on suitcase with decorations for a bachelorette, and we went upstairs, took her decorations [and] put them up so when the party arrived ... everything was already set up in the room.” If you need help securing transportation during your trip, the front desk staff should be able to assist you. This can be especially helpful when you need to be somewhere at a specific time, like the airport, cruise terminal or a tour meeting spot. “We have a couple transportation companies when we know that somebody really needs that reliability,” Nelson said. In this same realm, you can ask the front desk staff for directions if you’d rather get somewhere via your own transportation, according to Fermin-Rivers. “I particularly enjoy helping guests plan their itineraries and discover unique local experiences, as it’s always rewarding to see them explore and appreciate what Colorado Springs has to offer,” said Bryce Baron, the guest service manager at The Mining Exchange Hotel in Colorado. Just as with asking hotel workers for restaurant recommendations, they’ll be able to give you local insight into popular attractions in the area and offer tips on when best to visit and how to secure tickets ahead of time. Front desk staff can also help folks book hotel rooms that are next to each other or that are adjoining. Fermin-Rivers said this is a common request for folks traveling with family, and especially for people with kids. Also in this realm? Crib requests, she noted. If you’re staying at a pet-friendly hotel, it’s likely they have items you may need for your pet. “We have ... pet water bowls and little stuff [like] pet treats that we can put in the room,” explained Fermin-Rivers. While you may not always inform the hotel that you’re bringing your pet, it’s a good idea to do so. This way, you can find out the amenities they offer for your furry friend and arrange all of that ahead of time. It’s not a great feeling when you get to your hotel after a day of traveling just to realize you forgot something small that you really need, like toothpaste or a safety pin. Or maybe you realize the cafe is closed but you really need a cup of coffee. Kaup said it’s common for front desk staff to be able to assist with these things, and it’s one of her favorite kinds of tasks to help with. “It feels like so much to that person who you’re helping because they feel like you’re doing something special for them, or they feel like you’re doing something that is ... not necessarily with the grain,” Kaup said. “But it’s so small, like it’s so small to find you a safety pin, and it’s so easy to go grab you a cup of coffee when the cafe is closed.” Nelson noted that it’s common for properties to have seemingly random things in stock just for this reason — to help someone feel at home and taken care of when they forget the small things like a steamer or hair ties. You probably don’t think much about hotel loyalty programs. Maybe you’ve used one to sign up for free Wi-Fi or a members-only rate (which are, of course, perks), but have you dug into the preferences and settings in your loyalty account? Booking hotels and signing up for loyalty programs is largely done online, but in the days when these things were done in-person, guests had the option to check off preferences for their stay ― everything from pillow types to requests for certain rooms. Kate Casey, the guest ambassador manager at the Omni Boston Hotel at the Seaport, said that because things are now done almost entirely online, folks don’t think to fill out their preferences, but this can be done via many hotel loyalty programs. For the property Casey works at, “they can request Swedish pillows, they can request buckwheat pillows, noise machines, [rooms with certain views] and when they’re just enrolling quickly online, they don’t often see that.” Fermin-Rivers encourages “people to look at every hotel and what they offer and their loyalty membership. That way, the specials are recorded and can be saved, and that way, it’s just easier when they come into the hotel, we can provide it.” Hotel staff want to make your stay as enjoyable as possible, and having these preferences saved is just one way to do that.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-tell-when-nutrition-advice-on-social-media-is-rotten-ano_l_671a780fe4b0ede6b2c08240","How To Tell When Nutrition Advice On Social Media Is Rotten","rohina katoch sehra","2024-11-03","Nutrition influencers run the gamut, from conspiracy theorists convinced that grocery shopping is the delicate act of dodging disease to the licensed nutritionist who shares debunking posts. Accounts and opinions proliferate by the hour, all equally earnest and legitimate-seeming. It’s harder and harder to differentiate between the tedious combativeness of science deniers and ethical fact-first takedowns. The trends that unchecked nutrition influencers set can quickly go viral and correspond to nearly every broad category of nutrition pseudoscience infesting the present-day internet. Arranged on a credibility spectrum that goes from science-adjacent to totally unscientific, these are: “Scienceploitation.” Canadian health law and policy expert Timothy Caulfield coined this term to explain the enthusiastic adoption and breakneck mainstreaming of legitimate but emergent research for profit. It is most commonly done by companies and wellness investors eager for a first-movers advantage, and often seen with supplement-shillers who exploit the fact that supplements do not go through an approval process by the Food and Drug Administration. Biohacking. This is championed mostly by Silicon Valley types like tech billionaire Bryan Johnson, who is determined to de-age himself with the aid of obsessive vitals-monitoring, extreme diet modification geared to lower body fat percentage, and beta-stage technology aimed at outperforming regular exercise to deliver peak physique. CAM (complementary and alternative medicine). Positing that the real and perceived inadequacies of conventional medicine need other forms of healing to step in, complementary and alternative medicine (or complementary and integrative medicine) is a controversial field that pushes combined treatment protocols. Acupuncture and yoga are two examples of the alternative half of this complementary approach. Despite World Health Organization recognition and functioning departments in accredited hospitals, critics say that CAM is still not optimally regulated, tends to deepen patients’ resistance to more evidence-based treatments, and is packaged as being more effective than it actually is, especially by buzzy celebrity doctors. Chemical phobia. This is the belief that all artifice, embodied by the ingredients in mass-produced food, is bad, and that food is either clean and wholesome or loaded with toxins. We interviewed top nutrition science experts engaged in nutrition education for their views on the most persistent (and dangerous) myths circulating on social media. An author, gut biome specialist and professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London, Tim Spector believes that blanket mistrust of processed food makes no sense. “Processed food is not the issue. Processed foods include cheese, tinned beans and sourdough bread,” he said. “The mistrust is of industrially manufactured ultra-processed foods (UPFs) — or, as I call them, edible foodlike substances. And it certainly is justified. However, it is not surprising that we are attracted to these foods, given their affordable prices, hyperpalatability and convenience. Food companies tap into our desire to be healthier by labeling processed foods with claims such as ‘high protein,’ ‘low in fat,’ ‘low in sugar.’ The use of ‘health halos’ on UPFs is driving us to consume foods that are bad for us, under the guise that they might be good for us.” He identifies the high-protein bar as a key offender in the UPF category. “These are usually laden with dozens of chemical additives and serve no purpose to nourish us, but disguise themselves as healthy,” he said. Spector categorically disapproves of restrictive eating. “Consistency is more important than perfection, and no foods should be off the table,” he said. “Calorie counting is not a sustainable approach to maintaining a healthy weight and doesn’t encourage eating good-quality food. Quality of food is more important than calories, and a positive nutrition approach of adding healthy foods to our plate is more sustainable.” Spector also believes that the act of skipping breakfast isn’t as sacrilegious as it is made out to be. “The evidence now shows that having an overnight fast of at least 12 hours is beneficial for gut health and metabolism, meaning that many of us might skip breakfast and have brunch a bit later and feel better for it,” he said. Megan Rossi, who goes by @theguthealthdoctor on Instagram, has a Ph.D. in gut health from the University of Queensland and leads research on gut-focused nutrition therapies at King’s College London. “One common myth I often see is that bloating after eating is always due to some food intolerance,” she said. “A little bit of bloating can actually be a sign of a well-fed community of bacteria.” She cautions against restricting intake on the basis of a good-old food baby. “There are lots of reasons why someone may experience bloating that aren’t necessarily related to food either, so we shouldn’t restrict healthy foods without considering other potential factors,” she said. “Restricting foods unnecessarily can negatively impact someone’s gut health, as well as overall well-being both now and in the future.” On the topic of foods that she would like to see legislated off retail shelves, she mentioned bread because “it often has unnecessary additives as well as palm oil and sugar, which consumers may not always be aware of” — especially since “there are lots of popular and delicious breads on the shelves that don’t contain these additives, so it seems unnecessary to be adding these things in.” She said that “no refined sugar” is an overused food label, “despite products often containing things like coconut, nectar and date syrup, which are in fact refined. Despite these sugars being marketed as natural, they still don’t contain compounds like fiber. Therefore, they can have the same impact in our body when it comes to things like raising your blood sugar.” On the question of what foods and nutrition approaches deserve a revisit, she mentioned whole grains and snacking respectively. “Many whole grains often get demonized because many contain gluten (wheat, barley, rye),” she said. “However, as long as you don’t have celiac disease, then these can serve as an important part of your diet. Research has shown that people who regularly consume gluten-containing whole grains tend to have better gut health because they contain probiotics as well as other nutritionally beneficial compounds.” U.K.-based Dr. Idrees Mughal’s hugely popular videos on TikTok and Instagram make short work of hucksters in the wellness space. His snappy takedowns of questionable content are packed with peer-review citations and are a master class in debunking. Science literacy has never felt so satisfying to watch. “Toxic. Inflammatory. Poison. Clean. Detox,” the National Health Service doctor told us, when asked to list language that ticks him off. “These are all quackery words that have no real meaning. If they knew what a toxin was, they wouldn’t be using it in the context they’re using it. If someone claims that something is inflammatory, I want you to ask them these questions: 1) What does ‘inflammatory’ mean? 2) Which inflammatory cytokines are you proposing are increasing when they do the thing you’re saying? 3) Which part of the body is being affected? 4) What effects are you claiming this has on the body? 5) Where’s the evidence for this? Ask them these questions and watch them squirm.” Misinformation specialists have an easy tell. “Generally people instill fear in their content in order to get you to buy into whatever narrative they’re selling,” Mughal said. “Absolutist statements such as ‘this is the WORST food’ or ‘the MOST inflammatory thing you can do’ — statements like this make it clear the individual is not aware of the nuance or science that foods can have differing effects on different people. There is no universal ‘worst’ or ‘best’ food for anyone. Someone that claims to have ‘secret knowledge,’ or if they start a video with ‘they don’t want you to know this’ — who is ‘they’? This is classic tinfoil hattery, and no serious academic or health care professional would say things like that.” Mughal acknowledges that navigating today’s complex information landscape is challenging. “While many sources are behind paywalls, summaries and overviews of research are often available for free. Websites like PubMed and Google Scholar can be useful. Some researchers also share their work on platforms like ResearchGate,” he said. “Recognize that everyone, including experts, can have biases. Look for potential conflicts of interest, and always cross-reference information. Also remember that just because something or someone is ‘funded’ doesn’t automatically mean that information is invalid. Research has to be funded from somewhere.” “You don’t have to be an expert to ask questions,” said London-based Alan Flanagan, who holds a Ph.D. in nutrition from the University of Surrey and founded the consulting firm Alinea Nutrition, adding that questioning is the first thing he encourages laypeople to do. On every platform, including his own, he is relentless about putting the science front and center, and is known for compassionate deep dives on topics most people would flinch from. “If someone has made a claim, always ask: ‘What is this based on? What evidence supports this claim?’” Flanagan said. “Honest brokers will be happy to demonstrate not only what evidence supports their position, but why it does; grifters often become defensive or fob people off, which is a red flag.” For those confused by the glut of information online, his advice is to “simply follow national dietary guidelines.” “Dietary guidelines are also attacked by quacks and grifters, but we have evidence from multiple countries that higher adherence to the characteristics of those dietary pattern recommendations are associated with lower risk of adverse health outcomes,” Flanagan said. “Grifters sell people the idea that the rise of obesity is because of the dietary guidelines. It’s an absurd claim, and one immediately falsifiable by reference to a simple fact: No one started following the guidelines. Average adherence, whether looking at the U.S. or U.K., is very low. So for most people who are confused by all the noise, this is always my advice: Get off social media and just follow these recommendations.” Flanagan believes that seed oils, specifically rapeseed or canola, do not deserve a bad rap. “As a seed oil, it is vilified for purely pseudoscientific reasons, but it has an excellent nutritional profile,” he said. “And the evidence shows it is associated with improved cardiometabolic health markers. The claims about this oil being ‘rancid,’ ‘toxic’ or whatever else are flat out nonsensical.” He stressed that there is no “enemy food.” “If there is an enemy, to me it is clearly the purveyors of misinformation that cloud the simple reality that we largely know the characteristics of a dietary pattern associated with good health (e.g., unsaturated fats over saturated fats; whole grain carbs over refined; more of a contribution from plant protein sources; adequate dietary fiber intakes, low sodium intakes),” Flanagan said. “These principles are universal, although we can see regional and cultural differences in how these characteristics are achieved in terms of food.” He believes that a healthy approach to nourishing oneself is the simplest, most pragmatic one. “I think we’re all a bit hyperfocused on diet and nutrition right now, and could do with zooming out and reframing the conversation away from such a micromanaged focus on diet. Nutrition is important, but so is social support, stress levels, activity levels, etc.,” Flanagan said. “I think people need to be a bit less myopically focused on some of this stuff. … Just ask how much the micromanaging is costing you, financially, socially, emotionally. Too many people are paying a high price across all of those domains and calling it ‘health.’” Maryland-based Dr. Michael Greger, a founding member and fellow of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, provides impartial nutrition analysis and advice on the platform NutritionFacts.org. His work stands out for being unmediated by vested interests and is a great resource for anyone looking to cut through the clutter of nutrition advice online. Greger thinks the protein mania is ridiculous. “The obsession with protein is out of control,” he said. “Ninety-seven percent of Americans get enough protein (and most of the 3% who don’t are likely on extreme calorie-restricted diets and just not enough, period). Conversely, 97% of Americans are deficient in fiber (not reaching the recommended daily minimum), and 98% are deficient in potassium. Why don’t we hear about those?” He started NutritionFacts.org because “it’s the resource I wish I had when I was in medical school. With all the corrupting commercial influences out there, I felt I just needed to bring the peer-reviewed evidence out to the public.” He believes that those who create and spread misinformation online should be held more accountable. “People need to show their work,” Greger said. “They should share exactly how they arrived at their conclusions. When it comes to something as life-and-death important as nutrition, we should demand to see the evidence. And citing a study isn’t enough. They should show you the study, exactly what they gleaned from it and why, and link to it so people can download it themselves.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-there-actually-any-pumpkin-in-canned-pumpkin-goog_l_671a74afe4b0ede6b2c07fa7","Is There Actually Any Pumpkin In Canned Pumpkin?","sydney wingfield","2024-11-03","Is canned pumpkin a lie? Even though a label may read “100% pumpkin,” some argue this isn’t quite the case. It’s debated that there may be something other than just pumpkin in the can — and we’re not talking about ingredients to enhance its taste and texture. While you may be imagining that canned pumpkin is made from a Halloween-shaped pumpkin, it’s rumored that your canned pumpkin may actually contain something more akin to butternut squash. So what’s really in there? Yes, there is pumpkin in canned pumpkin. But there’s also squash. Why? Because all pumpkins are squash. Pumpkins, squash and gourds are all part of the Cucurbita family, which encompasses about 975 species of plants. Since the term “pumpkin” doesn’t have any botanical meaning, it’s considered squash. The Cucurbita family has many varieties with various flavors and textures. Canned pumpkin has been packed from certain types of firm-shelled, golden-fleshed and sweet squash for years. While pumpkins are squash, any hard-skinned squash can be considered a pumpkin since there isn’t a specific distinction when it comes to what defines a pumpkin. The reason some people believe canned pumpkin is made sans pumpkin may come down to a pretty lenient description offered by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1957: “Canned pumpkin and canned squash is the canned product prepared from clean, sound, properly matured, golden fleshed, firm shelled, sweet varieties of either pumpkins or squashes by washing, stemming, cutting, steaming and reducing to a pulp.” In 1988, the Food and Drug Administration issued a ruling that impacts how brands label their canned pumpkin today. It states, “Since 1938, we have consistently advised canners that we would not initiate regulatory action solely because of their using the designation ‘pumpkin’ or ‘canned pumpkin’ on labels for articles prepared from golden-fleshed, sweet squash, or mixtures of such squash with field pumpkins. In the absence of any evidence that this designation misleads or deceives consumers, we see no reason to change this policy.” The line between pumpkin and squash is blurry, so some squash are referred to as both. So if you say that canned pumpkin is made with squash, and your mom says it’s made with pumpkin, you can both be 100% right. Canned pumpkin most likely contains no amount of the quintessential, bright orange jack o’lantern pumpkin many of us imagine when thinking of pumpkins. In fact, they aren’t very tasty at all. “All pumpkins, including the Dickinson pumpkin Libby’s uses, are a variety of squash belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family or gourd family,” said Eduardo Vivas, senior manager of brand marketing for Libby’s. A Dickinson pumpkin, often referred to as a Dickinson squash, has a beige exterior and lacks the deep ribbing of the round, orange pumpkins you may carve around Halloween. They are usually larger in size but are more of an oblong shape, with outer rind coloring similar to the butternut squash. They’re preferred when baking and cooking because of their creamy texture. Most canned pumpkin you’ll find in your local grocery store (including Libby’s and Nestle) is made with the Dickinson pumpkin. But it’s common for some canned pumpkin brands to mix other types of winter squash, like butternut or hubbard, with the Dickinson pumpkin.

The NBA quickly said it has opened an investigation into the matter. Embiid took issue with Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes, who mentioned the All-Star center’s late brother and his son — both named Arthur — in columns questioning Embiid’s professionalism and effort not being in shape after playing in the Paris Olympics. Embiid has yet to play for the 76ers this season. As reporters entered the locker room to talk to players, Embiid stood and confronted Hayes. “The next time you bring up my dead brother and my son again, you are going to see what I’m going to do to you and I’m going to have to ... live with the consequences,” Embiid said to Hayes. Embiid continued, with several instances of profanity in the next few sentences. Hayes offered an apology, which Embiid did not want. “That’s not the f——— first time.” Embiid said. Embiid later said that he doesn’t care what reporters say. “But you do,” Hayes answered. Embiid appeared to get louder at that point, and not long afterward pushed Hayes on the shoulder while the team’s public relations chief got between them. Another PR person moved Tyrese Maxey’s interview to the hallway outside the locker room, trying to clear reporters. At the same time, a team security person asked the media not to report on what had happened. Embiid yelled over the security guard. “They can do whatever they want,” Embiid said. “I don’t give a s—-.” Embiid had called Hayes out in a press conference following practice on Friday at the team’s training facility, referring to him as “Marcus, whatever his name is” and questioning critics of his prolonged absence. Hayes recently wrote a story saying that Embiid disrespects the 76ers and the game, and that the team should consider giving fans refunds when Embiid doesn’t play. “I’ve done way too much for this … city to be treated like this, done way too ... much,” Embiid said Friday. “I wish I was as lucky as other ones, but that doesn’t mean that I’m not trying and I’m not doing whatever it takes to be out there, which I’m gonna be here pretty soon.” ""Joel Embiid got into a physical altercation, shoving a columnist in the postgame locker room tonight."" @ShamsCharania on Joel Embiid and the NBA's investigation into the incident on Saturday. pic.twitter.com/p2z3nJqrEY The next four years will change America forever.

What’s in it for the guy?” Che said during the “Saturday Night Live” news segment this weekend. “But then I realized if he doesn’t win this race, he could go to jail,” Che continued. “Like literally, his sentencing is coming up right after the election. That’s why he’s blowing that microphone. He’s trying to suck his way to freedom.” Che and co-host Colin Jost mocked Trump after he experienced apparent technical difficulties at a campaign rally in Wisconsin and criticized the height of the microphone stands. Trump then went up to the mic stand on his lectern and bobbed his head up and down, mouth open, in a move that many described as mimicking oral sex. Jost reacted to a clip of Trump’s wild act. “Dude. Even more embarrassing, the microphone immediately tapped him on the back of the head,” Jost quipped. You can watch more clips from “Weekend Update” below.

Tim Kaine (D-Va.) made a surprise appearance on “Saturday Night Live” to pose a straightforward question to a game show contestant seemingly caught up on U.S. politics: “What’s my name?” “I was Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential running mate,” said Kaine, as he reminded the startled contestant (played by “SNL” host John Mulaney) about the 2016 election in the game show sketch. He continued: “At the time, you said it was the most important election in American history, and that democracy was on the line. It’s been less than eight years. What’s my name?” Earlier in the sketch, Mulaney’s character ― a Democratic voter just a little bit self-satisfied about his knowledge of U.S. politics ― had confidently guessed the names of second gentleman Doug Emhoff and special counsel Jack Smith after seeing pictures of them. “You seem really invested in the 2024 election,” the game show’s host (played by Michael Longfellow) told Mulaney. “Of course I am. This is the most important election in American history. Democracy is on the line,” Mulaney replied. Kaine recalled Mulaney voting for him to be “one heartbeat away from the Oval Office” in an election more recent than the release of the 2016 film “Zootopia.” “What’s my name?” Kaine asked again. Mulaney appeared stumped, protesting that it wasn’t his fault he couldn’t remember Kaine’s name, since Kaine wasn’t “a more memorable guy” like Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. “This is very much a guy like Tim Walz. Let’s see them side by side,” Longfellow replied, showing a split-screen graphic of Walz and Kaine. “Wow,” Longfellow said. “Not only does he look exactly like Tim Walz, his name was also Tim.” You can watch more of the “What’s That Name?” sketch below.

You can open doors,” Harris joked, referring to the GOP nominee struggling to open a garbage truck door at a recent campaign stunt. The vice president was initially scheduled to head to Detroit on Saturday, but instead made the unannounced trip to “SNL” to appear on its final episode before Election Day. She joins a number of presidential candidates who have appeared on “SNL” over the years, including Trump in 2015, Hillary Clinton that same year and Barack Obama in 2007. The vice president’s cameo arrived in the show’s cold open, when Rudolph, playing Harris during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania, wished that she could talk to someone who has been in her “shoes” ― a Black and South Asian woman running for president, “preferably from the Bay Area.” Harris then appeared as Rudolph’s reflection in a mirror, as the two played around with the vice president’s first name to call for an end to the “drama-la” and to “keep calm-a-la and carry on-a-la.” In the final seconds of the sketch, the two women stood side by side as Rudolph declared she was going to “vote for us.” “Great! Any chance you are registered in Pennsylvania?” Harris asked. “Nope, I am not,” Rudolph replied. “Well, it was worth a shot,” Harris said.

Kennedy Jr. — a possible candidate for a role in Donald Trump’s cabinet, should Trump retake the White House — claims that a new Trump administration would immediately advise against the use of fluoride in U.S. public water systems. Kennedy, a former presidential candidate who has endorsed Trump and a prominent vaccine skeptic, suggested this would happen on the first day of a new Trump administration. For decades, U.S. health regulators have recommended adding a small amount of fluoride to drinking water supplies to prevent tooth decay. Fluoride at such a low dose is generally considered both safe and effective to protect oral health. “On January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water. Fluoride is an industrial waste associated with arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders, and thyroid disease,” Kennedy posted Saturday on X, formerly Twitter. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Kennedy’s remarks. Trump and Kennedy, an environmental lawyer who tried to walk back his criticism of the COVID vaccine during his presidential campaign, have both floated a health-focused role for him — possibly a post commanding health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At his rally last weekend at Madison Square Garden, Trump said he would let Kennedy “go wild on health, ... go wild on the medicines.” On Friday in Nevada, Trump said Kennedy would also be “in charge of women’s health.” Kennedy, according to a video obtained by CNN, told supporters he might be given control of more than one health-focused agency.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tim-sheehy-gunshot-wound_n_67269ab3e4b01e8b242527b5","'So Confusing': Montana GOP Senate Candidate Gives Shifting Explanations About Gunshot Wound","igor bobic","2024-11-02","Montana Republican Senate candidate Tim Sheehy offered shifting explanations for a gunshot wound he’d sustained on his arm in a new interview on Friday — a controversy that has nagged his campaign against Sen. Jon Tester (D-Montana). Last month, Kim Peach, a former U.S. Park Service ranger, came forward publicly and said that Sheehy accidentally shot himself with a gun on a family trip in 2015 at Glacier National Park in Montana — contradicting the former Navy SEAL’s campaign bio, which says he was “wounded in combat.” Recently, Sheehy has claimed that he actually lied to the ranger in 2015, telling Peach that he’d accidentally shot himself, in order to conceal the fact that he may have obtained the bullet wound during a friendly-fire incident while deployed abroad. Asked Friday if there were medical records to prove his story, Sheehy told former Fox News host Megyn Kelly there is “not an extensive medical record” from his emergency room hospital visit. He said he had “internal bleeding” after the bullet in his arm became dislodged after he fell while on a hike in the park. “There’s not a whole lot to talk about,” Sheehy said, calling the story “a distraction.” “So confusing,” Kelly responded during an interview with Sheehy on her SiriusXM radio program. Sheehy has also offered contradictory explanations for who may have been responsible for the gunshot wound. In his interview with Kelly on Friday, the 37-year-old GOP Senate hopeful suggested that he may have been shot by an Afghan ally in a friendly-fire incident. He called the environment at the time “messy” and described the challenges of operating alongside Afghan forces, saying it was “very, very common where you’d have Afghans who, either intentionally or unintentionally, would end up shooting friendly forces.” “It was a hazardous environment when you’re dealing with actual hostile forces ... but half the time, you’ve also gotta have one eyeball looking at our partner forces,” he added. But in his 2023 memoir, Sheehy wrote he was “struck by a friendly fire ricochet bullet” by a fellow SEAL who he wanted to shield from repercussions. “I didn’t want the teammate who had fired the shot, a total stud who went on to have a successful career as a SEAL, to be punished officially or reputationally ― by an accident that was in no way his fault,” Sheehy wrote in the book. “It wasn’t even a tough or dangerous mission; it was a milk run, just like this training flight, but it went bad quickly.” When the Post asked Sheehy about that passage in his book in April, he said he was not certain whether he was shot by friendly fire or by whom, describing an incident where his team came under fire at night. “To be very clear, I don’t know where the bullet came from,” Sheehy said. “Sometimes people find that hard to believe, but in Hollywood, they make it look like [in] a gunfight everyone knows exactly what’s going on. … That’s just not how it goes down.” Meanwhile, the ranger, Peach, told The New York Times earlier this month he was “100 percent sure [Sheehy] shot himself that day” in 2015. He recalled unloading Sheehy’s gun at the time and “finding five live rounds and the casing of one that had been fired,” as the Times reported. Republicans have dismissed the allegation on the basis that Peach has a history of supporting Democrats. The next four years will change America forever.

The RNC lawsuit claims the commission intends to limit poll watchers on Election Day, but the commission denied that anyone was “arbitrarily” limited from observing polls. “The Milwaukee Election Commission refutes the claims made by the RNC. Despite the [commission] maintaining open communications with the RNC, including meeting as recently as last night, it seems that filing a lawsuit was their goal all along,” Milwaukee Election Commission Executive Director Paulina Gutierrez said Monday in a statement. Observers “may be subject to reasonable limitations,” Gutierrez said, but “at no point was the Republican Party denied the presence of observing during the in-person absentee voting period, nor will they be denied that presence on Election Day.” Poll workers are different from watchers — workers administer elections, while watchers merely observe and can raise challenges — but an abundance of unruly watchers swarming already inundated workers is a recipe for delay and disruption. In Wisconsin, observers must follow rules set by the commission. In-person absentee ballot voting began in the state on Oct. 22 and ended on Nov. 3. The RNC alleges that watchers of in-person absentee and early voting were restricted at three early voting sites — American Serb Hall, Good Hope Branch Library and the Capitol Drive Voting Center — in Wisconsin. At some of these centers, the RNC claims that the commission allowed there to be only one watcher per political party despite there being space for “far more observers.” Such a limitation instills distrust and causes a “lack of voter confidence in our electoral process,” according to the RNC lawsuit.

The RNC lawsuit emphasizes that the inspector and commission are obligated to create numerous “areas” for observers at polling centers, not just one area. During the 2020 election, Wisconsin was one of several states that became a hotbed for Donald Trump’s fake electors scheme and the “Stop the Steal” movement. This year, Wisconsin Watch and ProPublica joined forces to assess the situation for 2024 and found that right-wing strategists have led a significant push to recruit thousands of poll workers who align closely with Trump.

While attending a 10th anniversary screening of the franchise’s first film on Sunday in Los Angeles, Reeves, 60, got candid about how performing the physically demanding stunts as the gun-toting hitman cost him his lunch at times. “I had so many wonderful teachers and guidance, and worked with so many talented actors, actresses and stunt people in the sense of it’s such a dance and collaboration and cooperation,” he said during a panel discussion with co-star Ian McShane, co-director Chad Stahelski and producer Erica Lee, People magazine reported.

The box office hit spawned three sequels, with “John Wick 4” most recently hitting theaters in March 2023. Reeves deemed the film franchise’s fourth installment the “hardest physical role” he’s ever experienced in an interview with Total Film in January 2023. “‘John Wick: Chapter 4’ was the hardest physical role I’ve ever had in my career so far,” he told the publication. “They really trained me up to be able to have what we call the toolbox.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Rodrigo’s comments left social media users on X (formerly Twitter) with differing opinions.

On Sunday, the “Dawson’s Creek” alum announced his diagnosis via People. “I’ve been privately dealing with this diagnosis and have been taking steps to resolve it, with the support of my incredible family,” the 47-year-old father of six told the magazine in an exclusive. After the news broke on Sunday, the “Varsity Blues” star followed up his announcement with an eye-opening post published to his Instagram account that same day, in which he explained why he felt the need to keep his health status a secret. “Each year, approximately 2 billion people around the world receive this diagnosis. And I’m one of them,” he began. “There’s no playbook for how [to] announce these things, but I’d planned on talking about it at length with People magazine at some point soon ... to raise awareness and tell my story on my own terms.” But, as the “Rules of Attraction” star went on to explain, this plan “had to be altered early this morning when I was informed that a tabloid was going to run with the news.” The “Don’t Trust the B―― in Apartment 23” alum went on to reveal that some of his loved ones weren’t even aware of his diagnosis until they learned it through the press. “Apologies to all the people in my life who I’d planned on telling myself,” he said. “Nothing about this process has occurred on my preferred timeline…” Van Der Beek also noted that although he’s been “dealing with this privately until now” he’s “in a good place and feeling strong.” “It’s been quite the initiation, and I’ll tell you more when I’m ready,” he wrote.

Now the former Fox News host turned Donald Trump toadie is blaming abortions for the increase in hurricanes. Carlson made the dubious claim Monday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast during a discussion about spirituality that stemmed from his recent claim he’d been attacked by a demon. Somehow the conversation morphed into Carlson decreeing that anyone who thinks reproductive rights are a good thing is “evil” and practicing child sacrifice. Carlson then claimed that people who don’t agree with his thinking are “worshiping abortion, the killing of kids, not as something that, like, needs to happen unfortunately, but as something that is good, that’s pro-abortion.” He then proclaimed that abortion likely causes hurricanes. “I’m sure I’ll be attacked for saying this, but I really believe it. People are like, oh, well, we had another hurricane, must be global warming,” Carlson said. “No, it’s probably abortion, actually. Just being honest.” Carlson continued: “You can’t kill children on purpose knowing that you’re doing that in exchange for power or freedom or happiness, whatever you think you’re getting in return. You can’t participate in human sacrifice without consequences.” You can see the exchange below. Tucker Carlson: ""People are like, 'oh, well, we had another hurricane, it must be global warming.' No! It's probably abortion, actually. Just being honest. You can't kill children on purpose. You can't participate in human sacrifice without consequences."" pic.twitter.com/k8LBaQYX17 Not surprisingly, Carlson’s theory that abortions cause hurricanes produced some stormy reactions on social media. Some posts pointed out that his theory goes against data suggesting that hurricanes have increased even as abortion rates have dropped over the last four decades. what's funny about this is that the U.S. abortion rate has actually been declining since the 1980s, so by his logic, hurricanes are getting worse in tandem with fewer abortions https://t.co/URh9Gl2jxs Not to question the causal logic of Tucker's very rigorous and not at all misogynist theory, but it would also struggle to explain why hurricanes keep hitting Florida and Texas but not California or Canada https://t.co/qDEIRty6dX So, every time a married, republicans, mistress has an abortion we have a hurricane? Is that what he’s saying? Aren’t these the same people who think the death penalty is a good thing? Another person noted that hurricanes are common in tropical Nicaragua despite very strict anti-abortion laws. Tucker is blaming women for god’s wrath. Oldest story in the oldest bookEl Salvador has a dozen severe hurricanes a year on average. And having an abortion is punishable by up to a decade in jailNot that it isn’t pointless to argue facts with a guy whose source is Revelations Other critics posted their own thoughts. When Tucker Carlson goes to Crazytown – like suggesting abortion causes hurricanes – it's hard to know whether he's actually a resident of Crazytown or is just trying to sell people lots in Crazytown at inflated prices. https://t.co/gtfm5dONLl Ahhh, republicans leaning on science again I see.

Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Judge Angelo Foglietta issued the ruling. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner argued the program, which has doled out $16 million so far, was an illegal lottery scheme and requested an injunction. Musk formally unveiled the $1 million giveaway to registered voters on his social media platform X, formerly Twitter, and on America PAC’s website, on Oct. 19. To be entered into the sweepstakes, people must be registered voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin or North Carolina — all swing states — and sign a pledge stating that they agree to be a “spokesperson for America PAC” and endorse its statement that the “First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms.” The Justice Department sent a letter to America PAC about the program on Oct. 23, informing Musk it may run afoul of federal voting and election laws. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner then sued Musk and America PAC on Oct. 28, at which time at least $4 million had already been doled out. Krasner argued that the sweepstakes illegally incentivized voters and only the state of Pennsylvania can operate lottery programs within its borders. Pennsylvania code states that all lottery proceeds must be used “for the benefit of those 65 years of age and older,” the district attorney’s office said. The manner in which prizes are claimed, how funds from lotteries are used and even how those funds are disclosed are all controlled by state law and state operators. Before Monday’s ruling by Foglietta to let the giveaway continue, Musk successfully managed to ensnare the case with brief delays. He attempted to move the case into federal court, kicking off a delay of at least a day as his attorneys argued that Krasner was engaged in a publicity stunt. Musk’s lawyers said the request for a transfer of jurisdictions was proper because the lawsuit involved constitutional and First Amendment issues that were specific to a “federal election.” A federal judge disagreed and ordered the case back to state court. But with so few days to go until Election Day, the impact of Krasner’s lawsuit was effectively moot. When Musk first announced the program, he said that the $1 million would be awarded randomly. In the suit, Krasner pointed out that recipients of the giveaways on Oct. 19 and Oct. 20 did not appear to be “chosen at random because both happened to live near the location of Musk’s pro-Trump rallies and both were in attendance at those rallies.” According to Reuters, Musk’s lawyer Chris Gober told the judge on Monday that the $1 million wasn’t a “prize to be won” but rather an agreement to fulfill “contractual obligations to serve as a spokesperson for the PAC.” The money, he argued, was a salary people earned. Gober suggested there was a difference between declaring recipients “randomly” and “by chance” and that doing the latter would make it a lottery. “You just heard this guy say, ‘My boss, my client, called this random. We promised people that they were going to participate in a random process, but it’s a process where we pre-select people,’” John Summers, lead counsel for the commonwealth, said Monday at the hearing. As of Sunday, $16 million has been allocated to voters who signed the petition, according to America PAC. So far, four winners have been declared in Pennsylvania; three winners each were declared in North Carolina, Michigan and Wisconsin; and one person each received the $1 million in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. Before the hearing, America PAC’s website stated that another $1 million would be given out in Arizona on Monday, and another “earner” in Michigan would be declared on Election Day. Musk did not appear in court on Monday. Reuters reported that Krasner told Foglietta that while he would seek to impose financial penalties on Musk for the lottery, he would not be looking to recoup the awards already given out.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-rally-sizes-dwindling_n_6729063de4b0f3d946e078e4","Donald Trump's Rally Sizes Are Dwindling","paige skinner","2024-11-04","Before former President Donald Trump was set to take the stage Monday at a North Carolina rally, MSNBC cameras panned Dorton Arena, which seats 7,600, and showed empty seats and seemingly bored rallygoers. Five minutes after the rally was set to start, reporter Vaughn Hillyard said the arena in the battleground state was about 70% full. “For nine years we have talked about the enthusiasm and the masses that have come out for Trump rallies time and again, even at his politically lowest points, including in 2022,” Hillyard said. “But interestingly, and I can’t tell you exactly why, this final week, we have seen far smaller crowds.” If the pollsters (and even astrologers) are correct, it’s because Trump is on a downslide as the exceedingly close race comes to a close. And at Trump’s Monday rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, it was no different. David Corn, the Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones magazine, shared a photo on social media and called the arena, which has a capacity of 8,800, “mostly empty.” The smaller crowd is probably a shot to the ego for Trump, who regularly brags about how big his rallies are. On Saturday night, he told a rally crowd in Greensboro, North Carolina, that he’s had “the biggest rallies in history of any country.” “Every rally is full. You don’t have any seats that are empty,” Trump said. As soon as Trump said that, a camera operator for NTD Television Network panned out to show quite a few empty seats at First Horizon Coliseum, which holds 22,000. That night, NewsNation campaign reporter Libbey Dean posted a video on social media of the arena an hour into Trump’s rally. The entire back of the arena was empty. And even though Trump packed New York City’s Madison Square Garden, which seats 19,500, on Oct. 27, CNN producer DJ Judd pointed out on social media that people began to leave while Trump was still talking — possibly because he took the stage two hours later than expected. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Trump’s dwindling rally sizes are in stark contrast to Vice President Kamala Harris’ rallies, which have seen record numbers leading up to Election Day. On Oct. 25 in Houston, with special guest Beyoncé, roughly 30,000 people showed up to support the vice president at her Texas campaign rally. As of August, the Crowd Counting Consortium, a collaborative research initiative by Harvard and the University of Connecticut, 28 of Trump’s rallies have seen an average of 5,600 people. In 2021, eight of Trump’s rallies saw an average of 15,000 people. The average of six of Harris’ rallies was 13,400. Democrats, including Harris and former President Barack Obama, have used several opportunities to point out how small and sometimes bizarre Trump’s rallies have been. At their Sept. 10 presidential debate, Harris looked into the camera and invited Americans to watch a Trump rally. “Because it’s a really interesting thing to watch,” she said, adding that people leave his rallies early “out of exhaustion and boredom.” At the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 20, Obama made a joke referencing Trump’s small rallies and other attributes.

During his Saturday rally in Gastonia, North Carolina, the 78-year-old spent nearly two minutes speaking about the movie character Hannibal Lecter from “Silence of the Lambs.” “When I say insane asylums and then I say Dr. Hannibal Lecter, does anybody know? They go crazy,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd. “They say, ‘Oh, he brings up these names out of ...’ Well, that’s genius. Right? Dr. Hannibal Lecter. There’s nobody worse than him.” He continued on the topic of the fictional cannibal for about 90 more seconds. Later, he said there were 20,000 people at that rally. As the camera panned out, it showed a different picture.

At a rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Monday, the GOP candidate asked a crowd of supporters whether he was “allowed to hit her now” after claiming that the former first lady had “hit me” — an apparent reference to her recent speech calling Trump “a criminal and an abuser.” Trump had already appeared to threaten Michelle Obama at a previous rally, noting ominously that she’d made “a big mistake” by criticizing him, but his latest outburst is an escalation in his language and appears to deliberately lean into the ambiguity of the word “hit.” Apparently recounting a conversation with his advisers, Trump said, “Michelle ... I was so nice to her out of respect. She hit me the other day. I was going to say: ‘Am I allowed to hit her now?’ They said: ‘Take it easy, sir.’ My geniuses, they said, ‘Just take it easy.’ ‘What do you mean? She said that about me, I can’t hit back?’ ‘Sir, you’re winning. Just relax.’” “Is that good or bad advice?” he asked the crowd. “I think it’s neutral.” He then asked, “What do the ladies of North Carolina think, hit back or just relax?” before admitting, “I’d actually love to hit back, but we’ll hold it a little while.” Trump: Michelle.. I was so nice to her out of respect. She hit me the other day. I was going to say, am I allowed to hit her now? pic.twitter.com/u0E8oXnOpD Trump’s comments about the former first lady followed his now-routine attacks on her husband, former President Barack Obama, whom Trump called “the great divider.” He also referred to him as “Barack Hussein Obama,” a long-standing racist tactic Trump uses to cast Obama, America’s first Black president, as nefarious and foreign.

But at a rally in Norristown, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, Michelle Obama made the case for Harris by comparing the two candidates. “Instead of someone who’s only in it for themselves, we will have a president who’s in it for you,” she said. “Instead of someone who’d accelerate the dismantling of our women’s reproductive health system, we will have a president who believes in our freedom to make decisions about our own bodies.” “Instead of a criminal and an abuser, we can have a president who has prosecuted lawbreakers and protected victims,” she added. “Instead of someone who cozies up to dictators and denies elections, we will have a president who will work to strengthen and expand our democracy, and do it all with warmth, joy and grace.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-us-subway-chokehold-death_n_6729381de4b05debb72babd2","Jury Sees Videos Of Subway Chokehold In Daniel Penny's Ongoing Manslaughter Trial","jennifer peltz","2024-11-04","NEW YORK (AP) — Jurors saw video Monday of Daniel Penny gripping a man around the neck on a New York City subway train as another passenger beseeched the Marine veteran to let go. Two videos shot by bystanders — one a high school student, the other a freelance journalist — offered the anonymous jury its first direct view of the chokehold at the heart of the manslaughter trial surrounding Jordan Neely ’s 2023 death. Prosecutors say the student’s video has never been made public before. Jurors also saw what prosecutors said was a fuller version of Mexican freelance journalist Juan Alberto Vázquez’s video, part of which he’d posted on social media and was widely seen. A member of Neely’s family held his head in his hands and then left the courtroom as Vázquez’s video was replayed on big screens. Prosecutors say Penny, 25, recklessly killed Neely, who was homeless and mentally ill. He had frightened passengers on the train with angry statements that some riders found threatening. Penny has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say he was defending himself and his fellow passengers, stepping up in one of the volatile moments that New York straphangers dread but most shy away from confronting. Neely, 30, known to some subway riders for doing Michael Jackson impersonations, had mental health and drug problems. His family has said his life unraveled after his mother was murdered when he was a teenager and he testified at the trial that led to her boyfriend’s conviction. He crossed paths with Penny — an architecture student who’d served four years in the Marines — in a subway train on May 1, 2023. Neely was homeless, broke, hungry, thirsty and so desperate he was willing to go to jail, he shouted at passengers who later recalled his statements to police. He made high schooler Ivette Rosario so nervous that she thought she’d pass out, she testified Monday. She’d seen outbursts on subways before, “but not like that,” she said. “Because of the tone, I got pretty frightened, and I got scared of what was said,” said Rosario, 19. She told jurors Neely was shouting in “an angry tone, like when you’re fed up.” She said she looked downward, hoping the train would get to a station before anything else happened. Then she heard the sound of someone falling, looked up and saw Neely on the floor, with Penny’s arm around his neck. The train soon stopped, and she got out but kept watching from the platform. She would soon place one of the first 911 calls about what was happening. But first, her shaking hand pressed record on her phone. She captured video of Penny on the floor — gripping Neely’s head in the crook of his left arm, with his right hand atop Neely’s head — and of an unseen bystander saying that Neely was dying and urging, “Let him go!” Rosario said she didn’t see Neely specifically address or approach anyone. But according to the defense, Neely lurched toward a woman with a stroller and said he “will kill,” and Penny felt he had to take action. Prosecutors don’t claim that Penny intended to kill, nor fault him for initially deciding to try to stop Neely’s menacing behavior. But they say Penny went overboard by choking the man for about six minutes, even after passengers could exit the train, after two of them stayed and helped hold Neely down, and after he stopped moving for nearly a minute. A lawyer for Neely’s family maintains that whatever he might have said, it didn’t justify what Penny did. Defense attorneys say Penny kept holding onto Neely because he tried at times to get loose. Prosecutors have said Neely was fighting for survival. Vázquez testified through a Spanish-language interpreter that Neely “tried really hard to break free,” first endeavoring to pull Penny’s arms off his neck — until another passenger pinned them down — and then moving his legs. Then, “in a moment, he stopped moving,” Vázquez told jurors. He testified that he’d shortened the version of the video that he posted on social media, cutting about a minute at the beginning where Penny and Neely weren’t moving much. Like Rosario, he also made his video after the train had stopped in the station. The defense also challenges medical examiners’ finding that the chokehold killed Neely.

On Oct. 30, Duff’s husband of five years, musician Matthew Koma, showed off his Halloween costume in an Instagram Story. According to multiple outlets that captured screenshots of the post, Koma dressed up as Duff’s ex-boyfriend, Good Charlotte singer Joel Madden. Duff and Madden’s relationship would almost certainly be considered controversial today, but was largely glossed over by mainstream media at the time. The two began dating in 2004 when Duff was 16 and Madden was 25. They split in 2006, and a month later Madden began dating his future wife, “The Simple Life” alum Nicole Richie. “What’s better than going as @joelmadden for a Halloween dinner with @joelmadden and @nicolerichie,” Koma wrote, alongside a photo of him decked out in Madden’s signature black attire, including an MDDN hat, a leather jacket and a chain necklace. And in a second Instagram Story from Koma, it was quickly revealed that his getup was part of a couple’s costume with Duff, who was dressed as Good Charlotte guitarist Benji Madden ― Joel’s identical twin brother. “Going as @benjimadden and @joelmadden to a Halloween dinner with @joelmadden and @nicolerichie,” Koma’s post read, alongside a photo of him in costume and Duff sporting all black, a chain necklace and a vest. Richie appears to have appreciated the move, reposting a photo of Duff and Koma in costume and writing “Hehehe” at the bottom. These days, Duff and Koma seem to be pretty chummy with Richie and Joel Madden, despite their messy pasts.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gun-sales-not-soaring-2024-elections_n_6729232ee4b0be8c956a1cfb","Gun Sales Typically Soar Before An Election — But Not This Year","roque planas","2024-11-04","The 2024 presidential election has yet to spark a significant jump in gun sales, according to FBI data released Friday, reversing a two-decade trend in which election years correlate strongly with firearm purchases. The trend appears to indicate dwindling concerns among gun owners that the election will result in tougher gun laws. But the numbers also reflect the fact that gun purchasing remains at historically high levels following a pandemic gun boom that broadened the demographics of firearm ownership. “We haven’t seen what we typically see in an election year,” Mark Oliva, the spokesperson for the National Shooting Sports Federation, the firearm industry trade group, told HuffPost. “We’ve seen more of a steady state for background checks for firearm purchases. It’s bucked the trend a little bit.” Jumps in election-year gun purchasing historically have been driven by fears that widely publicized mass shootings or Democratic victories would prompt stricter gun laws. But this year, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has tempered her stance on gun reforms while repeatedly highlighting that she owns a pistol she bought for personal protection. And there is no realistic chance for big-ticket gun restrictions like an assault weapons ban, universal background checks or magazine restrictions to pass Congress following an election in which Republicans will likely take control of the Senate. Those new political realities may help explain the absence of a surge in gun sales this election cycle. The U.S. does not track gun sales. The closest proxy is data from the FBI background checks required to complete a commercial sale, which the NSSF adjusts by subtracting checks associated with concealed carry permits. Every presidential election year for the last two decades has seen a major surge in background checks, indicating rising sales. While two months remain in the year, raising the possibility that gun sales could soar before the close of 2024, an election-year rise in gun sales would typically show in the data by now. Monthly FBI background checks for gun sales jumped 20% or more from August to October in 2000, 2004 and 2008, and by 15% in 2016, according to NSSF-adjusted figures. Background checks for 2012 as a whole jumped by 19% compared to the already rising year before. And 2020 was a year in which American gun sales, driven partly by the coronavirus pandemic, jumped more than any time in recorded history, with FBI background checks skyrocketing 60% over the previous year to 21.1 million. Annual background checks for gun purchases had risen by an average of 3.6% annually for the preceding two decades, the NSSF-adjusted figures show. This year, background checks rose 7% from August to October. But October checks fell about 5% lower than the same month last year, the figures show. At the current pace, background checks for 2024 gun sales will fall roughly in line with last year’s levels. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-killer-clown_n_672931f9e4b0be8c956a2b32","Convicted Killer Clown Released From Prison For Murder Of Her Husband's Then-Wife","terry spencer","2024-11-04","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A woman who pleaded guilty to dressing as a clown and in 1990 murdering the wife of a man she later married was released from prison Saturday, ending a case that has been strange even by Florida standards. Sheila Keen-Warren, 61, was released 18 months after she pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for the shooting of Marlene Warren, Florida Department of Corrections records show. The plea deal came shortly before her trial would have started. Keen-Warren, who has maintained her innocence even after her plea, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. But she had been in custody for seven years since her arrest in 2017, and Florida’s law in 1990 allowed significant credit for good behavior. It had been expected she would be released in about two years. “Sheila Keen-Warren will always be an admitted convicted murderer and will wear that stain for every day for the rest of her life,” Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said in a statement Saturday. Greg Rosenfeld, Keen-Warren’s attorney, has said she only took the plea deal because she would be released in less than two years and had been facing a life sentence if convicted at trial. “We are absolutely thrilled that Ms. Keen-Warren has been released from prison and is returning to her family. As we’ve stated from the beginning, she did not commit this crime,” he said Saturday in a text message. Marlene Warren’s son, Joseph Ahrens, and his friends were at home when they said a person dressed as a clown rang the door bell. He said that when his mom answered, the clown handed her some balloons. After she responded, “How nice,” the clown pulled a gun and shot her in the face before fleeing. Palm Beach County sheriff’s investigators had long suspected Keen-Warren in the slaying, but she wasn’t arrested until 27 years later when they said improved DNA testing tied her to evidence found in the getaway car. Rosenfeld has called that evidence weak. At the time of the shooting, Keen-Warren was an employee of Marlene Warren’s husband, Michael, at his used car lot. Since 2002, she has been his wife — they eventually moved to Abingdon, Virginia, where they ran a restaurant just across the Tennessee border. Witnesses told investigators in 1990 that the then-Sheila Keen and Michael Warren were having an affair, though both denied it. Over the years, detectives said, costume shop employees identified Sheila Warren as the woman who had bought a clown suit a few days before the killing. And one of the two balloons — a silver one that read, “You’re the Greatest” — was sold at only one store, a Publix supermarket near Keen-Warren’s home. Employees told detectives a woman who looked like Keen-Warren had bought the balloons an hour before the shooting. The presumed getaway car was found abandoned with orange, hair-like fibers inside. The white Chrysler convertible had been reported stolen from Michael Warren’s car lot a month before the shooting. Keen-Warren and her then-husband repossessed cars for him. Relatives told The Palm Beach Post in 2000 that Marlene Warren, who was 40 when she died, suspected her husband was having an affair and wanted to leave him. But the car lot and other properties were in her name, and she feared what might happen if she did. She allegedly told her mother, “If anything happens to me, Mike done it.” He has never been charged and has denied involvement. But Rosenfeld said last year that the state’s case was falling apart. One DNA sample somehow showed both male and female genes, he said, and the other could have come from one out of every 20 women. And even if that hair did come from Keen-Warren, it could have been deposited before the car was reported stolen. He said Marlene Warren’s son and another witness also told detectives that the car deputies found wasn’t the killer’s, though investigators insisted it was. Aronberg last year conceded that there were holes in the case, saying they were caused by the three decades it took to get it to trial, including the death of key witnesses.

A spokesperson for the National Labor Relations Board said the agency’s general counsel filed the charges Friday, alleging Grindr used the mandate to force out employees because they had “joined the union and engaged in concerted activities.” The NLRB is responsible for investigating union-busting claims and overseeing union elections. The complaint also accuses Grindr of presenting workers with an unlawful severance agreement and refusing to bargain with the workers’ union, the Communications Workers of America. Grindr denied the allegations in an emailed statement to HuffPost, calling them “meritless.” “Grindr team members work from one of our offices just 2 days per week under our hybrid work model, and our decision to transition from fully remote to hybrid work in 2023 predated the union election petition,” the company said. “It was only after it was known that the transition back to in-office work was underway that some employees began signing union cards.” The CWA said Grindr, which is based in West Hollywood, California, lost nearly half of its staff after mandating a return to the office last year, as many workers would have had to move long distances in order to make in-office work possible. The union also said the severance agreements included a provision to “silence” workers from speaking out. “The RTO mandate gave workers two weeks to choose between ending their tenure at Grindr or relocating to their respective team’s newly assigned ‘hub’ city to work in-person twice a week,” the union said at the time. Last December, Grindr employees voted 19-13 in favor of joining CWA. But ballots from another 55 voters were challenged by either the company or the union, so the labor board must determine their eligibility before announcing an official result. The NLRB spokesperson said most of those challenged ballots were cast by workers pushed out under the return-to-office policy. The next four years will change America forever.

The general counsel’s office is asking the labor board to issue what’s known as a Cemex bargaining order, which would require Grindr to negotiate a contract with the union regardless of what the election results turn out to be. The general counsel’s office requests such an order when it believes an employer has broken the law in a way that tainted the vote. The labor board created the Cemex framework in a landmark decision last year, saying it would discourage companies from breaking the law by making it more dangerous to do so. It is one of many progressive labor policies likely to be rolled back if former President Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.

In a clip posted to X, formerly Twitter, the Fox News personality-turned-podcast-host said that while she “never expected” the invite to speak to the former president’s supporters, she plans to “explain to that crowd and beyond why I think it is absolutely essential he win this election.” She added that she has “all sorts of reasons [for supporting Trump] that won’t come as any surprise to the people listening to this show.” You can see the announcement below.

WATCH: pic.twitter.com/YZS4eV5MEs The Hill notes that Kelly is the second former Fox News personality to join Trump on the current campaign trail. Tucker Carlson spoke at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally late last month, delivering a speech that was, as a fellow HuffPost reporter put it, “a racist rant tinged by conspiracy theory.” Kelly has had a complicated professional relationship with Trump since the first Republican presidential debate in 2015, when she questioned whether his temperament was suited for the presidency while pointing out to him, “You’ve called women you don’t like ‘fat pigs,’ ‘dogs,’ ‘slobs’ and ‘disgusting animals.’” Trump reacted by later calling Kelly a “bimbo” and claiming she had “blood coming out of her wherever.” In July 2023, Kelly said that their beef was “water under the bridge,” but admitted to Eric Bolling in September 2023 that the former president is still mad about the question she asked him in 2015. A week after she said that, Trump called her “pretty nasty” because he didn’t like her questions during a Sirius XM interview. Considering all this weird history, it’s not surprising people had thoughts about Kelly’s appearance with Trump in Pittsburgh. Even CNN’s Dana Bash called Kelly’s decision “an interesting turn of events.” CNN's Dana Bash: ""I'm being told that Megyn Kelly just announced that she's gonna be speaking at Donald Trump's last rally. Megyn Kelly of 'blood coming out of her whatever' fame. That's an interesting turn of events."" pic.twitter.com/yVhCmWKbCa Others chimed in on X. I can’t wait for this one to backfire. 🤣 Are they going to introduce Megyn as the one who ""had blood coming from her wherever""???That's super appealing to women. And she is posing as garbage! Incredible debasement of herself for the sake of maintaining a conservative audience! https://t.co/8J9IXZzXdy pic.twitter.com/WyIIc67EZS Megyn Kelly is a morally and ideologically empty grifter. She used her time at Fox to springboard into morning show liberalism and had no problem with it until she got fired. As soon as she got canned, she flipped right back to the GOP and went full MAGA when she figured out it… Megyn Kelly is a pathetic creature in the right wing media industrial complex. She was once one of the more respected journalists on Fox News, but she has gone hardcore MAGA. And this comes after the infamous way Trump insulted her.

She Found A Way To Fight Back.","njera perkins","2024-11-04","This article includes material from HuffPost’s weekly culture and entertainment newsletter, The Culture Catchall. Click here to subscribe. “A lot of people were trying to take control of my narrative and tell my story, so that’s why I even agreed to do the documentary in the first place.” Speaking in front of a packed crowd at Los Angeles’ TCL Chinese Theatre on Wednesday, Megan Thee Stallion made her biographical vision clear. At her film’s premiere, she explained why she had dared to put her life story on the big screen at just 29 years old. “Let me just tell my truth and lay it out on the table, because y’all don’t respect shit else but raw and honesty,” she said. “I was trying to be a cookie-cutter celebrity for y’all, but it didn’t work out… so y’all are about to experience Megan Pete for the first time.” In the documentary, Megan Thee Stallion peels back the curtain of her glamorous rapper persona to tell a candid story of ambition, sorrow and triumph. It is raw, intimate and heartfelt. “Megan Thee Stallion: In Her Words,” a memoir-style documentary directed by Nneka Onuorah, offers what its Amazon MGM Studios description calls “unprecedented access” to the multifaceted Houston native, who hustled to reach hip-hop success in just a few years after her rapper momager, the late Holly “Holly-Wood” Thomas, planted the seed during her childhood. The film, which premiered on Prime Video on Oct. 31, follows Megan “on the road to stardom as she tenaciously navigates fame, grief, pressure, and success,” according to the blurb, and uses creative animation to illustrate what cameras didn’t catch. For the past few years, we’ve witnessed in real time what Megan has achieved and endured. But between the Grammy wins, No. 1 records and critical acclaim, she also suffered great loss. In March 2019, Megan’s mother died suddenly from a brain tumor. She lost her great-grandmother just weeks later. The following year, Megan was embroiled in a high-profile scandal after her ex-friend, rapper Tory Lanez, shot her after a pool party and tried to convince the world he didn’t. He was convicted in December 2022 and sentenced to 10 years in prison, a heart-wrenching moment captured in the documentary. But between that time and the shooting, critics ridiculed Megan online and claimed she had either lied about being shot or was trying to “bring a Black man down.” Hateful social media comments and a frenzy of misinformation spread by bloggers and podcasters sent the rapper on a downward spiral that forced her to find refuge at a mental health retreat before Lanez’s trial, according to the documentary. But she fought back, reclaiming her story. A day before her documentary debuted, Megan sued blogger Milagro Gramz for allegedly engaging in a years-long cyber smear campaign that spread “falsehoods” about the shooting. In a statement, the rapper said: “It’s time to hold bloggers accountable for years of harassment, cyberbullying and the publication of misinformation about my personal and professional life… It’s unacceptable behavior and these individuals need to understand there will be repercussions for recklessly posting lies and defamatory falsehoods.” The lawsuit and Megan’s documentary show how she has sought to set the record straight on her story. Director Onuorah says the rapper tasked her with capturing the essence of her spirit so people could finally understand her perspective. HuffPost spoke to Onuorah about her approach to Megan’s documentary, filming her most vulnerable moments behind closed doors, and how the rap star aimed to regain her power in the face of her detractors. Artist documentaries involving the artist can easily become vanity projects that gloss over nuance, but this documentary feels like an exception. Whose idea was it to be so candid and transparent in telling Megan’s story? Nneka Onuorah: Well, I think we both wanted to be candid and transparent in this film. That’s what we made it for. This film wasn’t a fluff piece, and it also wasn’t a film where anyone was telling anyone how it should be made. I got to make the film that I saw in this case, and it was about really getting a portrait of what it is like to go from a disempowered state to an empowered state and how you can use your own internal power to work through all the shadows and doubts of yourself to become your highest, strongest, most open self. I think showing a feminist manifesto is really what this was to be an example of. Megan Thee Stallion just happens to be the subject of the film, but if you took [her] out of it, this is something that women and Black women experience all the time. We experience grief and down times in the midst of our highs, so how do we navigate that dichotomy when it comes at you in life? That’s why we use anime to help support that story. Talk about the importance of distinguishing between Megan Pete and Megan Thee Stallion in this documentary. Onuorah: They both represent two different things. Megan Thee Stallion is the ultimate feminist icon, strength and power as we see it in the outside world. Megan Pete is just a beautiful young lady under 30 trying to navigate her life without her mommy and daddy. That is a very personal thing that many people could experience and relate to. It was very important to show how these two things could be true in one Black woman’s body. How we navigate both of those, sometimes Megan Pete needs to lean on Megan Thee Stallion. But what’s happening when everybody’s tearing Megan Thee Stallion down? Megan Pete needs herself. And so I really wanted to be able to show that juxtaposition of the two of their lives and how those two parts could support each other. How strength and vulnerability come together to make us our most empowered, beautiful selves, and I think Megan showed that exact example. In the documentary, Megan talks about being closed off after the shooting because she didn’t know who to trust. How was she when you first met her? And how did you build that trust that allowed you to film some of her most vulnerable moments? Onuorah: When I first met her… she was always kind, but she was trepidatious, and so one day, I just had to have a straight conversation with her. I was like, “Meg, we can’t keep showing up to things, and you’re not filming. What are your fears? Walk me through what you’re concerned about.” And so I really changed the creative [directive] to be: Anything [regarding] Megan Pete, I’m gonna film myself [without the rest of the team]. I’ve got to build that trust in that relationship as a filmmaker to artists so that you feel like you have a safe space. My team that I hired would film Megan Thee Stallion. But if [she was] in [her] home, in any place that you have to be Megan Pete, it would just be me and her. So I created the trust that way by really listening to her. Sometimes, you just need people to listen to you in order for them to understand you, and I think she knew I had a deep understanding of her at that point. With this documentary, we weren’t burdened with a bunch of talking-head interviews like typical artist documentaries. Most of what we hear comes directly from Megan’s mouth. What was the intention behind that decision? Onuorah: I think taking an observational perspective, with some questioning, allows not only for intimacy but for you to see the person. You’re not hearing people’s story through all these other voices — because they’re filtering it through their voice. In this case, Megan’s story [needed] to be at the forefront, so I needed to interact with her. I needed to study everything about how she operates, what makes her sad, what makes her excited, and that observational perspective allows you to be able to then put that on screen. And that’s psychology. I use a lot of the techniques from school to figure out how to navigate this documentary, especially Carl Jung’s “shadow self” work, and also with feminist work, like Audre Lorde’s [“Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power”]. The combination of those two is really an inspiration to my approach to this doc. And I always try to figure out how to break convention. I don’t like doing conventional things, so a lot of my work changes the narrative of that. And so this was [me] continuing to push the boundaries of how documentaries are made. Something else that stood out was how the documentary highlighted the misinformation spread about Megan’s shooting and showed a lot of critics who were vocal about not believing her. Why was it important to show that opposition in contrast to Megan telling her side of the story? Onuorah: To understand the internal conflicts, you have to also understand the external conflicts that are pushing those internal conflicts into fruition. Also, to tell a well-rounded story, I felt like it was important to see what Megan was experiencing from the inside of her life, but also to see what the noise was on social media (outside). I think compiling those social media moments together should be able to show us how negative and how much we can tear down people on social media. I wanted us, as a generation right now, to see how powerful this tool of social media is and how much it has an impact on mental health. We need to be accountable for the things that we say online because they do affect people. Whether it’s a celebrity or a non-celebrity, it’s deeply impactful. In your opinion, what purpose should celebrity documentaries serve in this day and age? Onuorah: They should really [help] people see the bigger picture of [anyone] going through anything, but to the max. Like I said, Megan Thee Stallion could have been anyone going through this experience, and it would be relatable. It just so happens that she’s on a public scale, so it allows us to expand on how many people wanna watch this experience. I think this film has changed the way that celebrity docs could be made. A lot of people have made them as fluff pieces or [because] “my album’s coming out.” This was not about any of that. This was raw storytelling. These were real things that were happening that she had to navigate. I want people to remember that. When you’re online talking about people, especially celebrities, it may seem like they’re a figure, but they’re human beings. And so you’re degrading a human being when you do things like that.

Onuorah: I don’t think opinions matter to us. The documentary was a win when Megan Pete felt happy and empowered in herself. Everything else is just everybody observing and watching and seeing what you can learn from it. I think people will get a different side of Megan, a more intimate side of her, and get to know her. It’s been so positive online. People say, “Wow, I didn’t know this about Megan,” or “It’s been great getting to know her through this film.” So I’m excited for her, ’cause people are finally seeing her for who she is. “Megan Thee Stallion: In Her Words” is streaming now on Prime Video.

Imagine with me: It’s January 2026, one year since we inaugurated Kamala Harris as president. We are celebrating America’s Quarter Millennial — and the progress we have made since the founding of America 250 years ago. Our everyday lives are better — and we have entered a golden era. Inflation is down thanks to Harris’ economic plans. We have legal abortion protections. We now have resources for our aging parents and grandparents, affordable prescription drugs, and Medicare to cover home health care costs, giving elderly Americans the ability to live with dignity. The national minimum wage is now $15 an hour, changing the prospects for millions who had been laboring for $2.13 an hour in states like Louisiana or for the federal wage of $7.25. Federal voting rights are protected and restored. Assault weapons are illegal, and we finally experience a drop in the gun deaths of young people. The White House celebrates immigrants from all over the globe, and provides a pathway to citizenship for those who have been contributing to this country for years but have lived in fear of deportation. Dreamers have hope of gaining an earned pathway to citizenship. Mainly, though, we feel better as Americans, as people. There is a new horizon of possibility for collective welfare and good governance and decency and respect for others. The overwhelming sense of dread is gone, the “us versus them” talk coming from leaders and found online has given way to big ideas to build an economy that will outlast the climate crisis. We are building a country where everyone belongs, and everyone can claim part of the American story. And banning books, and attacks on trans people are no longer in vogue or accepted as normal behavior. Imagination is power in politics. Kamala Harris’ candidacy is possible first because we imagined it could be so. We are in a moment of expansive imagination for the future of this country and we decided that we would not accept the dark declarations of Trump but instead have created a fate of our own making. Inspiring people to reimagine America governed by women of color is the force behind my work. Opening the door to Congress, the Supreme Court, Cabinet positions, governors’ mansions, and the White House has changed the lives of millions for the better. Nearly a decade ago, I dared the country to turn to women of color and recognize our courageous vision and skilled leadership during Trump’s dangerous and chaotic first term. This is what I envisioned when I organized the nation’s first presidential forum for women of color in 2019. And it’s why I am doing everything I can to elect Kamala Harris to the White House. What I see is that millions more now share the vision that women of color have held for the country. Millions more are committed to expanding justice, building solidarity, and supporting a new generation of leaders to defeat MAGA efforts to install fascism and protect white supremacy. It is Black women, for example, who are leading the Kamala Harris coalition. We are helping the electorate imagine a way to get out of the Trump morass we find ourselves in, and we are doing so with joy and purpose and transformation. That is where we are today — the choice of a politics that is equal parts collective imagination and action steps and this has created the conditions that are ripe for change. Nowhere does this ring more true than this election cycle. By envisioning a brighter future, we can motivate our country to put in the work on Election Day to choose Kamala. This is how we ensure Tuesday furthers our centuries-long fight for a true multiracial democracy. This is how we elect a woman of color to our nation’s highest office. This is a future that our imagination can conjure and it is a future represented by the candidacy of Kamala Harris. She will be a president who will make a concerted effort to lead all people, with Cabinet and federal appointees that reflect our nation’s diversity — a multiracial democracy representative of its people. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Juana Torres, a 36-year-old single mother in Philadelphia, expects to receive $140 more per month in Supplemental Security Income as a result of the policy shift. “I have four children at home, along with special needs,” Torres told HuffPost. “I think it’s very good that they made this change.” The extra cash for Torres offers a small illustration of the stakes of Tuesday’s presidential election for SSI and a range of safety net programs that are never discussed on the campaign trail. When he was president, Donald Trump tightened rules for food and disability benefits, while President Joe Biden reversed most of those changes and made programs more generous. “By simplifying and expanding our policies, we are making SSI smarter, removing barriers to accessing payments, and reducing the burden on the public and agency staff,” Social Security Administration commissioner Martin O’Malley said when he announced the most recent change. Congress has ignored SSI for decades, so the near-term future of the program’s rules depends on whether Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris takes control of the White House. The president appoints the commissioners of the SSA, which oversees SSI as well as Social Security Disability Insurance, in addition to the better-known retirement insurance program. More than 7 million Americans with disabilities receive SSI, with payments averaging less than $700 per beneficiary. The government reduces benefits and can withdraw beneficiaries if they earn more than $2,000 per month or pile up more than $2,000 in savings — rules that Democrats and Republicans alike say force SSI recipients to remain in near poverty. Until Sept. 30, program beneficiaries had to tell the government if anyone helped them out with food, such as by providing meals or groceries, with such assistance typically resulting in a one-third reduction of benefits. Another change that took effect the same day exempts households from having to disclose such in-kind support if household members are receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits. All told, the changes will benefit hundreds of thousands of households. Republicans are furious about the administrative reforms, with GOP lawmakers on the House Ways and Means Committee pointing to the $37 billion estimated cost and calling it a “parade of regulatory overreach that circumvents Congress and costs taxpayers billions just months before the 2024 election.” Biden also oversaw an administrative expansion of SNAP benefits that infuriated Republicans. Because they weren’t done by Congress, Trump could likely undo the changes in both programs without Congress if reelected. The next four years will change America forever.

Torres found out she was eligible for a higher monthly SSI benefit, which she receives on behalf of a daughter with special needs, after her monthly payments were reduced as a result of child support payments she began receiving this year. She sought help from Community Legal Services, a Philadelphia nonprofit that assists low-income families, and found out that because she gets SNAP benefits, her SSI payments would no longer be reduced because of her income from working as an Instacart shopper. An attorney with CLS said Torres’ benefit will increase by $140 to $783 starting in December. In a statement, the SSA said that eligible SSI recipients would automatically benefit from the policy change without having to contact the government. “People do not need to apply or contact us to request the new regulatory changes to be applied to their record,” an SSA spokesperson said. “We will notify them directly if there is a change in their monthly benefit amount.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

During a new interview alongside Matt Damon with Entertainment Tonight published Monday, Affleck proved that there is no ill will between the two while discussing his ex-wife’s role in her new film, “Unstoppable,” which he produced. The conversation kicked off after the publication asked the “Justice League” star to compare the sports drama to one of his other upcoming projects, “Small Things Like These” starring Oscar winner Cillian Murphy. Affleck and Damon co-founded Artists Equity, the production company overseeing the two films, in 2022. “Unstoppable is a very different movie than this but in a way it’s similarly rooted in the passion of really talented artists. [Director] Billy Goldenberg and Jennifer [Lopez] and Don Cheadle and Jharrel [Jerome], and Bobby Cannavale, all were really passionate about this film,” Affleck said of the movie that hits theaters Dec. 6. Affleck then singled out Lopez’s talents, adding, “Jennifer is spectacular.” The California-born actor and Lopez became one of Hollywood’s hottest power couples in the early ’00s. The pair split in 2004, but nearly 20 years later, they resurrected their rollercoaster romance in 2021. Affleck and the “Enough” actor finally got married in 2022, but their relationship died off again after Lopez filed for divorce in August 2024 following two years of marriage. Both Affleck and Lopez have previously been married. The “Daredevil” actor was married to fellow Marvel star Jennifer Garner in 2005 and got divorced in 2018. They share three children. Lopez was married three times before. She was married to Ojani Noa from 1997-1998 and to Cris Judd from 2001-2003. She then tied the knot with singer Marc Anthony in 2004, and later welcomed twins together. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The former president processed that realization in real time, going off-script before veering back into ominous territory with his written remarks. “Think of this: I won’t be doing this anymore with North Carolina,” he said. “And I won’t be doing this anymore with — after today, this is, I’m just thinking this, I’m going through this, that this will be our final moment.” “But, the really, the more exciting moment is going to begin,” he continued. Trump spoke at J.S. Dorton Arena, taking the stage 40 minutes after his planned arrival amid reports of a lower-than-expected turnout at the 7,610-seat venue. Video from reporters at the rally indeed showed quite a few empty seats one day before Trump faces Democratic nominee Kamala Harris at the polls. Oof. @VaughnHillyard on Trump's smaller crowds in the closing days.""For 9 years we talked about the enthusiasm and the masses that have come out for Trump rallies. But interestingly, in this final week we have seen far smaller crowds."" pic.twitter.com/5hJLs4emy9 “See, these moments of hundreds and hundreds of the most incredible rallies in any country — no country’s ever seen anything like this — but these moments, these moments that we’ve had together, these really were just to create what we’ll hopefully create tomorrow, which is we’re going to make America great again,” Trump said. “So we’ll have many meetings but we won’t have rally meetings. We’re going to have — maybe we’ll rally in that we’ll rally in our success.” Trump then returned to his teleprompter, where his written remarks hinted darkly at what’s to come should he be elected. “After all we’ve been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history,” he predicted. “With your help we will restore America’s promise and we will take back the nation that we all love so much. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.” Trump, who was impeached for attempting to overturn the 2020 election results by urging a violent mob to attack the U.S. Capitol, then promised to “never, ever surrender.” The next four years will change America forever.

While appearing on this week’s episode of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, the filmmaker said today’s Walt Disney Company probably wouldn’t entertain putting the film’s leading lady, sultry cartoon Jessica Rabbit, back on screen. “There’s a good script sitting at Disney, but here’s the thing — here’s what you have to know, and you know this: The current Disney would never make ‘Roger Rabbit’ today,” Zemeckis explained. “They can’t make a movie with Jessica in it.” Pointing out how Disney already toned down the animated bombshell’s looks at its Disneyland resort, he said, “Look what they did to Jessica at the theme park. They trussed her up in a trench coat, you know.” There is strong evidence to back up Zemeckis’ claim. When Disneyland revamped its Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin ride in 2021, the park decided to hide Jessica’s signature curves under a demure detective-appropriate overcoat. The updated “Roger Rabbit” ride did promote the illustrated ingenue from a damsel in distress to the main character, however. During the podcast, Zemeckis also told host Josh Horowitz how he never had any interest in tempering the 1988 original to be more kid-friendly. “I kept saying, and I sincerely say this, and I do believe this, and I say, ‘I’m making Roger Rabbit the way I believe Walt Disney would have made it,’” he remembered telling Disney execs. “And the reason I say that is because Walt Disney never made any of his movies for children,” the auteur added. “He always made them for adults. And that’s what I decided to do with Roger Rabbit.” Elsewhere during the interview, Horowitz told Zemeckis he was surprised that the original cartoon noir was even able to earn a PG rating. “We were able to make it right at the time when Disney was ready to rebuild itself,” the “Here” filmmaker explained. “We were there when a new regime came in and they were full of energy and they wanted to do” something new. “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” was both a commercial and technical triumph when it was released. The groundbreaking production combined live-action scenes with animation, bringing a cartoon-infused version of 1940s Hollywood to life.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/poop-monument-trump-jan-6-insurrection_n_6728f0f2e4b05debb72b6f29","Mini Poop Statues Appear At D.C.’s Mysterious Turd Monument ‘Honoring’ Trump","jennifer bendery","2024-11-04","WASHINGTON — It’s been two weeks since a mysterious satirical poop monument appeared by the U.S. Capitol, “honoring” former President Donald Trump and the people behind the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection with a massive turd. Early Monday morning ― one day before the presidential election ― the anonymous group behind the installation made some new additions: free souvenirs, in the form of mini-poop statues and postcards. Stacks of them were left out on a table for passersby to take. All of them mockingly hail Trump and his violent mob of supporters for trying to steal the 2020 election. “We figured that a monument isn’t a real monument until cheap souvenirs are involved,” reads an anonymous message HuffPost received from one of the organizers. “That’s why just like the ‘heroes’ who invaded the capitol and landed some sweet laptops, iPads and a John Lewis photo, we wanted people to have something to take home with them.” A group called Civic Crafted LLC got a permit from the National Park Service to put up the monument. It’s not clear, though, who is behind this group. D.C.’s turd installation was the first of these “monuments” that have been popping up around the country in recent days, all of which use satire to condemn Trump for various egregious and contemptible things he’s done. One statue appeared in a Philadelphia park last week to “honor” Trump for a “lifetime of sexual assault.” A similar monument popped up in Portland, Oregon. A second D.C. monument appeared last week as a “tribute” to Trump for referring to his supporters in the violent 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, as “very fine people.” Still another statue magically appeared early Monday at the Donald J. Trump State Park in Yorktown Heights, New York. (Yes, there is a state park named after Trump.) This monument, called “The Very Large Donald J. Trump Monument,” is more than seven feet wide and eight feet tall, according to a message from one of its anonymous creators. There is a tiny golden mushroom on top of it — a reference to Trump’s former mistress Stormy Daniels saying in her 2018 book that Trump’s manhood is “smaller than average” and similar to “a mushroom.” The plaque on this statue reads: This giant pillar pays tribute to President Trump. As you can see this is a very large monument. Definitely the largest. Despite this towering statue’s impressive heft, The President’s former mistress, Stormy Daniels, knowingly slandered the President as having a “smaller than average” monument and claimed it is an “unusual” monument similar to “a mushroom.” She further went on to describe her interaction with his monument as “the least impressive I’ve ever had.” The circumstances surrounding her statements have been verified by a New York State Court of Law. This tower monument stands in defiance of these false statements so that we all bear witness to the truth of this giant, very normal monument. Trump, who has been accused of rape and sexual assault by dozens of women and who in January was ordered by a jury to pay out $83.3 million to one of those women, E. Jean Carroll, has bragged about his manhood. He’s also made lewd sexual comments about his opponent, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. These monuments look authentic and are quite big, though up close, you can see they’re actually pretty light and made of foam or cloth. It’s not until you read the plaques on the structures that it’s clear they’re mocking Trump. D.C.’s poop monument features a replica of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desk with a bronze turd on it, along with some papers and a Pelosi name plate. It is a reference to some of Trump’s supporters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, reportedly spreading their feces throughout hallways and offices in the building. The new souvenirs from this monument are just brown pieces of fake poop on a base with a plaque that reads, “Trump National Jan. 6 Memorial.” The mini statues were gone by the time HuffPost stopped by early Monday. But there was still a stack of free postcards on a tiny table available for the taking. They feature an image of Trump’s smiling face next to the U.S. Capitol with the turd monument centered in the picture. In bold postcard-like font, it reads, “Trump National Jan. 6th Monument.” A security guard posted by the installation said the mini-statues were gone in “no time.” More were expected to be delivered later in the day. HuffPost arrived at the monument as the leader of a group of high school students from around the country was explaining to them that it was satirical. They appeared amused as she read aloud the plaque. “Satirical, when they say ‘honors’ the brave men and women,” said one male student. “Who broke into the United States Capitol to loot, urinate and defecate throughout those hallowed halls,” continued the group leader. “To honor them,” the student said with a laugh. Jennifer, a D.C. local, and her friend Wybie stopped to inspect and take pictures of the monument. Both requested only using their first names. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/fulton-county-election-hub-2024_n_672909e1e4b0f3d946e07b30","Fulton County, Georgia, Braces For A Massive Election","matt shuham","2024-11-04","UNION CITY, Ga. — Additional police will be present at the election headquarters in Fulton County, Georgia, this year — “just because of what’s going on,” LaShandra Little, voter education and outreach manager for the county, said euphemistically during a facility tour Monday. Just hours before Election Day, there’s a lot going on in Fulton County. Fulton is Georgia’s most populous county — and a Democratic stronghold that could provide the blue votes necessary to put Vice President Kamala Harris over the top, both in the state and, potentially, overall. This is also the county’s first year using a mammoth new “Election Hub” facility. It takes up 400,000 square feet of a 1-million-square-foot warehouse in Union City, just outside Atlanta. And on Election Day eve, it was buzzing with anticipation. The Election Hub facility is imposing, looking from the outside like an Amazon warehouse. Inside, election machines are lined up in lengthy rows and election workers operate in neon vests and “VOTE” T-shirts. Throughout the building, they are organizing voter registration application forms, wheeling tabulator machines into place, and systematically opening the envelopes carrying absentee ballots — a step called “pre-processing” that, at least in some states, allows the counting to proceed much more quickly Tuesday. Near a section reserved for election observers, a studio-apartment-sized room is walled in glass on all four sides. Inside sit the computers that will tally the county’s results. Ahead of a press briefing Monday morning, Little gave a tour of the facility to dozens of members of the media who spoke a half a dozen languages among them. Across Fulton County, there will be about 2,000 election workers making the democratic process run on Tuesday, Little said. Of that, about 10% will be working out of the Election Hub. Ever since Donald Trump unsuccessfully pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to “find” the thousands of votes necessary for him to overturn the will of the people in 2020, Georgia has faced intense public scrutiny — under a microscope smudged by Trump and his allies’ lies about (nonexistent) widespread voter fraud. Rudy Giuliani was recently ordered by a judge to turn over a penthouse apartment and various luxury goods to two former Fulton County election workers whom he falsely accused of cheating — and who successfully sued for defamation. Just recently, a fake video purported to show a Haitian immigrant with fraudulent ID cards who said they’d voted multiple times. Nonetheless, at least one prominent Republican shared it as if it were real. “They are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing,” Trump said Sunday. And he has never stopped lying about the 2020 election, insisting he won. Misinformation is the “biggest challenge,” Nadine Williams, the county’s elections director, said at a news conference Monday. She has separately expressed concern about a “large crowd that we can possibly get on election night,” saying the county has trained for various scenarios along those lines. Officials hope the large new facility will make it easier for observers to watch the process as it unfolds. As in 2020, polling places throughout the county will have a police officer assigned to them. Also, as memory cards with precinct-level ballot counts arrive at the Election Hub on Tuesday, they will have company: police escorts. Williams has extensive experience in the election department. But overall, Little said, the county’s election team is “pretty much all new.” She herself started in 2021. That fits with a nationwide pattern of high turnover among election workers — ever since Trump used lies to massively decrease public confidence in the Democratic process and turn civil servants into targets of harassment. Over 4 million people around the state have voted early or by mail in this election, Raffensperger’s office said Saturday, and Raffensperger said he expects 1.1 million in-person voters Tuesday. In Fulton County specifically, officials said Monday they had already received thousands of mail-in ballots. Officials said they expected to be able to tally all of the advanced votes, and at least some of the absentee ballot votes, by 8 p.m. Tuesday. Assuming polls close on time, about 70% of ballots are expected to be counted and reported by 8 p.m. statewide, Raffensperger said at a press briefing Monday.

His Track Record Says Otherwise.","akbar shahid ahmed","2024-11-04","When Donald Trump was president, he constantly found new ways to boost global tension. He fast-tracked bombs to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) as they massacred civilians in Yemen, repeatedly risked nuclear war with North Korea, escalated U.S. conflict with Iran, inched toward regime change in Venezuela, appointed officials who heightened tensions in the Balkans and Israel-Palestine, and turbo-charged U.S. military spending. Since he left office, Trump has encouraged violence abroad: He celebrated Russian President Vladimir Putin’s gruesome invasion of Ukraine and urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ramp up his deadly offensives in Gaza and Lebanon. Now the Republican presidential nominee wants voters to believe that if they give him a second term in office, he will deliver global harmony. “We want to have peace on earth,” Trump declared on Friday. Trump’s most consistent message on foreign policy is that his opponents are warmongers. The pitch taps both hope and fear: Trump wants to seem like a “change” candidate who would end current conflicts, and he claims a victory by his rival Kamala Harris on Tuesday would cause even more killing. “She would get us into a World War III guaranteed because she is too grossly incompetent to do the job,” Trump said last week. It’s jarring to hear the mantle of a peace icon claimed by a man who regularly fantasizes about brutality and threatens foreigners (as well as many of his fellow Americans). Still, Trump and some outside observers are promoting the idea of Trump as peacemaker, as his campaign woos voters frustrated with current U.S. foreign policy choices like President Joe Biden’s near-total backing for Netanyahu’s wars, which is deeply unpopular among many Arab, Muslim and younger Americans, and slams neoconservatives who once dominated the GOP. As a self-identified dealmaker, Trump has spoken of negotiating with U.S. foes and complained about the cost of foreign military campaigns. Meanwhile, his backers suggest, a fixation on appearances could make him try to stem horrors abroad: He has bemoaned how footage of Israel’s attacks in Gaza has hurt its reputation, and he has expressed a desire to be seen as shaping history that might lead him to pursue recognition like a Nobel Peace Prize. Finally, advocates of the idea Trump wants a calmer world also say that would serve the economic interests of him and those he is close to. In the Middle East, for instance, the former president has boosted his business ties, particularly in Saudi Arabia, as have companies linked to Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump associate Steve Mnuchin. Separately, Trump argues his blustering style would project strength but also uncertainty, making global players more cautious about war lest they face an overwhelming or unpredictable U.S. response. But on the other side of the ledger, there’s a strong case for seeing Trump himself as a warmonger, and a second Trump presidency as extremely likely to fuel carnage globally. Between 2017 and 2021, Trump’s saber-rattling and volatility meant the U.S. narrowly avoided major wars largely due to luck and other nations’ restraint, most experts believe. In the years since, the deadly consequences of Trump-era choices became clear, as his deal for a U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan formed the basis for a drawdown that doomed thousands of pro-U.S. Afghans, and as his breaks with U.S. policy on Israel fueled Palestinian outrage that helped drive the Oct. 7, 2023, attack, which in turn led to Israeli retaliation and the current war in Gaza. Rather than reflect and propose a different path for a second term, the former president and allies are doubling down on his past approach, envisioning bigger confrontations with nations from China to Iran, and little tolerance for dissent against his policies from national security professionals or the public. “Trump likes to claim that he’s the ‘candidate of peace,’ which is just plainly absurd,” Sara Haghdoosti, the executive director of the advocacy group Win Without War, told HuffPost this week. With mass deportations and a trade war with Beijing on the Republican nominee’s agenda for a second term, and the complex diplomatic needs on conflicts from Ukraine to Gaza, many pro-peace voices are extremely skeptical a second Trump administration will usher in global stability. “When Trump was president, he brought us to the brink of a ruinous war with Iran by tearing up the successful Iran nuclear deal and then recklessly assassinating [Iranian general] Qasem Soleimani,” Haghdoosti said. “He tore apart families at the border, and tried to tear apart mine and thousands of others with his Muslim ban. He’s said repeatedly that he’d do all that again and more, and we have no reason to expect anything less.” For most of the globe’s hot spots, a second Trump presidency portends more suffering. To those pushing dubious military plans to manage global affairs ― from Iraq invasion cheerleader Netanyahu to some of his peers ― it’s a feature, not a bug, to have a U.S. president who believes “real rough, nasty” moves solve complex problems. Another Trump presidency would likely spell more anguish in situations like the civil war in Sudan, as analysts say governments fueling violence like the U.A.E. would anticipate less resistance to their approach from Washington. Still, the Biden administration’s failure to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, to free Israeli hostages and bring desperately needed relief to Palestinians, has fueled hope a different administration can deliver a deal. Trump’s exhortations to Netanyahu to wind down his campaign there have, to some, suggested he might pressure the Israeli leader to strike a deal in a way Biden has not, and Harris has not indicated she would. Yet it’s easy to envision a compromise that creates only the appearance of easing tensions while permitting ongoing killing, more alleged war crimes and further damage to prospects of Israeli-Palestinian peace. Trump’s policy in the region has long been aligned with hardline Israel supporters, from mega-donor Miriam Adelson to his former lawyer David Friedman, and Netanyahu appears to be planning to prolong fighting. When it comes to key questions on Gaza’s fate over which the U.S. has unique influence, like whether Israeli settlers seize part of the territory or how to care for its displaced, traumatized population, a Trump administration is extremely unlikely to push Netanyahu toward concessions to Palestinians. “Trump and his associates have never expressed any interest in Palestinian lives, freedom, or self-determination,” Haghdoosti noted. The prospective administration could foment further Israeli-Palestinian violence by revoking even the limited steps to deter attacks against civilians in the occupied West Bank that the Biden administration has introduced, as well as by further encouraging far-right Israelis seeking to capture Palestinian land. And domestically, Trump and Republican lawmakers are near-certain to crack down on pro-Palestinian and anti-war activism for a more restrained U.S. policy. “Trump likes to claim that he’s the ‘candidate of peace,’ which is just plainly absurd.” In deferring to hard-right Israelis, Trump could also worsen violence along Israel’s so-called “northern front”: its recently launched bombing and ground invasion of Lebanon to weaken the Hezbollah militia, which is based in the country and which has a long animosity with Israel. A settlement between Israel and Hezbollah would involve complex diplomacy, probably through the United Nations, to address Israel’s demand for Hezbollah’s forces to pull back from its border. Yet Trump has long discounted the U.N., pulling the U.S. out of parts of the organization when he was president and calling it inherently ineffective. Officials in his last administration and Trump’s allies in Congress have long sought to undermine the U.N. mission in Lebanon and the Lebanese military ― the two forces that are widely seen as able to limit Hezbollah’s influence along the Israel-Lebanon border and help peace take hold there. If neither of those organizations do the job, the main possibility is an Israeli occupation of the area, which could fuel years of further turmoil. A through-line in America’s Middle East entanglements is the U.S.’ decades-old feud with Iran, which Israel sees as its chief enemy, and which backs Hamas and Hezbollah. Washington and Tehran attempted rare diplomacy under President Barack Obama, signing an agreement that gave Iran relief from international sanctions on its economy in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. Yet when Trump took power, he torpedoed the deal. Biden has failed to restore the agreement, and Iran is now closer than ever to being able to build a nuclear weapon ― a possibility Israel and the U.S. say they could not abide, raising fears of a military confrontation if a peaceful solution is not reached soon. Meanwhile, Israel’s post-Oct. 7 military campaign has repeatedly hit Iranian targets, and in recent months, Israel and Iran have launched their biggest ever attacks on each other, boosting fears of a full-scale conflict. Trump has suggested he would negotiate with Iran, an idea the country’s new president may be open to. But he would have to square that effort with Israel’s eagerness to deal Iran lasting damage. He would face additional complexities, noted Sina Toossi, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy think tank. Even as Israel has weakened some Iran-linked groups, “Iran and its allies have kept the Bab el-Mandib pressure valve open,” Toossi told HuffPost, referring to a strait in the Red Sea that has been repeatedly targeted by the Iran-backed Houthi militia, which is based in Yemen. The corridor is vital to global trade and, by extension, worldwide inflation. The Houthis’ continued ability to launch attacks there ― presented as a gesture of solidarity with Palestinians ― give pro-Iran forces a way to pressure the U.S. Toossi also noted that one of the key remaining elements of the previous Iran nuclear deal, the “snapback” mechanism for U.N. sanctions, is set to expire in October 2025, putting a ticking clock on efforts to resolve concerns about Iranian nuclear activity diplomatically. Altogether, the situation demands a level of diplomatic savvy that’s hard to anticipate in a second Trump administration, and involves a significant risk of spiraling into warfare, even if unintentionally. Some Trump watchers believe the conflict he is most motivated to address lies beyond the Middle East: in Ukraine. Since Russia’s vicious full-scale invasion of the country in 2022, Trump and a growing number of Republicans have questioned Biden’s policy of arming the Ukrainians. A ceasefire there could let him claim a break from Biden’s policy, which he has cast as needlessly prolonging slaughter and too costly for the U.S. It could also boost Trump’s relationship with Putin, whom he has long admired, and win him credit from anti-interventionist voices on the right and in his electoral coalition, like former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who have made U.S. Ukraine policy their chief bugbear. The idea of a negotiated settlement between Kyiv and Moscow has gained traction among some Ukrainians and in Europe, and it’s possible a Trump administration could build on existing proposals for a deal. But actual peace hinges on a lasting bargain, and terms both sides can live with. It’s questionable how long either side will abide by an agreement if core issues like Ukraine’s autonomy and Russia’s occupation of its territory remain unresolved. Meanwhile, foreign officials and experts worry the general tenor of a second Trump presidency would encourage Putin to try to aggressively expand his influence in Europe, particularly if Trump remains deeply skeptical of the U.S. alliance with nations there, NATO, and if his policy choices are shaped by his desire to challenge European countries on trade. “They are going to have to pay a big price,” Trump said of the European Union earlier this week. A reelected Trump is expected to have far fewer guardrails against dramatic, ill-considered moves on foreign policy than were present in his first term. In conservatives’ Project 2025 plan, which Trump has disavowed but to which he remains strongly connected, his allies are clear they intend to gut the State Department, calling most of its national security experts “left-wing.” In terms of the armed forces, Trump has been clear he expects personal loyalty, and his circle likely has a better sense of how to enforce that after battling in their first tenure with generals like former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley who resisted Trump suggestions, like deploying troops to shoot and beat protesters in American cities. And Trump has shown he will refuse attempts by co-equal branches of government to exercise authority over international relations. Fears about his decision-making when he was president led Congress to twice use the extremely rare move of passing so-called war powers resolutions to limit Trump’s ability to single-handedly dial up global crises, with even some Republicans signing on. Each time, Trump vetoed the bill. The upshot: It’s hard to envision a Commander-in-Chief Trump having the impetus or skill to make good on his “anti-war” credo. It’s harder still to see peace having a chance if he is elected.",-0.0567141959220475,0.282706845390411
"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/taiwan-us-election-2024_n_67290438e4b05debb72b888d","Taiwan Readies For U.S. Election — And Potential ‘Uncertainty’ Ahead","chris d'angelo","2024-11-04","TAIPEI, Taiwan — For years, Taiwan has enjoyed solid bipartisan support in Washington — a consensus that has only strengthened as China has increasingly threatened the self-governing island, which it claims as its own territory and has promised to “reunify” with the mainland. In recent months, however, Donald Trump’s rhetoric has left some experts questioning whether Taiwan could continue to rely on the U.S. if the former president is reelected to the White House, given his wariness of American commitments to foreign partners and his enthusiasm for strongmen like Chinese President Xi Jinping. Taiwanese officials HuffPost heard from during a weeklong press delegation last week largely struck a diplomatic tone when asked about the upcoming U.S. election. Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister François Chihchung Wu said Taiwan will be closely monitoring the election on Tuesday and expressed measured anxiety about what the outcome will mean for future relations between the two democratic countries. “Of course, we are very concerned by the presidential election of the U.S., because the U.S. is our most important ally,” he told the group of visiting international reporters, responding to a question from Brad Dress as The Hill. Wu added that Taiwan’s concern boils down to “uncertainty” and said the island remains hopeful that whoever is elected on Nov. 5 will continue supporting its capital, Taipei. Polls show Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump in a neck-and-neck race for the Oval Office. The vote comes as observers worry a flashpoint is nearing for bubbling tensions between communist-led China and Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China. Since establishing relations with China in 1979, America has maintained a “one China” policy that recognizes the Beijing government as the sole representative of China and acknowledges but does not endorse its claim to Taiwan. Yet even as Washington has not sought formal independence for Taiwan, instead, it has been an unofficial ally and the island’s largest weapons supplier. In 2022, Biden vowed to defend Taiwan if China tried to invade. And last week, the U.S. approved the sale of nearly $2 billion worth of arms to Taiwan, including advanced surface-to-air missile defense systems. Taiwan has been “very happy for the support of the Biden administration,” Wu said. “[Biden] was very successful to cross a red line imposed by China,” he continued. “In the past, China always said that if China found any foreign military in Taiwan, it would be considered a declaration of war, but now we have the U.S. Army [Special Forces stationed] in Taiwan. We also send our soldiers to be trained in the U.S. China can just be angry. The only thing China can show is to be angry.” Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly praised Xi, calling him a “brilliant guy” who “controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist.” In recent interviews, Trump has falsely accused Taiwan of stealing the semiconductor industry from the U.S., threatened to impose tariffs on its chips, and argued Taiwan “should pay us for defense.” Echoing the approach of other worried American partners who have faced criticism from Trump and seen him praise their rivals, like European leaders, Wu avoided direct criticism of the Republican presidential nominee while trying to position support for his country as in line with Trump’s thinking. “For Mr. Trump, he always said that he wants to make America great again,” the Taiwanese leader said. “From my observation, if Trump abandoned Taiwan, I wonder how he can make America great again, because he would lose the support and credibility of the U.S. in the total Asia-Pacific.” Wu did swing back at Trump’s comment about Taiwan needing to pay for U.S. protection, noting the island already pays for its own defense. If the U.S. or any other country wants to sell Taiwan more advanced weapons, it would be happy to pay for them, he said. Senior Taiwanese officials reiterated their country’s longstanding narrative that the U.S. is essential to the region — a line of thinking that could appeal to both Harris-style proponents of American alliances and Trump supporters who worry Beijing will reduce American influence in the area. “I personally think that the reason why the Taiwan Strait has been peaceful for many, many years, one of the reasons, is because of deterrence from the U.S.,” Mainland Affairs Council Deputy Minister Liang Wen-chieh told visiting reporters. “As mainland Chinese power has been growing in terms of military and economics, whether or not this kind of deterrence will continue to be effective will have to depend on the determination and the strength of Taiwanese people and, of course, the determination and the power of the U.S.” Liang added that Xi is watching the U.S. closely, and it is “key” that the U.S. leader is not viewed in Beijing as “someone who will back down.” Pressed about how he views Trump in that context, Liang said he has his own opinions but declined to elaborate. Trump renewed his call for Taiwan to pay for U.S. protection — once again casting American ties to foreign countries not as a matter of shared interests and values but as a protection racket and so far less reliable — last week on the ”Joe Rogan Experience” podcast. When asked about Trump’s comments, a Chinese official implied that Trump could abandon Taiwan if reelected as president. The Taiwanese people know that “the United States will always pursue ‘America first’ and that Taiwan could go from being a pawn to an outcast at any time,” Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, told state media, according to Newsweek. Alongside its ongoing efforts to deter military escalation by China in the region, the U.S. has spent tens of billions of dollars in recent years supporting Ukraine in its war of survival against Russia and Israel in wars against militias in the Palestinian territory of Gaza and Lebanon. Asked if Taiwan is concerned increased U.S. military aid to Ukraine and Israel could mean there is eventually less U.S. support available for the island, Wu argued maintaining peace in the Indo-Pacific remains a top priority for Washington. “We feel that the U.S. is putting more and more resources in the Indo-Pacific,” he told HuffPost. “They need to pay high attention to the rise of China.” Whatever occurs stateside, Taiwanese officials emphasized they are relying on their own policies as they continue to hope a Chinese invasion can be avoided and a diplomatic Taipei-Beijing solution achieved. “Our position is that we have to show our determination,” said Catherine Hsu, director general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Department of International Information Services. “We need to be able to defend ourselves before we can ask for any support from outside. That is the reason why we have been further strengthening our national defense.” While China’s Xi has repeatedly vowed to unite China with Taiwan by military force if necessary, Hsu stressed that Taiwan does not see war as imminent or unavoidable. “Our goal is not to have that situation happen,” she said. “The strategy is that we work with those democracies that share the common concern to prevent the war from happening.” The next four years will change America forever.

De Niro did not disappoint outside Philadelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field before the Eagles beat the Jacksonville Jaguars. Joined by former Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry in a segment shared by Harris’ Pennsylvania team, De Niro said of Trump: “His former chief of staff General Kelly reminded us that Trump admires Hitler and ridicules our American troops who died for us.” “He mumbles, he stumbles and blubbers on, exhibiting clear signs of dementia. He promoted the Project 2025 agenda. That’s all in one week! All in one week!” De Niro said.

Lt. John Rodgers of the Clark County Sheriff’s Office in Springfield, the city that was recently in the news over false reports of migrants eating people’s pets, allegedly posted the comments on Facebook, according to images obtained by local news outlets and circulated on social media. “I am sorry. If you support the Democrat party I will not help you,” one of the posts read. “The problem is that I know which of you supports the Democratic Party and I will not help you survive the end of days,” another post read. “At the end of the day I will require you to provide proof of who you voted for if you ask me for help. Weapons and ammo are not cheap,” yet another read. An official with the Clark County Board of Elections, responding to Rodgers’ comments in an email to HuffPost Monday, reminded that a person’s vote “is always protected by ballot secrecy.” “Once a ballot is cast there is no way for anyone to access the vote selections made by any voter,” said the board’s deputy director, Amber Lopez. Lopez added that Rodgers’ comments are a matter of internal discipline with the sheriff’s department and “not within the authority of the Board of Elections.” A representative for the sheriff’s office called the comments “highly inappropriate” to local media and said they don’t reflect the office’s values and mission. “The community has a right to be upset over the actions of Lt. Rodgers and he, as well as the Sheriff’s Office in general, will have to work even harder to replenish the trust of members of our community,” Chief Deputy Mike Young said in a statement to WHIO-TV and The Associated Press. Representatives with the sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. Rodgers has said he doesn’t remember writing or deleting the posts, according to a copy of an investigative report into the comments that was obtained by WHIO and the Springfield News-Sun. Rodgers reportedly suggested that some sleeping medication he was prescribed was likely to blame as it causes him to act “out of character.” “I was taken aback when I read those messages and do not have those, nor have I ever had feelings toward anyone like what was depicted in the posts,” he said, according to the report. Rodgers reportedly received a written reprimand for violating the department’s social media policy and remains on duty. The incident is just the latest in Ohio to raise concerns about law enforcement officials compromising their sworn duty to protect all citizens due to personal political beliefs ahead of the presidential election. In Portage County, Ohio, the local sheriff back in mid-September encouraged people on Facebook to make lists of any neighbors displaying signs supporting Harris.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-mexico-tariff-25-percent_n_6728fe8ce4b0266a34583f73","Donald Trump Threatens 25% Tariff On Mexico In Retaliation For Border Crossings","arthur delaney","2024-11-04","Former President Donald Trump said Monday that he’d slap new tariffs on goods from Mexico in retaliation for illegal border crossings if he returns to office. Speaking at a campaign event in Raleigh, North Carolina, Trump said one of the first things he’d do if he wins the White House would be to call Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and threaten her over his fearmongering characterization of arriving immigrants. “I am going to inform her on day one or sooner that if they do not stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I am going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the United States of America,” Trump said. “If that does not work, I will make it 50,” he continued. “If that does not work, I will make it 75. I will make it 100.” Trump has made illegal immigration a central focus of his presidential campaign for the past year amid a surge of crossings along the U.S. border with Mexico. But there have been far fewer border encounters in recent months, according to federal data, likely as a result of changes President Joe Biden enacted earlier this year to stifle asylum claims and speed deportations. Biden announced the changes in June after Trump urged Republicans to abandon a bipartisan border security bill in Congress. Border encounters during the most recent three months were lower than the average number of encounters per month in 2019, while Trump was president, before they dropped sharply due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump has also made tariffs a centerpiece of his policy agenda for a second term and has already proposed a 20% tariff on all imported goods, claiming foreign countries would bear the cost. In fact, economists widely agree that tariffs would sock U.S. consumers as companies raise their prices to offset the cost of the tariffs. Trump’s actual tariff plans have been something of a moving target, however. His original 10% across-the-board tariff idea later became tariffs of 10% to 20% on imported goods. He’s also suggested a higher 60% tariff on Chinese goods. In recent weeks, Trump has proposed 200% tariffs on cars imported from Mexico and a week later said it could be much higher. “All I’m doing is saying, ‘I’ll put 200 or 500, I don’t care.’ I’ll put a number where they can’t sell one car,” he said on Fox News. In between those comments, Trump went even higher. “I will impose whatever tariffs are required — 100%, 200%, 1000%,” Trump said in an appearance at the Detroit Economic Club. It’s not clear if Trump’s proposed 25% tariff on Mexican goods would be in addition to the other tariffs he’s envisioning. Trump’s claim that foreign nationals would bear the cost of higher tariffs is reminiscent of his repeated and false claims in 2016 that Mexico would pay for his proposed border wall. When Trump was in the White House, Enrique Peña Nieto, Mexico’s president at the time, simply refused to go along with the wall funding demands. During his rally on Monday, Trump recalled how he wound up raiding military funds in order to pay for wall construction after Congress also balked at his demands for funding. He did not remind voters of his failed promise to make Mexico pay. The next four years will change America forever.

Will America turn the page on the Donald Trump saga? Or will America embrace his vision of a combative, possibly totalitarian future? It’s yet unclear. But Black women know that this fight is bigger than us. It’s bigger than Trump or Kamala Harris. It’s bigger than any individual. So if Black women vote, it’s for not just their future, but this country’s future. Black women know. We know we have to fight, to vote, to concede nothing. We know it will be hard. We know we will be punished for it. But we do not care. Black women know we have to turn the page to a brighter future, or be consumed and destroyed by this country’s violent past. So Black women vote. Photojournalists Nicole Buchanan (Atlanta), Laylah Amatullah Barrayn (Brooklyn) and Marissa Leshnov (Oakland) spoke with Black women at the polls during early voting in three communities about what they hope their votes yield in 2025. _____________________ “Housing is the most important issue for me and the increased rates and the inflation you know. I see that it should be decreased, I mean I’m not a middle-class person. I am, you know, someone that works every day, and everything is going up from toilet tissue to food to your cost of living. I get a raise and then it’s taken away. It’s just everything, everything is just basically being taken away from us.” _____________________ “[The most important issue for me] is inflation and the economics of everything. Giving the youth what they need, giving them the proper influence. I just feel like the people that they have on the front end — we feel like we only have two options, but there are more options. I just don’t really like the options that were presented to us...You know, like there’s so many things that need to be fixed. And we need someone in there that’s going to go in every department and fix things, and not be selfish and greedy.” _____________________ “I’ve lived in Atlanta for 40 years. This is one of the most important votes that we’ve ever had the privilege to exercise. I grew up a public school child. I went to public college. I think about all of the kids and families that would be disenfranchised if the other side had their way. As well as, all of the other freedoms: a woman’s right to choose and to do with her own body. I think about my small nieces and if they should ever need an abortion or the care that would come from that procedure to save their lives. I think about the elders in the community, the possibility of them losing their food stamps and Medicaid and Medicare. I voted not for myself but for everybody that we touch.” _____________________ “I’m really happy to vote for the first black woman president ― so very excited. The most important to me is the economy. I know a lot of people are out there struggling, and I hope that [Kamala Harris] is able to bring costs down to help everyone else. I’m also hoping for peace and less drama.” _____________________ “I want Kamala Harris now because she seemed like she do a better job than Trump do to me. I just feel like she’ll be a better president than Trump.I want them to not stop abortion. I want them to keep abortion going because I was a little girl once upon a time, and I had a bad life. If abortion [wasn’t a possibility], then I would have been a mother of six children or seven children at my young age. I wanted to finish school, but I couldn’t finish school. If Trump [wins], in office, he’d create problems when there ain’t no problem.” _____________________ “Thankfully, I am able to vote. And to not let this man get into the presidency. The most important issue to me right now is inflation. Money, financial difficulties, and housing for the elderly. I am hoping for a democratic win, and I’m hoping that we can bring this country together.” _____________________ “My biggest concern is seniors, how to address the senior concerns, economics, health issues, everything that touches our lives. People are living longer, and we need our issues addressed also. I’m hoping for unity, I’m hoping for peace. Those are the two things I’m hoping, not even hoping, praying for, unity and peace. Among the community, among the country. Just peace, a lot of peace.” _____________________ “The most important issue to me is living and the environment. I am hoping that people like me, who are getting up in age, that we will have better places to live, more affordable places to live, and better for my family.” _____________________ “I’m really hoping that we turn things around, our country is really on the decline, and I don’t know about you, but I don’t have anywhere to run to. I just like to see things be on a better path than where it is now. I want to see things get better for everybody, no matter who they vote for, what they feel. This is our country, we all live here, we’re all in it together. Whoever has our nation’s best interests at heart, and makes a difference, I’m here for it.” _____________________ “I think it’s very important that, now, at 22, I’m able to vote and that now I have an opinion on the presidency. Hopefully crime will change and the police force will change. I am hoping that Kamala Harris wins.” _____________________ “Most important is, of course, abortion, and the ban on that and our rights as women. My daughter is 23, so she hasn’t even had any children, and I don’t want her rights to be affected by somebody else making that decision for her. She hasn’t even thought about having kids yet, but it’s the fact that 10 years down the line [it] could be an issue for her, and I don’t want that to be an issue. I want her to make that decision for herself. So that’s my main issue. The second issue is [the possibility] of Donald Trump in office. In 2016, I literally woke up the next day and cried. I thought we were better than that as a country, and to know that so many people voted for this man that’s a sexist, a racist, a felon, and all that was so disappointing and that makes you look at everybody differently.” _____________________ “I’m excited to vote for our first African American female president. One of the issues important to me is actually the recall for the mayor of Oakland. It’s important because Oakland needs some help and some support, especially with homelessness and crime. For me, making the right decision that will really help our city was key for me. I am hoping that Kamala is voted our president for the United States and just that we come together as a country and not be divided no matter who wins. [I’m hoping] that racism [doesn’t win] and that we just kind of understand each other. That’s what I’m hoping for.”",0.0507184140735399,0.301313675185053

It Could Save Your Life.","griffin wynne","2024-11-04","HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. When my recent story on wintertime car safety was posted to the HuffPost Instagram account, I couldn’t help but read the comments. I had interviewed my own mechanic and I wanted to see if his recommendations resonated with readers. One item from the list kept coming up: a $10 emergency multitool that functions as a seatbelt cutter and glass car window breaker. If you’re in an accident or your car ends up in the water, this tool can help you sever your seatbelt or break your car window to get out. Commenters shared stories of family members using the tool to escape from car accidents. Many said they were happy to have it with them in their ride. Some said they gave it as a gift to new car owners or just a practical present for loved ones that drive. Better safe than sorry! This dual-headed safety hammer has a pointed spike with a protective cap, a flat-head hammer and a sharp blade to cut seatbelts. It has a 4.8-star rating, with reviews calling it a ""must-have"" and a handy tool for all drivers. Amazon user Andrew C. wrote that it sits ""driver-side door well,"" so it's easy to grab in the case of an emergency. It's already under $10 but you'll also get an 15% by clipping the on-page coupon. The savings will show up at checkout. As my mechanic Carmen Campione previously told HuffPost, “people don’t realize how hard it is to break glass.” Car windows are stronger than you may think, and they can be extra hard to break when your car is compromised by an accident. Additionally, Campione said if you have a totally electric vehicle, your door handles may malfunction during an accident, meaning it can be impossible to get out without breaking the window. Though she luckily hasn’t had to use it yet, parent and HuffPost follower Raquel Fletcher said she keeps a car multitool with her whenever she’s driving. “It has a razor-sharp cutting blade for car seats to get [a] child out in case of emergency,” she commented on the Instagram post. Commenters shared that you should keep this device within arm’s reach of the driver’s seat — in the glove box, middle console or the side door. If you keep it in the trunk or backseat, it may be hard to reach during an emergency. Promising reviews: “I always struggle with thinking the worst thing could happen when driving with my kids in the car. This product has allowed me to stress less and feel more safe to have such an important tool in my car! Thank you.” — Summer Blubaugh “This emergency escape tool is sturdy and useful for more than just breaking into or out of a vehicle or someone may be trapped. Just make sure you keep it where it can be reached if there is a crash. The life you save might be your own.” — Sandhills Complete Security “This was a gift !

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dennis-allen-fired-new-orleans-saints_n_67290d89e4b05debb72b8fd9","NFL Team Calls Him 'Excellent Football Coach' But They Still Fire The Guy","ap","2024-11-04","NEW ORLEANS — The New Orleans Saints fired coach Dennis Allen on Monday, a day after a loss at last-place Carolina extended the Saints’ losing streak to seven games — their longest since 1999. “DA is an excellent football coach,” Saints general manager Mickey Loomis said. ”This season, we’ve had an avalanche of injuries. It took its toll. DA has never offered excused. He fought each day for this organization and this team and that is what makes today disappointing.” The Saints named special teams coordinator Darren Rizzi the club’s interim coach for the final eight games of what is expected to be the fourth straight season without a playoff berth for New Orleans (2-7). Allen is 18-25 without a playoff appearance since taking over in 2022 after Sean Payton, the most successful coach in Saints history, began what turned out to be a one-season retirement from coaching. Allen was promoted by general manager Mickey Loomis after a six-season tenure as New Orleans’ defensive coordinator, a period that saw his unit ranked in the top 10 in the NFL in 2020 and 2021. “Dennis has been a part of our organization for many years,” Saints owner Gayle Benson said, referring to Allen’s initial stint as a defensive assistant with New Orleans from 2006 to 2010. “He has been extremely loyal and professional. “All of this makes today very tough for me and our organization,” Benson added. “However, this decision is something that I felt we needed to make at this time.” While the Saints continued to field one of the better defenses in the NFL during Allen’s first two seasons as head coach, the offense has been erratic and often struggled in the late stages of close games. This year, with new offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak in charge, the offense began the season by scoring a stunning 91 points over consecutive victories in Weeks 1 and 2. Since then, however, the unit has struggled to produce while injuries to key players have mounted. Center Erik McCoy, the Saints’ most accomplished offensive lineman, was the first to go down in Week 3 and hasn’t played since. Meanwhile, New Orleans has endured stints without quarterback Derek Carr, top receivers Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed and veteran guard Cesar Ruiz, among others. New Orleans entered Sunday’s loss to the Panthers without three of its top four cornerbacks on defense: Marshon Lattimore, Paulson Adebo and Kool-Aid McKinstry. But Carr was back from a three-game absence. The Saints outgained the Panthers 427 yards to 246 yet still lost, 23-22 — to a team it had beaten 47-10 in Week 1. Allen went 7-10 in his first season with the Saints and improved to 9-8 last year, narrowly missing the playoffs. Allen hoped that with a new offense, New Orleans would improve enough to make the playoffs for the first time since 2020 — which also was franchise all-time passer Drew Brees’ final NFL season. But since its strong opening two weeks, New Orleans’ offense has largely languished and dropped to 16th in yards per game (331.4) through Sunday’s games. Allen’s defense, meanwhile, has plummeted to 28th, allowing 376.4 yards per game. While the 52-year-old Allen remains an accomplished defensive coordinator, his prospects for getting another head coaching position are dim at best. He is now 26-53 as an NFL coach, including his 8-28 record with the Oakland Raiders from 2012-14.

Within hours of the announcement that Jones had died at age 91, his friends, colleagues and admirers from all over show business started paying their respects to the music legend. Whoopi Goldberg, whose film “The Color Purple” was produced, in part, by Jones, took a moment on Monday’s episode of “The View” to offer this tribute: “I can’t even explain what’s happening in my head right now,” Goldberg said as she transitioned from discussing the election to highlighting Jones’ life and career. “We just lost the extraordinary Quincy Jones, songwriter, composer, producer; he worked with everybody.” Actor Michael Caine, who was born on the exact same day as the producer, joined in celebrating him. My Celestial twin Quincy was a titan in the musical world. He was a wonderful and unique human being, lucky to have known him. LL Cool J posted his own tribute on Instagram and called Jones “a father and example at a time when I truly needed a father and example.” A post shared by LL COOL J (@llcoolj) Other celebrities chimed in with their own personal experiences of meeting and working with Jones.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-york-times-tech-workers-strike_n_672900b9e4b05debb72b80c0","New York Times Tech Workers Strike Just Ahead Of Election Day","dave jamieson","2024-11-04","Hundreds of tech workers went on strike early Monday morning at The New York Times, threatening to push their work stoppage into Election Day if they don’t see progress on a collective bargaining agreement. The walkout could disrupt what should be a monster traffic day for the paper of record on Tuesday, when all news organizations want their products running smoothly for readers. The tech workers on strike include the many engineers who handle website and app glitches in real time as polls close and viewership surges. The employee union said the strike could even impact the functioning of the Times’ famous and gut-churning Needle, which shows the presidential candidates’ vacillating odds of winning according to the latest results. “It could and it will,” predicted Benjamin Harnett, a union shop steward and principal engineer at the Times who’s worked through three presidential elections. “There is a complex set of data pipes and systems driving the Needle. ... Any one of those things could have a weird glitch.” The workers unionized as the New York Times Tech Guild in March 2022 and are still trying to negotiate their first contract. (Newsroom employees have had union representation for decades.) The union said it hasn’t reached agreements with management on some core concerns, including job protections, hybrid work arrangements, and how to address what the union said are pay equities among membership. “We’re expecting a tremendous surge in traffic, probably record-breaking for The New York Times tomorrow. We’re looking at our systems having to run at 20x or 30x capacity.” The workers are on what’s known as an “unfair labor practice” strike, walking off the job alleging illegal behavior by their employer. They claim the paper has implemented a return-to-office mandate without bargaining over it and tried to “intimidate” members by interrogating them about the upcoming strike. “The Tech Guild is asking readers to honor the digital picket line and not play popular NYT Games such as Wordle and Connections as well as not use the NYT Cooking app,” the union said in a statement Monday. Danielle Rhoades Ha, a Times spokesperson, said the paper was “looking forward” to reaching a “fair contract,” but that it was “disappointed” workers went on strike when they did. “We’re in one of the most consequential periods of coverage for our readers and have robust plans in place to ensure that we are able to fulfill our mission and serve our readers,” Rhoades Ha said. “While we respect the union’s right to engage in protected actions, we’re disappointed that colleagues would strike at this time, which is both unnecessary and at odds with our mission.” Although the digital picket line does not include news stories, Harnett said the strike could certainly impact how the Times delivers news to readers on Election Day. He said the paper would probably try using managers and consultants to fill the roles of strikers, but he doubted they could do so adequately amid a traffic surge. He said managers have also tried to get union members to cross the picket line by assuring them they could do so discreetly. “We’re expecting a tremendous surge in traffic, probably record-breaking for The New York Times tomorrow,” he said. “We’re looking at our systems having to run at 20x or 30x capacity.” He said engineers try to anticipate the problems that might arise, but that the issues they face on a night like Tuesday tend to be “unexpected.” He also said the roles they work in are not so interchangeable — it could take an engineer “hours” to get up to speed on a system they don’t customarily work with. If the strike continues, Harnett said, those workers won’t all be in the same room eating pizza and handling glitches as the world eagerly clicks for the latest results from battleground states. “For each system there is a small number of people who are clued in and able to fix this,” he said. “And most of those people are going to be on strike.” The next four years will change America forever.

The war shows no signs of ending, and Israel has said it is carrying out new operations targeting Hezbollah infrastructure across Lebanon and in parts of Syria while Hezbollah continues to launch dozens of rockets into northern Israel. Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after Hamas’ surprise attack into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran. For nearly a year, the conflict was mostly contained to the areas along the border between Israel and Lebanon. The conflict dramatically escalated on Sept. 23 with intense Israeli airstrikes on south and east Lebanon as well as Beirut’s southern suburbs, leaving hundreds dead and leading to the displacement of nearly 1.2 million people. Israel began a ground invasion of south Lebanon on Oct. 1, causing wide destruction in border villages but making little advances on the ground inside Lebanon. Israel says it is destroying Hezbollah weapons and command centers near the border, including an extensive tunnel system built by Hezbollah. The Lebanese Health Ministry said 16 people were killed and 90 injured in attacks on Sunday, bringing the death toll to 3,002. At least 13,492 have been injured. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and Hezbollah fighters in its toll. Israel claimed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters have been killed. In Israel, 72 people have been killed by Hezbollah attacks, including 30 soldiers, according to the prime minister’s office. More than 60,000 people have been displaced from their homes. Also on Monday, Israel announced it terminated the agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, the main aid provider in Gaza. It was the first step in implementing legislation passed last week that would sever ties with the agency, which Israel says has been infiltrated by Hamas, and prevent it from operating in Israel. The agency, known as UNRWA, denies the allegations and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that it has notified the U.N. of the cancellation of an agreement dating back to 1967 that facilitates UNRWA’s work. It said UNRWA “is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution.” Israel controls all entry into Gaza, and aid groups groups have warned that the legislation could severely hamper UNRWA’s work, creating further obstacles to addressing a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Israel says that UNRWA is responsible for only 13% of aid entering Gaza and it says other U.N. agencies and aid groups can fill the gap. But aid organizations say UNRWA is essential, and the agency says the Israeli figures do not account for the key role it plays in coordinating aid deliveries. “Without UNRWA coordination, without UNRWA logistics platforms ... no U.N. agency could operate at the scale required,” said Jonathan Fowler, a spokesman for the agency. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US was clear about their opposition to the legislation, and gravely concerned about the insufficient number of aid trucks entering Gaza. “We have serious concerns about the implications of it being fully implemented, as well as our concerns about the underlying humanitarian situation in, Gaza, even before Israel passed the legislation,” he told reporters in Washington on Monday. The agency provides education, health and other basic services to Palestinian refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation and their descendants, who now number nearly six million across the region. Refugee families make up the majority of Gaza’s population. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

I saw it from the inside. It was a chaotic disaster. I am also a lifelong conservative, a former Republican nominee for Congress, and a former White House Counsel,” Mitnick wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in a 13-part thread. “Trump is reckless, angry, vengeful, and narcissistic, and he has no respect for the Constitution or the rule of law.” “He is not a conservative; rather, he is a would-be autocrat and fascist motivated exclusively by his personal self-interest,” he continued. “If you think he cares about you or your family, I assure you that he does not. He cares only about himself.” Mitnick said the country did not go “completely off the rails” during Trump’s presidency because there were “just enough senior officials” who served as guardrails. But in a second term, he warned, there would be no guardrails. “If Trump is re-elected, senior administration positions will be filled entirely by blindly ambitious or unqualified radicals and grifters who pass a test of personal loyalty to Trump,” he predicted, echoing warnings from many other former Trump administration officials. 2. You won’t escape the disastrous effects of his policies (e.g., tariffs) on the economy, global instability and damage to national security resulting from his admiration for foreign dictators, or the chaos, lawlessness, and persecution that he promises. No one will.10/13 Mitnick wrapped up by encouraging fellow conservatives to join him in voting for Vice President Kamala Harris. While he disagrees with the Democratic nominee on many issues, he wrote, “she will respect our constitutional system and the rule of law, and she will support our international alliances and allies.” “It’s time to close the book on Trump and rebuild a truly conservative party based on respect for the Constitution, the rule of law, and each other,” he concluded.

According to a story published by The Atlantic on Saturday, the Republican candidate for president was eager to call his rival “Retarded Joe Biden” after the Democrat’s lackluster debate performance in early summer. “The guy’s a retard. He’s retarded. I think that’s what I’ll start calling him,” Trump reportedly told staffers traveling with him on his campaign plane, Trump Force One, back in June. Trump’s aides urged the former president to table the juvenile moniker, telling him it could alienate moderate voters and garner sympathy for an already wilting Biden campaign. In the end, campaign staff was able to convince the politician to rethink using the word in public. Steven Cheung, Trump’s campaign spokesperson, disputed the account, telling The Atlantic in a statement included in the story that the nickname “was never discussed and this is materially false.” Though he had to be convinced to abandon the derogatory sobriquet, Trump still has plenty of other insults for Biden.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colon-cancer-young-people-symptoms-ano_l_6728fc3be4b05debb72b7bef","Colorectal Cancer Is Becoming More Common In Young People. Here Are The Signs.","jillian wilson","2024-11-04","Actor James Van Der Beek, who is best known for his role as Dawson Leery in the ’90s teen drama series “Dawson’s Creek,” announced this week that he has colorectal cancer. The 47-year-old actor’s diagnosis is part of a concerning rise in colorectal cancer rates ― which groups together colon and rectal cancer because of their similarities ― in younger people throughout the world. A report by the American Cancer Society found that colorectal cancer diagnoses nearly doubled in people younger than 55 in recent years; it increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019. And the report says there’s a higher rate of advanced-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses, which increased from 52% in the mid-2000s to 60% in 2019. Even before this new report, doctors and researchers had been aware of this rise in cases. “We have seen an alarming and unsettling increase in the instance of colorectal cancer in younger people,” said Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, co-director of the Center for Young Onset Colorectal and Gastrointestinal Cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. “It’s been increasing about 1 to 2% per year since the 1990s.” The overall numbers are small, but, still, any increase is cause for concern. And it’s especially shocking because the biggest increase in cases is in the youngest group of people — those who are 20 to 29, Mendelsohn explained. Why are cases rising in young people? “We don’t have a definitive answer as to why we’re seeing rates rise,” said Dr. Nilofer Saba Azad, co-director of cancer genetics and epigenetics at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore. “But what is clear is that it’s not because anything new is happening genetically, which means it’s likely due to environmental factors.” These factors mainly include a Western diet (particularly processed meats), excess body weight, alcohol, smoking and conditions including diabetes and other metabolic issues. “Each of these individual factors isn’t a major risk factor, but when you put all of these things together it’s likely underpinning some of what we’re seeing — but we don’t have a definitive answer,” Azad noted. Azad stressed that this doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the foods that are part of a Western diet or have a glass of wine; many cancer risk factors, like genetics, are out of your control. Instead, this just underscores the importance of moderation and prioritizing nutritious foods and exercise, too. In addition to taking part in a lifestyle that limits certain risks, you should know the signs of colorectal cancer and follow official screening guidelines to stay healthy or catch the disease early. Unfortunately, the youngest groups of people experiencing this increase in colorectal cancer are too young to get screened. Screenings aren’t covered by insurance plans until 45 for most people (more on this in a moment). But that just makes it doubly important for you to get screened as soon as you can. The age for screenings to begin in the U.S. used to be 50, but as a result of this uptick in cases, the guidelines changed, said Dr. Arif Kamal, the chief patient officer at the American Cancer Society. “The reason for that is we were seeing a remarkable increase in people ... in their early 50s with colon cancer,” Kamal said. “The purpose of screening is twofold,” Mendelsohn stated. “One is if cancer is detected, it’s detected early ... in the early stages, colorectal cancer is extremely curable. And the other is to find polyps, which are precancerous growths that over time can turn into cancer.” “The idea is if we can find polyps, to identify them and remove them and therefore prevent cancer — so both early detection and cancer prevention,” Mendelsohn added. People in certain high-risk groups can get screened and have it covered by their insurance plan before age 45. “We do start earlier in people with a family history, so it’s really important for everyone to know their family history,” Mendelsohn said. In other words, you’ll want to know if a parent, child or sibling has or had colon or rectal cancer, she noted. Those with inflammatory bowel disease, which is Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, also can get screened earlier, she said. If you don’t fall into any of these groups but are worried something is wrong, it’s still worth bringing it up to your doctor. You know your body best. Together, you and your doctor may decide it’s worth getting a colonoscopy; this may not be covered by insurance or may be denied, but there are options you can explore with your medical provider. It’s very common for people to be afraid of colonoscopies, though it’s unwarranted, experts say. “Colonoscopies are extraordinarily safe procedures ... and they are actually not uncomfortable at all,” Azad said. Azad added that the most uncomfortable part for many people is the preparation (essentially cleaning out your system). But that minor inconvenience comes with major health benefits. Many experts do consider colonoscopies to be the gold standard, Mendelsohn said, “because it’s really the screening method where we can at the same time identify these polyps and remove them, and if there is cancer, biopsy it — it allows us to do early recognition and cancer prevention at once.” There are other screening tests available as well, like stool tests and a CT scan known as a virtual colonoscopy, Mendelsohn said. In healthy people, colonoscopies should take place every 10 years, and virtual colonoscopies are required every five years. Stool tests should happen more frequently, ranging from every year to every three years, depending on the test, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “When people ask what is the best test … I do think [colonoscopy] is the best test because it allows us to do all the things that we talked about, but in the end, I think the best test is the one that gets done,” Mendelsohn said. So, if you’re nervous about getting a colonoscopy (or the routine to prepare for one), there are other screening options. New research published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that abdominal pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding and iron deficiency anemia are the early “red-flag signs” that can appear months to years before a colorectal diagnosis. So, it’s doubly important to alert your doctor if you notice any of these issues. According to Mendelsohn, “the most common symptom is rectal bleeding or blood in the stool, which can be in the toilet bowl, in the stool itself [or] on the toilet paper.” But she stressed that the majority of people with rectal bleeding will not have cancer. Hemorrhoids are a common cause of this. At the same time, though, not all rectal bleeding in young people is hemorrhoids, a dangerous misconception. According to the Mayo Clinic, another colorectal cancer sign is if it feels like you can’t empty your bowel. Meaning, when you go to the bathroom, you don’t feel the relief and emptiness associated with pooping. Anemia could be another sign, too. “If you are diagnosed with anemia, so if your blood count is low, that could be a sign that you’re losing blood” in the gastrointestinal tract, Mendelsohn said. Changes in your stool is another red flag, according to Azad. This can include having black poop, Kamal added, or having issues with constipation. Though it’s also worth saying that not all constipation or poop changes are reasons to panic. Some of this could be stress-related or diet-related, Mendelsohn said. And know that some of the other symptoms — like abdominal pain and weight loss — can be really vague. These can include abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss and unexplained appetite changes. “That’s what makes this so difficult. If someone has some rectal bleeding, that’s a very easy sign … but some of the other symptoms can be a little bit more subtle,” Azad said. “It’s really about people knowing their bodies and knowing that something feels different than it has before.” Since most people younger than 45 won’t be screened for colorectal cancer, it’s important to monitor yourself for these symptoms and get in touch with your doctor if you notice any of these signs. If you do, you can and should advocate for an earlier test. Additionally, even if you’re 45 or older and getting screened regularly, it’s necessary that you alert your doctor to any of these issues.

Zero racism. Because, remember, when I was hired I was the only Black writer. Lorne wanted to have somebody Black on TV at night-time. People didn’t want that. They were clamoring to make it all white. He didn’t.” Morris, 87, described what he said was an uncomfortable incident that unfolded before the historic premiere on Oct. 11, 1975. “It really threw me when we were going through the first show,” he told The Guardian. “I didn’t have a skit, but I was watching another one. I said to Lorne, ‘There’s a doctor in this skit. Why don’t I play the doctor?’ And he says, ‘Garrett, people might be thrown by a Black doctor.’ Now mind you I had come from New Orleans, where you’re surrounded by Black medical doctors and Black PhDs. In all big cities down south, for that matter.” Morris recently told a similar anecdote to The New York Times, but said it was the show’s head writer, the late Michael O’Donoghue, who made the comment. “I was breathless at his response,” Morris told the Times. Morris acknowledged to The Guardian that cocaine addiction led him to make some “bad choices” during his time on “SNL” (though he was hardly the only cast member using the drug). Still, his five seasons on the NBC show paved the way for comedic giant Eddie Murphy’s arrival in 1980 and helped create opportunities for a host of other Black stars, including Chris Rock, Tim Meadows, Tracy Morgan, Leslie Jones and Kenan Thompson.

Grab It Before It Sells Out.","kevin cortez","2024-11-04","The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount (and when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why). HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. If you want that Dyson power but not the Dyson premium price tag, the brand’s Digital Slim vacuum cleaner might be your best bet, especially since it’s a whopping 50% off right now at Amazon and Target. While the Digital Slim has some of the makings of a typical Dyson stick vacuum cleaner — a cordless design, an LCD to show you its power levels, an easy-empty canister, a long-lasting rechargeable battery — it differs from other models for being the most compact in the brand’s lineup. This cuts the fat off the more expensive models — you won’t find an LED light or laser here or a plethora of attachments — but in exchange, it’s 30% lighter and 20% smaller than the prototypical Dyson V11. That makes the Digital Slim available at an accessible price point, but at this current half-off discount, it’s even more affordable at $249.99. Compact design aside, the Digital Slim has an LCD that shows the total amount of particles it’s picking up as you clean, the remainder of your runtime left before it needs a recharge (down to the second), if maintenance is ever required and what suction mode it’s in. Set it to “auto” so it automatically adapts its suction power to the type of floor it’s over, “eco” to save on battery or “hig” to get rid of your dustiest woes. Dyson claims it can last up to 40 minutes on a single charge. The vacuum has three head attachments, too, including a no-tangle head brush, a wide nozzle brush tool and a deep crevice tool. The vacuum’s lightweight (it’s only 4.4 pounds!) and small size makes it easier to suck up cobwebs and dust you might see in your living space’s walls or ceilings. If you’re looking for a Dyson that’ll easily stow away, is easy to carry and use and doesn’t have all those premium features, grab the Dyson Digital Slim today while it’s at this shocking discount. And take a look below to see what Amazon reviewers have to say about this nifty cleaner. “I am a huge fan of Dyson product[s], have had their vacuums for years, have the Dyson hair dryer and the Dyson Air Wrap. They are all amazing. Dyson has excellent customer service as well which is a big plus in my book. The Dyson Digital Slim does not disappoint. I love the design, you can see in my last picture that it is definitely slimmer than my other Dyson, and a little smaller in length. But it has as much power as the others that I own. It actually has a little more power on the boost cycle than my other one. My 5th picture show the dog hair that I got out of my carpet in literally one minute of run time. Amazing! I love that it shows you how much battery it has when using the different modes, that is a great feature. And, it is right in your view, no having to check what mode you are in. The bin is easy to empty, just one push on the large red handle and it opens easily and empties with ease. I will never hesitate to recommend a Dyson product to anyone. They are awesome.” — Jan  “This vacuum is great, I have a Dyson ball but it’s really bulky to use for small cleanup jobs. This is perfect! Picks up dog hair like nobody’s business. Only thing I would have liked better is if the handheld trigger was an on or off button, after a while arthritis starts to kick in and it gets rough holding the trigger. Cleanup is simple, just pop open the tank and dump it out. Easy!” — A.S.  “The vacuum rocks. This is our 5th Dyson; the rest are still working somewhere. This one gets the star place in the vacuum closet and the V10 now gets moved near the kid’s space. The slim digital now has kitchen and hallway duty. Which means it will get as rough use as the V10 that has lasted us for a long time. Its only quibbles were managing its filter. The slim digital also has a much bigger filter, its noticeably lighter and looks a little shorter in length for the floor mode. The time left indicator is priceless ― so far it seems pretty accurate. I wonder if it will change as the battery wears. Same attachments - but they work well. This is the workhorse of the kitchen and hall mess and everyone down to the 10yo can use it easily. My biggest gripe with both this one and the V10 is the wall mount. The drywall attachment fasteners are cheap and fail on installation. You need to replace them with substantial anchors. If you are going into wood ― the included screws are acceptable. Why skimp on this? The overall design of the wall mount hasn’t changed much ― its smaller, but the same as the old one. -1star... time to improve.” — Christopher Powell  “It’s a Dyson vacuum. Performance and filtration are top notch. Apparently, the digital slim is very similar to the V11 we have, but lighter (which is a good thing for how it’s used) and has slightly shorter run time. We’ve also had a V8 previously. Every dyson we’ve used has been performing well and prevents dust from reentering the room. Unlike some higher and more expensive models, digital slim’s trigger needs a constant pull, but it didn’t really cause any issue for me on the V11. Therefore, the lighter slim mode should be less of an issue. Overall, I’d say price is the most significant downside for almost any dyson product. Otherwise, they all seem to perform better than similar product from other brands. Just a personal experience.” — Chris  By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. Ever since I became a contact lens wearer many years ago, chronic dry eyes and I have become fast and familiar friends. That gritty feeling and overly red appearance only gets exacerbated by staring at a computer screen for long periods throughout the day. After a recent visit with my eye doctor, where I expressed my dryness-related woes, he pulled up this $29 electric eye mask on his computer and told me this would be an effective solution —and reviewers agree. In all transparency, this wasn’t the first time an eye professional told me that heat application could help with dryness. However, this was the first time I had been suggested an option that was electric and didn’t require a microwave, wet washcloths or other more cumbersome methods that don’t stay hot. The Aroma Season eye mask is filled with natural flax seeds to offer a slightly compressive, non-toxic remedy and a design that molds into those awkward gaps around the eyes and nose, which means there’s greater contact with the heat of the mask. The mask is also slimmer compared to previous renditions, which can be better for a more precise wear. According to the brand, this mask uses a graphene heating element, which generates a deeply penetrating infrared heat that can assist with more than just eye dryness, but also styes, ocular migraines and more. The five temperature settings can be controlled using the attached controller, which can also be used for scheduling timer functions, an important safety feature if you accidentally end up falling asleep with the mask on. According to my eye doctor, just 10 minutes a day can be all you need to help with dryness symptoms, though it can vary from person to person. To find out exactly how heat works to improve eye dryness I also reached out to an eye specioutside of my own healthcare provider. Dr. Anat Galor, a Miami, Florida-based ophthalmologist and clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that in some individuals, abnormalities of the Meibomian glands — which are the glands in the eyelids that produce the oil component of tears — contribute to dry eye symptoms. “One treatment that is used to improve Meibomian gland health is to apply heat to the glands to help the release of oil onto the surface of the eye,” Galor said. Although I have yet to try the Aroma Season mask out for myself (we have procrastination to thank for that) it had a whole host of promising Amazon reviews that supported my doctor’s recommendation and Galor’s explanation for why it helps with dry eyes. One reviewer claimed that this mask “saved them” and has been a long-lasting and effective solution for their chronic eye dryness and styes, while others say the electric design has been more beneficial compared to microwavable versions or gel-filled options. Promising Amazon reviews: “If you suffer from dry eye, look at a computer screen all day or just need to relax your eyes this is a wonderful product. My optometrist recommended this exact device as he has one too and he told me he loved his ,so I decided to try it for myself. My optometrist was right. This makes my eyes feel great after using it. My Optometrist recommend that I use it about 15 minutes 1-2 times a day. I like that you can set the temperature to the level you like. It gets pretty warm to me, so I keep mine at the lower levels. I like the cloth covering that comes with it too. It is filled with flaxseeds, has infrared heat, three preset timers w/ auto shut off and high/medium/low temperatures. This is the perfect device for your Me Time.” — Henrietta “My eye doctor wanted me to apply heat to my eyes for 10 minutes/day to combat dry eye. I started out with one of those gel-filled masks that you microwave; it lasted about a year then started leaking and burning. This one was twice the price or so of the gel-filled one, so I decided to try it. I LOVE it. I love the compact size; I love that it is shaped so I can use it with the cord on the right or left. At first I thought a cordless one would be better, but then I realized I wouldn’t be doing any multi-tasking while using the mask LOL. It has a digital readout that’s large enough to see without my readers, an on/off button and 5 graduated heat settings. I use it on the highest setting (5) and it’s just right. The material is soft, including the cloth cover that came with it to keep it clean (the cloth cover is washable, the actual devide is not). Highly recommend over microwavable styles.”— MarsWhitt “I have suffered with dry eyes for years and need the heat applied to my closed eyes to help stimulate my eye ducts/oil glands. I had always heated socks or cloths in the microwave but it wasn’t very efficient. This small electric heated mask is really great. It has four heat settings and the timer can be set up to 1 hour. Perfect for a little nap! Love it.” — Anita Reed “Saved me. I wish I had known about this sooner! Found out about it after watching an eye dr. youtube video on dry eyes that explained the the research for dry eyes is the heat temp and 20 min timing. This is why the microwaveable ones do not work. They are too hot at first then don’t stay at the right temp long enough.This has the set 20 min and heat timing! I have ocular rosacea and get styes as well as severe dry eye now. I use this every night before bed and now no longer get styes!” — HaloS In line with a recommendation from The National Eye Institute's Dr. Chantal, it's best to stick with tear replacement drops that can mimic your natural tears without employing preservatives. This 50-pack of eye drop vials by Refresh are packed in individual vials to reduce the chance of bacteria growth and can instantly moisturize and and lubricate the surface of the eye. Nab this on sale today at 38% off. For stronger daytime dry eye relief when regular drops just aren’t cutting it, this everyday soothing eye gel by Refresh might do the trick. The slightly thicker drops are safe to use with contacts and help to coat the eye surface, relieving a number of symptoms like burning, stinging and redness. Dr. Hakop Khurdajian, a Los Angeles-based optometrist, said that applying warm compresses on your eyes three or four times each day for about 5 to 10 minutes each is one of the best ways you can relieve dry eye symptoms without the use of medication. The heat helps to open the glands in the eye and promote greater oil flow, instantly reducing that gritty feeling. Once microwaved for about 20 seconds, this washable and anti-bacterial eye mask can help relax strained and dry eyes with the help of heat-holding beads. Running air conditioners in the summer or heaters in the winter can zap moisture from the air. Cousineau-Krieger said it might be helpful to place a humidifier in your room or office. The AquaOaisis humidifier produces cool mist to boost hydration in the air using a 360-degree rotating nozzle. The large-capacity tank means longer run times, and three different mist modes give customized levels of air moisture. Heads up: Clip the on-page coupon and take $2 off this humidifier today. Cousineau-Krieger said that drinking more water is essential when it comes to eye hydration. This can be tricky if you're a busy person or someone who forgets to drink water throughout the day. This 21-ounce vacuum-insulated water bottle is made from odor-resistant and shatter-proof stainless steel. The HidrateSpark Pro's most impressive feature, though, is its Bluetooth capability, which allows you to track your water intake, set daily goals or even challenge friends through an app. The LED sensor at the bottom also starts to glow when it's time to take a drink, and it contains a location tracker so you never lose your bottle. ""Try using a high-quality air filter at home to reduce the effects of dry or polluted air,"" Herz said. (Read more about how air purifiers work.)The Blueair Blue Pure 211+ is a reasonably priced purifier that’s suitable for spaces of up to 540 square feet. It uses an activated carbon filter to effectively grab particles — particularly dust, smoke and allergens that can potentially cause eye irritation. It also contains a second machine-washable filter specifically for capturing larger particles in air and has an indicator that lets you know when it's time to change the filter. ""Ask your ophthalmologist if you should take omega-3 fatty acid supplements,"" Herz said. ""Omega-3 fatty acids can also be found naturally in foods like fish and flax seeds, and may help reduce dry eye symptoms.""While supplements might not be an option for everyone, these fish oil soft gel capsules are made from strict and carefully selected ingredients that have been purified to remove potential traces of mercury or other contaminants. Heads up: It's 40% off for this bottle of fish oil capsules, for a limited time.

Boy, that must have been a painful day in his life.” Trump added, “He didn’t have to do that. He provided the necessary votes.

McConnell rebuked Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, blaming him for inciting the riot. In return, Trump has hurled insults at McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao, who resigned as Trump’s transportation secretary after the insurrection. McConnell had also reportedly trashed Trump in private, after the 2020 election but before the attack on the Capitol, as “stupid,” “ill-tempered” and a “despicable human being.” But that didn’t stop McConnell from endorsing Trump in March when it became clear that Trump would become the GOP’s presidential nominee. “It should come as no surprise that as nominee, he will have my support,” McConnell said in a statement at the time.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/truth-social-outsource-mexico_n_6728b1e6e4b0266a34580840","Truth Social's Company Awkwardly Admits Outsourcing A Few Jobs To Mexico","ron dicker","2024-11-04","Truth Social’s parent company copped to a truth that might make Republican nominee Donald Trump look like a hypocrite: Trump Media has hired coding contractors in Mexico while Trump vows to punish businesses that outsource, ProPublica reported Saturday. A rep for the company told the news outlet that it was using two workers and accused ProPublica of sensationalizing the story. But according to ProPublica, there’s more to it. Staff deemed the south-of-the-border hirings as betrayals of their “America First” ethos, a source said, and a whistleblower letter accused CEO Devin Nunes, a former GOP congressman, of asserting a policy to hire only foreign contractors. The Trump Media spokesperson declined to comment to ProPublica on how much the workers are being paid, in addition to how many were employed over time. A board member, meanwhile, defended the practice because he said Trump Media is a global multimedia company. In a moment of posturing about his “America First” platform, Trump recently threatened farm equipment maker John Deere with a 200% tariff if it relocates part of its operation to Mexico following domestic layoffs. However, the Republican nominee’s tough talk may actually be counterproductive. Tariffs could jack up domestic prices, many economists claim. In February, Trump was sued by Truth Social co-founders who said the former president was trying to bilk them out of their shares. Read the full Truth Social investigation at ProPublica.

I’m an immigrant. I chose to be here,” Oliver said, appearing to choke up towards the end of his closing monologue. “I would argue there is nothing more American than having a healthy adversarial relationship with those in power, even if you voted for them,” he added. He acknowledged he had not given “a very uplifting speech,” but concluded with a note of optimism, predicting that if former President Donald Trump loses Tuesday’s election, “he’s basically finished.” He acknowledged that Trump would likely first “put us through hell” before leaving the stage. Trump has laid the groundwork to again falsely claim the vote is fraudulent if he loses. “But when the dust settled, he’d have lost two elections in a row, and he would be campaigning as an 82 year old next time,” Oliver said. “I think he’d be done. And doesn’t that sound great?” He went on: “I know the problems that he’s a symptom of would, of course, remain, but we wouldn’t have to deal with him anymore. Wouldn’t it be great to live in a world where he’s no longer an active threat, just an annoyance? Where this photo could just be funny, rather than having geopolitical implications. Or he can yell about ice cream machines and complain about windmills, and we all have the option of just not giving a shit about any of it at all.

Harris “delivers the message that I think Americans want, which is, ‘Let’s come together, I’m going to be president for all Americans.’ She’s done this for quite some time,” co-host Joe Scarborough noted. Trump, though, said Scarborough, “talked about America being horrible,” lied yet again about his 2020 election defeat, repeated his “father of IVF” untruth and “then he did a graphic scene, like he was having oral sex with the microphone.” “Oh my God,” said co-host Mika Brzezinski.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/matt-cartwright-mike-johnson-villain_n_672859aae4b07ebc5a29c35d","Pennsylvania Rep. Matt Cartwright, A Trump Country Democrat, Finds A Different Right-Wing Villain","daniel marans","2024-11-04","STROUDSBURG, Pa. — If you’ve listened to Democrats talk about immigration policy this election cycle, you’ve undoubtedly heard them blame former President Donald Trump for killing a border security deal negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators. It’s the heart of Vice President Kamala Harris’ argument on the topic — and not without good reason: The deal collapsed in February shortly after Trump came out publicly against it. But not every Democrat is singing that tune. Embattled Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.) doesn’t mention Trump at all when describing what happened. He pins the blame instead on House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). “There were a bunch of bipartisan senators that were behind this, and all of a sudden, Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, said, ’Don’t bother bringing that to the House. It’s dead on arrival in the House,’” Cartwright said in his Oct. 23 debate with Republican challenger Rob Bresnahan. “Imagine for us to be able to stop fighting over the border, and Mike Johnson didn’t want anything to do with it.” In a brief interview after the early Veterans Day parade Sunday in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, Cartwright cited Johnson’s insistence that Trump’s pressure had not played a role in his decision to oppose the border security deal. “I am not privy to the firsthand discussion, but when Mike Johnson said, ‘No, it was my own idea,’ I’m going to take him at his word,” Cartwright told HuffPost. There’s more than a little truth in Cartwright’s analysis. Even without Trump’s opposition, Johnson would likely have faced enormous pressure from his right flank not to put a Senate border bill up for a vote. But for Cartwright, a trial lawyer who has represented northeastern Pennsylvania since 2013, there are also political reasons to avoid bringing Trump into the discussion. Cartwright represents a largely white, blue-collar stretch of Pennsylvania that has been drifting right for years despite including President Joe Biden’s hometown of Scranton. That makes him something of a Democratic Party unicorn. One of just five Democrats in the House running for reelection in districts that Trump carried twice, Cartwright is the sole member of the group to have been on the ballot in such a district in both 2016 and 2020. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, another longtime Democrat in that group, was only drawn into a district Trump would have won ahead of the 2022 race; the remaining three Democrats — Reps. Jared Golden (Maine), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.) and Mary Peltola (Alaska) — were all elected after the 2016 race. What’s more, unlike the newer members of the Trump country quintet, who are all members of the centrist Blue Dog Caucus, Cartwright has refused to back away from his support for “Medicare for All” and his membership in the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Cartwright has instead found more subtle ways to break with Democratic Party leaders and cultivate support from the Trump-voting majority, while still painting Bresnahan — and the Republican majority he could help cement — as a threat to voters of all ideological stripes. “I’m not going to be beholden to anyone, not Donald Trump, not Mike Johnson.” One of them is tying Bresnahan, the heir to a union electrical contracting company, to Johnson, who has visited Cartwright’s district — Pennsylvania’s 8th — to raise money for and campaign with the GOP challenger. In his opening statement at the debate, Cartwright said he has “always stuck my thumb in the eye of the huge corporations that are raising the costs for everybody by profiteering and gouging us again and again.” “They don’t need anybody’s help,” he continued. “They don’t need my help. They’ve got Mike Johnson and his handpicked candidate.” Whether Cartwright succeeds in nabbing another term could determine how Democrats running in pro-Trump districts pitch themselves to voters in the future. His fate remains unclear. The Cook Political Report rates the race a toss-up. But if Cartwright falls short, it won’t be for lack of material provided by the gaffe-prone House speaker. In addition to Johnson’s role in the demise of the bipartisan immigration bill, Cartwright has singled out Johnson’s recent promise to try to undo the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. According to video obtained by NBC News, Johnson was speaking about health care reforms with supporters in an adjacent Pennsylvania district on Oct. 29, when an event attendee asked him, “No Obamacare?” Johnson replied by rolling his eyes while saying, “No Obamacare,” even as he acknowledged dislodging the deeply embedded law would require “massive reforms.” “The Johnson/Bresnahan plan to rip coverage away from northeastern Pennsylvanians is utterly consistent with their campaign mantra: Corporations over families,” Cartwright said in a Wednesday statement responding to the report. Bresnahan’s campaign told HuffPost he does not want to repeal the ACA and would not support any change that “removes health care coverage from any constituent.” Bresnahan has no policy record to speak of, but he has spoken positively about the Trump tax cuts, calling them “incredible.” His campaign told HuffPost he would “not vote for any tax increase and will be focused on delivering additional tax relief to working class families before anyone else.” The vast majority of the benefit from the Trump tax cuts went to the top 1% of highest-earning Americans. Democrats like Cartwright say they want to allow the reduction of the top income tax rate to expire, while providing additional tax relief for the middle class. Cartwright has used Bresnahan’s position on the tax cuts and ties to Johnson to depict Bresnahan as a stooge for Corporate America. “He’s for cutting taxes for billionaires,” Cartwright told HuffPost. “I’m not.” Bresnahan insisted on his independence from Republican Party leadership during his debate with Cartwright, vowing to leave office if he were to ever vote with party leaders 98% of the time or more. “I’m not going to be beholden to anyone, not Donald Trump, not Mike Johnson,” he said. Bresnahan’s greatest asset is likely that the workers at his family’s electrical contracting company, Kuharchik Construction, are members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union. “These are family-sustaining wages you earn while you learn,” Bresnahan said in the debate. “These jobs will always be needed.” But Cartwright’s Democratic allies have sought to convert an asset into a weakness, seizing on the fact that Bresnahan took over as a top executive when he was just 19 and that he presided over the sale of the company to a private equity firm in July 2023. Bresnahan still owns a sizable chunk of the company and has said the sale has spurred additional hiring at the company, but private equity firms have a history of squeezing workers to slash costs over time. Bresnahan “took over the family business as a teenager, cashed out by selling it to a foreign private equity firm, and invested his money in China,” says the narrator of a TV ad by House Majority PAC, House Democrats’ main super PAC. “Now, Bresnahan and his allies have a plan to give a huge tax break to millionaires like themselves and risk your hard-earned Social Security and Medicare.” “If you don’t do anything up until 2035 then all of a sudden, it’s going to be, ‘Oh, we have no more runway left, and our only option is to cut benefits for seniors.’ That's the quiet part out loud.” Unlike Bresnahan, Cartwright also boasts the support of Pennsylvania organized labor’s umbrella organization and backs the PRO Act, a sweeping bill making it easier for unions to organize. Bresnahan doesn’t support the bill in its entirety, according to a CNBC report from mid-October. “As it is currently written, the PRO Act in its current form would add unnecessary bureaucratic measures ― something Congressman Cartwright excels at,” Bresnahan’s campaign said. And Cartwright faults Bresnahan for claiming to oppose Social Security cuts without getting behind a plan to shore up the program’s revenue in a way that would make cuts avoidable. Cartwright is a co-sponsor of a bill eliminating the cap on Social Security’s taxable income for earnings greater than $400,000 a year. “It’s not about ‘not cutting.’ If you don’t do anything up until 2035 then all of a sudden, it’s going to be, ‘Oh, we have no more runway left, and our only option is to cut benefits for seniors,’” Cartwright told HuffPost. “That’s the quiet part out loud.” For his part, Bresnahan has seized on the fact that Cartwright voted in line with Biden’s position 100% of the time in 2021 and 2022, according to FiveThirtyEight. And the GOP challenger has cited Cartwright’s membership in the Congressional Progressive Caucus as evidence of his radicalism. Cartwright has responded by pointing to 16 bipartisan bills he introduced that became law. Four of those bills passed under Trump, including a measure to increase financial restitution for victims of child sexual abuse material. One of Cartwright’s TV ads also features a Republican mother and Democratic daughter who bond over their shared support for abortion rights, police funding, and Cartwright, a champion of both. A similar Cartwright spot last cycle featured a Biden voter and a Trump voter backing Cartwright. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sex-trump-supporter-womens-rights_n_6724f813e4b01f6919d9e988","I Was Having Sex With An Old Hookup. Midway Through, I Discovered He Was A Trump Supporter.","carla sosenko","2024-11-04","When comedians Billy Eichner and Will Ferrell hit the streets in a video released last week repping “loud white men for Kamala Harris,” I was delighted. I was even happier when three women they approached had similar answers to slightly different versions of the same question: “Would you have sex with a Trump voter?” The responses were, in order, “absolutely not,” “no!” and “[puking sound].” You see, reader, I had been there — actually, literally, geographically there, faced with the same question, in the bed of (someone who turned out to be) a Donald Trump voter. I had only myself to blame, because there had been signs. I suppose somewhere in the back of my brain I told myself, I’d rather just not know. It was 2020, fall. Like everyone else in New York, I was a nervous wreck. Every day had the same soundtrack: Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s voice telling me how many people had died the day before, sirens, the 7 p.m. catharsis/shock of banging pots and pans. As Nov. 3, Election Day, crept closer, the noise in the streets and noise in my head bled into one cacophonous blob of fuuuuuuuuck. A pandemic and the possibility of a second Trump term? I couldn’t bear it. You deserve something nice, I told myself. I forget how we got back in touch, but a guy I’d slept with on and off for years — usually with long absent stretches — resurfaced. I asked him if he’d been following COVID-19 rules as strictly as I had, and when he said yes, I decided that he was the something nice I deserved. This man and I had met on a dating site years before. It became apparent quickly that we were not compatible for loads of reasons. But as incompatible as we were ideologically, we were very compatible chemistry-o-logically. Also, I was comfortable with him. Protectiveness of my body and discomfort with strangers has made me cautious when it comes to sleeping around — it has no moral charge for me; strangers just don’t rev my engine in that way — so his perpetually being in the background was nice. It was like I had him on layaway. You see, I have a history of terrible men. I have dated all manner of narcissist, idiot, douchebag and misogynist. (Occasionally I’d hit a grand slam and get all of the above in one person.) I buried my head in the sand when men I was attracted to showed signs of extreme anger; I looked the other way when guys said things I wouldn’t have tolerated in friends but did tolerate in objects of my affection because I really, really wanted to smoosh my face against their dumb faces. Over our years of knowing each other, Layaway Man had waved the occasional red flag. We met in the lead-up to the 2016 election, and I knew he did not like Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. He said something vaguely about probably voting for Gary Johnson, and I must have dissociated, because I kept seeing him. One time, he was very aggressive with someone standing too close to him on the subway as we commuted after one of our nights together, and it frightened me. He also posted to his Instagram a photo of an apparently unhoused man sleeping on the subway, which to me seemed pointlessly cruel — Patrick Bateman–esque, maybe, or even Trumpian. (Yes, I did just put them in order of scariness.) He tended to complain a lot in the way that straight white men do more and more these days. He was, in many ways, the diametrical opposite of the kind of people I value. It didn’t matter, I told myself, because I wasn’t trying to date him; I was only trying to bone him. This sort of character vivisection is not at all on brand for me. I am and have always been a proud liberal. I treat my body as if it were a (fuel-efficient) car and wear my political beliefs like bumper stickers, to draw close people who are like me and ward off (and agitate) those who are not. I grew up with parents who boycotted or abstained from many things for many reasons, from Nestlé to Chanel. As an adult, I became an emphatic supporter of cancel (or rather “consequence”) culture, axing people for all manner of misdeed, whether a simple political difference or a onetime gaffe that to me showed a rooted moral deficiency. For a long time I was unforgiving in a way I now consider a little too rigid, nihilistic and needlessly exhausting. (One of my more joyous recent surprises has been seeing people I thought would be forever on my no-go list — Paris Hilton, Eminem — revealing themselves to have grown into inspiring, beneficent adults who are, it turns out, humans who have made mistakes and reckoned with them, or at least some of them. Other people — Mel Gibson, Harvey Weinstein, anyone who attended Donald Trump’s recent Madison Square Garden rally, on the stage or in the audience — have close to zero chance of ever redeeming themselves.) At Layaway Man’s Bushwick apartment in fall 2020, we got straight to business, as usual, and it was fun, as usual. Then we sort of … took an intermission. (We’re in our 40s, not 20s.) He asked if I wanted to see his YouTube channel. “Not really” is what I thought, but “sure” is what I said, for I am a lifelong people pleaser. I pulled on my undies, and when I moved to grab the rest of my clothes, he urged me not to. Now, in addition to watching a vlog I had no interest in, I was going to do it while feeling like I was on a French beach. Fantastic. I honestly can’t remember what the video was about specifically. I just know it was composed of snarky, derisive, sexist to-camera commentary about Kamala Harris, who wasn’t even the Democratic nominee. He (the naked Layaway Man sitting next to me, not the grating, men’s rights-y video projection I was being forced to endure) watched me watching him, and he seemed like a little kid proud of what he’d brought for show-and-tell. In a way, it felt like he was trying to impress me. In another, it felt like he was baiting me. Our pairing had always been incongruous — I had a more successful career and could tell that it bothered him, and he often made snide remarks about the nice apartment I lived in alone while he was in a cramped triple with roommates — but it was the first time I felt like he was trying to needle me. I finally asked, “You’re not voting for Donald Trump, are you?” A smile spread across his face. He shrugged coyly, pursed his lips together as if to say, “I dunno, mayyyyyyyyybe,” meaning, definitely, yes, he was voting for Donald Trump. Was he flirting? Did he think he was flirting? Was this the ideological equivalent of pulling my hair on the playground (or in the bedroom)? In that moment, I didn’t understand how we had ever tolerated each other long enough to even find out that we had chemistry. “I can’t have sex with someone who’s voting for Donald Trump,” I heard myself say, and next thing I knew I was grabbing my Isabel Marant dress off the floor. He seemed dumbfounded, and in a way I sort of was too. But I knew on a cellular level, before the words had even formed, that there was no way I could knowingly let a Trump supporter touch me. As I flung pieces of clothing onto my body, I heard myself muttering other things, like “You’re super great” and “Take care, good luck!” (With what? Oh, my God, Carla, stop talking.) He protested, dejected — “I haven’t come yet” — and I said, “Oops, sorry, Uber’s here, gotta run!” I flew down the stairs of his building and never saw him again. I was proud of my body, which had chosen “flight” out of all the available options (and I guess a little bit of “fawn” — because, again, people pleaser). I told the story to anyone who would listen, waving it around as proof of my commitment to democracy and feminism and humanity. (Withholding his orgasm wasn’t purposeful, but it did give me a sadistic little thrill.) Of course, deciding to sleep with him (or not sleep with him) based on how he was voting was relatively low stakes for me. I am a fair-skinned, cis-femme, self-supporting New York Jewess, so unlike for many others, this man and his ideals posed little actual threat to me. (My Jewishness is something I can hide, though I don’t. I do the opposite, draping myself in a Mr. T level of Judaica-themed jewelry.) His presence didn’t call mine into question, because I live in relative safety, unlike people who are marginalized and targeted, like those in the transgender and Black communities. The revelation of Layaway Man’s voting intentions was a true lady-boner killer — but it was my inherent privilege that kept me from needing to know earlier. In a post–Jan. 6 world, I won’t make that mistake again. Like those women on the street with Billy Eichner and Will Ferrell, I can tell you, “Absolutely not, ew, [puking sound] — I would not have sex with a Trump voter.” And I mean it. Instead, I’m hoping to come across a guy who gives me the feelings in my body Layaway Man once did, but the feelings in my heart and my brain that only a Kamala supporter could.

Velshi had asked Snyder what he was telling people about “feeling overwhelmed, scared and anxious” ahead of the 2024 election, which polling still says is remarkably close between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival. “That is the perfect question because the people who want to bring the system down, the people that want to make America into a different kind of order, authoritarian, they want us to be frightened, they want us to be anxious,” Snyder replied. “That is exactly the thing that they are aiming for, and it’s their strongest weapon,” he added. “And so when you feel that, you should recognize, ‘Aha, this is part of the regime change, this is their trick, and I’m not gonna fall for it. What I’m going to do is I’m gonna make sure that I am not only thinking the right things, that I am doing the right things, and that I’m doing them with other people.’” Snyder has repeatedly expressed his fears as to what will happen if Trump wins back the White House. “Unless Trump loses,” he warned in July, “America ends.” Watch Snyder’s conversation with Ali here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/spain-floods-mud-hurled-royals-officials_n_6728bb97e4b0f3d946e04088","Furious Spain Flood Survivors Hurl Mud At King, Queen And Top Government Officials","david melero , joseph wilson","2024-11-04","PAIPORTA, Spain (AP) — A crowd of enraged survivors hurled clots of mud left by storm-spawned flooding at the Spanish royal couple on Sunday during their first visit to the center of their nation’s deadliest natural disaster in living memory. Spain’s national broadcaster reported that the barrage included a few rocks and other objects and that two bodyguards were treated for injuries. One could be seen with a bloody wound on his forehead. It was an unprecedented incident for a royal house that carefully crafts an image of monarchs adored by their country of more than 48 million people. Spanish fury has been unleashed against a state that appears overwhelmed and unable to meet the needs of people used to living under an effective government. Officials also rushed Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez from the scene soon after his contingent started to walk the mud-covered streets of one of the hardest-hit areas, where over 60 people perished and thousands of lives were shattered. The disaster fueled by climate change killed at least 205 people in eastern Spain. “Get out! Get out!” and “Killers!” the crowd in the town of Paiporta shouted, among other insults. Bodyguards opened umbrellas to protect the royals and other officials from the tossed muck. Police had to step in, some officers on horseback, to keep back the crowd of several dozen, some wielding shovels and poles. Queen Letizia broke into tears sympathetically after speaking to several people, including one woman who wept in her arms. Later, one of the queen’s bodyguards had a bloody wound on his forehead and there was a hole in the back window of the prime minister’s official car. But even after being forced to seek protection, King Felipe VI, with flecks of mud on his face, remained calm and made several efforts to speak to individual residents. He insisted on trying to speak with people as he tried to continue his visit. He spoke to several people, patting two young men on their backs and sharing a quick embrace, with mud stains on his black raincoat. Still, one woman smacked an official car with an umbrella and another kicked it before it sped off. While far from awakening the passion that the British hold for their royals, Felipe and Letizia’s public events are usually greeted by crowds of fans. The 56-year-old Felipe took the throne when his father, Juan Carlos, abdicated in 2014 after he was tarnished by self-made financial and personal scandals. Felipe immediately cut a new figure, renouncing his personal inheritance and increasing the financial transparency of his royal house. He and the 52-year-old Letizia, a former journalist, dedicate a significant part of their public agenda to cultural and scientific causes. Visits to sites of national tragedies are also part of the royal duties for monarchs seen as a stabilizing force in a parliamentary monarchy restored following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The king later told regional authorities at the command post of emergency response efforts that they had to give “hope to those affected by the flood and attend to their needs, guaranteeing that the state is there for them.” Public rage over the haphazard management of the crisis has been building. Felipe heard some jeers when he took part in a tribute to the dead of a deadly 2017 terror attack in Barcelona, but that was nothing comparable to Sunday’s reception. The queen had small glops of mud on her hands and arms as she spoke to women. “We don´t have any water,” one woman told her. Many people still don’t have drinking water five days after the floods struck. Internet and mobile phone coverage remains patchy. Most people only got power back on Saturday. Stores and supermarkets are in ruins and Paiporta, population 30,000, still has many city blocks completely clogged with piles of detritus, countless totaled cars and a ubiquitous layer of mud. Thousands have had their homes destroyed by a tsunami-like wave of muck and indignation at mismanagement of the disaster has begun. The floods had already hit Paiporta when the regional officials issued an alert to mobile phones. It sounded two hours too late. More anger has been fueled by the inability of officials to respond quickly to the aftermath. Most of the cleanup of the layers and layers of mud and debris that has invaded countless homes has been done by residents and thousands of volunteers. “We have lost everything!” someone shouted. Shouts Sunday included demands aimed at regional Valencia President Carlo Mazón, whose administration is in charge of civil protection, to step down, as well as “Where is Pedro Sánchez?” “I understand the indignation and of course I stayed to receive it,” Mazón said on X. “It was my moral and political obligation. The attitude of the king this morning was exemplary.” Spanish national broadcaster RTVE reported that the barrage aimed at the royals included a few rocks and other hard objects were tossed and that two bodyguards were treated for injuries, and the monarchs and officials called off another stop Sunday at a second hard-hit village, Chiva, about half an hour to the east of Valencia city. Sánchez said that recovery efforts won’t be derailed by the incident. “I want to express all my government’s solidarity and its acknowledgement of the anguish, suffering, uncertainty and the needs of the residents of Paiporta and the region of Valencia,” Sánchez said, while adding that he believes the majority of people “reject the types of violence that unfortunately we saw today.” The mud-slinging scene occurred as thousands more Spanish soldiers, national police officers, and Civil Guard gendarmes arrived, or are set to arrive, at the disaster sites.

He continued, “Who just this past week arranged for one of his supporters to tell jokes about Black people eating watermelon and Puerto Rico being an island of garbage, right there on stage at Madison Square Garden. Do you think that’s somebody who’s going to look out for you?” Obama on Trump: Who cannot understand how an NBA superstar can be both Greek and Black… Who spreads ridiculous fantasies that Haitians are eating people’s pets.

CNN commentator Scott Jennings endorsed Donald Trump for president after previously blaming the former president for the Capitol riot. “President Donald Trump caused this insurrection with his lies and conspiracy theories about the election process being rigged against him,” Jennings wrote for CNN hours after the siege on Jan. 6, 2021. “Now, all Republicans have a duty to support the republic and the Constitution by condemning this terrorism, rallying around the peaceful transfer of power and our constitutional institutions,” he urged. That Jennings was almost nowhere to be found in his opinion piece for the Los Angeles Times on Friday. He offered a flaccid “I was none too pleased with Trump after Jan. 6, 2021” in the Times before declaring: “Today, millions of Republicans like me — who nearly upchucked a time or two on this crazy ride — are prepared to vote for him one more time as a bulwark against the cultural and governance excesses of the American left. Simply put, I’m more worried about the country’s future than any problems I’ve had with Trump in the past.” The official allegiance to the Republican nominee by Jennings, who worked for ex-President George W. Bush, isn’t exactly a shocker. His frequent role as a Trump apologist and conservative provocateur on CNN has made headlines of late. The next four years will change America forever.

Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount (and when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why). HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Fall and winter weather don’t have to mean packing up the grill until next spring. An indoor grill can be your cold-weather companion, firing up charred veggies and meats sans a hint of smoke right on your kitchen counter. We found one by Ninja currently on sale that one reviewer raves is “one of the best purchases I’ve ever made for kitchen use.” It doesn’t just char foods; the six-in-one functions also let you air fry, roast, bake, broil and dehydrate as needed. The grill also has a thermometer to take the guesswork out of meat prepping and it heats up to 500°F. The price usually hovers around $280, but you can snag one today for only $170 for a limited time! This countertop appliance makes your kitchen feel like a backyard party, heating up to 500°F and using a combination of hot air and a steel grate for char-grilling foods. According to several reviewers, that smoky flavor is still present, whether you’re cooking meats or veggies, and the built-in thermometer is a nifty way to keep tabs on how everything’s going. One user raves that it’s great for cooking “effortless, perfectly grilled foods right in your kitchen.” They continue: “So far, I’ve used it for grilling steak, chicken, fish, and veggies and air frying potatoes, frozen fries, and frozen chicken strips and everything has turned out flavorful, moist, and cookbook-picture perfect.” The included grill grate, air fryer basket and drip pan are all dishwasher-safe for breezy clean-up, too, so there is no smoke or a messy kitchen. If you’re looking for a way to elevate your foods without leaving your warm, cozy home, consider grabbing this indoor grill while it’s on major discount. And read on to see what other reviewers are saying about this heavy-hitting Ninja. “This grill is so far one of the best purchases I’ve ever made for kitchen use. In the hands of a relatively experienced home cook (me) it’s a super tool. First of all, it makes side dishes extremely easy and fast to prepare. Most frozen casual bagged finger foods such as french fries, egg rolls, pizza rolls, chicken nuggets, et al come out of the air fry function both much faster and much more crisp than you can achieve in the oven even using wire racks. Self made side dishes such as roasted vegetables and potatoes likewise cook faster than any other appliance and with better color and crisper results. Grilling is a mixed bag. Generally, proteins such as burgers or whitefish filets finish with great marking and color fast, but you need to check the doneness diligently. Hot dogs and sausages are easy and superb on this grill. I was skeptical of the Foodi considering it excessively over engineered, but the main benefit it has over other methods is that all cooking or grilling is enclosed, so spattering of even messy foods is non existent. It also grills consistently and cleanly so I can get better results of small tender items such as fish than I can with a gas grill outdoors. I love that the control panel pretty much lets you do anything. Bypass preheating and changing time or temperature on the fly are all standard. You open the cover anytime you like to check on doneness. I will ding the Foodi on easy of cleanup of the appliance itself. The screen pops out for cleaning, but you’re on your own to clean the dried grease that builds up on the underside of the top lid. That’s the downside of the shielding of the rest of the kitchen from spatters. I consult Youtube videos to find out best ways to clean this thing. Overall, if you know cooking already, this grill can pretty much do anything in terms of dry heat cooking.” — Pepe the Programmer and More  “The Ninja DG551 Foodi Smart XL is an excellent all-in-one kitchen gadget. It grills, air fries, roasts, and more with impressive results. The Foodi Smart Thermometer ensures perfectly cooked meals every time, and the large capacity is perfect for family dinners. Cleanup is a breeze, and the multiple functions make it a versatile addition to any kitchen. Highly satisfied!” — sion Kim  “Omg, I am in love with this thing! I’ve used it almost daily since I got it. I’ve bought many “miracle” appliances in the past but none ever lived up to the hype and were quickly forgotten. I moved from a house where I grilled or used a cast iron grill pan on a gas stove almost daily. Now I have a glass top stove and can’t use cast iron and no grills allowed in the balcony. So far, I’ve used it for grilling steak, chicken, fish, and veggies and air frying potatoes, frozen fries, and frozen chicken strips and everything has turned out flavorful, moist, and cookbook-picture perfect. Honestly, the thermometer makes sure it’s perfect and the food turns out even better than my beloved grill (don’t tell Weber!). It almost feels like cheating somehow. The smoke alarm has gone off a couple of times, but only when I have the lid open and it’s stopped quickly. In a small apt practically everything sets off the alarm so I’m actually pretty impressed that it has only rarely activated it. I’m excited to try the other functions, like roasting and dehydrating. The grill, air fryer basket, and drip pan/roasting pan are very well made and dishwasher safe. They have been a total breeze to clean, which makes it even easier to use frequently. Bottom line: it’s not cheap, but absolutely worth every penny. Especially if you like grilled and air fried food, those functions alone make it absolutely with the cost and counter space. I’m not usually one to take pics of my food but I did take one of a cedar planked salmon and grilled Mexican street corn made on the ninja grill. Both were perfect with practically no effort and steaks and chicken were just as beautiful.” — Karen Calagna  “I bought this Ninja Foodie for the temp probe and adjustable final internal temperature. My first attempt was a 12oz ribeye that was cooked perfectly and looked like it was right out of my Weber grill. Cleanup is a breeze due to the nonstick grill insert and nonstick pan. The controls are easy to use and adjustments are simple. I’m sold on the versatility and features at a cost effective price.” — Ken S.  “I really enjoy this grill! I had never had an indoor grill or air fryer so this was all very new to me. I bought this in order to grill meats indoors without the odor and greasy mess on the stovetop or in the oven oven. This works unbelievably well on both counts! I set it up on the stovetop so it’s right under the exhaust hood and I never have any cooking odor in the house. There is very little grease in the pan/grill after cooking and none can escape to splatter all over the stovetop. The air fryer function is also terrific! I had never had this before but I really love it. The unit is very easy to clean too.

And, to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much, coz, I don’t mind, I don’t mind that,” Republican presidential nominee Trump told a rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania. The comment drew laughter from the audience. Trump, who was the subject of an assassination attempt at a rally in July, later complained about how the protective glass installed to ensure his safety meant he didn’t look great on TV.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. You don’t need a genealogy expert to undercover your familial past. The advent of at-home DNA tests has made ancestral deep-diving a little easier (for better and for worse), simply by mailing a saliva sample to a lab, waiting weeks for processing and viewing your genetic details online. If you’re interested in unlocking your past with a DNA test— one that reviewers say is “easy, fun and illuminating” and provides a “fun, educational experience” — Amazon has an incredible deal on an AncestryDNA test. Normally $99, you can grab one today on sale for just $40, so jump on this deal before the price shoots back up. This AncestryDNA kit aims to detail a person’s origins from 2,600 global regions and reviewers say it’s super simple to use. Once you purchase the kit, you can activate it online and submit your spit sample with the included prepaid mailing kit. After six to eight weeks — though some user reviews say results may come faster than that — you’ll receive an interactive report with details on your ethnicity and geographic origins, as well as your ever-expanding family tree full of other users who’ve used AncestryDNA in the past. These kits have helped people find their parents, discover distant relatives and better understand their ancestors. “This DNA test brought us a lot closer to our family” says user Michael Haller. “So many doors have opened up to me, to our family, with the critical help of the results through this DNA kit. Literally, generations of our family have been revealed, hooked together, and opened communication pathways among the living relatives that we didn’t even know we had or existed.” Of course, sharing your DNA comes with privacy risks, but if you find your familial curiosity too much to resist, then this under-$40 AncestryDNA test may be too good of a deal to pass up. You might also be comforted by the brand’s overall privacy approach found on the Ancestry website. “I did Ancestry after doing 23 and me. Ancestry has a lot more information about my family’s history and seemed more accurate. The $30 monthly membership to have access to the records is prohibitive, so I will be canceling after the 3 month free trial. I did learn a lot of family history, though. If it was something I could afford, I would keep it.” — Donald Dunlop  “Some of the results were expected, some were new and surprising but all of it has been interesting and fun to share with family and friends. The ethnic diversity within our own family, especially between siblings has been most fascinating. We inherit traits from a genetic grab bag of sorts from each of our parents and this can lead to a myriad of unexpected combinations. This grab bag is complex and fascinating, with much that scientists can not fully explain. I did not expect Ancestry to unravel all of these mysteries with a mail-in saliva test.” — Terri  “As a result of Ancestry DNA kit, my twin nieces found our family. This includes a great niece and nephew. My Dad, Uncle and sister previously submitted their own Ancestry DNA tests. Since then my Dad and sister have died as did my Mother. It was a profound loss. Having the twins find us encouraged me to submit my DNA as well. The twins now have a family and connection that was denied them for 38 years. We have some catching up to do, but they are us. When I met one twin, who lives 30 miles away, I hugged her and it was like giving my sister a hug. After sadness and grief, my heart was filled with joy and happiness. Do I recommend this product? Absolutely, positively yes!” — J Kennedy  “It’s hard to find words and where to begin, but as a child you have no options to ask your parents about a WHY or WHEN ...and you hope that one day in the future , you do find your answers !!..Things were kept as Secrets and nobody ever spoke about our Families past , but now I do understand the WHY !!..There are still many more unanswered questions and the WHEN will maybe never been discovered, plus another new question of HOW just popped up in my mind !?...but for now , I feel much more confident when I talk about my heritage!!..I am very excited and proud of my grandparents ❤️ how they did managed their survival within a very hard time , with 2 young girls in their ‘luggage’, where one was later my mother !!!...Thanks to ANCESTRY for helping me now to understand the WHY and WHEN and hopefully one day I will be able to discover the HOW 🤔 My journey just started today , but my answers are now laying in front of me !!!...Thanks to everyone from the ANCESTRY TEAM for helping me , to understand now many situations in my childhood , but I never received the ANSWERS for !!!..God bless you all 🙏😇🥰” — barbara Edenf.  “I was adopted at birth so I had been been searching for family for years. I took this test for my birth “father’s” family to prove the man my birth mother told me was my father 20+ years ago (my brother’s father) was my biological dad. After testing I matched NONE of the family members tested but matched an entirely different family close enough for a first cousin/sibling match. Of course I matched my own children and my birth mom’s family. She was just mistaken about my father but she has passed away so I can no longer ask her as has my father also . I only have one of his brothers that will talk to me. I am 58 yrs old and still never got to have a father 🥺 but glad I know the truth. Thank you Ancestry.

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) on Sunday urged for appropriate coverage of what he called Donald Trump’s “thermonuclear meltdown” in the final leg of the 2024 presidential race. “I sure hope no one on social media or in the traditional media sugarcoats the thermonuclear meltdown Trump is having,” Schatz posted on X, formerly Twitter. “He’s indulging in a fair amount of violent talk, paranoid fantasies, and promises of retribution. Please no ‘candidates trade barbs in final hours.’” I sure hope no one on social media or in the traditional media sugarcoats the thermonuclear meltdown Trump is having. He’s indulging in a fair amount of violent talk, paranoid fantasies, and promises of retribution. Please no “candidates trade barbs in final hours.” In the last stretch of the campaign, the Republican nominee has continued to derail off message, after increasingly erratic rhetoric and behavior in recent weeks led hundreds of health care professionals to warn the 78-year-old is “concerningly short of any standard of fitness for office.” The former president has imagined former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) being gunned down, warned that the start of a second Trump administration may be “nasty,” and signaled he will put an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist in charge of government health agencies. On Sunday, he said he “shouldn’t have left” the White House in 2021 after he lost the election. A day earlier, he suggested he’d like to “knock the hell out of people backstage” when his microphone stopped working at a rally, before performing a bobbing gesture on the mic stand that many viewed as an imitation of oral sex. Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has had a more typical finale to the race, pitching an optimistic closing message to voters in Michigan over the weekend.

Here is the Trump video that ran during NASCAR and also during NBC’s Sunday Night Football postgame show as part of the equal time provision, given that Kamala Harris appeared on SNL. pic.twitter.com/7I1eRs1hr0 Brendan Carr, a Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, issued a public complaint on X this weekend after reports first emerged that Harris would drop in on the iconic show with just days to go until the presidential election. The skit saw the vice president give a pep talk to comedian Maya Rudolph — who has been playing her for weeks — and make some jokes about Trump’s recent campaign stop inside a garbage truck. “This is a clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC’s Equal Time rule,” Carr wrote on X. “The purpose of the rule is to avoid exactly this type of biased and partisan conduct — a licensed broadcaster using the public airwaves to exert its influence for one candidate on the eve of an election.” NBC later filed an Equal Time Notice with the FCC on Sunday noting Harris appeared on SNL “without charge” for a total of a minute and 30 seconds. Doing so allows other campaigns to request equal access to its airwaves. Trump’s minute-long video message was aired as NBC broadcast a NASCAR event on Sunday and was played again during the network’s “Sunday Night Football” coverage for a total of two minutes of airtime. Update: NBC stations ARE providing Trump with equal time, per the FCC's regulations, in the wake of the Harris cameo on ""SNL"" last night.

(Unless, of course, you’re all politically like-minded — in which case, lucky you.) Now more than ever, Americans are subscribing to a kind of political tribalism, sticking close to those who think like them and sneering at those who don’t. But what about your actual tribe ― your family? How are you supposed to stay civil and above the fray when you can’t believe they’re voting for “that guy”? To help you get through the election results without becoming estranged, we asked marriage and family therapists what they do when a family member draws them into a political argument. Here’s what they said. At one recent family gathering, marriage and family therapist Sean Davis and his wife were the lone Californians in the room. Seemingly out of nowhere, Davis said a family member went for the jugular, asking the couple, “How do you guys feel about the fact that everybody else in the country thinks Californians are stupid?” “I had to process the ignorance of such a blanket statement, but my wife handled it deftly,” said Davis, who’s also a professor at Alliant International University. “She told him, ‘Californians don’t think about the rest of the country’ and left it at that.” Her mic drop moment admittedly felt great, he said, and did defuse the situation while maintaining their dignity, but “matching snark with snark has rarely worked outside of that situation,” he said. “Tell yourself that it’s OK that everyone has their own opinions, even if they’re completely different than your own. Remind yourself that you don’t have to change anyone’s minds, it’s not your job.” Davis said he usually prefers to be clear and direct about what he believes and why when talking politics. To that end, he uses nonconfrontational “I” statements. “I use phrases such as, ‘As I see it…,’ ‘To me…,’ ‘I see it differently…’” he explained. “I make sure to validate: I let the other person know I heard her even if I disagree with what they said.” That conversational trick has helped him avoid intense arguments with his sister, whom he describes as a Fox News-watching, Rush Limbaugh-loving conservative. (Davis himself is a centrist.) Even just saying, “I understand you see it that way. I see it this way ...” can shape the conversation for the better, he said. Davis also tries to remind himself that he and his sister have had very different adult life experiences; had he lived her life, he may have the same political ideologies. “Basically, I try to focus on understanding the life experiences that have led her to her beliefs more than the beliefs themselves, then I share my life experiences that have led me to my beliefs,” he said. “It’s been much easier for me to have compassion and understanding when focusing on understanding her context rather than arguing her beliefs. The latter gets you nowhere and always damages the relationship.” If your family members are open to having a conversation, ask yourself what is realistic to hope for during and at the end of that conversation, said Jesse Kahn, director and sex therapist at The Gender & Sexuality Therapy Center in New York City. “You may not radically change or impact anyone in a single conversation, so are you OK with just laying the groundwork?” he said. “Are you OK with having multiple conversations? Can you provide some insight or resources that helped you grow as your politics were changing, and allow your family the time to explore them as you did?” If you’ve been the political lone wolf or black sheep in your family your whole life ― say, the sole liberal in an ultra-conservative family ― any family gathering can be anxiety-inducing (or eye-roll-inducing, depending on how you see it). There’s always that one relative who’ll reliably prod you on the political news of the day. That’s always been the case for Deborah Duley, a psychotherapist and founder of Empowered Connections in Maryland. “For me, it was always my dad who was a die-hard conservative and not open and accepting at all,” she said. “I’m the opposite as a feminist, women’s rights and LGBTQ+ rights activist. It was Groundhog Day every time I had to share the same space with him.” The arguments ended when Duley matured and opted to take a different tack with her dad: At family get-togethers, she’d completely ignore the barbs and missiles he’d send her way. Now, that’s the advice she gives to clients who are tired of political taunts from family. “You have to take a step back, or away, and then take some deep breaths,” she said. “Tell yourself that it’s OK that everyone has their own opinions, even if they’re completely different than your own. Remind yourself that you don’t have to change anyone’s minds, it’s not your job.” Ibinye Osibodu-Onyali, a marriage and family therapist in Murrieta, California, doesn’t consider herself a political black sheep in her family, more of a “rebel without a cause.” “Within my family, I am probably the most liberal and outspoken,” she said. “I speak up regularly about social justice issues and prejudice: I often have conversations with my family about protecting the rights of people who are often on the fringes of society, including individuals who struggle with substance use, those who are currently incarcerated or have come out from incarceration, and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.” Through the years, Osibodu-Onyali has learned not to let the tenor of these conversations get too heated. “The way I see it, it’s my job to educate and listen, not argue,” she said. If she’s on a phone call with a family member who doesn’t understand her beliefs on social justice issues, she tries to reset the conversation: “What are your thoughts on the subject? And what experiences led you there?” “When I feel myself getting triggered during a conversation, I remind myself to take a deep breath and try to understand the other person’s point of view,” she said. “If I want to be seen or heard, I also have to see and hear others. This is how true dialogue begins.” Unless your family member has some truly toxic views, the goal of these conversations should be to get your point across all while maintaining the relationship, Davis said. “When I get into arguments with my sister, I try to communicate through body language and I-statements so that I can hold our discordant beliefs and our relationship at the same time,” he said. “She then usually follows my lead, since we both value the relationship.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anti-aging-skin-care-amazon-ud_l_6723d323e4b0871068fe9bca","These Are Some Of The Best Anti-Aging Skin Care Products At Amazon","lourdes avila uribe","2024-11-04","When it comes to skin care, everyone has different needs and priorities. The words “anti-aging” can be polarizing these days, but it is really just a catch-all term for products with active ingredients that improve the overall health and appearance of the skin — and everyone could use that, regardless of age or beauty goals. Finding the best anti-aging products used to mean scouring department stores and roaming around Sephora like a wolf stalking prey, but now it’s as easy as heading over to Amazon and shopping from the comfort of your couch. High-end and cult-favorite brands are no longer relegated to specialty beauty retailers; even luxury beauty brands can be found at Amazon. Not only has it made it easier and more convenient to shop for products, but it’s democratized the process. It is, however, always imperative to make sure you’re purchasing items from a brand’s actual Amazon storefront to avoid being scammed into fake products. (Brands are sometimes legitimately available through third-party sellers, but you’ll want to check reader reviews and ratings to ensure that they’re reliable.) Below, we’ve rounded up many of Amazon’s most highly-rated anti-aging skin care products. They include must-have effective ingredients like vitamin C, retinol, peptides, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and more. They’re reviewer-beloved and sure to enhance your repertoire. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Rating: 4.6 out of 5 stars For many, retinoids are an essential skin care ingredient for promoting the skin's cellular turnover rate, a process that's important for collagen production and declines as we age. This 0.5% retinol oil-like serum from The Ordinary is balanced with squalane. Squalane is a nourishing ingredient with anti-inflammatory properties that can help enhance surface-level hydration. Promising review: ""I have heard many good things about this company and the product retinol. I just received it and have used it. It's recommended to start using only twice a week. And work up, so there's no irritation supposed to be very good for your face. I'm adding this line forward now. I have been continuing to use it and have noticed a very noticeable difference. I'm a 58-year-old guy who likes to take care of his skin. Retinol, it's great.I've heard about it for years, but never really did any research. I've been using a lot of amino peptides, pretty good, but this seems to be much better for life wrinkles. I'd say give it a try. I'm very satisfied. I've had it for close to a month. I'm guessing started out twice a week.I use it about four times a week now."" — Jim gourley Rating: 4.4 out of 5 starsAnti-aging skin care doesn't stop at the neck; you can utilize powerful ingredients on the rest of your body as well. This incredibly popular crepe-correcting body lotion has a super-nourishing formula with powerful botanicals, anti-oxidants and omega fatty acids that can help to reduce the look of crepey, thin skin. Promising review: ""Pleasantly surprised. Really didn't think this would work. I have been applying everyday for five days and have noticed an improvement in my skin. 100% recommend, don't spend the money on the expensive products!"" — Jill Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars Any dermatologist will tell you that regularly incorporating a good SPF into your skin care routine is vital for preventing premature skin aging. Supergoop is a beloved name in sunscreen and this glow-inducing formula is available in four flexible shades and contains hyaluronic acid for hydration, vitamin B5 and antioxidant-rich niacinamide to help ward off those pesky environmental factors that contribute to signs of aging. Plus, it provides a dewy, pearlescent base for makeup application. Promising review: ""Young people, pay no attention to the old lady about to speak. You're good for now. Older ladies - as we age, we get those pesky lines around the mouth, eyes, and forehead. And probably like me you're noticing that foundation settles into EVERYTHING, making you look like a dehydrated Yoda. Supergoop Glowscreen not only has the SPF that our doctors are always harping about, but it gives your skin this all-over dewy sheen that makes you look younger and blurs the lines. I haven't worn foundation in months. It's this, mascara, lip gloss, done. It's pricey but so is a facelift, Grogu."" — Rebecca Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars Not only is this hyaluronic acid- and peptide-infused eye cream great for reducing the look of common issues like fine lines and wrinkles, dark circles and dryness, but it also serves as a base for makeup.Promising review: ""This eye cream lives up to its name! Hydrates the under eye area very well. It’s a creamy texture, is absorbed well and doesn’t sit on top of the skin. It is not greasy. I am 56, I have dry skin and I was afraid this would not be hydrating enough for me; but this is a wonderful, hydrating eye cream."" — Shannon Phillips Amazon rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars This powerful 2% BHA salicylic acid exfoliant is beloved by skin care obsessives. It helps to clear skin and unclog pores by gently sloughing away dead skin to reveal the texture-free glow hiding underneath. It's especially great for those with acne-prone skin or who want a smoother, brighter complexion.Promising review: ""I hardly use many products on my face. But lately I have been testing with new things as I am entering my 30's. Ordered the small bottle. I highly recommend. I have seem overall improvement with the texture and coloration of my skin after using the product for two weeks now. My dark spots are diminishing. I still have plenty of product to use, and it makes my face feels so good and soft. I highly recommend. Will be ordering the large bottle next time."" — Kayla Rating: 4.6 out of 5 stars It's no secret that Sol De Janeiro's original Bum Bum cream is a long-standing cult favorite product that people have been slathering themselves with instead of using traditional perfume or body sprays. Shopping writer Tessa Flores said she recently tried the Beija Flor Elasti-Cream, one of Sol De Janeiro's more recent formulations, and has been obsessed with it for the past couple of months. Here's what Flores had to say: ""Not only is the long-lasting fragrance absolutely incredible — think a clean-smelling cotton candy that's also slightly floral but not overly sweet — but the texture is perfectly rich and soaks deep into the skin and leaves my skin feeling genuinely luxurious. It features skin-plumping collagen and a unique retinol alternative, which is a derm-approved skin care ingredient that can increase the cellular turnover rate and reveal younger and firmer skin.""  Promising reviews: ""I am in love with this cream! Wow! I’ve bought and used the bum-bum cream but this is so much better! The scent will last until you shower and re-apply even if it’s 2 days! Skin is hydrated and looks so much younger! I use it all over. Treat yourself with this cream."" — Grace k. ""Helps reduce the crepey look of skin. Really thick, smells good. Doesn’t feel greasy. Absorbs good after rubbing in."" —Amazon customer Rating: 4.6 out of 5 starsGreat for most skin types, retinol beginners and those with sensitive skin, CeraVe's offering includes an encapsulated, time-released retinol along with moisturizing, skin-repairing ingredients like ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid. It has a gentle-yet-effective formula that can help smooth and brighten skin.Promising review: ""Feels nice going on, smooth. I was surprised at the nearly immediate positive result. My skin looks brighter, less tired. I’d never tried a retinol product, but at 67 and showing the effects of aging and life in general on my face, I am glad I did! I don’t wear make up, preferring a natural look. I have been applying it morning and night for a few days and the positive effect is pretty obvious."" — Susan E. Bickford Rating: 4.6 out of 5 starsIf you have dry skin, then you definitely want to check out this facial moisturizer. It's supercharged with nourishing ingredients like ceramides that promise to lock in hydration, and niacinamide that can hydrate, smooth and brighten the complexion. It's beautifully rich without being greasy. Promising review: ""This is the best face moisturizer that I have ever used! I am not a fan of super oily greasy moisturizers and love that this is not like that, but it still keeps my face moisturized. A little goes a long way, so it lasts a long time and it makes my face so soft and makes it look so healthy. Totally recommend it. 10/10"" — Rocio Jimenez Rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars For a concentrated dose of hydration and a quick fix for those dryness-related fine lines, this Neutrogena Hydro Boost single-use mask can come in handy. The hydrogel mask is drenched in the same formula as the brand's iconic gel cream and features hyaluronic acid, a well-known humectant that draws moisture into the skin and leaves it feeling supple. Promising reviews: ""This mask is fun to use and actually makes a difference with fine lines and wrinkles."" — KatMo ""Love this mask. Ultra moisturizing. Fine line smoothing. Favorite mask."" — Lynn Mazeika Rating: 4.6 out of 5 stars Formulated with peptides, hyaluronic acid and ceramides, this CeraVe cream can help deeply hydrate the skin while helping to renew the skin’s natural barrier overnight. It's ideal for dry winter months or for anyone who battles dry skin year-round. And the price point can't be beaten.Promising review: ""I bought this based on a recommendation by a dermatologist. This was a budget buy due to its price point. I have dry, mature fair skin. I am really particular with the creams I put on my face. I can tell in 5 minutes if something is going to be hydrating enough for my skin. This CeraVe cream is a winner when it comes to moisturizing and hydrating your skin. It also has working benefits in it like peptide complex, niacinamide and ceramides. These all work for your skin. It is very hydrating, so I use it mainly at night. It has no fragrant smell. It does its job and is a good night cream. You will feel the difference."" — Michelle S. Rating: 4.6 out of 5 starsLike so many, I ride hard for Luna night oil. If you’ve been on the fence about trying an oil or retinoid, then this is the perfect place to start. Soothing botanicals like blue tansy and German chamomile are paired with an advanced retinoid ester that supports skin health and elasticity, evens out redness and fights fine lines and wrinkles. Avocado seed oil plumps up the skin and delivers a healthy dose of antioxidants. It doesn’t clog my pores, which is perfect if you are acne-prone like me.Promising review: ""I bought this based on reviews when Amazon had a promo, having tried some Sunday Riley products in the past. I am 55 and I am hooked. Nothing eases my lines, reduces inflammation, and diminishes my dark spots like this product."" — Deborah Wilson Rating: 4.6 out of 5 stars First Aid Beauty's facial radiance pads are packed with lactic and glycolic acids — two types of chemical exfoliants that skin care experts have previously told HuffPost can fade hyperpigmentation, refine skin texture and reduce fine lines by improving collagen production. The removal of dead skin cells through exfoliation can even make your other skin care products penetrate better. These compostable pads make it easy to apply this important anti-aging ingredient and are also enriched with soothing cucumber water and lemon peel. Promising reviews: ""Amazing, effective product! Your skin will look and feel 10 years younger after 1 month of use!"" — Its A Mystery ""Great product. Doesn't dry out your skin but keeps it smooth and literally makes you look younger!!"" — L. Michelle Cox ""In my late 50's and I use this every night! It's keeping my skin brighter and helps with my aging process!~ Love this product and I've used MANY for anti-aging. This is one that I never run out of!"" — Sandy Rating: 4.3 out of 5 starsWhile Seoul Ceuticals is a lesser-known brand than Cosrx, their incredibly popular moisturizer also harnesses the power of snail mucin. It contains a 97.5% concentration of snail mucin, which the brand claims is one of the highest available, and also boasts rich, powerful emollients that can help to boost hydration. It can also help to brighten and improve the look of skin, reducing dullness and the appearance of lines and wrinkles. Note: Clip the coupon for an added discount at checkout. Promising review: ""After trying many many other thicker heavier moisturizers for my 64 year old skin, this is the only one that works. I’ve been using tretinoin for almost two years and it’s been very harsh on my skin - until I found this cream! No stinging, no redness, no peeling skin, no pilling under sunscreen, no shine, and no clogged pores. I just hope they keep making it!"" — Lisa A. Newman Rating: 4.6 out of 5Find out why this serum has cult-like status and is probably one of the best-known products in Korean beauty. It's a skin-softening serum that contains concentrated snail secretion said to help improve damaged skin barriers, offer deep hydration and even promote wound healing. The formula also contains allantoin, which can be great for soothing inflammation and irritation. Even if you're feeling skeptical, it's worth a look — you just might be convinced.Promising review: ""This is such a lightweight and silky formula. There is no left over greasiness or stickiness left on the skin. It does not leave my skin oily or caked. It makes my skin so soft and glowy. My pore size has gone down and the texture of my skin has improved dramatically. I'm in my 40s, this has improved my appearance and confidence. I will recommend this over and over again. The thought of snail mucus may weird you out, but it doesn't have a smell, it's not as uncomfortable as you think. Let's be honest ladies. We've had stuff for worse on our face as mothers. This is perfect for any age, and worth the buy!!"" — Honey Rating: 4.4 out of 5 starsA classic drugstore staple, Roc's hydrating cream with glycerin works overnight and combines retinol and glycolic acid to resurface dull, dry skin and enhance collagen production to improve texture.Promising review: ""I've been using this for years and swear by it. I absolutely believe that my 73 yr. old face looks 10 yrs. younger because of the amount of retinol that is its main ingredient. It's not greasy and immediately absorbs into my skin."" — Akr Rating: 4.5 out of 5 starsThis NatureWell face, body and hands moisturizer uses advanced micro-encapsulated retinol to help improve skin tone, smoothing texture and boosting firmness and elasticity. The pump dispenser conveniently delivers the right amount so you don't worry about wasting product and helps to lengthen the cream's product life. It's incredibly popular on Amazon and is also incredibly affordable in comparison to other body products with retinol. Note: Clip the coupon for an added discount at checkout. Promising review: ""I wish I would have taken a before picture of my [creepy] skin to show how this product has improved my skin’s texture and firmness. The first few days, this product was comparable to other moisturizers as it did a good job moisturizing. But within a few weeks, I noticed a big improvement. I just ordered my second container, and am extremely pleased. It does have a rose scent, but I am used to it now."" — Tina S. Rating: 4.4 out of 5 starsPeople swoon over the LilyAna Naturals eye cream, but this retinol-powered facial moisturizer is even more highly rated. Get all the benefits of retinol, like reducing typical signs of aging and smoothing skin, while the potent hyaluronic blend can help keep skin soft, supple and hydrated. You really can't beat the price.Promising review: ""I have been using this retinol cream for the past year, and I absolutely love it. I see a huge difference in my skin from using this product. It looks softer and more hydrated, and my lines and wrinkles are not as deep. I love the natural ingredients used and feel great about supporting a cruelty-free, family-owned small business. And the stuff really works!"" — Kat Rating: 4.3 out of 5 stars Vitamin C is a very popular ingredient, and for good reason. It's an easy way to deliver anti-aging goodness straight to the skin on a daily basis.

It can help to plump up skin and make it look and feel youthful and vibrant.Promising review: ""I’m just now finishing my 1st bottle. It Lasted over 4 months.

This no-hand massage sling — which you may already be familiar with if you're anywhere on TikTok— offers both gentle heat and four modes of bidirectional kneading massage along with two loops for resting hands and creating resistance.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. There seems to be a tradeoff in many lip products: Buy an actually affordable product that provides color but no hydration, or pay two or three times that amount for pigment and moisture, and let your wallet suffer. Julep’s two-in-one lip balm lipstick is coveted by thousands of Amazon reviewers for being that ‘best of both worlds’ Goldilocks option. Folks say it’s an excellent swap for more expensive lip products like the Clinique chubby sticks — and for expensive holy grails from MAC and Urban Decay that have since been discontinued. Loyalists say the lippie is an “extraordinary find” that’s best described as “lipstick with moisturizer,” with the rich color and satin-y finish of lipstick and the “luscious” hydration of a good lip balm. The crayon’s impressive hydration is due to its vitamin E and sunflower butter-infused core, which conditions lips with antioxidants and fatty acids. The result feels like “a drink of water for your lips” that applies “smooth as silk” without feeling sticky or waxy. “I’m a chapstick addict who hates the feel of lipstick,” writes one reviewer S. McBrayer. “This is much softer and exactly what I wanted!” The lipstick-lip balm hybrid is essentially foolproof, folks say, the kind of product you can swipe on without a mirror and trust it looks good. And, it’ll still look good as the day goes on: It fades into a nice tint that’s like ”[your] lips but better,” according to reviewers, without bleeding or any weird lines. That’s part of why one person deemed it their apocalypse beauty pick: “If I had to pick only one lip color to bring with me on a desert island — or go on vacation, or to work, or for a Zoom call — currently, I’d pick this one.” And, for folks with chronically dry lips, including as a result of hard-earned age, the Julep lippie “is a great answer,” providing nourishment and color without feeling heavy or overdone. “I’m older and it has just the right amount of tint and the moisturizer has reduced the flakiness and lines on my lips,” writes a reviewer named Wanda. “I’m almost 50 and love that it feels like chapstick [and] moisturizes,” says another, Colleen, adding that her daughter wanted in on the secret, too: “My 21 year old daughter loves it and bought some for herself, then her roommate did too.” The Julep lippie comes in tons of colors and shades, offering “a shade for every event or outfit,” from statement-making red and plum hues to subtler neutrals and multi-packs that include both. Its unique iridescent shade offers a pearly shimmer that you can layer under or over your other favorites. For heavy-hitter favorites at a glance, reviewers with medium to deep skin tones enjoyed Julep’s rich plum and sweet sangria shades, while reviewers with fairer skin tones swore by vintage mauve, dusty orchid shimmer and canyon rose. Brandy wine and cherry wood crème were also popular among users. Right now, you can snag a buy one, get one free deal with a qualifying purchase of another balm or one of Julep’s eyeshadow sticks or gel eyeliner pencils. “This balm is so perfect. I love the color but the most important thing is that is that it feels soft and it doesn’t bleed and just makes my lips feel very nice. I’m 65 and my lips get dry easy so I have to always have some kind of lipstick or lipgloss but I don’t really want to have heavy lipstick anymore. This is definitely the best thing I found. Definitely will be getting different shades.” — boricua “I have a hard time finding a tinted balm that looks ’natural, only better’. This one is perfect and helps my aging lips look more youthful.” — Kure Beach “Smooth like butter! It really is! It glides on so smoothly and feels really light and moisturizing. It’s not sticky at all! Love the way it feels. I got the Shimmer Dusty Orchid and it’s the perfect natural shade for me. Giving my lips but better. Great product for hydrating your lips and creating a natural look.” — Linh Hoang “I’m a senior and lipstick can look like too ‘demanding’ on me...This seems to be a great answer to the issue. Love the ‘Vintage Mauve’. If you’re ‘mature’ you should give it a shot. Surprisingly flattering.” — Tricia “I will buy this over and over again! It is the perfect shade , glides on well and is just a bit of color you need without it being overdone!

McKissic, a controversial pastor who once suggested that Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans to “punish” it for abortion clinics and its LGBTQ-friendly Southern Decadence event, has previously taken to social media to declare that he’s “horrified at the thought” of Trump returning to the White House. In his MSNBC op-ed, he noted that “many circles” believe evangelical Christians should vote for Republicans. He added that his values aren’t aligned with Democrats who have backed LGBTQ rights, same-sex marriage and abortion rights. McKissic then pointed to a recent social media post where he revealed that he was “voting for character” in this year’s election instead of supporting the nominee of a party whose platform previously “made sense” to him. “The party I knew and loved would have never chosen as its nominee the adulterous, childish, habitually lying and criminally convicted Donald Trump,” wrote the pastor, who backed Hillary Clinton over the former president in 2016. I’m voting for character, as in someone who would not instigate, finance, participate in, or even attend, a gathering such as the Jan 6 insurrection, against the USA, led & financed by Donald J. Trump.I’m voting for competence, as in someone who would gladly accept credible… The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/moldova-presidential-runoff-result_n_67289fd8e4b05debb72b37d6","Moldova's Pro-Western President Defeats Russian-Friendly Rival In Runoff Election","stephen mc grath , vadim ghirda","2024-11-04","CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldova’s pro-Western President Maia Sandu has won a second term in a pivotal presidential runoff against a Russia-friendly opponent, in a race that was overshadowed by claims of Russian interference, voter fraud, and intimidation in the European Union candidate country. With nearly 99% of votes counted in the second round of the presidential election held Sunday, Sandu had 55% of the vote, according to the Central Electoral Commission, or CEC, compared to 45% for Alexandr Stoianoglo, a former prosecutor general who was backed by the pro-Russia Party of Socialists. The result will be a major relief for the pro-Western government, which strongly backed Sandu’s candidacy, and her push for closer Western ties on Moldova’s path toward the EU. “Moldova, you are victorious! Today, dear Moldovans, you have given a lesson in democracy, worthy of being written in history books. Today, you have saved Moldova!” Sandu said after claiming victory after midnight. She went on to claim that her country’s vote had faced an “unprecedented attack” through alleged schemes including dirty money, vote-buying, and electoral interference “by hostile forces from outside the country” and criminal groups. “You have shown that nothing can stand in the way of the people’s power when they choose to speak through their vote,” she added. Speaking before the final vote count, Stoianoglo told the media that “everyone’s voice deserves respect” and that he hopes “from now on, we will put an end to the hatred and division imposed on us.” It isn’t clear if he has publicly commented on his electoral defeat. When polls closed locally at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT), turnout stood at more than 1.68 million people — about 54% of eligible voters, according to the CEC. Moldova’s large diaspora, which cast ballots in record numbers of more than 325,000 voted, heavily in favor of Sandu in the runoff. In the first round held Oct. 20, Sandu obtained 42% of the ballot but failed to win an outright majority over the second place Stoianoglo. The presidential role carries significant powers in areas such as foreign policy and national security and has a four-year term. European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Sandu on her victory, by writing on X: “It takes a rare kind of strength to overcome the challenges you’ve faced in this election.” Moldova’s diaspora played a key role in the presidential vote and in a nationwide referendum held on Oct. 20, when a narrow majority of 50.35% voted to secure Moldova’s path toward EU membership. But the results of the ballots including Sunday’s vote were overshadowed by allegations of a major vote-buying scheme and voter intimidation. Instead of winning the overwhelming support that Sandu had hoped, the results in both races exposed Moldova’s judiciary as unable to adequately protect the democratic process. On Sunday, Moldovan police said they had “reasonable evidence” of organized transportation of voters — illegal under the country’s electoral code — to polling stations from within the country and from overseas, and are “investigating and registering evidence in connection with air transport activities from Russia to Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey.” “Such measures are taken to protect the integrity of the electoral process and to ensure that every citizen’s vote is cast freely without undue pressure or influence,” police said. Moldova’s foreign ministry said on Sunday afternoon that polling stations in Frankfurt, Germany, and Liverpool and Northampton in the U.K. had been targeted by false bomb threats, which “intended only to stop the voting process.” Stanislav Secrieru, the president’s national security adviser, wrote on X: “We are seeing massive interference by Russia in our electoral process,” which he warned had a “high potential to distort the outcome” of the vote. Secrieru later added that the national voter record systems were being targeted by “ongoing coordinated cyberattacks” to disrupt links between domestic polling stations and those abroad, and that cybersecurity teams were “working to counter these threats and ensure system continuity.” Moldova’s Prime Minister Dorin Recean said that people throughout the country had received “anonymous death threats via phone calls” in what he called “an extreme attack” to scare voters in the former Soviet republic, which has a population of about 2.5 million people. After casting her ballot in Chisinau, Sandu told reporters: “Thieves want to buy our vote, thieves want to buy our country, but the power of the people is infinitely greater.” Outside a polling station in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, 20-year-old medical student Silviana Zestrea said the runoff would be a “definitive step” toward Moldova’s future. “People need to understand that we have to choose a true candidate that will fulfill our expectations,” she said. “Because I think even if we are a diaspora now, none of us actually wanted to leave.” In the wake of the two October votes, Moldovan law enforcement said that a vote-buying scheme was orchestrated by Ilan Shor, an exiled oligarch who lives in Russia and was convicted in absentia last year of fraud and money laundering. Shor denies any wrongdoing. Prosecutors say $39 million was paid to more than 130,000 recipients through an internationally sanctioned Russian bank to voters between September and October. Anti-corruption authorities have conducted hundreds of searches and seized over $2.7 million (2.5 million euros) in cash as they attempt to crack down. In one case in Gagauzia, an autonomous part of Moldova where only 5% voted in favor of the EU, a physician was detained after allegedly coercing 25 residents of a home for older adults to vote for a candidate they did not choose. Police said they obtained “conclusive evidence,” including financial transfers from the same Russian bank. On Saturday, at a church in Comrat, the capital of Gagauzia, Father Vasilii told The Associated Press that he had urged people to go and vote because it’s a “civic obligation” and that they do not name any candidates. “We use the goods the country offers us — light, gas,” he said. “Whether we like what the government does or not, we must go and vote. ... The church always prays for peace.” On Thursday, prosecutors raided a political party headquarters and said 12 people were suspected of paying voters to select a candidate in the presidential race. A criminal case was also opened in which 40 state agency employees were suspected of taking electoral bribes. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, told AP that whatever the outcome of the second round, it “will not deflate” geopolitical tensions. “On the contrary, I expect geopolitical polarization to be amplified by the campaign for the 2025 legislative elections.” Moldovan law enforcement needs more resources and better-trained staff working at a faster pace to tackle voter fraud, he added, to “create an environment in which anyone tempted to either buy or sell votes knows there will be clear and fast consequences.” Savlina Adasan, a 21-year-old economics student in Bucharest, said she voted for Sandu and cited concerns about corruption and voters uninformed about the two candidates. “We want a European future for our country,” she said, adding that it offers “many opportunities, development for our country … and I feel like if the other candidate wins, then it means that we are going 10 steps back as a country.” A pro-Western government has been in power in Moldova since 2021, and a parliamentary election will be held in 2025. Moldova watchers warn that next year’s vote could be Moscow’s main target. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moldova applied to join the EU. It was granted candidate status in June of that year, and in summer 2024, Brussels agreed to start membership negotiations. The sharp westward shift irked Moscow and significantly soured relations with Chisinau. ___ McGrath reported from Bucharest, Romania.

Democrats are trying to understand and grapple with the reasons behind Harris’ decisive defeat. Trump will meet President Joe Biden at the White House this week to continue a tradition that Trump himself shunned in 2020. Republicans regained control of the Senate and leadership candidates are trying to express their devotion to Trump. Control of the House is still up in the air. Abortion rights, inflation, extremism, immigration and more — the stakes have never been higher. Catch up on critical 2024 election updates here. Read the latest updates on the election below. We've ended coverage on this liveblog but please go here to follow the latest politics updates. Trump made another personnel announcement on Tuesday, this time announcing Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are his picks to lead a “department” Trump says he plans to establish. “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies - Essential to the ‘Save America’ Movement,” Trump said in a statement. “It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time,” he continued. Trump said this new entity would be named the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE — a name Musk coined referencing the doge meme. In the statement, Trump says Musk and Ramaswamy will conclude their work by July 4, 2026, claiming “a smaller Government, with more efficiency and less bureaucracy, will be the perfect gift to America on the 250th Anniversary of The Declaration of Independence.” Trump said he will nominate former Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Texas) as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency when Trump is in office. Ratcliffe was previously the Director of National Intelligence from 2020 to 2021. “From exposing fake Russian collusion to be a Clinton campaign operation, to catching the FBI’s abuse of Civil Liberties at the FISA court, John Ratcliffe has always been a warrior for Truth and Honesty with the American Public,” Trump said in a statement announcing his pick. “I look forward to John being the first person ever to serve in both our Nation’s highest Intelligence positions,” Trump added. William Joseph McGinley will serve as Trump’s White House counsel, the president-elect announced. McGinley took part in the first Trump administration as White House Cabinet secretary between 2017 and 2019 after working on the 2016 Trump campaign. He also worked on Trump's most recent campaign. “Bill is a smart and tenacious lawyer who will help me advance our America First agenda while fighting for election integrity and against the weaponization of law enforcement,” Trump said in a statement. Steven Witkoff, a wealthy real estate CEO who owns Chicago’s iconic Woolworth Building, will serve as Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East. “Steve is a Highly Respected Leader in Business and Philanthropy, who has made every project and community he has been involved with stronger and more prosperous. Steve will be an unrelenting Voice for PEACE, and make us all proud,” the president-elect said in a statement. It is unclear what experience he has with diplomatic relations in the volatile region. Witkoff spoke at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally last month and at the final night of the Republican National Convention in July, where he humanized Trump, calling him “as kind and compassionate a man as I've ever met my lifetime."" He is also serving on Trump's inauguration committee. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R) nomination to serve as secretary of state would leave a vacant seat for Gov. Ron DeSantis to fill. Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) thinks Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, should get the pick. Britt told Axios she thinks Trump would “be a tremendous pick” because “she understands the America First agenda.” Donald Trump Jr. is joining a venture capital firm with an eye on investing in conservative companies rather than taking up a role in his father’s White House administration, according to multiple reports. Read more: With a four-month prison stint for contempt of Congress just weeks behind him, Donald Trump’s longtime ally and former strategist Steve Bannon was back in court on Monday. Bannon is set to go to trial on Dec. 9 in New York to face criminal charges that he bilked donors who sent cash to We Build The Wall, a fundraiser that claimed it was set up to fulfill Trump’s 2016 campaign promise of constructing a wall between the U.S. and Mexico border. According to ABC, Bannon’s defense lawyers asked the judge overseeing the Manhattan-based case on Tuesday to delay the start of the trial until January because the prosecution is still trying to introduce evidence for trial. New York Supreme Court Acting Justice April Newbauer, did not rule but scheduled an evidentiary hearing on Monday to determine the next steps. True to form for the far-right bloviator, as he was leaving the courtroom on Tuesday, Bannon remarked on the reelection of Trump to the White House, saying that the “people rendered their verdict on this lawfare last Tuesday” and that “the hunted are about to become the hunters.” Trump said he plans to nominate former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as the U.S. ambassador to Israel. “He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!” Trump said in a statement Tuesday. Huckabee in 2016 was rumored to have been under consideration by Trump to serve as ambassador to Israel, though Huckabee ultimately denied that claim. He did say that he and Trump discussed a cabinet or advisory role at the time. House Republican leaders on Tuesday suggested Trump not look to their ranks for any more picks for his White House Cabinet, acknowledging their cushion for votes will be narrow. “He’s already pulled a few really talented people out of the House. Hopefully, no more for a little while until special elections can come,” said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) at a Capitol Hill press conference. Read more: Trump has selected Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) as his national security advisor, praising his background as a Green Beret and Army veteran in a Tuesday statement. “Mike served in the Army Special Forces for 27 years where he was deployed multiple times in combat for which he was awarded four Bronze Stars, including two with Valor,” the statement read. “Mike retired as a Colonel, and is a nationally recognized leader in National Security, a bestselling author, and an expert on the threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, and global terrorism.” Waltz serves on the House Armed Services Committee, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Tuesday that the widespread voter fraud he’d warned about all year turned out not to be a problem in last week’s elections that Republicans happened to win. “I’m happy to report to you that because of all the emphasis we placed on that, and because of all the attention the American people put on it, that I think we were able to limit, to a high degree, the amount of fraud and irregularity and many of the things that concerned all Americans after 2020,” Johnson said in response to a question from HuffPost.

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for Secretary of State, calling Rubio a ""strong choice"" despite their political differences. “Unsurprisingly, the other team’s pick will have political differences than my own,” he said in a post on X. “That being said, my colleague [Sen. Marco Rubio] is a strong choice and I look forward to voting for his confirmation.” Rubio’s selection has not been officially confirmed or announced by Trump, though The New York Times and Reuters on Monday night reported that the appointment is expected.

New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan agreed with prosecutors and defense attorneys to allow more time to figure out whether the verdict should stand, given the unprecedented nature of the circumstances surrounding the case.Read more here: Trump's newly appointed “border czar” has doubled down on his hardline language, warning undocumented migrants: “We’re gonna come and find you.”Tom Homan, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during part of Trump’s first administration, had already told Democratic governors to “get the hell out of the way” soon after being tapped for the role on Monday by the president-elect.But he appeared to go further during an appearance with Fox News’ Sean Hannity later that night.Hannity proposed a “grace period” in which undocumented immigrants are allowed time to get their affairs in order and leave the country, and then eventually be allowed to apply to return to the U.S. legally.“Criminals and gang members get no grace period,” Homan replied. “While we’re out prioritizing the public safety threats and national security threats, if you wanna self-deport, you should self-deport because, again, we know who you are and we’re gonna come and find you.”He said criminals and gang members “get no favors from this administration” and “we’re coming for you.” And he added that he was “all for” people to “self-deport.” A judge is due to decide Tuesday whether to undo President-elect Donald Trump’s conviction in his hush money case because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. New York Judge Juan M. Merchan, who presided over Trump’s historic trial, is now tasked with deciding whether to toss out the jury verdict and order a new trial — or even dismiss the charges altogether. The judge’s ruling also could speak to whether the former and now future commander-in-chief will be sentenced as scheduled Nov. 26. Read more here: Donald Trump has picked South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to serve as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in his new administration, CNN reported, citing two sources familiar with the selection. With the pick, Trump is placing a loyalist in the top job in an agency he is staffing with immigration hardliners Stephen Miller and Tom Homan. Noem at one point was considered a potential vice president pick for Trump. However she saw some controversy this year when she published a book containing an anecdote about killing her dog, ostensibly to show that she could make tough decisions. Noem also can't enter 20% of the land in her state after being banned by all of the Indigenous tribes over offensive comments she made about Native people. Trump’s new “border czar” told Democratic governors to “get the hell out of the way” as the upcoming administration prepares its mass deportation plans — or face unnamed consequences. “There will be a massive deportation operation because we have a massive, never-seen-before illegal immigration [wave],” Tom Homan said during a Fox News appearance on Friday. “It’s not about hate, it’s not about discrimination, it’s not about being racist — it’s about those people entering the country illegally, which is a crime.” Read more: Trump reportedly plans to name Florida Sen.

Weissmann also warned of the legal pitfalls the former president may face in doing so. Appearing on MSNBC this weekend, Weissmann recalled Trump’s demand during the 2020 election to “stop the count” when he was beating then-Democratic rival Joe Biden in the number of votes that had been counted at that particular time. Trump, suggested Weissmann, may pull the same stunt of calling for a halt to counting votes if he appears to take a similar early lead (in the votes processed at that time) against Democratic 2024 rival Kamala Harris. “Just to be clear, that is illegal to say that,” Weissmann pointed out. “That is a violation of the obstruction statute and the civil rights statutes, federally.” “But you will hear exactly that thinking, ‘If you can stop the incoming vote,’ it won’t cause the Democrats to win. That is illegal,” Weissmann reiterated. “You have to count all votes.” He added, “So, I fully expect that if Donald Trump thinks that he is ahead at the start and there are more mail-in ballots, absentee ballots that are coming in that are going to favor the Democrats, he is going to be doing exactly what he has already done, which is to say, ‘Stop the count and it’s actually voter fraud.’ When in fact, the voter fraud is saying, ‘Don’t count the votes.’” Watch Weissmann’s analysis here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/britain-conservatives-kemi-badenoch_n_67289d5ce4b0880b6fcb38f5","Who Is Kemi Badenoch, The First Black Woman To Lead Britain's Conservative Party?","jill lawless","2024-11-04","LONDON (AP) — The first Black woman to lead a major U.K. political party, Kemi Badenoch is an upbeat and outspoken libertarian who thinks the British state is broken — and that she’s the one to fix it with smaller government and radical new ideas. The new leader of Britain’s right-of-center Conservative Party was born Olukemi Adegoke in London in 1980 to well-off Nigerian parents — a doctor and an academic — and spent much of her childhood in the West African country. She has said that the experience of Nigeria’s economic and social upheavals shaped her political outlook. “I grew up somewhere where the lights didn’t come on, where we ran out of fuel frequently despite being an oil-producing country,” Badenoch told the BBC last week. “I don’t take what we have in this country for granted,” she said. “I meet a lot of people who assume that things are good here because things are good here and they always will be. They don’t realize just how much work and sacrifice was required in order to get that.” Returning to the U.K. aged 16 during a period of turmoil in Nigeria, she worked part-time at McDonalds while completing school, then studied computer systems engineering at the University of Sussex. She later got a law degree and worked in financial services. In 2012, she married banker Hamish Badenoch, with whom she has three children. She was elected to the London Assembly in 2015 and to Parliament in 2017. She held a series of government posts in the 2019-22 government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, before becoming part of a mass ministerial exodus in July 2022 over a series of ethics scandals that triggered Johnson’s downfall. Badenoch ran unsuccessfully to succeed Johnson, boosting her profile in the process. She was appointed trade secretary in the 49-day government of Prime Minister Liz Truss, and business secretary under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. She held onto her seat in Parliament in July’s national election, which saw the Labour Party win a huge majority and the Conservatives reduced to 121 lawmakers in the 650-seat House of Commons. Like many Conservatives, Badenoch idolizes Margaret Thatcher, the party’s first female leader, who transformed Britain with her free-market policies in the 1980s. Citing her engineering background as evidence she’s a problem-solver, she depicts herself as a disruptor, arguing for a low-tax, free-market economy and pledging to “rewire, reboot and reprogram” the British state. A critic of multiculturalism and self-proclaimed enemy of wokeness, Badenoch is an opponent of “identity politics,” gender-neutral bathrooms and government plans to reduce U.K. carbon emissions. Supporters think her charismatic, outspoken style is just what the Conservative Party needs to come back from its worst-ever election defeat. During her leadership campaign, her backers wore T-shirts urging: “Be more Kemi.” Critics say Badenoch has clashed with colleagues and civil servants and has a tendency to make rash statements and provoke unnecessary fights. During the leadership campaign she drew criticism for saying that “not all cultures are equally valid,” and for suggesting that maternity pay was excessive — though she later backtracked on that claim.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/recruiters-job-application-chatgpt_l_6723b4e1e4b0871068fe81ad","We're Recruiters. This Is The Biggest Tell You Used ChatGPT On Your Job App.","monica torres","2024-11-04","With the rise of AI-powered writing assistants, typing up your job application can be quicker than ever. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, for example, is a chatbot powered by machine learning that can write out detailed resumes and cover letters in less than five minutes with the prompts you give it. But if you are doing this, know that recruiters can tell. “Easily 25% of apps appear to be AI-generated,” said Bonnie Dilber, a recruiting manager with app-automation company Zapier. And these blatant examples do not leave a winning impression on recruiters. At worst, “it signals to me that the person may not know what they are talking about or how to blend AI-generated content with their own ideas,” Dilber said. The biggest red flag, recruiters said, is when your application reads like a copy-pasted, robotic and formulaic template. If you are using an AI-powered writing assistant, think of the hundreds of other job candidates who are doing the same. For recruiters who sift through many applications, the ones that are done through AI become obvious, because they have similar sentence structures and they use the same case studies. Dilber gave the example of asking “Why are you interested in this position?” on a job application and getting candidates who use the same word-for-word response of “Company’s mission of ‘insert mission statement’ resonates with me and my experience in ‘insert their current job.’” “First time I saw it, it was cute, the next few times, it becomes obvious they all plugged this into the same tool.” “After seeing this exact same response over and over again, it becomes clear that the candidates are all using AI,” she said. When the application asked about how to use Zapier’s product, which automates tasks, Dilber said, “a bunch of people all came up with the same use case of a flower shop. First time I saw it, it was cute. The next few times, it becomes obvious they all plugged this into the same tool.” For Gabrielle Woody, a university recruiter for the financial software company Intuit, the telltale sign of a ChatGPT-written application is also the “robotic tone” that is markedly different than how early-career professionals actually talk. “I almost always see words like ‘adept,’ ‘tech-savvy’ and ‘cutting-edge’ repeatedly now on resumes for tech roles,” she said. “I mostly review intern and entry-level resumes, and many of the early-career candidates I reviewed were not using those terms in their applications before ChatGPT.” “A good recruiter can spot an AI-written application from a mile away,” said Laurie Chamberlin, head of LHH Recruitment Solutions in North America. For her, the clear giveaway is the generic buzzwords. “We might catch candidates listing skills like ‘excellent communicator’ or ‘team player,’ but they don’t back them up with real-life examples,” she said. “The absence of specificity, authenticity and personal touch can be a red flag.” In some cases, it’s obvious because of the lack of editing. Tejal Wagadia, a recruiter for a major tech company, said that she will see job applications that still have the font, parentheses or phrasing like “add numbers here” that ChatGPT will give in its summarized answers. “They will literally copy and paste that into their resume without any kind of editing,” Wagadia said. This can backfire for candidates, because it signals you are careless. “If you’re missing that level of detail, it shows the employer that you’re not detail-oriented. Yeah you use technology, but not well,” she added. Ideally, you use AI writing tools as a starting point, recruiters said. Woody said ChatGPT can help job candidates generate ideas about which experiences to present on their resumes: “You can ask ChatGPT to break down a job description or identify the most relevant skills and experiences for the position you’re applying to.” In other words, AI writing assistants can help you write a first draft, but you need to edit and write your final draft with specific, detailed experiences only you know to share. Wagadia advised making your job search “targeted and not templated.” So don’t mass-apply with hundreds of AI-generated job applications. “It’s better to have five targeted applications where you put in effort than 100 where the other person can clearly tell that you’re not interested,” Wagadia said. And don’t lie. Tech and digital marketing recruiter Kelli Hrivnak cautioned applicants against using the suggested achievements generative AI tools can create in their answers if they are not true: “If you have misled the company, then this jeopardizes your integrity as an employee,” Hrivnak said.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/goldilocks-countries-travel-tourism_l_67222d5ee4b03a564e7ce196","Why Your Next Vacation Should Be To A 'Goldilocks Country'","caroline bologna","2024-11-04","You’re likely familiar with the fairy-tale character of Goldilocks, a young girl who enters the home of three bears and samples their bowls of porridge. She finds one of them too hot, one too cold and one that strikes the perfect balance. As Goldie says, that last bowl is “just right.” Now, on a related note, have you heard of “Goldilocks countries”? This travel term isn’t as well known as the classic fairy tale, but it has the potential to change the way you vacation. Here’s what you should know about the Goldilocks approach to travel: The terms “Goldilocks countries” and “Goldilocks Zone countries” refer to travel destinations that strike the “just right” balance. These places have a lot to offer visitors, and yet they haven’t been affected by overtourism. As TikToker Allie Marshall, aka @AllieGoneAway, explains in her video about the concept, Goldilocks countries have infrastructure, money and political support for tourists. At the same time, the local community has not been harmed by “an unsustainable boom of tourism,” which means “there are still opportunities to have authentic and meaningful interactions and cultural experiences.” Residents of Goldilocks countries are generally with fine travelers visiting, and there’s reliable public transit, safe accommodations, convenient ports of entry and tourism information centers. Marshall named Slovenia, Vietnam and Bhutan as examples. “In regards to tourism, the bowl of porridge in the metaphor is the destination and the temperature of the porridge relates to the level of development and desire of the host community to welcome tourists,” Ben Martin, an economics practice director and principal at the architecture and hospitality strategy firm HKS, told HuffPost via email. “The Goldilocks Countries are destinations that are ‘just right’ ― welcoming to tourists, backed by government tourism funding, yet not oversaturated or perceived as ‘too busy.’” He predicts that the concept of Goldilocks countries will shape the tourism industry in 2025, because such destinations offer genuine cultural experiences without big crowds. “This balance makes them ideal for those wanting to explore new destinations that are eager for visitors but still retain their unique charm,” Martin said, adding that these locations exist on the lower slopes of Butler’s Tourism Area Life Cycle, which can be a useful reference for travel planning. He listed Albania, Chile, Norway and Georgia as examples of current Goldilocks countries. Hitting that sweet spot of tourism infrastructure and genuine local immersion comes with many upsides in terms of cost, comfort and enjoyment. “A Goldilocks destination or country will provide you with a visitor experience that is still authentic, welcoming and engaging ― typically at a price that is more accessible than highly developed destinations,” Martin noted. “At the same time, it won’t be so ‘rustic’ as to be uncomfortable, unfamiliar, or even unsafe.” However, there are downsides to consider as well. Travel can be incredibly subjective, after all. “One person’s definition of what ‘the right temperature’ is will differ from another’s,” Martin explained. “Thresholds of acceptability differ, typically based on your home-life experience and levels of previous travel experience. Equally, a destination might be considered a little too well-packaged or developed for others.” As always, visitors should be mindful and respectful of these destinations and do their part to prevent overtourism. Martin pointed to the recent focus on regenerative tourism. “These practices and principles are harder to apply in an ‘already well-established’ mature destination like the Costa del Sol,” Martin said. “But for those destinations that are gradually evolving and beginning to attract international attention, the time is right to shift the paradigm and build a tourist economy where the question has shifted from ‘what can the destination do for tourism?’ to ‘what can tourism do for the destination ― the local environment, the host community, local businesses?’” In addition to considering the practices of regenerative tourism, visitors to these “just right” destinations can take various steps to properly experience a Goldilocks country. “Do your homework,” Martin urged. “Decide what your priorities are then get [online] and explore, and seek advice.” The research process can be part of the fun of travel as you get to explore exciting options from the comfort of your home. “Engage with the local community in a respectful manner,” Martin said. “Typically the host community is open, willing and proud of its culture and traditions and direct engagement fosters a deeper, more meaningful experience.” He also recommended giving yourself enough days to engage in “slow travel” and really get to know your destination. Make sure to get out of your hotel room and explore. “Try local activities and visit local sights,” Martin said. “This will help to foster those highly-valued memories that you’ll carry with you for the rest of your life.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/microwave-healthy-food_l_6716a54ce4b019cef4eb429e","Is Heating Food In The Microwave Bad For Your Health? The Answer May Surprise You.","vivian chung","2024-11-04","Few appliances spark as much debate as the microwave. For those who don’t have the time (or desire) to cook, it’s a game-changer, swiftly warming up leftovers and transforming fresh ingredients into satisfying meals. Still, concerns about nutrient loss persist, with some worrying that essential vitamins and minerals are being zapped away, leaving food unhealthy. So, is microwave cooking really that bad for your health? We asked experts to get to the bottom of the debate. Microwaves heat food by using electromagnetic waves that cause water molecules in the food to vibrate. “Water molecules are a bit like tiny magnets — they have a positive and a negative side,” explained registered sports nutritionist and dietitian Krutika Nanavati, referring to the dipole rotation mechanism. When the microwave oven is running, it sends waves that switch direction millions of times per second. In response, the water molecules try to align with the changing waves but end up spinning and colliding with each other at incredibly high speeds. “This constant movement creates friction, and that’s what generates heat. Microwaves only penetrate about an inch or so into the food. The rest of the heating happens because that initial heat spreads throughout the food by conduction,” Nanavati explained. All cooking methods, whether baking, boiling, frying or microwaving, result in some nutrient loss, particularly when temperatures exceed 140°F, explained Adrian Hernandez, a registered dietitian nutritionist and certified gastrointestinal nutritionist. The degree of nutrient loss varies based on several factors, including cooking time, heat intensity and the quality of the food. Compared to other cooking methods, microwaving often does a better job of retaining essential vitamins and minerals. “With microwaving, food cooks quickly and it often uses little to no water, meaning more of the good stuff stays in your meal,” Nanavati said. This is especially beneficial for preserving heat-sensitive and water-soluble vitamins like B and C, which tend to break down under prolonged heat. For instance, boiling carrots can cause a significant portion of these vitamins to leach into the water, but when microwaving, more of these vitamins can be preserved since they’re not lost to the cooking liquid. “Some nutrients actually become more available after microwaving,” Nanavati pointed out. Heating carrots or tomatoes in the microwave enhances the bioavailability of carotenoids, a heart-healthy antioxidant, by breaking down their cell walls, which makes them easier for your body to absorb. “Leafy greens like spinach also retain more of their vitamin K when microwaved compared to boiling. And minerals like calcium, iron and zinc? They’re hardly affected at all by microwaving, so it’s a great option if you’re looking to retain those,” Nanavati said. To help maintain the quality of your food and its nutrient value when heating in the microwave, Hernandez suggests using a higher temperature for a shorter time. “If I steam, boil, bake or microwave something like broccoli or green beans for a shorter period at high heat and then remove them, they’ll still maintain their crunch and firmness. If I cook them for a longer time, they will wilt, fall apart and become mushy. This end-quality result is an easy way to understand the level of nutrient depletion.” Also, because microwaving doesn’t require added fats or oils for cooking, it can make for a healthier option. Though experts agree that leftovers are safe to reheat in the microwave, it’s important to note that, as with any cooking method, overcooking can still cause nutrient loss, especially with heat-sensitive vitamins like C and B. “Food texture can also be altered, as repeat microwave cooking can cause foods to become tough, such as meats, or soggy, like carbohydrates,” explained Brittany Werner, a director of coaching and registered dietitian nutritionist. “Lastly, each time we reheat food, the flavor starts to break down and can leave the food tasting bland.” Hernandez adds that high-temperature cooking processes can trigger the formation of certain compounds. “Overcooking and browning foods can also cause an increase in heterocyclic amines, aromatic hydrocarbons and advanced glycation end products, which have been linked to increases in inflammation.” For greater efficiency, Hernandez suggests only reheating the portion you need. He also emphasizes the importance of following the 72-hour rule for leftovers to reduce the risk of foodborne illness since bacteria can still multiply over time, even in the refrigerator. “That means the soup or rice you’ve been holding onto all week isn’t the best idea. If you plan to keep leftovers for more than 72 hours, I recommend freezing them in an airtight container immediately after cooking to preserve them for longer.” For busy individuals juggling work, school, kids and everything in between, the microwave can be a real lifesaver, with endless possibilities for cooking meals from scratch. Hernandez suggests going for dishes like steamed or cooked vegetables, pasta, soups, omelets, tacos, meatloaf, casseroles and common breakfast porridge — meals that don’t require much time to develop flavor, tenderize or cook. “Beans, for example, [are] not a good idea unless canned because they need time to soak and then take hours to cook at a medium to low temp before they’re ready to eat.” “The biggest [thing] to be aware of is plastics,” said Hernandez, referring to the type of cookware you should avoid using in the microwave. “I recommend heating or cooking with food-grade ceramics or glass to avoid plastic leaching into foods.” Hernandez also cautions against microwaving takeout containers, whether Styrofoam, plastic or even paper ones, as they often contain a thin plastic coating to keep liquids and oils from seeping through.

To prevent splattering and lock in moisture — which is essential for both flavor and nutrition — Hernandez suggests using a paper towel instead of plastic lids when covering food. Werner adds that spreading food out as much as possible and using the largest microwave-safe dish available can promote more even heating. Stir and reposition food halfway through to further help eliminate cold spots. “There are a lot of benefits to microwave heating due to its quick and relatively simple way to prepare meals. There are several considerations, however, when it comes to what you’re cooking or reheating food in, how long, and what temperature it is before deeming it ready to eat,” Hernandez said.

Jones’ publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family. “Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones’ passing,” the family said in a statement. “And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.” Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary musical catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song. For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who did not own at least one record with his name on it, or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who did not have some connection to him. Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for “Roots” and “In the Heat of the Night,” organized President Bill Clinton’s first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of “We Are the World,” the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa. Lionel Richie, who co-wrote “We Are the World” and was among the featured singers, would call Jones “the master orchestrator.” In a career which began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 rpm, top honors likely go to his productions with Jackson: “Off the Wall,” “Thriller” and “Bad” were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones’ versatility and imagination helped set off the explosive talents of Jackson as he transformed from child star to the “King of Pop.” On such classic tracks as “Billie Jean” and “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For “Thriller,” some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing “Beat It” and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track. “Thriller” sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles’ “Greatest Hits 1971-1975” among others as the best-selling album of all time. “If an album doesn’t do well, everyone says ‘it was the producers fault’; so if it does well, it should be your ‘fault,’ too,” Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. “The tracks don’t just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.” Quincy Jones leaves behind a vast music (“Thriller”) & film (THE COLOR PURPLE) legacy. He was a terrific movie producer, composer, arranger & the most successful music producer of all time. He was also a compelling storyteller, recounting his projects’ histories. #RIPQuincyJones pic.twitter.com/9Geqa1H1nG RIP Quincy Jones, who defined the highest level of musical genius for 5 generations. Perhaps the greatest producer & soundtrack composer of all-time. The most quotable, the coolest, who made everything from Thriller to Vibe to the Fresh Prince. Who did it all, better than anyone. pic.twitter.com/gU8PD1gsCN So sad to wake up to the news that music god & genius Quincy Jones has died😢His work on Off the Wall with Michael Jackson was the first album to blow my mind, then Thriller. His catalogue of work is crazy. Love this Mack the Knife clip of him with Sinatra. Rest in power sir🙏🏽☺️ pic.twitter.com/z4lPL57vFt The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography “Q”, including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for “Roots.” He also received France’s Legion d’Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, “Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones” and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author. Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that “There are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don’t. Nothing’s in between.” Jones’ mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem “senseless” for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting. “They nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,” he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood. Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano. “I went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,” he wrote in his autobiography. “That’s where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.” Within a few years he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band. “We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,” Jones later told Musician magazine. “That’s when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.” As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early ’60s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, “The Color Purple,” received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986. (But, to his great disappointment, no wins). In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999. “My philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,” Jones wrote in his autobiography. He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra’s “Fly Me to the Moon” to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles’ soulful “In the Heat of the Night” with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, rapper and singer Queen Latifah). On “We are the World” alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson – “P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing” – and Donna Summer – “Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) – and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom “Sanford and Son.” Jones was a facilitator and maker of the stars. He gave Will Smith a key break in the hit TV show “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” which Jones produced, and through “The Color Purple” he introduced Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg to filmgoers. Starting in the 1960s, he composed more than 35 film scores, including for “The Pawnbroker,” “In the Heat of the Night” and “In Cold Blood.” He called scoring “a multifaceted process, an abstract combination of science and soul.” Jones’ work on the soundtrack for “The Wiz” led to his partnership with Jackson, who starred in the 1978 movie. In an essay published in Time magazine after Jackson’s death, in 2009, Jones remembered that the singer kept slips of paper on him that contained thoughts by famous thinkers. When Jones asked about the origins of one passage, Jackson answered “Socrates,” but pronounced it “SO-crayts.” Jones corrected him, “Michael, it’s SOCK-ra-tees.” “And the look he gave me then, it just prompted me to say, because I’d been impressed by all the things I saw in him during the rehearsal process, ‘I would love to take a shot at producing your album,’” Jones recalled. “And he went back and told the people at Epic Records, and they said, `No way — Quincy’s too jazzy.’ Michael was persistent, and he and his managers went back and said, `Quincy’s producing the album.’ And we proceeded to make ‘Off the Wall.’ Ironically, that was one of the biggest Black-selling albums at the time, and that album saved all the jobs of the people saying I was the wrong guy. That’s the way it works.” Tensions emerged after Jackson’s death. In 2013, Jones sued Jackson’s estate, claiming he was owed millions in royalties and production fees on some of the superstar’s greatest hits. In a 2018 interview with New York magazine, he called Jackson “as Machiavellian as they come” and alleged that he lifted material from others. Jones was hooked on work and play, and at times suffered for it. He nearly died from a brain aneurysm in 1974 and became deeply depressed in the 1980s after “The Color Purple” was snubbed by Academy Awards voters; he never received a competitive Oscar. A father of seven children by five mothers, Jones described himself as a “dog” who had countless lovers around the world. He was married three times, his wives including the actor Peggy Lipton. “To me, loving a woman is one of the most natural, blissful, life-enhancing — and dare I say, religious — acts in the world,” he wrote. He was not an activist in his early years, but changed after attending the 1968 funeral of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and later befriending the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Jones was dedicated to philanthropy, saying “the best and only useful aspect of fame and celebrity is having a platform to help others.” His causes included fighting HIV and AIDS, educating children and providing for the poor around the world. He founded the Quincy Jones Listen Up! Foundation to connect young people with music, culture and technology, and said he was driven throughout his life “by a spirit of adventure and a criminal level of optimism.” “Life is like a dream, the Spanish poet and philosopher Federico Garcia Lorca said,” Jones wrote in his memoir. “Mine’s been in Technicolor, with full Dolby sound through THX amplification before they knew what these systems were.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

With the polls between Trump and Democratic rival Kamala Harris still so close, the newspaper’s editorial board published a short but scathing analysis of the former president. Trump is “a threat to democracy,” “lies without limit” and in a second term “will use the government to go after opponents” and “pursue a cruel policy of mass deportations,” the publication warned. The piece contained 110 words and links to multiple Times articles to back up it points. It ended with the word, “Vote.” Read the full editorial at The New York Times. The Times endorsed Harris in September, in contrast to The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, which have opted not to formally back a candidate in this election. Last month, The New York Times’ board urged voters to believe Trump on the rhetoric he’s been spewing on the campaign trail and before. “The record shows that Mr. Trump often pursues his stated goals, regardless of how plainly they lack legal or moral grounding,” it wrote. “The record further shows that many of his most reckless efforts in his first administration were stymied only because of others in his administration who blocked, delayed or watered down his aims to ensure that he could not put himself above the law or the country,” it added.

And again —,” Buttigieg said of Kelly, a retired U.S. Marine Corps general. “Do you think — do you think that, mayor, that Donald Trump is a fascist. Do you think he’s that?” the Fox News host asked, using Buttigieg’s title from when he was mayor of South Bend, Indiana. “I don’t think General Kelly is wrong. He knows Donald Trump much better than I do and I would not contradict General Kelly in his assessment of his former boss,” Buttigieg replied. Moments earlier, Cavuto noted efforts by Buttigieg — a Harris campaign surrogate — to reach out to Republicans in areas “not generally seen as a blue wall bastion” such as Midland, Texas. He further pointed to Buttigieg’s call with billionaire Trump backer Elon Musk, who implied on X (formerly Twitter) that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was shutting down airways to prevent Hurricane Helene recovery efforts. Cavuto claimed that Harris hasn’t made similar efforts to communicate with conservatives and asked if the vice president will “regret” such a strategy. “I’m not sure I can agree with the premise of that question,” replied Buttigieg, who noted that he hasn’t seen another Democratic presidential candidate pledge to include Republicans in their Cabinet and invite “prominent” GOP elected officials to campaign with her. The transportation secretary later noted that Americans have never seen a former president’s chief of staff or his vice president not support him. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-unfocused-mess_n_67281296e4b07ebc5a29b92c","Trump Enters Final Sprint For White House An Unfocused Mess","s.v. date","2024-11-03","WASHINGTON ― In the final sprint toward Election Day, Donald Trump has mused about former congresswoman Liz Cheney as well as journalists covering his rallies getting gunned down, confirmed that he will put an anti-vax conspiracy theorist in charge of the government’s health care apparatus and explained that talking about a fictional serial killer proves his genius. And that was all before he declared at a rally Sunday that he should have just stayed in office despite his 2020 election loss and failed coup attempt on Jan. 6, 2021. “The day that I left, I shouldn’t have left,” he said at a rally in Pennsylvania. “I mean, honestly, because we did so well.” Trump did not elaborate on how, exactly, that might have worked. At noon on Jan. 20, 2021, Joe Biden became the new president and commander-in-chief. At that moment, Trump would have been a trespasser had he chosen to remain in the White House and subject to arrest. Trump’s critics cite Trump’s advancing years ― he is now 78 ― and apparent mental decline as the cause for his inability to deliver a succinct closing message as to why voters should, despite everything, return him to office. “Age and cognitive decline?” offered one veteran Republican consultant on condition of anonymity. “Psychological decompensation,” said George Conway, whose former wife, Kellyanne Conway, ran Trump’s 2016 campaign in its final months. George Conway supported Trump that election before quickly concluding he had made a terrible mistake. Trump’s campaign rejected the idea that Trump is losing focus. “President Trump is the greatest orator in political history and his patented ‘weave’ is a brilliant method to convey important stories and explain policies,” spokesman Steven Cheung said. “The media is too stupid and ignorant to understand or comprehend what is happening in the country and, therefore, is unable to accurately report on President Trump’s achievements while in office and the pro-America agenda he will implement in his second term.” Weave refers to Trump’s claim that his rambling speaking style of jumping from topic to topic, eventually returning to his original thought, shows off his great intellect. Vice President Kamala Harris had a much more typical day on the trail, campaigning in Michigan, where she attended a Black church service in Detroit in the morning, visited a local restaurant and barbershop, and held a rally at Michigan State University. “We have momentum, it is on our side, can you feel it?” Harris said to the roar of the crowd at the rally. “Our campaign is tapping into the ambitions, the aspirations and the dreams of the American people.” The Harris campaign, which has said its internal data indicates late-deciding voters are breaking their way, is projecting more and more confidence as the days go on. On a conference call with reporters on Sunday, campaign officials boasted they had launched 57,000 door-knocking and phone-banking shifts on Saturday. “It is bananas big,” a campaign official said of Harris’ ground operation. Polls in the race remain tight, with both candidates within striking distance in each of the seven swing states. However, Trump’s increasingly erratic campaign rhetoric in the finals of his 2024 campaign stands in stark contrast to his performance eight years ago, when he robotically stuck to reading poll-tested themes from his teleprompter multiple times a day. Kellyanne Conway has spoken often about how she persuaded him to stay on message for the final weeks after the release of the Access Hollywood tape on which he was heard to boast that his celebrity allowed him to grab women by the genitals. Trump took that advice then, hitting the same points over and over every night: the latest Hillary Clinton emails, stolen by Russia and released by Wikileaks; the southern border wall and making Mexico pay for it; bringing back jobs from overseas; fighting radical Islam; and redoing unfair trade deals. In that final month, Trump cut way back on interviews and largely stuck to the script written for him by others, for the most part avoiding meandering detours. Once he even reminded himself aloud about remaining focused. “We’ve got to be nice and cool, nice and cool, right?” Trump said at a rally on Nov. 2, 2016. “Stay on point, Donald, stay on point. No side tracks, Donald. Nice and easy.” Eight years later, Trump instead spends most of his hour-and-a-half speeches on those side tracks. “When I say insane asylums, and then I say, Doctor Hannibal Lecter, does anybody know? They go crazy. They say, oh, he brings up these names out of— Well, that’s genius. Right. Doctor Hannibal Lecter. There’s nobody worse than him. Silence of the Lambs. Who the hell else would even remember that? I have a great memory, but they always hit me. I don’t bring it up too much because they have to take such a— he brought up Hannibal Lecter. What does that have to do with this? What is it? It has everything to do with it, right?” he said at a North Carolina rally on Saturday. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/global-headwinds-hitting-kamala-harris-campaign_n_6727f6f1e4b0cfb9cc69dda9","The Global Headwinds Hitting Kamala Harris' Campaign","kevin robillard","2024-11-03","If you spent the past week looking for signs Vice President Kamala Harris might lose the presidential race to former President Donald Trump, your best bet was maybe not to look at Madison Square Garden, where Trump held a rally widely condemned for its racism and misogyny. It wasn’t necessarily to look at Harris’ rally in Washington, D.C., or in the swing states, which largely went off without a hitch. It wasn’t to stare at spreadsheets full of early voting or polling data or to look at contested White House transcripts. Your best bet might have been to look 9,000 miles southeast across the Atlantic to landlocked Botswana in Southern Africa. There, the Botswana Democratic Party lost its parliamentary majorities for the first time in the country’s 58-year history. Just a few days earlier, the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, long the dominant party there, had turned in its second-worst electoral performance in history. While there are unique reasons for these electoral flops — a corruption scandal in Japan; a drop in prices in Botswana for diamonds, one of the nation’s largest industries — they also fit into a new yearslong trend of electorates punishing incumbent parties around the world, as a seeming hangover from the COVID years and subsequent global inflation batters politicians’ approval ratings. The global trend casts Harris’ toss-up battle against Trump in a different light, one where her tactical decisions and the ideological positioning of the Democratic Party could matter less than the simple fact inflation hit 9.1% in July 2022, and one where a win against a candidate as evidently flawed as Trump is far from preordained. But there are also reasons Harris may be better positioned to ride out an anti-incumbent wave. “There is a lot of unhappiness with the way democracy is functioning in many countries,” said Richard Wike, the director of global attitudes research at the Pew Research Center. “There’s just a lot of discontent with political leaders,” he added. “Huge majorities in just about every country we survey say elected officials don’t care what people like me think.” This year, Pew surveyed citizens of 31 different countries. Across them, 54% said they weren’t satisfied with how democracy was working, while just 45% were. It’s reasonable to expect voters to take their anger out on incumbents, whether in the United States or elsewhere. The ideology of these parties does not seem to matter. The Liberal Democratic Party in Japan is a center-right party, roughly equivalent to the pre-Trump GOP in the United States. The Conservative Party in Great Britain, which suffered a drubbing this summer, occupy a similar space on the left-to-right political spectrum. South Africa’s ruling African National Congress, which has held power since the end of apartheid, suffered huge losses and lost its majority, only remaining in power through a coalition agreement. Center-left leaders in Canada and Germany have also seen their popularity plummet. Even the Bharatiya Janata Party, led by popular right-wing populist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, suffered major losses in elections earlier this year and was forced to team up with allies to control parliament. The one exception to the rule seems to be Mexico, where voters elected Claudia Sheinbaum, a close ally of former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, as his successor. Both belong to Morena, a left-wing populist party. Polling data from Gallup indicates the malaise clearly extends to the United States. Just 26% of the country says the United States is on the right track. A plurality of the country, 46%, describes the economy as “poor,” and 62% says the economy is actively getting worse. While these impressions are not exactly backed up by macroeconomic data — which shows low unemployment, whipped inflation and solid wage growth — they do represent an ongoing bitterness about the post-COVID economy. Adding to Harris’ problems is the unpopularity of her boss, President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race with just over 100 days to go before the election. While Biden’s approval rating briefly ticked up following the decision, it once again stands at a net of -18 in the FiveThirtyEight average. Trump’s campaign and allied super PACs have hammered Harris for failing to decisively break with Biden in some interviews. “Harris backed Biden on everything,” a narrator says ominously at the start of an ad the Trump campaign released earlier this week. And there are other headwinds, some of which Harris has only minimal control over: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which has created clear but surmountable cracks in the Democratic coalition, and the Biden administration’s turn toward border security, which came years too late in the eyes of most Democratic strategists. Additionally, there are questions that may only be able to be answered in hindsight. Why are Democrats potentially losing ground with union voters, even though the Biden administration was incredibly pro-union? Why didn’t full employment and wage growth lead to broader popularity? The answers to all of these questions have at least something to do with inflation, a global problem perhaps exacerbated by legislation supported by all but one congressional Democrat. It’s difficult to place blame for the inflation spike on any one part of the party’s coalition. But with both progressives and moderates within the Democratic coalition jockeying for influence in a Harris administration or to craft the narrative of why she lost, these collective headwinds make it difficult to evaluate Harris’ — and to a certain extent, Biden’s — political strategy and positioning. In an interview with HuffPost in October, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) blew past an aide’s attempt to end the conversation when asked about attempts by the party’s moderate wing to pin Biden’s poor approval ratings on the economy on progressive influence. She noted the United States spent more to prop up its post-COVID economy than other advanced economies and subsequently had gross domestic product growth, small-business formation numbers, and the lowest unemployment and inflation rate. “There’s no counterargument here to push on Democratic leadership to say that somehow we need to follow a less progressive path and it will lead to a stronger economy,” she said. “All of the evidence points in exactly the opposite direction.” If there is one global trend that could help Harris, it could be the simple fact she literally does not look like the 46 presidents she may end up succeeding. Voters around the world have expressed interest in electing more representative politicians, Wike said. For Harris, who would be the first woman, second Black person and first Asian American elected to the presidency, it could be a boost — although Harris has often downplayed the historic nature of her candidacy. “There’s a lot of interest in having, for instance, more women elected to public office, more young people, more people from poor backgrounds,” Wike said. “So there’s this overall kind of sense that, OK, we’re frustrated. People around the world are frustrated with political elites, and they want to see some changes in terms of what those political elites look like.” There’s also the simple fact Harris has tried to seize on a “change” mantle even as a pseudo-incumbent, boasting in her closing television ad: “As president, I will bring a new generation of leadership.” The next four years will change America forever.

During a recent interview, the “Thank U, Next” singer explained to Australian radio station Hit 104.7 Canberra why she decided to use her full legal name — Ariana Grande-Butera — in the credits for her upcoming film, “Wicked,” in which she’ll play “good witch” Glinda. “Technically, it’s my little girl name!” she explained. “It’s little Ari’s name.” “I just feel like this experience was such a homecoming for me,” she continued. “I feel like I came home to myself in a lot of ways through what I learned from Glinda, from Elphaba.” She then added a very cute detail. “That was my name when I went to see [“Wicked” the play] when I was 10 years old. It felt like a really lovely way of honoring that. It felt really full circle. It just felt like something I wanted to do.” The sentiment is very sweet, although Grande’s romantic relationship with her “Wicked” co-star Ethan Slater has left some fans bitter. Last summer, Grande divorced her husband after two years of marriage and Slater separated from his high school sweetheart, with whom he’d been married for five years. Sources close to Slater and Grande told People that the two didn’t begin dating until they were both officially single, but Slater’s ex, Lilly Jay, suggested otherwise to Page Six last July. In an interview with Vanity Fair this month, Grande “dispute[d] specific allegations” about her relationship with Slater, but kept things relatively vague — saying only that “there couldn’t be a less accurate depiction” of Slater than the cheating rumors coming from the tabloids. Slater, a Tony Award-nominated Broadway actor, told GQ in an interview published last week that the online hate spurred by his relationship with Grande has been “really difficult.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

I offered to give the identical speech at a Harris rally.” McGraw said he would have happily crossed off Trump’s name and replaced it with Harris’ had he been given the opportunity to speak in front of her supporters. However, it’s presumable it wouldn’t have gone over well, especially considering how McGraw criticized DEI initiatives during his MSG speech, saying that America was “built on hard work” and “not on DEI.” The TV personality also insisted to Morgan that his speech didn’t mean he endorsed Trump, despite the fact that speaking at a political rally for a candidate running for office is, in most people’s eyes, the very definition of an endorsement. McGraw also dubiously claimed that a day after he spoke at the Trump rally, a Harris staffer got in contact about possibly speaking at one of her rallies. “I said right back, ‘Absolutely, tell me when and where to be, and I will bring a transcript of the speech and give it at a Harris rally,’” he recalled telling the staffer. “And she answered accordingly — crickets. Never heard another word once they found out I was serious.” HuffPost reached out to the Harris campaign for comment, but no one immediately responded. You can see McGraw and Morgan discuss the MSG speech below. McGraw’s reasoning for speaking at the Trump rally incited plenty of snarky remarks on X, formerly called Twitter. Nothing quite as vindictive as an entitled man scorned https://t.co/3xXNFXHWPu Kamala: Girl, Dr. Phil called like 20 times!!Oprah: Leave that mf on read. TRUST ME.Kamala: Aight. Cool. https://t.co/Uro20WENgo Dr Dr Phil offered 25 times to speak at a Kamala Harris rally but they had actual celebrities so he got snubbed and turned MAGA. MEN ARE TOO EMOTIONAL TO LEAD https://t.co/Ag2U5MThcp ""I offered to give the identical speech at a Harris rally"" is exactly WHY he wasn't invited to give that speech at a Harris rally. Yeah, I’m fairly sure Dr Phil would not rail against DEI at a Kamala rally. Besides, he owes his fame (notwithstanding the fact he lost his licence) to Oprah, so his view is rather hollow. Dr. Phil couldn’t handle a woman telling him no. Fu(k his feelings. Dr. Phil, who surrendered his Texas license in 2006, and has never held a license to practice psychology in any other state since, called Vice President Kamala Harris a diversity equity & inclusion hire when in reality he's the DEI hire plucked from obscurity by Oprah. pic.twitter.com/vM7yNXwIog The next four years will change America forever.

Particular","kimberley richards","2024-11-05","It’s Election Day, and voters are stressed out. While people across the nation are casting their ballots, many are also figuring out what to eat as they anticipate the results of various House, Senate and governors’ races ― not to mention the presidential election. And some folks are really chewing on their snack decisions. Social media users have been posting meal ideas that they believe will help them get through the anxiety-inducing day. Some ideas are rooted in superstition, while others are meant to tackle comfort food cravings. It should be noted that eating certain snacks won’t actually help decide down-ballot races, or determine whether Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump will win the presidency. But people are taking their food choices seriously nonetheless. Some social media users are letting their superstitions inform the menu. “On Election Day 2020, I made beef stew and Trump lost,” one person wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Monday. “I’ll make beef stew again tomorrow night.” On Election Day 2020, I made beef stew and Trump lost. I’ll make beef stew again tomorrow night. Do you have any election day superstitions that you know are completely irrational but you’re going to follow them anyway? Another X user announced their plans to eat Taco Bell on Tuesday, since their preferred candidate has won every time they ate Taco Bell on Election Day since 2012 — except for 2016, when the person didn’t get Taco Bell, and their candidate lost. Other people are focusing their Election Day meals on comfort foods. “On today’s suggested menu: bagels w/cream cheese, mozzarella sticks, loaded mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, grilled cheese — basically is it carbs and cheese? Then IT’S ACCEPTABLE!” one X user wrote. “Election Day Food is fast food and Election Night Drink is red wine,” another declared. Below, check out more people’s ideas about Election Day snacks, traditions and superstitions: We ate fish stew in 2016. I told husband its forbidden on election day. Had it last night and it will be destroyed tonite. Thought i was the only 🥜 We buy a giant bag of Cheesies before each election. If the result is awful, the Cheesies are a consolation. If the result is good, they’re a celebration. Can’t lose. I feel justified in buying outrageously bad-for-me snacks this week. If my candidate wins, they are celebratory snacks. If she doesn’t, they are “eating my feelings” snacks. Either way, they won’t go to waste. 🤷🏻♀️ #electionsnacks #vote pic.twitter.com/AVxlNeCsuC This is a friendly reminder to buy your election week snacks. Do not be caught without cheese and something sweet. You do not want to run out of sparkling water Tuesday night. My normal election night ritual is to drink 3 glasses of wine, put in earplugs, and go to sleep but not drinking takes away that option. I think I'm gonna order a cheeseburger the size of my face and possibly a large Five Guys fry to be delivered by semi truck. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

The teen was arrested and charged with battery on a person over the age of 65 — a third-degree felony — after witnesses at the rally reported the woman had been struck following a separate altercation involving the teen and an adult man, the Stuart Police Department said. The woman fell to the ground, but she declined medical assistance at the scene. She later identified herself to local news outlets as Kathleen Tomasko. “I’m standing there and people are moving and this kid just turned around and he punched me. I don’t know where he came from,” she told the Treasure Coast Palm. “He punched me in the gut and knocked me on the ground, and I fell back and hit the ground,” she continued. “Thank goodness the two ladies were behind me so I didn’t hit my head.” In a separate interview with NBC affiliate WPTV, Tomasko said she was still shocked from the incident. “I never thought there was going to be trouble,” Tomasko said. “I never thought anything like this.” The rally at Roosevelt Bridge, also called “Rally on the Bridge” was put on by the Women’s March in support of the Harris campaign and Florida’s Amendment 4 ballot initiative. If passed, it would amend the state’s constitution to protect abortion rights. The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/violent-threats-spur-arrests-charges-in-michigan_n_672a7bcae4b0ffe83cf1dd1d","Violent Threats Spur Arrests, Charges In Michigan","br,i buchman","2024-11-05","Two men were arrested in Michigan on Election Day: one man was allegedly sending threatening communications and spoke of killing Donald Trump to authorities during an FBI interview, and the other man — who feds claim boasted of his extremist ties in his communications — for vowing to injure or kill members of an unnamed political action committee. The FBI and Justice Department announced the arrests on Tuesday afternoon. According to authorities, Michigan man Isaac Sissel, 25, was arrested and charged with sending threatening communications on Tuesday. The FBI said in court records that the social media site Reddit had voluntarily reported disturbing messages from a user with the name “ShootUpTrumpRally,” who also went by similar monikers like “WillShootTrumpSoon” and “PlanningToShootTrump.” Authorities said they were able to identify Sissel by tracking his IP address back to the University of Michigan. According to court records, the FBI National Threat Center in West Virginia received an anonymous threat on its website on Nov. 2. The threat stated: “I shall carry out an attack against conservative christian [sic] filth in the event trump wins the election. I have stolen ar1 and a target I refuse to to name so I can continue to get away with my plans. Without a specific victim or ability to find the place I hid the gun, there’s not a thing the FBI can do until I complete the attack.” The FBI said it responded to the message by asking about access to weapons. “I already have that shit,” a reply read. Authorities said they were able to track the message back to Sissel’s phone and then interviewed him at a Travelodge motel in Canton on Monday. No firearms, ammunition or other similar equipment were found, but agents said that wasn’t surprising because Sissel had claimed that he “hid the gun.” During the interview, Sissel allegedly remarked that Trump was a “threat” and a “piece of shit” and that he believed Trump should have been assassinated. “Sissel said that he wouldn’t kill Trump, but if he knew someone was going to assassinate Trump that it was his (Sissel’s) duty not to intervene,” an FBI affidavit states. Though authorities located Sissel in Ann Arbor, he allegedly told them that he had access to firearms while living in Washington state but not while in Michigan. The FBI said it does not appear that he has maintained a “consistent residence” and that Sissel had IDs from New York and Washington. Sissel was in Michigan on the same day Trump had a rally in the state. After his arrest on Tuesday morning, Sissel made his first appearance before a magistrate judge, and records show he is currently detained. His next court date will be Nov. 7 at 1 p.m. Elsewhere in Michigan, authorities arrested and charged Jackson resident Christopher Pierce, 46. An FBI affidavit reviewed by HuffPost Tuesday shows that Pierce is accused of sending two online messages on Oct. 2 threatening to injure or kill people associated with a political action committee. The PAC is not named in court records. Prosecutors said that Pierce used a readily identifiable Gmail account to send messages to the PAC. In the field to enter his name on a message form sent to the PAC, Pierce allegedly wrote: “Your worst fucking nightmare.” The message vowed to “find each and every one of your fucking organizees” [sic] and seemed to suggest that he may be a member — or at least sympathetic to — the far-right “Three Percenters” network. “I’m a member of that American patriotfucking three bitch. And we will turn you motherfuckers inside out. I’ve already managed to locate one of your callcenters [sic]..You will shut this shit down or we will shut it down for you permanently,” the message continued. It also called Vice President Kamala Harris “Kamala Harrisis,” a reference to the terrorist network Isis. A separate electronic communication Pierce is accused of sending in October vowed that the “Americanpatriot three” were “trained killers” who were “trained by Uncle Sam” and that the PAC’s “call centers have been located.” “Don’t make these boys and girlsgo [sic] to work,” Pierce allegedly wrote. The FBI said it interviewed Pierce at his home in Jackson on Oct. 30, and he was “generally hostile” to agents as he spoke to them through his front screen door. Agents said they read Pierce’s messages back to him, but he “stated he did not see the emails as threatening.” Prosecutors noted in a criminal complaint that this isn’t the first time Pierce has been involved in allegedly making threats. On June 29, 2022, the FBI alleges that Pierce used an Instagram account with the user name “pierce_overheard_door” to lash out at a witness who testified publicly before the now-defunct House select committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Court records do not name the witness, but the date of Pierce’s alleged post would suggest he was referring to witness Cassidy Hutchinson, a former assistant to Donald Trump’s onetime chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Hutchsinon delivered explosive testimony to the Jan. 6 committee, including revelations that the former president knew that rioters were armed but believed they wouldn’t hurt him. The June 29 message from Pierce cited by prosecutors declared that “what comes next” would “make January 6th look like a Sunday stroll through the park” and that Hutchinson was committing “career suicide.” “Where exactly in the world does she think she’s gonna be able to hide from one of the worlds [sic] wealthiest men in his army? Because there’s not a politician in this country that would come within 100 miles of this bitch now! You can’t be trusted! And we all know what happens to snitches,” Pierce allegedly wrote. FBI agents said they interviewed Pierce at his home in September 2022 about those messages. Agents claimed they also asked Pierce about a comment he made suggesting there would be “no 2024 election.” In response, Pierce allegedly told agents that he was trying to “emphasize an ongoing movement encouraging voters not to cast a vote at all.” “He stated that the federal government was ‘fake’ and ‘illegitimate’ anyway, which, he opined, was why the FBI was at his door to intimidate him,” an FBI affidavit states. During that same interview, the agents said they warned Pierce that making threats could lead to criminal federal charges. Pierce allegedly responded that soon “the country will descend into civil war.” The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-bkn-76ers-embiid-suspended_n_672a9b3ce4b0ffe83cf1e8a7","NBA Suspends Joel Embiid 3 Games For Shoving Journalist","ap","2024-11-05","NEW YORK (AP) — Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid was suspended by the NBA on Tuesday for three games without pay for shoving a member of the media. Embiid’s suspension will begin with the next regular-season game for which he is eligible and able to play. The 2023 NBA MVP has yet to play this season because of what the 76ers call left knee management. The Sixers begin a road trip in Los Angeles against the Clippers on Wednesday night. Embiid shouted at and eventually shoved a newspaper columnist in a locker room altercation Saturday night. “Mutual respect is paramount to the relationship between players and media in the NBA,” league executive Joe Dumars said in a statement announcing the suspension. “While we understand Joel was offended by the personal nature of the original version of the reporter’s column, interactions must remain professional on both sides and can never turn physical.” Embiid took issue with Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Marcus Hayes, who mentioned the seven-time All-Star’s late brother and his son — both named Arthur — in columns questioning Embiid’s professionalism and effort not being in shape after playing in the Paris Olympics. As reporters entered the locker room to talk to players following a 124-107 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, the two-time NBA scoring champion stood and confronted Hayes. “The next time you bring up my dead brother and my son again, you are going to see what I’m going to do to you and I’m going to have to ... live with the consequences,” Embiid said to Hayes. Embiid continued, with several instances of profanity in the next few sentences. Hayes offered an apology, which Embiid did not want. “That’s not the f——— first time,” Embiid said. Embiid later said that he doesn’t care what reporters say. “But you do,” Hayes answered. Embiid appeared to get louder at that point, and not long afterward pushed Hayes on the shoulder while the team’s public relations chief got between them. Another PR person moved Tyrese Maxey’s interview to the hallway outside the locker room, trying to clear reporters. Embiid was the No. 3 pick in the 2014 draft but missed his first two full seasons with injuries. Since his first full season in 2016, he has played in 433 of a possible 805 regular-season games and only 59 of 67 possible playoff games. The next four years will change America forever.

The social media personality, whose full name was Isabella Francis Bradford, died Oct. 15 at age 24, according to an online obituary. In footage recorded before her death and shared to TikTok last week, Bradford expressed gratitude to her followers for their support and said she hoped they’d continue to revisit her earlier posts when they needed “a pick-me-up” in the future. “Unfortunately my life has, by now, come to an end, and I’ve passed away,” she said in the clip. “Remember that you live every day, and you only die once, so make every day count.” Watch an E! News report on Bradford’s death below. The video was part of Bradford’s “get ready with me” series, in which she shared her advice on fashion and beauty. The footage showed her wearing a St. Agni dress paired with a white cardigan and black ballet flats. In a caption accompanying the video, Bradford said, “Filming these videos truly brought me a sense of [purpose] ... in my final few months and also connected me with a very kind community of people.” She added, “I wish you all a beautiful life.” The caption acknowledged that Bradford died while “surrounded by the people she loves most.” Bradford had been diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare form of soft-tissue cancer that affected her jaw, in 2021. She spoke at length about her diagnosis in a TikTok posted in May. “I thought it was my wisdom teeth. Turns out it wasn’t,” she said in that video. Though she’d undergone chemotherapy and multiple surgeries to reconstruct her jaw following the diagnosis, she added, “Unfortunately, I’m incurable.” According to her obituary, Bradford “is survived by her mum, Jill, sister Ash, extended family and many close friends.” She was predeceased by her father, with the obit saying, “May she rest in peace as she joins her beloved dad, Brian.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-us-navy-fat-leonard_n_672a92c2e4b05debb72c75f3","'Fat Leonard,' Navy Contractor Behind One Of Military's Biggest Scandals, Is Sentenced","ap","2024-11-05","SAN DIEGO (AP) — Former military defense contractor Leonard “Fat Leonard” Francis was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years in prison for masterminding a decade-long bribery scheme that swept up dozens of U.S. Navy officers, federal prosecutors said. U.S. District Judge Janis L. Sammartino also ordered Francis to pay $20 million in restitution to the Navy and a $150,000 fine, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. He was also ordered to forfeit $35 million in “ill-gotten proceeds from his crimes,” the statement said. Prosecutors said the sentence results from Leonard’s first guilty plea in 2015 concerning bribery and fraud, his extensive cooperation with the government since then, and another guilty plea Tuesday for failing to appear for his original sentencing hearing in 2022. Shortly before he was due to be sentenced in September 2022, Leonard cut off a GPS monitor he was wearing while under house arrest and fled the country. He was later arrested in Venezuela and brought back to the U.S. in December 2023. Sammartino sentenced him to more than 13 1/2 years for the bribery and fraud charges plus 16 months for failing to appear, to be served consecutively. “Leonard Francis lined his pockets with taxpayer dollars while undermining the integrity of U.S. Naval forces,” U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath said in Tuesday’s statement. ”The impact of his deceit and manipulation will be long felt, but justice has been served today.” Prosecutors said Francis’ actions led to one of the biggest bribery investigations in U.S. military history, which resulted in the conviction and sentencing of nearly two dozen Navy officials, defense contractors and others on various fraud and corruption charges. An enigmatic figure who was 6-foot-3 and weighed 350 pounds at one time, Francis owned and operated his family’s ship servicing business, Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd. or GDMA, which supplied food, water and fuel to vessels. The Malaysian defense contractor was a key contact for U.S. Navy ships at ports across Asia for more than two decades. During that time, Francis wooed naval officers with Kobe beef, expensive cigars, concert tickets and wild sex parties at luxury hotels from Thailand to the Philippines. In exchange, officers, including the first active-duty admiral to be convicted of a federal crime, concealed the scheme in which Francis would overcharge for supplying ships or charge for fake services at ports he controlled in Southeast Asia. The officers passed him classified information and even went so far as redirecting military vessels to ports that were lucrative for his Singapore-based ship servicing company. In a federal sting, Francis was lured to San Diego on false pretenses and arrested at a hotel in September 2013. He pleaded guilty in 2015, admitting that he had offered more than $500,000 in cash bribes to Navy officials, defense contractors and others. Prosecutors say he bilked the Navy out of at least $35 million. As part of his plea deal, he cooperated with the investigation leading to the Navy convictions. He faced up to 25 years in prison. While awaiting sentencing, Francis was hospitalized and treated for renal cancer and other medical issues. After leaving the hospital, he was allowed to stay out of jail at a rental home, on house arrest with a GPS ankle monitor and security guards. But three weeks before his scheduled sentencing in September 2022, he snipped off his monitor and made a brazen escape, setting off an international search. Officials said he fled to Mexico, made his way to Cuba and eventually got to Venezuela. He was arrested more than two weeks after his disappearance — caught before he boarded a flight at the Simon Bolivar International Airport outside Caracas. Venezuelan officials said he intended to reach Russia. The cases were handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in an effort to be independent of the military justice system. But they have came under scrutiny. The felony convictions of four former Navy officers were vacated following allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Sammartino agreed to allow them to plead guilty to a misdemeanor and pay a $100 fine each. The next four years will change America forever.

On TikTok, people are sharing a new kind of “Get Ready With Me” video: a behind-the-scenes look at the long journeys some individuals are taking to cast a vote in person. These TikTokers have shared how they drove for nine hours or flew across state lines ― all because they felt voting in person was worth it, or necessary. Everyone wants to make sure their vote counts, whether it’s recorded via a mail-in ballot or at the polls. In most states, you can track the status of your mail-in ballot. In two-thirds of states, there is also a process for voters to “cure” the denial, which is the official election term for addressing mistakes in time for a ballot to be counted. This way, you can make sure your vote was received and accepted. And if you are determined to vote Tuesday at your designated polling place, take heart ― you’re not alone in this journey. HuffPost talked to five people who traveled to vote in person about what motivated them to do so in spite of the transportation costs. (Interviews have been lightly edited for clarity and length.) “I did not submit to vote absentee in time. My fiancé right now is in D.C. voting via ballot, and just this morning when he was walking to the ballot box, it was roped off, and there were police officers everywhere. So I know that there’s all these situations going on ... or there’s also ballot boxes being lit up on fire. And I was like, ‘Even if my ballot comes in time, I would just rather go to a polling station.’ I just knew it was really important to show up and just do my civic duty and speak for plenty of women who live in Pennsylvania who maybe they don’t feel comfortable voting blue. I represent several things. Being a woman, I’m from a family of immigrants. My mom’s from Puerto Rico, my biological father’s from Haiti, so yeah, I just really wanted to do it. I was at work all day on Monday, and then I told my boss, ‘I’m driving tonight to Pennsylvania from Washington, D.C.’ With all the traffic, it made the drive about three and a half hours. Got here around 9:30-10 p.m., because there was a lot of traffic building up. Got up this morning, woke up my brother. It was his first time voting ― he’s 20 ― and got to walk with my dad, my brother and vote. I’m from Lancaster County. Lancaster County is a city with a lot of immigrants in it, but it also has a lot of people who are very proud to be Republican and wave their Trump flags very proudly. This is a city that can be a little bit more 50-50 so I know just having one more vote in here really matters. Sixty dollars [for driving to vote] kind of affected me a little bit ... but this amount for a tank of gas felt minuscule compared to the effects that it would have on me long term by not voting.” ― Betsey, who asked to not share her full name, who drove from Washington, D.C., to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania “I live in Arkansas, but I’m temporarily living in Texas, so I needed to drive to Arkansas to come vote because that’s where I’m registered. That’s my permanent address. Had to wait until I got off work yesterday. By that point, big storms were rolling in, and so the first few hours of my drive were very stressful. I couldn’t see anything with the rain pouring down ... I was just praying. I had the Christmas music going in the background to lighten the mood. But hopefully, it’s definitely worth it to be able to vote and make sure my voice is heard and hopefully make some history. I could have requested to vote absentee, I am just very passionate and wanted to vote in person and just be part of that experience. I’m hoping that me and my mom are voting for the first woman president.” ― Savannah Henthorne, who drove from Allen, Texas, to Greenbrier, Arkansas “I was actually registered in Fulton County, Georgia, and I asked for a mail-in ballot to be sent to my mother’s house in the middle-end of September. She lives in Charleston, South Carolina; I’m going to be up there helping her renovate a house that she just bought. I never received a ballot. I’ve been very patient. I’ve waited, and I kind of knew after a certain point, ’I’m going to have to probably make a drive down there if it doesn’t show up in the mail.’I started around 11:30 p.m. and I got to Fulton County around a little after 4:30 a.m. and then I stopped to use a bathroom ... I did want to take a nap. I couldn’t for a couple reasons. One was the energy drink just had me awake. But two, I was afraid that I would be so tired, because I’ve been up for almost 24 hours at that point, that I wouldn’t hear an alarm on my phone. I got to my polling place right at 5 a.m. I was the first voter there. I felt like I needed to be there and my vote would matter more than me being like, ‘Oh, it’s too long of a drive.’ I also used to drive trucks, so I’m used to long drives anyway. I could have used that $200 [round trip for gas and snacks] to go somewhere else. I kind of needed it to go somewhere else, but I’m like, ‘I can make the $200 back later.’ So it’s definitely worth the cost. It is very special to me to see Kamala Harris win the race. I truly do believe she’ll win, and she’ll take the necessary steps to make this a progressive country again.” ― Zyereri Jackson, who drove from Charleston, South Carolina, to Fulton County, Georgia “I have ADHD, so I have a little bit of issues with procrastination. The closeness of the election was about the time when I started to get a little nervous about it. I’m living in Colorado currently, and I tried to remove my registration in Washington and I tried to register in Colorado. However, I couldn’t request an absentee ballot, because it was too close to the election at that time. So I couldn’t vote in Grand Junction where I go to school, so I had to come to Denver to vote in person where my license is registered. I took a six-hour [and a half] bus ride to be here today to vote. It was a lot. And I don’t like bus rides. Pretty much from the time that I got that letter [informing me I was too late to vote by mail], there was no hesitation on my end. The only concern was finding the money for the bus ticket. It was like $45 each way. So it’s going to be [around] $90 total, which as a broke college student was a lot. But once I was able to obtain that, I essentially never thought about anything other than going ― I just felt it was that important to me.” ― Lena Conn, who traveled from Grand Junction, Colorado, to Denver “I’m an opera singer, and I live in Atlanta, Georgia ... I got very lucky with my schedule. I just happened to be in between performances at the Metropolitan Opera in New York right now ... I had to ask for a release from the Metropolitan Opera, and they very graciously gave me one to be able to travel. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

And number two: Quite honestly, the Postal Service in the state has been just absurdly slow in the last couple of years. I figured, if I have the option of flying from New York and I can just be here to make sure that my vote is counted, then that’s probably the best thing. And so that’s why I chose to fly back. I remember the flight cost being above the $500 mark. I’m very conscious of the fact that I’m financially privileged enough to be able to do this and not worry about the cost of it so much. But that being said, it’s absolutely worth it to me as a woman, as a queer person as well ― I feel this election is existential. If I had not had the opportunity to fly back, I absolutely would have been doing mail-in ballot. I would have participated no matter what, but this just made me feel more secure.” ― Jamie Barton, who flew from New York City to Atlanta By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

On Tuesday, Trump seemed irate that Fox had aired recent footage of TV legend Oprah Winfrey, who’d suggested the night before that if Trump were to retake the White House, “it is entirely possible that we will not have the opportunity to ever cast a ballot again.” “I think it’s ridiculous,” Trump said of Winfrey’s remarks after casting his own vote in Florida. The presidential candidate said he was “disappointed” in Winfrey for warning about the dangers of a second Trump term while stumping for his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, at a Monday rally in Philadelphia. “I think Oprah’s become a major divider in our country, and I think frankly she should be ashamed of herself,” he continued, before pivoting his criticism away from the former talk show host. “You know who else should be ashamed? Fox,” he went on. “I’ve seen Oprah on Fox about 50 times making the same statement, and I think it’s a disgrace what Fox does.” Trump: You know who else should be ashamed? Fox. I've seen Oprah on fox about 50 times making the same statement and I think it's a disgrace what fox does. Everyone thinks fox is so pro-trump. They aren't pro-trump at all. pic.twitter.com/3wORsyWtkE “Everyone thinks Fox is so pro-Trump,” he said. “They’re not pro-Trump at all. They’ve put Oprah on all morning long.” It’s not secret that Fox News, owned by the Fox Corp., has a conservative bent. But Trump has laid into the network multiple times in recent months over perceived slights. When Fox News covered Harris’ remarks after she visited the southern U.S. border in September, he claimed that the network shouldn’t have been “allowed” to air comments from the Democrat’s campaign stop. “It’s all lies. It’s all lies,” he said at a rally in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. “Everything she said is a lie.” The next four years will change America forever.

Like, don’t you get enough of me and your dad?’” Barrymore said Monday on her eponymous talk show. “And they were just so happy.” “I was like, ‘Oh, but this is so sweet and wonderful,’” she continued. Fans of the two actors, who also co-starred in 2014’s “Blended,” were certainly smitten. “Love these 2 Together! I even enjoyed Blended. I don’t care what anyone says, Blended was Awesome,” one person wrote Monday on social media. Another fan commented simply: “Awww.” Barrymore shares two daughters, 12-year-old Olive and 10-year-old Frankie, with her ex-husband Will Kopelman. (It’s not clear which of her daughters she found watching the movie.) Sandler and his wife Jackie share two daughters, Sunny, 16, and Sadie, 18. “50 First Dates” reunited Sandler and Barrymore after the 1998 hit “The Wedding Singer,” and centered on a playboy (Sandler) who falls in love with a sun-soaked art teacher (Barrymore) who has anterograde amnesia — and can’t remember a single day after the accident that caused it. “50 First Dates” went on to win a 2004 MTV Movie Award for “Best On-Screen Team.” The film seemed to come up organically Monday when Barrymore’s guest, “Young Sheldon” star Emily Osment, said she “sobbed” after recently watching it for the first time. She told Barrymore it must be “comforting” to find her daughter enjoying one of her pictures. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Sgt. Quandarius Stanley, 23, was a motor transport operator and was critically injured when high winds and heavy seas damaged the pier, causing four Army vessels to become beached. Two other service members also were injured but later returned to duty. U.S. military officials have not provided details on how exactly Stanley was injured but have noted it was not in combat. He died last Thursday and had been assigned to the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia. “Sgt. Quandarius Stanley was an instrumental and well respected first-line leader in the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary (TBX), especially during the mission to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. We will continue to provide support to his family during this difficult time,” said Col. John “Eddie” Gray, brigade commander. “Our entire unit mourns alongside his family.” Capt. Shkeila Milford-Glover, spokesperson for the 3rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command, said Stanley had recently been retired and was receiving treatment in a long-term care medical center. The massive pier project was hampered by unexpected bad weather and security issues, as well as persistent safety issues involving Israeli forces that prompted aid agencies to halt distribution of the supplies out of fear of being injured and killed.

But aid agencies had difficulty moving the food brought ashore to areas further into Gaza where it was needed most because humanitarian convoys came under attack.

Farage, who attended Trump’s Monday night rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, urged the former president to accept the results for the sake of U.S. democracy if a “clear” result is produced after Election Day. “If it was clear and decisive then maybe it’s time [for Trump] to go and play golf at Turnberry,” he told The Telegraph in an interview, referring to the Trump Organization’s golf resort in Scotland. The longtime Trump ally and leader of the right-wing populist Reform UK party also acknowledged having “huge doubts about election integrity,” calling the U.S. voting system “abhorrent.” Still, Farage told the Telegraph, “I have never gone along with the stolen election narrative” that Trump and his followers pushed after the Republican’s 2020 loss. He stressed that another insurrection attempt like the one on Jan. 6, 2021, was not the answer. “If it [the outcome] was clear, then Republicans have to accept the result,” Farage explained. “The whole point of voting is we don’t need to fight. It is what we fought two world wars for. We settle our differences with the ballot box.” Farage, however, was quick to note that his thoughts were “all hypothetical,” adding: “I still think he is going to win.” The British politician, who also attended the Republican National Convention in July, got a shout-out from Trump at Monday’s rally. “He was the big winner of the last election in the U.K.,” Trump said, alluding to Farage’s July 5 victory after seven unsuccessful attempts at getting elected to the House of Commons. “He’s a little bit of a rebel, but that’s good. Don’t change, Nigel.” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-supporters-in-garbage-bags-stumped_n_672a3687e4b0be8c956ab610","Trump Supporters In Garbage Bags Stumped When Comedian Points Out Their Logic Is Trash","elyse wanshel","2024-11-05","It seems when you ask Donald Trump’s supporters what kind of statement they’re trying to make by wearing garbage bags, you get a dumpster fire of conflicting answers. On Sunday, The Good Liars — a political comedy duo consisting of Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler — published a short clip on X, formerly Twitter, of Stiefler interviewing two Trump supporters at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Trump supporters Stiefler spoke to were wearing black garbage bags decorated with American flags that boasted the words “Proud to be Trump’s Garbage.” The proclamation on the garbage bags refers to President Joe Biden seemingly calling Trump supporters “garbage” during an interview with Voto Latino last week. Biden’s remark came in response to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s hate-fueled set at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally in Manhattan days prior in which Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico an “island of garbage” and made other racist and antisemitic remarks. The White House later said that Biden was calling the underlying rhetoric at Trump’s rally “garbage” rather than his supporters, but Trump and his campaign decided to capitalize on the comment. And although Vice President Kamala Harris is Trump’s actual adversary in the 2024 presidential race — and said as recently as Monday that she wants to be “a president for all” — Trump added fuel to the fire last week by showing up for a photo-op in a garbage truck. Now Trump’s supporters have decided to apparently “own” Biden’s “garbage” label and dress in trash bags as a signifier of their loyalty. “The current so-called president of the United States called Trump supporters garbage,” a man decked out in a trash bag explained to Stiefler in the Good Liar’s clip. “So we showed up as garbage!” a similarly costumed woman said proudly. “And so, can you tell me how wearing the garbage bag proves that you are not garbage?” Stiefler asked. In response to his question, the woman spun around excitedly to show the message on the back of her bag that read, “Biden calls us garbage, Trump calls us Americans.” “Right, but you’re dressed as Biden defined you,” Stiefler pointed out. “Not as Trump defined you.” The garbage bags are confusing. pic.twitter.com/qXyk7anwLa This seemed to stump the woman, who responded by nervously laughing and stammering, “Well … .” “Well, I think … we’re taking it as a joke at this point,” the male Trump supporter finally responded. “Like it would make sense if you were wearing an American flag, and you said, ‘Biden calls us garbage, and Trump calls us Americans,’” Stiefler said. “I’m confused,” the woman admitted before the clip ends. In the full video of Stiefler’s interviews at the Greensboro rally published to The Good Liar’s YouTube account Sunday, other Trump supporters offered conflicting reasons for donning trash liners. “I’m proud to be trash if it’s under Mr. Trump. Absolutely,” one woman told Stiefler. “It’s a statement,” the woman added later about her plastic ensemble. “It doesn’t prove that I’m not trash, it doesn’t prove that I am. But it makes the statement that if you’re going to call me trash because of what I believe in, then I’m going to stand by what I believe in, no matter what you say to me.” “What if Joe Biden would’ve been like, ‘Trump supporters — they hit their fingers with hammers,’” Stiefler asked. “Then I would probably get a plastic hammer,” the woman responded with a laugh. In an interview with another male Trump supporter — who said the trash bag he was wearing communicated that “We are deplorables, we’re garbage, we’re anything they want, but what we are as Americans, we’re Trump people” — Stiefler offered a similarly goofy scenario. “What if Joe Biden said, ‘You know, Trump supporters — they’ll leave a glass of milk on the counter for like, six hours until it curdles and then they’ll chug it and they’ll have tummy troubles all day.’ Would you be doing that?” Stiefler asked. “That’s silly,” the man responded. “It is a silly question,” Stiefler admitted. “It is a silly question,” the man reiterated. But Stiefler had a zinger for this man. “But, the garbage bag. Not silly?” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Keoghan explained that while he used to openly share photos of his baby boy online, he’s since stopped being as transparent with his personal life because “people love” to use his son as “ammunition.” “People kind of have a judgment on me as a parent,” Keoghan said during the episode released on Nov. 5. “I’m like, well, until you’ve walked a day in my shoes growing up as a kid, then you can comment… There’s a lot online. If I didn’t have tough skin or the strength I have, I wouldn’t be sitting here.” The Irish actor continued, “The more in the public I’ve become, the less I’ve posted about my child, because I don’t think it’s fair to put my child online, there’s sick people out there.” Keoghan said since he’s “reined” in his posts about his son, internet trolls have begun to “draw a narrative and go ‘absent father, sh*t deadbeat dad’ and more disgusting things that I wouldn’t even repeat.” “Just the audacity of some people, man, it sickens me more than it makes me furious,” he added. Only one post remains on Keoghan’s Instagram account of his son at this time: an adorable selfie of the pair playing with toys. Keoghan, who previously opened up to GQ about growing up in Dublin, Ireland, without a father and losing his mother at age 12 after she died of a heroin overdose, shared how judgment over his parenting skills has emotionally impacted him. “Of course, it’s going to affect me being a father when I had no blueprint to take from. People just read that [as] laziness and go, ‘Oh, that’s no excuse to be an absent father,’” he said during the podcast interview. Keoghan then insisted, “I’m not an absent father.” The “Eternals” alum said that the cyberbullying has extended to comments about his appearance. “Especially on TikTok… people can sit there and make videos and be like ‘I don’t like his face, he looks weird, or he looks evil’ and just pick you apart,” he shared.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chatgpt-argument_l_6729047ce4b05debb72b89a2","Couples Are Using ChatGPT To Resolve Arguments. Is That Lazy Or Brilliant?","brittany wong","2024-11-05","For people who turn to ChatGPT for nearly everything, there are three sides to every argument in a relationship: theirs, their partners’ and ChatGPT’s. “Pretty sure my wife just apologised through chatgpt,” one husband wrote on Reddit, showing the mea culpa and saying he wasn’t entirely mad about it. “Honestly, I think it’s a pretty thoughtful apology,” he said. Others are less enthused. “My girlfriend uses Chat GPT every time we have a disagreement.” one man wrote in a viral Reddit post last month, explaining that his partner will sometimes start talking to the artificial intelligence text chatbot while he’s right there in the room. “Am i the asshole for asking her to stop using chat gpt in this context?” Baron, a 40-year-old from London, said he also uses ChatGPT as a resource in interpersonal conflicts. (Baron asked HuffPost to use his first name only to protect his and his wife’s privacy.) “When it comes to arguments, I tend to be a sulker,” he said. “I decided to use ChatGPT while in one of my sulks.” It’s good at taking heated, loaded or even passive-aggressive text messages and removing all of the emotional charge that sometimes makes communicating in the moment so hard, Baron explained. “For those who may not have access to mental health services, using ChatGPT is one way to access some sort of resource for guidance.” Baron’s wife often feels like the burden of making decisions — small or large — falls on her shoulders, with him making little to no effort. So he’s used ChatGPT to find a solution. “ChatGPT suggested we could implement a system by which my wife could collect all the options over a period of time and then present them to me in ‘batches,’” he said. “That way, it didn’t feel to me like we were revisiting the same decision multiple times per day, and to her it didn’t feel like I wasn’t interested at all.” Cynthia Shaw, a psychologist who practices in New York and New Jersey, has heard about couples turning to AI for help and sees the benefit. “For those who may not have access to mental health services, using ChatGPT is one way to access some sort of resource for guidance,” she said. AI technology like ChatGPT can essentially compile information gleaned from professional advice columns and therapists’ lifestyle articles. For a question about the household division of labor, it might tell you: Let your wife know you see her perspective when she asks you to take out the trash and load the dishwasher. Explain that you feel overwhelmed when she makes consecutive demands of you. Is it “fair” to recruit AI in a fight to essentially tell you what to do? Shaw thinks it comes down to a person’s intention. “What is the reason someone is resorting to the use of artificial intelligence? Is it to help craft the ‘perfect apology,’ or is it to look for information as to how to engage in active listening?” she said. “The former may seem a bit shallow, whereas the latter may seem more sincere, as if someone is trying to learn so that they can incorporate this in future interactions.” Baron, the frequent ChatGPT user, agrees with that take. “If you’re using GPT to tell you what to say in order to ‘win’ an argument, unless it’s a kind of in-joke argument that doesn’t cause emotional distress, then I think you’ve got bigger problems than just the immediate fight,” he said. “Arguments should be resolved, not won or lost.” If you want to recruit ChatGPT as a mediator in a very emotionally charged situation, mental health experts who spoke to HuffPost had some advice. See what they had to say below. In heated conflicts, emotions can cloud judgment, making it difficult to communicate in a calm, rational way. Janet Bayramyan, a trauma therapist in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, thinks ChatGPT can serve to de-escalate intense emotional responses by suggesting more measured language. “For people who have difficulty expressing their thoughts clearly, or who tend to communicate in ways that escalate conflict ― for instance, using defensive language ― ChatGPT can offer alternative phrasing that promotes collaboration rather than defensiveness,” she said. Some people find conflict distressing and may freeze up or avoid addressing issues because they’re unsure how to approach them, Bayramyan said. For those people, “ChatGPT can provide a nonjudgmental space for rehearsing conversations or processing emotions, helping them feel more confident when engaging in real-life dialogue,” she said. Another perk, according to Shaw? Due to the perceived lack of judgment from ChatGPT, people may be more receptive to alternative perspectives. “We may feel less as if we need to defend ourselves,” Shaw said. Melanie McNally, a psychologist in Arlington Heights, Illinois, is concerned that when people use ChatGPT, they might not be gaining the clarity that they’re likely seeking. “That’s because people structure the prompts from their own biased perspective, [so] the responses could also be biased,” she said. “ChatGPT isn’t going to challenge you about your own role in the conflict or help you understand someone else’s perspective, unless you ask it directly.” And if you’re apologizing, ChatGPT can’t do the emotional work of actually being repentant. “Ultimately, I think when people use ChatGPT to resolve conflict, they might be missing a great opportunity to learn more about their partner, themselves and how to self-regulate,” McNally explained. Disagreements can be complex and require reading nonverbal body language, understanding someone else’s perspective and background, and so much more, she said. “Just remember that ChatGPT can’t do those things for us,” McNally advised. Using ChatGPT as a mediator might be beneficial for people on the neurodivergent spectrum, as those with differences in brain functioning may struggle to interpret body language, pick up on nonverbal cues or empathize with a partner’s emotions. “One of the reasons I think ChatGPT has been good for my wife and I is because we’re both neurodivergent,” Baron said. “I have ADHD [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder] and my wife has Asperger’s, so communication between us can sometimes be a minefield.” If you want to use ChatGPT to help work through your emotions, Bayramyan said to reflect on questions like: What am I really upset about? What do I need from my partner? What do I want to communicate? “While ChatGPT can offer helpful insights or suggestions, it’s critical that you do the emotional work yourself. Authentic communication requires emotional presence, vulnerability and active engagement,” she said. “Let ChatGPT help you prep, but remember: The real work happens between you and your spouse.” Not everyone feels that recruiting ChatGPT into an argument is fair. Some might say it’s outsourcing emotional work. (In a Reddit thread where someone posted about using ChatGPT, one person responded: “If I was married and I found out my wife used a soulless, unfeeling chatbot to apologize for something, I’d be pissed. I wouldn’t want something to defuse my rage, I’d want an honest apology.”) Natalie Grierson, a mental health counselor in Dayton, Ohio, said she understands that perspective. “If someone doesn’t share that they used ChatGPT to inform their responses in an argument, their partner may feel ‘duped’ and betrayed if they find out,” she told HuffPost. Additionally, there is a potential risk to sincerity, which is instrumental in resolving conflict. “If a partner discovers their loved one used AI to apologize or express empathy, it may feel disingenuous or careless,” Grierson said. There are some great use cases for ChatGPT outside of fights, Grierson noted. “For example, I typed in ‘Tell me tips for communicating effectively with my spouse,’ and ChatGPT gave me 10 solid strategies for interpersonal effectiveness, including guidance to actively listen, use empathy and remain open to feedback,” she said. “Partners who want to learn more about practical communication tools may benefit from ChatGPT.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Obviously, ChatGPT lacks the ability to fully understand the nuances of your specific situation — your past relationship patterns, for instance, or what resentments or issues you and your girlfriend hold. It can offer general advice or conflict resolution techniques, but it may miss important context or sensitivities that could impact the outcome, Bayramyan said. “‘Fair’ fighting, whether you’re using ChatGPT or not, requires both parties to be present, listen and express their feelings authentically,” she said. “While ChatGPT might help organize thoughts or calm an overly emotional response, it can create an imbalance if one partner is outsourcing their emotional work while the other is putting in full effort.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Online bidding has started and will continue through Dec. 7, Heritage Auctions in Dallas announced in a news release Monday. The auction company received the sequin-and-bead-bedazzled slippers from Michael Shaw, the memorabilia collector who originally owned the footwear at the heart of the beloved 1939 musical. Shaw had loaned the shoes in 2005 to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. That summer, someone smashed through a display case and stole the slippers. Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Now the museum is among those vying for the slippers, which were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only four remain. Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival. The funds will supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to purchase the slippers. The man who stole the slippers, Terry Jon Martin, was 76 when he was sentenced in January to time served because of his poor health. He admitting to using a hammer to smash the glass of the museum’s door and display case in what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off “one last score” after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value.

Click here for the video. The declaration before her son quarterbacked the Chiefs to a home victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers counters Taylor Swift’s political stance. Swift rocked the world with her Kamala Harris endorsement over the summer and is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The “Anti-Hero” singer still appeared to be friendly with Mahomes’ wife Brittany after the latter reportedly “liked” a Trump social media post about his campaign platform. She then lashed out at people who made disparaging comments and got a thank-you from the Republican nominee for her support in early September. As for the three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback, he’s staying mum on the endorsement front. “I’ve always said, I don’t want my place and my platform to be used to endorse a candidate or do whatever, either way,” he said earlier in the season.

I do not have to sit somewhere with my heating pad plugged in anymore. This one is portable and amazing. I highly recommend it!” — Madison Garnes “The doctor at ER suggested getting one of these instead of a regular heating pad for warm compresses for an ear infection.

I came across this while just casually searching for something else to help and I ordered it immediately. Not only does this have 3 heat settings, it has 3 vibration settings as well(which help distract from the pain). This gets so hot and it soothes the cramps perfectly. It also has an adjustable stretchy strap so you can discreetly wear to work/school/store/etc I highly recommend this product to anyone with severe cramps that make ... periods horrible for you.” — Lauren Lines By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He was 95. Marcus died Monday in Boca Raton, Florida, surrounded by family, according to a Home Depot spokesperson. Marcus was Home Depot’s CEO as it grew rapidly during its first two decades, and was chairman of the board until his retirement in 2002. In recent years, he became an outspoken supporter of former president Donald Trump. “We owe an immeasurable debt of gratitude to Bernie,” the company said in a statement. “He was a master merchant and a retail visionary. But even more importantly, he valued our associates, customers and communities above all. He’s left us with an invaluable legacy and the backbone of our company: our values and culture. ” The son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Marcus was born in 1929 and grew up in a tenement in Newark, New Jersey, according to a biography on the company’s website. Marcus had aspirations of becoming a doctor, but his family couldn’t afford medical school and he endeavored to become a pharmacist, receiving a degree from Rutgers University. Marcus used to say he’d skip classes to sell Amana freezers door-to-door, according to Home Depot. After college, Marcus worked at the manufacturing conglomerate O’Dell’s and the retail chain Vornado, quickly ascending the corporate ladder. By 1972, Marcus was chairman and president of Handy Dan Improvement Centers, part of the Daylin conglomerate. It was there that Marcus formed a lifelong friendship with Arthur Blank. The big moment in his career arrived after he was fired by Handy Dan in 1978, along with Blank. Marcus had dreamt of a one-stop shop for do-it-yourselfers. At age 49, Marcus, along with Blank, founded Home Depot. Investment banker Ken Langone helped to secure financing to get The Home Depot started, according to the company.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-ml-israel-politics-netanyahu-yoav-gallant_n_672a6140e4b05debb72c5a82","Israel's Netanyahu Dismisses His Defense Minister As Wars Rage. Protests Erupt Across The Country.","ap","2024-11-05","JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday dismissed his popular defense minister, Yoav Gallant, in a surprise announcement that came as the country is embroiled in wars on multiple fronts across the region. The move sparked protests across the country, including a mass gathering that paralyzed central Tel Aviv. Netanyahu and Gallant have repeatedly been at odds over the war in Gaza. But Netanyahu had avoided firing his rival before taking the step as the world’s attention was focused on the U.S. presidential election. Netanyahu cited “significant gaps” and a “crisis of trust” in his Tuesday evening announcement as he replaced Gallant with a longtime loyalist. “In the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and defense minister,” Netanyahu said. “Unfortunately, although in the first months of the campaign there was such trust and there was very fruitful work, during the last months this trust cracked between me and the defense minister.” In the early days of the war, Israel’s leadership presented a unified front as it responded to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack. But as the war has dragged on and spread to Lebanon, key policy differences have emerged. While Netanyahu has called for continued military pressure on Hamas, Gallant had taken a more pragmatic approach, saying that military force has created the necessary conditions for at least a temporary diplomatic deal that could bring home hostages held by the militant group. In a late-night news conference broadcast on national TV, Gallant said that he had disagreed with Netanyahu over three main issues: the need to end controversial exemptions from the military draft for ultra-Orthodox men, the urgent need for a hostage deal and the need to establish an official commission of inquiry into the political and security failures of Oct. 7, when Hamas militants stormed into Israel and killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel estimates that about 100 hostages remain in captivity, only about 65 of them still alive. With military service compulsory for most Jews, Gallant said that drafting the ultra-Orthodox was both an issue of fairness and security at a time when Israel faces so many challenges. He said a hostage deal was needed “as quickly as possible, when they are still alive” and said there will be “no forgiveness” for neglecting them. And he said a full investigation into the events of Oct. 7 was the only way to ensure the government would learn the proper lessons. Netanyahu has rejected calls for an inquiry, saying it should only take place when the war is over. Gallant ended his statement by honoring the soldiers serving in the army and those who have died in the wars. He held up his hand and saluted as he walked away from the podium. Many of the families of the hostages, along with tens of thousands of people who have joined anti-government protests, accuse Netanyahu of scuttling a deal in order to maintain his hold on power. Netanyahu’s hard-line partners have threatened to bring down the government if he makes concessions to Hamas, raising the risk of early elections at a time when the prime minister’s popularity is low. This week, authorities announced the arrest of a Netanyahu aide on suspicion of leaking classified information to foreign media that gave the prime minister political cover as hostage talks fell apart. “Firing Gallant in the middle of a war is an act of madness,” opposition leader Yair Lapid said on X. “Netanyahu is selling Israel’s security and the Israeli army soldiers for a disgraceful political survival.” Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, whose largely ceremonial office is meant to help unify the country, called the dismissal “the last thing Israel needs.” The grassroots forum representing hostage families said Gallant’s dismissal is “a direct continuation of the ‘efforts’ to torpedo the abductee deal.” Within hours, thousands of protesters gathered in central Tel Aviv, blocking the city’s main highway and crippling traffic. The crowd, many holding blue and white Israeli flags and others blowing whistles and pounding drums, gathered around multiple bonfires. Several thousand people demonstrated outside Netanyahu’s home in Jerusalem and elsewhere in the city. Protesters gathered and blocked roads in several other spots across the country, and Israeli TV stations showed images of police scuffling with protesters. The dismissal comes at a delicate time. Israeli troops remain bogged down in Gaza, over a year after invading the territory in a war that has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, including tens of thousands of civilians, and caused widespread destruction, while Israeli ground troops are pressing ahead with a month-old ground invasion against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed in the fighting. Israel also has clashed with Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and is facing the possibility of another strike by Iran. Iran has vowed to avenge an Israeli strike that came in response to an Oct. 1 Iranian missile attack, itself a reprisal for earlier Israeli attacks on Iranian-linked targets. On Monday, Gallant announced he had sent out thousands of draft notices to young ultra-Orthodox men. The system of exemptions for religious men has bred widespread resentment among the secular majority, and Israel’s Supreme Court has ordered the government to scrap the system. Netanyahu, whose governing coalition depends on ultra-Orthodox parties, has not yet implemented the order. Channel 13 TV said Netanyahu had also taken advantage of the U.S. election, when American attention is focused elsewhere, to dismiss his rival. The White House on Tuesday declined to comment on the firing but called Gallant “an important partner on all matters related to the defense of Israel.” “As close partners, we will continue to work collaboratively with Israel’s next minister of defense,” the White House National Security Council said. Gallant, a former general with a gruff, no-nonsense demeanor, has emerged as the most popular figure with the public in Israel’s wartime government. Gallant has worn a simple, black buttoned shirt throughout the war in a sign of sorrow over the Oct. 7 attack and developed a strong relationship with his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. A previous attempt by Netanyahu to fire Gallant in March 2023 sparked widespread street protests against Netanyahu. He also flirted with the idea of dismissing Gallant over the summer but held off until Tuesday’s announcement. Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Katz thanked Netanyahu and pledged to lead the security establishment to victory in the wars against Israel’s enemies. Katz, 69, was a junior officer in the military decades ago and has little military experience, though he has been a key member of Netanyahu’s Security Cabinet over the years. Gideon Saar, a former Netanyahu rival who rejoined the government in September, will take the foreign affairs post. Netanyahu has a long history of neutralizing his rivals. In his statement, he claimed he had made “many attempts” to bridge the gaps with Gallant. “But they kept getting wider,” he said. “Our enemies enjoyed it and derived a lot of benefit from it.” The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/baby-names-kamala-donald-election_l_67298d08e4b0266a345882c3","How The Presidential Election Could Impact Baby Names","caroline bologna","2024-11-05","What’s in a name? In the 2024 presidential election cycle, the answer is: Perhaps more than you think. Throughout former President Donald Trump’s campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump has mocked and attacked Harris’ racial identity, her laugh and even her given name. The Republican nominee and fellow GOP-ers have intentionally misspelled “Kamala” and mispronounced it as “ka-MALA” or “Camilla” in a seeming attempt to ridicule and “other” the opposing candidate, who was born in California to immigrant parents from India and Jamaica. But does all this talk of names impact the actual naming choices parents in the U.S. will make when they welcome newborns? We asked experts to weigh in on the influence of presidential politics on baby names and the popularity of “Kamala” and “Donald.” “In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, parents regularly named their children after their political heroes,” Abby Sandel, the creator of the baby name blog Appellation Mountain, told HuffPost. “Even a name as unlikely as Cleveland spiked in use for boys in 1885, the year Grover Cleveland became the 22nd president of the United States.” According to the Social Security Administration’s data, the name Grover also saw a huge surge as Cleveland hit the national political scene ― rising from No. 104 for boys in 1883 to No. 20 in 1884 and 1885. “Losing candidates could prove influential, too,” Sandel noted. “William Jennings Bryan lost the 1896 election, but Bryan more than quintupled in use that year anyway.” Although presidential politics influenced baby names into the 20th century, parents eventually started to shift away from the trend. “Franklin peaked in 1933 at No. 33 when FDR was elected, Truman peaked in 1945 at No. 247 when Harry Truman was elected, and Woodrow jumped from No. 232 to No. 46 between 1911 and 1912, during his campaign for president,” said Nameberry editor-in-chief Sophie Kihm. “This effect started to slow by the Kennedy administration.” She noted that the name Kennedy entered the list of 1,000 most popular names for boys for the first time in 1960, the year John F. Kennedy was elected president, and rose to No. 592 in his first year in office. But the name didn’t peak until 1964, following his assassination. Although some suggest Reagan is an example of a popular presidential name, the moniker didn’t see major increases in popularity until the 1990s, after President Ronald Reagan had left office. “The popularity of the name Reagan had more to do with the 1973 movie ‘The Exorcist’ than Ronald Reagan’s landslide wins in 1980 and 1984,” Sandel explained. “In fact, the names Ronald and Reagan both fell in use during his time in office.” She emphasized that most U.S. presidents’ given names have been quite traditional in the last several decades, and it’s difficult to track how politics influence the popularity of names like James, George, William and Joseph. The same goes for John and Jack in the Kennedy era. “On the other hand, Barack Obama’s first name debuted in the U.S. popularity data in 2007 as he rose to national prominence,” Sandel added. “In 2009, 71 boys were named Barack, an all-time high. That suggests that a history-making Harris presidency could see the name Kamala climb.” “Kamala first debuted on the U.S. popularity charts in 1955, when it was given to six baby girls,” Kihm explained. “It peaked in 1964 ― the year Kamala Harris was born ― when it was given to 105 American baby girls.”She cited two cultural influences that likely contributed to the name Kamala’s 138% increase in popularity between 1963 and 1964. “The first is the remake of the Bollywood film ‘Thoratanchi Kamala,’ released in 1963, which features a character named Kamala as the protagonist,” Kihm said. “The second is Kamala Devi, a British-Indian actress who starred in film and television throughout the ’60s. She married American athlete and actor Chuck Connors in 1963.” Sandel pointed to the influence of British-Indian novelist Kamala Markandaya around the same period as well. The name Kamala declined in popularity over the subsequent decades, but it remained in the Social Security Administration’s data (which includes names given to five or more babies in a given year), with the exception of the years 2000 and 2010. The name reached its highest usage level in the 21st century in 2021 ― the year Harris took office as vice president ― when 25 baby Kamalas were born. “Last year, just seven girls were named Kamala,” Sandel noted. “Even a few dozen parents inspired to name their daughters after Harris would be noticeable.” If Harris wins the presidential election, Sandel believes there will be a small but measurable increase in the number of girls named Kamala, as her victory would represent a significant milestone, a la Obama and the name Barack. The prospect of a major popularity boost that lasts beyond her tenure seems less likely, however. “Kamala is a very rare name for babies these days, and it’s strongly tied to a particular set of cultures,” Kihm explained. “Kamala is virtually only used among Americans with Indian, Nepali, Sri Lankan and Azerbaijani heritage ― a small subset of the overall population ― and is unlikely to be used outside of that demographic whether or not she wins the presidency.” Many parents also hesitate to choose a name strongly associated with a singular figure, hence the decline of names like Beyoncé and Elon. Harris’ first name seems primed to meet the same fate for that reason. But Kamala does have some qualities that appeal to modern parents. After all, it sounds similar to the current No. 13 name, Camila (as well as other recent faves like Layla and Delilah). “Kamala has a beautiful meaning of ‘lotus flower or lotus blossom,’” said Heidi Prunkl, a name consultant and founder of Baby Name Sunday. “I can definitely see it rising, as both nature names and K-names are very sought out for as parents.” “Kamala also has an uncommon sound and an interesting ‘K’ initial that are intriguing to parents already considering names like Kaia, Kamila and Kehlani,” echoed baby name consultant and My Name for Life founder Sherri Suzanne. If the vice president wins the election, the name Harris could also get a boost after falling off the Top 1,000 list in 2021. “One of the strongest trends in contemporary naming in America is the transferred use of surnames to first names ― and presidential surnames are an abundant source,” Suzanne said. “Just check out the growing popularity of Lincoln, Hayes and Harrison.” Sandel recommended keeping an eye on Harris’ middle name Devi, which doubled in use between 2020 and 2023 and features the strong middle v-sound heard in popular picks like Ava, Evelyn, Sylvia and Jovie. “Devi could be the best of both worlds ― a subtle nod to a history-making figure and a very stylish choice, too,” she said. “We hear presidents’ full names far more often after they’re elected, in a way we never really hear many other officials’ full names. Think of George Herbert Walker Bush or William Jefferson Clinton. If Harris wins, expect to hear ‘Kamala Devi Harris’ during her inauguration.” “Donald was in the Top 10 for boys from 1923 to 1942 and then started to drop off slowly,” said Jennifer Moss, founder of BabyNames.com. “It is currently No. 657 for baby boys.” She added that Donald is also coincidentally the name of Kamala Harris’ father. “Donald is a classic name in the U.S., where it has always ranked in the Top 1,000,” Kihm said. “It peaked in 1934 at No. 6 for baby boys. Donald was a Top 50 name in the U.S. from 1907 through 1978, equating to over 1.3 million boys named Donald during that 70-year period alone. Namewise, Donald Trump is just a product of his time.” The name Donald has followed a general trajectory of decline since the late 1950s, dropping more precipitously in the 2000s. “After generations of Donalds, parents turned to more exciting options,” Kihm explained. “But the prevalence of Donald in previous generations is also what keeps it on the charts. There were so many Donalds in the past that it’s a common name for parents to use when naming a son after a family member or loved one — something parents have historically been more likely to do with baby boys than girls.” The name Donald has seen small popularity jumps in recent years, however. “It increased in rank — from No. 489 to 486 — between 2016 and 2017, when Trump was inaugurated,” Kihm said. “But this is not statistically significant. Percentage-wise, 0.031% of 2016 babies, totaling 625, were named Donald, compared to just 0.03% in 2017, totaling 602.” Another slight increase occurred in 2021 after Trump lost his reelection bid. The name jumped from No. 609 to 596 with the number of baby Donalds increasing from 449 to 467. But Donald then hit its lowest ranking in 2022 at No. 679. “There will likely be a small, rather insignificant bump in the name Donald in 2025, regardless of if he wins or loses,” Kihm said. “But most parents will continue to avoid this name because it’s simply unfashionable for 21st-century babies.” “Like Gerald and Shirley, there’s nothing fresh or interesting about Donald at the moment. It’s hard to imagine a second Trump presidency reversing that trend.” Sandel also believes the name Donald belongs to a different moment in time and will probably continue its general downward trajectory even if Trump wins the election. “Like Gerald and Shirley, there’s nothing fresh or interesting about Donald at the moment,” she said. “It’s hard to imagine a second Trump presidency reversing that trend.” Trump’s name seemingly fits with his executive office ambitions, however. “Donald has a very powerful meaning ― ruler or king of the world,” Prunkl said. “That can have a big impact on parents who love that name style of strong, leader-like meanings.” She noted that this meaning contrasts with the more beautiful sound and symbolism in the name Kamala.

But parents today tend to draw inspiration from different types of public figures. “In our modern era, presidential candidate names are unlikely to meaningfully rise or fall in popularity regardless of if they win or lose,” Kihm said. “Today, parents are much more impacted by celebrities and influencers than politicians when it comes to choosing baby names.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The retired NFL center addressed the now-viral incident at the top of this week’s “Monday Night Countdown,” admitting he wasn’t “proud” of what transpired ahead of the battle between Penn State and Ohio State. In widely circulated videos of the scuffle, an angry Kelce is seen swatting a phone out of a man’s hand after the man had badgered him with crude questions about his brother, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, who is in a relationship with pop star Taylor Swift. After the man had followed Jason Kelce through a crowd and called his younger brother a “faggot,” the former Philadelphia Eagles player whipped around, smashed the man’s phone and snapped back with the same anti-gay slur. 🚨JUST IN: #NFL legend Jason Kelce just apologized on ESPN for the incident that happened over this weekend.“I chose to greet hate with hate, and I just don't think that's a productive thing.” pic.twitter.com/o6xmJbF4NU Though other footage seemed to show the heckler hounding Kelce ahead of the confrontation, the sports anchor still apologized to his fans for losing his cool. “I’m not happy with anything that took place. I’m not proud of it,” he told ESPN viewers. “In a heated moment, I chose to greet hate with hate, and I just don’t think that’s a productive thing, I really don’t.” “I don’t think that it leads to discourse and it’s the right way to go about things,” he added. “And in that moment, I fell down to a level that I shouldn’t have.” “The bottom line is, I try to live my life by the golden rule, that’s what I’ve always been taught,” Kelce said. “I try to treat people with common decency and respect, and I’m going to keep doing that moving forward.” On Monday, People magazine reported that the Penn State University Police were looking into the weekend incident.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/texas-justice-department-election-monitors_n_672a4821e4b0be8c956ac009","Texas Will Allow Justice Department Monitors Outside — Not Inside — Polling Places","br,i buchman","2024-11-05","An agreement has been struck between Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and the Justice Department to allow the presence of federal election monitors outside of polling places in the Lone Star State on Election Day. According to an agreement filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas on Tuesday, election monitors from the Justice Department cannot go inside polling places or central count locations but are permitted to be outside to determine whether federal voting rights are being observed. The Justice Department announced on Nov. 1 that it would send compliance officials to 27 states and 86 jurisdictions across the U.S. as concerns about voter intimidation and threats to polling places have circulated. The monitors are there to ensure that federal laws like the Voting Rights Act, the National Voter Registration Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and others are being properly enforced. Those laws bar threatening or obstructing voters trying to cast their ballots. Monitors are not police or federal agents, but lawyers. Federal law permits monitors to observe both inside and outside polling locations — but to go inside, they must receive state permission. In his response to the notice, Paxton sued and argued that the DOJ’s plan to dispatch monitors infringed on the “states’ constitutional authority to run free and fair elections.” The agreement reached on Tuesday states that monitors can be within 100 feet of Texas polling locations but are “subject to Texas law regarding electioneering and other conduct within 100 feet of polling and central count locations.” In Texas, electioneering is defined as posting, using or distributing political signage or literature, and this applies to everyone at the polling place, including voters and poll workers or observers. According to the agreement, voters are allowed to talk to DOJ personnel at polling sites. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk had ordered the Justice Department to declare that no “observers” from the agency would be present in Texas polling places, but the Trump-appointed judge stopped short of issuing a restraining order, as Paxton had requested. The agreement on Tuesday heads off what may have been a protracted battle, since Kacsmaryk had asked the parties to explain the distinction and definitions of “monitoring” or “observing” before he decided whether to issue the restraining order. “The Court cannot issue a temporary restraining order without further clarification on the distinction between ‘monitoring’ and ‘observing’ on the eve of a consequential election,” the judge wrote. Texas wasn’t the only state that tried to bar compliance officials from inside state polling centers. Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey and Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft also sued ahead of Election Day, saying monitors were not among the approved categories of individuals allowed at state polling places. Ashcroft accused the feds of trying to “displace” state election officials and cause irreparable harm. U.S. District Judge Sarah Pitlyk, another Trump appointee, was not persuaded. In her order, Pitlyk noted that in 2021, a settlement agreement had been reached between the City of St. Louis and the DOJ over compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act at voting centers. As a part of that deal, the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners had agreed to let monitors observe conduct at polling places on Election Day. “The settlement agreement had a term of three years, and would have terminated in January 2024, but on October 3, 2023, the parties extended the term of the agreement, including the provision allowing monitoring of polling places, through July 11, 2025,” the judge wrote. In Missouri, there have been compliance officers in place without incident, she noted. “The harms to persons with disabilities that led to the Settlement Agreement and the presence of federal observers are documented and uncontested, whereas the harms that the State of Missouri anticipates are speculative—a defect underscored by the fact that similar observers have been present at least twice and their presence apparently went unnoticed,” Pitlyk wrote. In Florida, Secretary of State Cord Byrd issued a letter to the DOJ saying Florida would send its own monitors to jurisdictions where DOJ monitors are expected to send staff.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/solange-knowles-pots-syndrome-diagnosis_l_672902bee4b05debb72b8507","Solange Says She’s Living With This ‘Debilitating’ Condition — And Diagnoses Are Rising","kimberley richards","2024-11-05","Solange Knowles recently shared that she’s been living with “debilitating” and “confusing” symptoms of Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) after model Shaun Ross posted on social media last month that he developed the condition after experiencing long COVID. The “Cranes in the Sky” singer took to the comments section of one of Ross’ Instagram posts to share that she’d also been struggling with POTS. The condition is an autonomic nervous system disorder that causes an exaggerated increase in heart rate when transitioning from lying down to standing, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Knowles, who has talked about living with health issues before, said she was diagnosed with POTS and two other medical conditions in 2018. She also deals with Sjogren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that targets moisture-producing glands, and Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a condition that “causes intense episodes of swelling, shortness of breath, hives, diarrhea, vomiting and other symptoms” per the Cleveland Clinic. On Instagram, Knowles praised Ross for publicly sharing his journey with POTS while describing her own experience with the disorder as a “lonely” one. But while it may feel isolating, Knowles and Ross are part of a growing group of people living with the disease. Diagnoses of POTS have been rising, and researchers are continuing to study links between the disorder and COVID-19 and long COVID. Symptoms for POTS vary from person to person but may include severe fatigue, brain fog, lightheadedness, forceful heartbeats, headaches and intolerance of exercise, among other symptoms. “If you have POTS, your body can’t coordinate the balancing act of blood vessel constriction (squeezing) and heart rate response,” according to the Cleveland Clinic, which notes that the imbalance can cause dizziness and fainting when transitioning to standing upright. The disorder is estimated to affect 1 to 3 million people in the U.S. But POTS could be more prevalent than what’s been reported. “POTS can be underdiagnosed because the symptoms are not unique and specific to the syndrome and there is no identified gene associated with it,” Dr. Susan Cheng, associate dean for public health practice at Tulane University’s School of Public Health, told HuffPost. Researchers aren’t exactly sure what causes the condition, which is a form of dysautonomia, which is an issue that occurs when the body’s automatic nervous system doesn’t function as it should. The majority of people diagnosed with POTS are women. Cheng said that while the exact cause is unknown, there are several theories about what causes the condition, such as familial links, viral triggers and immune system insufficiency. She added that POTS could develop after another chronic condition. Researchers and medical experts are also currently researching the links between COVID-19, long COVID and POTS. Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told HuffPost that “the actual mechanism linking COVID-19 infection and POTS has not been fully discovered,” but “several hypotheses such as autoimmunity, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and others are being investigated,” he said. Someone is considered to have long COVID when their symptoms from COVID-19 persist for more than 12 weeks after contracting the virus. Some people experiencing ongoing symptoms after contracting COVID-19 may actually have POTS, according to an article published by Johns Hopkins. Cheng pointed out that while reports suggest that some patients first notice symptoms of POTS after a COVID-19 infection, it’s “difficult to discern whether this is a correlation or causation without establishing detailed timelines.” Dr. Arthur L. Jenkins, a neurosurgeon who specializes in nervous system disorders such as POTS, explained to HuffPost that while hypotheses about the links between COVID-19 and POTS “haven’t been definitively proven yet,” there does “appear to be more POTS in patients who have had COVID, than those who haven’t.” “But I also suspect we’re also looking for it more now than we did 10 years ago,” he added. Research has suggested that cases of POTS have increased since the start of the pandemic, but there could be several factors contributing to the rise in reported cases. Jenkins said that he’s seen more “general recognition” of POTS and that he believes in the past, people with the disorder had more commonly experienced “medical gaslighting” when discussing their symptoms, in addition to misdiagnoses. He also explained that while there’s ongoing research and hypotheses about how long COVID could affect the autonomic nervous system, the virus could also magnify the symptoms associated with POTS, which could, in turn, lead to more awareness and diagnoses of the disorder. People who suspect they have POTS should refer to a medical professional for an evaluation. There is no known cure for POTS, but for most patients, the condition can be managed with diet, exercise and medications, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Jenkins added that it’s important that people not assume the symptoms they’re experiencing are “normal.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

The actor, who plays a young Trump in director Ali Abbasi’s “The Apprentice,” slammed the Republican presidential nominee in a Sunday conversation for The Hollywood Reporter’s “Awards Chatter” podcast, marking the latest Trump criticism issued by Stan amid the biopic’s release. “There’s people that are going to say, ‘We don’t know what the truth is anymore.’ That’s the problem!” he said at Florida’s Miami Film Festival GEMS event, adding that Trump has “muddled it up so much.” “You can create your own truth at this point, believe what you want, and that’s what people are doing,” he said. Stan, a Romanian immigrant who moved to the U.S. at 12 years old, said that he was partially drawn to the film because, to him, it’s about the American dream. “The movie was asking the question, ‘What is the cost?’” Stan said. “And this man [Trump] was sort of a really good example of what can happen as a result when you lose who you are because you are so focused on one thing and that nothing else matters, not even your humanity.” “The Apprentice” initially struggled to find distribution amid threatened legal action from Trump’s team. Briarcliff Entertainment ultimately picked up the film, which was then released theatrically in October to rave reviews (and a social media rant from Trump). The movie is now garnering Oscar buzz for Stan and co-star Jeremy Strong, who portrays late Trump fixer Roy Cohn. Stan suggested Sunday that cinema might make more of a difference in shaping people’s views on Trump than, say, exhausting daily news reports about the Republican’s antics. “It’s the experience of being with this person for two hours, and seeing where he’s coming from,” said Stan, “and really asking yourself at the end of this film, ‘Do you trust this person? Do you really trust that this guy is going to make a decision that’s going to be good for you or good for him?’” He added: “There is one paranoid, scared little man that’s still out there fighting the good fight to get into the membership club of Manhattan and be put on a plaque on a wall. He ain’t caring about your situation. It’s that he’s got to get there first.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Walking is one of the easiest ways to stay active and fit; the benefits are endless. Just 21 minutes of walking daily may reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Anecdotally, our own Lindsay Holmes bought a walking pad during quarantine, and she reported having better posture, less stress and more mental clarity. Bottom line: We should all be walking more. Consider grabbing a foldable walking pad if you want to increase those steps like Holmes. They take up less space than a traditional treadmill, operate via remote control and can fit underneath a standing desk. And unlike other minimal walking pads we’ve covered in the past, this one has a bar for maintaining balance and increasing safety. This HuffPost-reader favorite folding treadmill is on sale for 51% off, way more than the first time we covered this treadmill at 34% off. Several customers — from seniors to remote workers — say the walking pad helped keep them active, rain or shine, night or day. Normally $349.99, this foldable treadmill is down to just $169.77, its lowest price of the year. The folding treadmill has adjustable speeds up to 7.6 mph, an excellent range for light walkers and fast joggers, and comes with a remote control to change settings. Folded up, you can slip it underneath your bed or lean it inside of a closet or storage space. When unfolded, a small digital display tells you how fast you’re walking or jogging, plus it has a mountable shelf so you can place a phone or book on it to stream, listen or read while staying active. It has a 6-foot power cord for easy outlet reach, and, according to several reviewers, initial set up is simple. “It fits perfectly next to my desk so that I can walk during conference calls or breaks,” says reviewer Christopher L Kehl. “Setup was super easy. The small platform is perfect for my Kindle or my phone. It is very simple to use and is helping me to move more throughout the day. We have a full sized treadmill in the basement but having one right next to my desk is a game changer. I can walk for 5 or 10 minutes at a time and hop off and go back to my computer easily if something pops up. It is quiet, my husband doesn’t hear it down the hall and my son doesn’t hear it from the next room.” Reviewers say they use their foldable treadmills everywhere and anywhere at home, from underneath standing desks and in bedrooms to garages and in front of televisions. It’s also a solution for many to stay active during awful weather — from avoiding icy sidewalks and snowy streets to hot, swampy air. Whether you’re looking to kickstart your fitness journey, get extra daily steps in or want a convenient way to work out, this walking pad could be an excellent investment — especially on sale. Read on for more promising reviews below and take advantage of this discount while it lasts. Don’t need the folding bars with your treadmill? Grab this version that’s on sale today. “I did all my research on all the smaller portable moveable treadmills. This seemed to be the most stable. I have no complaints! The bar goes up and down easily. The dial on the bar is good quality. I haven’t seen any weird calibration with the actual treadmill track. You can pick the backside up like wheel barrel and it has wheels to easily move around the house which is so nice because its pretty heavy for one person to move. Fits perfect under my bed when not in use. I also liked that the bar and the tablet mount is very stable when you run on highest speed for my ipad or phone. The only thing is that the remote did not work. I even tried a different battery. But you do not need the remote if you have the bar up with the dial that does everything for you. Worth the money and starting my weight-loss journey.” — Yoga_phoe (This review has been edited for length. Read full review here.)  “As someone living in a rural area without access to walking trails, especially in the winter months, my wife has been looking for a simple way to get some daily steps in at home. The UREVO Under Desk Treadmill has been a great solution for her needs! This treadmill is lightweight and easy to move around. We were able to set it up with ease. The compact size also makes storing it away a breeze when not in use. It folds up nicely and can slide right under a bed or high enough couch. The setup process was quick and straightforward. Within minutes we were up and walking! It operates a little noisily, but while streaming documentaries and lifestyle videos, we simply turn up the volume. The LED display provides clear stats like steps, time, speed, distance, and calories. We love that it has a remote control, so you can adjust settings on the fly without breaking stride. My wife and I have found that using the treadmill is a nice incentive to get in daily activity, especially on cold or rainy days when we can’t go outside. She will treat herself by walking while catching up on travel videos, which makes exercise feel less monotonous. It’s been a great way to avoid being a “couch potato,” and the little bit of activity leaves her feeling good. For anyone looking for an affordable, easy-to-use compact treadmill ideal for getting steps in at home, we highly recommend the UREVO Under Desk Treadmill! It has exceeded our expectations, but not our budget.” — Daniel Middleton  “Super quiet…no one can tell when I step on it. Perfect for the office. I don’t really go too fast, mainly just walk 15min or up to an hour at a time. I haven’t used the bar that flips up so can’t comment on that. I wish the remote could turn the unit on and off instead of having to pull it out slightly to get at the switch on front. My boss got a diff walking pad and her on/off was similar to mine it’s out it being on the remote so maybe that’s a safety feature. Overall very pleased….dont judge it by the off-kilter English in the manual, it’s perfect for an office..” — Anita vigil  “For a Senior this treadmill comes in perfect for my needs. Easy setup, Length is right, controls are easy to navigate - from a slow start to however much I want to increase speed. Folds perfectly under sofa with the help of the wheels. Keep in mind, for those who have balance issues, the handle bar is a bit too forward. I would have liked if handle bar could be adjusted. Urevo has other models that have side handle bars so you may consider those models instead. All-in-all the Urevo models are well made and is a good piece of machinery.” — Luna  By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

As you’re early holiday shopping for loved ones (or even yourself), consider the music lover, the podcast listener or the frequent commuter in your life and know that at least one time or another, owning a pair of noise-canceling headphones has definitely crossed their mind. Right now, Bose, one of the best-known names in audio tech, is offering up their well-reviewed QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones for 43% off — matching its lowest price of the year at Amazon. These QuietComfort headphones are fitted with Bose’s notable high-fidelity audio, one that promises crisp notes and rich bass that remains balanced and clear no matter what volume you set. We also have to mention their proprietary noise-canceling technology, which smartly personalizes your level of noise dampening to your own ears and even includes a true quiet mode that silences noisy surroundings for an immersive listening experience. With several function settings and plush ear cups, these headphones can be controlled using an app on your phone and have up to 24 hours of battery life with the case. They can also be used for 2.5 hours after just 15 minutes of charging. Many people attest to the brand’s claims of all-day comfort; the headphones come in several colors to match your personality. The QuietComfort headphones have no shortage of impressive claims from real users, including some that have given them the title of “the best headphones ever.” To see more of these convincing testimonials, keep reading or grab yourself a pair before the sale is over. “As an army combat veteran, I’ve had my fair share of experiences with equipment designed to endure the harshest conditions. When I unboxed the Bose QC45 Noise Cancelling Headphones, I felt an immediate connection—not just to the quality of the product, but also to the striking army green color that resonates deeply with my military background. It’s a hue that evokes memories of resilience, strength, and camaraderie, making these headphones not just a gadget, but a personal statement. From the moment I put them on, I was enveloped in a cocoon of serenity. The noise-cancelling technology is nothing short of revolutionary; it feels as if the world outside has been muted, allowing me to immerse myself fully in my music, podcasts, or even the soothing silence I often crave after a long day. The sound quality is breathtaking, delivering rich, nuanced audio that makes every note come alive. Whether it’s the thunderous bass of my favorite tracks or the delicate strings of a classical symphony, the QC45s handle it all with remarkable precision.” — Michael Wyatt (This review was edited for length. Read the full review.)  “As a migraine patient I have to be really careful about anything I put my head. Anything can give me migraine. I’ve tried dozen of headphones till I found this. This is the lightest headphones I’ve ever tried. You feel different since the moment you put this on on your head. Speakers are located behind the ear. This is the reason why I chose this. Since the voice not going into ear directly not giving me headache at all. Battery life is incredible. I fulled the battery and im using for a week and it still %60 full. Connection with my apple devices is ok but not as fast as AirPods. When you want to switch one to another you have to do it manually. This is tricky but I could ignore this only for other features it has. Mic quality is good as well. First time I had phone call I looked back like the person I’m talking was behind me. The voice was clear and alive like a real person talking. Im using mostly at gym. Noise cancellation is working great. It feels like you are in an isolated room and speakers are behind and you are enjoying your music while working out. Only thing I can criticize is it slides when you lie on your back. I’m feeling really happy with my purchase.” — I**** O*****  “I’ve owned various Bose products in the past and have always been impressed with them! These wireless headphones are no exception. The sound is fantastic. Whether it’s a podcast, film, audio book, or music, everything is detailed and clear. There is depth and although there is a good deal of high end, it is not harsh to my ears. There is enough bass for me with the default EQ setting. (If you aren’t happy with the EQ, you can adjust it in the app.) I listen to everything from classical, blues, and jazz, to classic rock and progressive metal. It all sounds good through these headphones. Setup was quick and easy;no issues there at all. I mainly use these with my iPhone and iPad. Bluetooth seems solid even if I leave my phone or tablet at the other end of the house which is nice. I am very impressed with the battery life! I can easily go a day or two without charging and that’s with pretty heavy use throughout the day and evening depending on what I’m up to. The earcups and headband are comfortable, they are lite, and the carry case is a nice touch. IT’s small enough that it will be easy to travel with. I like that they updated their headphones with USB C. The noise cancelation is pretty good, however, they don’t equal the Apple Airpods Max in that department. (That’s not a deal braker for me but I thought I’d mention it all the same.) All in all, these are great and I would buy them again. Bose make excellent products!” — Cameron S.  “I was always really hesitant to buy big expensive headphones because I never knew if I was buying the brand or quality. After having surgery, and living in the middle of a chaotic house for a few months, I and my sanity needed some better noise canceling. Thanks to prime day and a deep discount on these, decided to try it out. Oh my God. They are the best noise canceling headphones I have ever used. They beat out my AirPods my AirPod Pro, numerous beats, and the slew of other cheap options I tried. Not only does it do a great job of quieting the noise (You can never truly cancel noise like people, talking, dogs, barking, etc.) But the sound quality blew me away. I never thought that I could hear a difference, then I tried these headphones I now sleep in them, So I can fall asleep to audiobooks and have gotten the best sleep I’ve ever gotten. I have been using them for over a month now, and the performance has been consistent. They feel very light on and fit comfortably over my ears. The battery life is astonishing. I can leave them on all night and wake up to about 80% battery. They charge in no time too . While the price tag is daunting, I am so glad that I was able to try these because I will never not have them near me henceforth.

(Watch the video below.) The Republican nominee segued from riffing on a recent jobs report to making a whopper of a claim — in which he also said that immigrants are not people. “Meanwhile, 100 percent of the net jobs created in the last year have gone to migrants,” the former president said. “100 percent of the jobs that were created went to migrants, not to people.” Trump: 100% of the jobs that were created went to migrants, not to people pic.twitter.com/x3G5kbrRMN Trump has floated a similar claim about immigrant jobs before, and it’s been debunked. He also threw in some extra racism during his Grand Rapids speech. “Your Black population is being devastated by these people,” he said. “They’re taking all the Black population jobs away. ... They should announce those numbers.” After Trump managed to blithely lie, repeat his much-ridiculed reference to “Black jobs” and dehumanize migrants at the same time, people rushed to condemn him. “I’m pretty sure that’s as dehumanizing as it gets,” one person wrote on X. He’s so used to dehumanizing them he forgets they are people. Holy shit!!!Dehumanization much?

Who deng?” the Scottish zoo playfully posted Monday on the social media platform X as it introduced its infant hippo to the world. The smack talk pitted two critters with more in common than just being females calves of the same endangered species. They’re also named for meat products that don’t typically carry cute connotations. Haggis, the national dish of Scotland that is butt of many jokes, is made in a sheep’s stomach filled with spiced and diced innards. Moo deng is a type of meatball that means “bouncy pork” in Thai. Moo Deng, a pudgy, pink-cheeked pygmy hippo, quickly became a social media star about two months after being born at Khao Kheow Open Zoo in July. Videos of her went viral and she was the source of endless memes. The Thai zoo planned to copyright and trademark the hippo’s name and capitalize on its fame by making shirts, pants and other merchandise to support its operations. The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland is also looking to cash in on its prize pygmy with a drawing promising the winner a “unique pygmy hippo experience” to meet Haggis and her parents, Gloria and Otto. Tickets are 5 British pounds ($6.50) and the zoo had raised more than half its 15,000 pound ($19,500) target in a day. “Prepare to fall in love with wee Haggis,” the zoo said. “With her playful nature, Haggis will show you why the world has fallen in love with pygmy hippos!” There are only an estimated 2,500 pygmy hippopotamuses in the wild in West Africa, where it is threatened by poaching and loss of habitat. Edinburgh Zoo visitors won’t immediately be able to see Haggis, who was born Oct. 30, because the hippo house will be closed during the first month of her development.

That means thousands of voters have to turn in their mail-in ballots in person by 7 p.m. Tuesday, vote at a polling place on Election Day — or risk being disenfranchised. Gregory, who asked that his last name not be used, received his mail-in ballot on Friday, even though he requested it in time. The Postal Service and election officials previously recommended mailing in ballots at least a week before Election Day. Gregory delivered his mail-in ballot in person to the Cobb County elections office Tuesday. But he was worried about others who may be affected. “Especially if they don’t have a car, it’s going to be hard,” he told HuffPost after dropping off the ballot. “It’s going to be a problem for them.” Sheena Grantz, who also dropped off a ballot Tuesday, said her and her wife’s ballots had arrived on time, but her brother’s never arrived at all. Luckily, she said, “We found a TikTok [video] about it, so I sent it to him.” “I just found out about that stuff last night,” Grantz told HuffPost of the legal fight over the ballots. “I sent him everything, told him he needs to follow up about it. I think he’s on the way [to vote in person] now.” Another voter, who declined to give his name, said his ballot arrived in the mail Saturday. According to the county, the issue was a surge of requests for mail-in ballots in the final days of the application window, as well as timing issues with a state-approved vendor and other problems with county printing equipment. More than 1,000 of the affected absentee ballots were being sent out of state, the county said. After the American Civil Liberties Union and Southern Poverty Law Center filed an emergency suit over the late-delivered ballots last week, a judge ruled Friday that affected voters whose ballots were postmarked by 7 p.m. on Election Day would still be counted, as long as the ballots arrived at election offices by Friday. But on Monday afternoon, the state’s Supreme Court reversed that ruling in a 5-3 decision, saying in response to an appeal by the state and national GOP that even affected voters would only have until the end of Election Day to turn in their ballots. Ballots postmarked on time but received by Friday, the court said, should be segregated but not counted, “until further order of the Court.” Suddenly, county officials as well as local political parties, who received lists of affected voters, are scrambling to let them know that deadlines have changed for the worse. Stacy Efrat, a Democratic Party appointee on the Cobb County Election Board, told HuffPost Tuesday that volunteers from various organizations had been calling voters all weekend telling them to get their ballots “postmarked by Tuesday, and that these ballots would be accepted by Friday.” “We spent all weekend giving them that information, which was true at the time, and then last night, we learned that that decision was overturned, and they have to be received by Tuesday, not postmarked by Tuesday,” Efrat said. “So all of these people who had gotten that instruction — we’re trying to call them back. But we don’t know if it’s too late for some.” County Board of Elections Chair Tori Silas told HuffPost that the county acknowledged its mistake and initially communicated the extended deadline to voters. After Monday’s Supreme Court order, she said, “we’ve taken every step we can to communicate with those voters that that extended deadline is no longer extended.” For Essence Johnson, chair of the Cobb County Democratic Committee, “its just another one of those GOP tactics.” (Eight of nine justices on the Georgia Supreme Court were appointed by Republican governors, and Republican Party plaintiffs opposed the extended deadline for the ballots that were mailed out late.) Johnson emphasized the out-of-state voters who were advised over the weekend to express-mail their ballots home to Georgia given the lower court’s ruling, trusting they would be counted as long as they were postmarked on time. But now, ballots that arrive late, even if they are postmarked on time, will be segregated and potentially discarded. “It’s all about voter suppression,” she said.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-billion-dollar-plan-to-make-america-pay-attention-to-kamala-harris_n_672a044de4b05debb72bfc9c","The Billion-Dollar Plan To Make America Pay Attention To Kamala Harris","kevin robillard","2024-11-05","One of the most important ads of the 2024 presidential election is only six seconds long. “Donald Trump wants to cut taxes for these guys,” a narrator says as images of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the second-richest and richest man in the world, respectively, appear on screen. “Kamala Harris wants a tax cut for middle-class families.” Why is a six-second ad, barely long enough to say the names of both candidates, so important? Because unlike most ads on YouTube — and a lot of other social media platforms — the viewer is not allowed to skip it, which is important in a fragmented media environment where viewers rarely have to watch anything they don’t want to watch. And the low-information, low-propensity, disaffected voters who may end up deciding the 2024 presidential election don’t pay attention to politics and don’t want to pay attention to politics. “Those sort of annoying ads that people see where they have to watch until you get to hit skip?” said Quentin Fulks, the deputy campaign manager on Harris’ team who oversees paid media. “That’s the good stuff. You make sure you get that.” Or as Ishanee Parikh, the creative director at FF PAC, the super PAC behind the aforementioned ad, put it: “Any avenue where we can put paid media and get someone to have to watch something, we’re there.” Parikh and Fulks are among the leading figures in the sprawling effort — costing more than a billion dollars, involving hundreds of operatives and staffers, and resulting in a potentially uncountable number of ads — by the Democratic Party and other allies of Harris to solve one of the biggest problems they faced at the beginning of the election cycle: Disaffected voters, hammered by inflation, felt particularly disaffected toward the Democrats and the party’s 81-year-old incumbent candidate, Joe Biden. Whether Harris, the party’s nominee for barely more than 100 days, is elevated to the presidency will come down in no small part to how FF PAC and the Harris campaign used their combined war chests — nearly $1.4 billion, according to Federal Election Commission records — to find, reach and persuade the disaffected. Switching from Biden to Harris helped with the problem. Disaffected voters, while they come in basically every demographic box in the book, do tend to be younger, more diverse and less educated. Harris improved the party’s standing with all of these groups. But selling them on voting, and on voting for Harris, first required finding them. These voters do not watch the nightly news. “They’re not watching speeches of the candidates,” Parikh said. “They most likely didn’t watch the debate.” In fact, many of them don’t watch broadcast or cable television at all, except for rare moments like the Olympics and NFL games, events for which both campaigns eagerly bought up television time. The Harris campaign and FF PAC each put more than half of their ad buys toward digital advertising. Democrats have a significant advantage over the GOP in digital advertising, with the Harris campaign outspending the Trump campaign 20 to 1. That’s because the number of platforms you can spread ads across is massive. YouTube is the biggest player, but Hulu, Facebook, Instagram, Google search and a multitude of lesser-known streaming services all receive significant advertising dollars. The Harris campaign, in order to reach out to young men, advertised the candidate’s immigrant story during La Liga soccer matches and ads about how Trump inspired anti-Asian hate on the gaming website IGN. Once you can find them, you have to grab their attention. Ashley Aylward, a research manager at HIT Strategies, a Democratic polling firm, recounted running focus groups of young women. The participants were shown a simple video of Harris, speaking at a podium and promising to protect abortion rights. The women agreed they found it persuasive. But they also agreed if they came across it on social media, they would swipe away before watching it in full. “It’s a tough nut to crack,” Aylward said, recommending the party work with influencers as an alternative to using paid media. She noted young men, in particular, would recoil as soon as a politician spoke: “As soon as they see that it’s a political message, they just turn off their brains and disengage.” The Harris campaign would occasionally deploy so-called “brain rot” techniques to grab viewers’ attention, for instance by running a clip of Subway Surfers gameplay alongside otherwise-normal advertising content. But most of their attention-grabbing techniques were more mundane: making sure ads used different angles, or making sure the person delivering the message changed what outfit they were wearing, so viewers wouldn’t just assume they were seeing the same ad for the second or third time. Once they had their attention, it was about getting a message out quickly — like, really quickly. “What does your ad say in the first three seconds?” Fulks asked, referring to how long the campaign has to convince a viewer to watch the full spot. The campaigns tried to keep their message simple — something Democrats gave the Trump campaign credit for with his “no tax on tips” messaging — and tried to make sure it required almost no background knowledge about the two candidates. But regardless of what platform they were using, the messaging did not change much. Both the campaign and its allied super PACs focused on basic economic messaging — hitting Trump on his tariff proposals and contrasting them with Harris’ support for an expanded child tax credit, for instance — and on savaging Trump over abortion rights. Those messages tended to perform the best in the extensive message testing now endemic to Democratic political campaigns. “We’re not slicing and dicing the electorate or seeing big differences in the issues people care about,” Parikh said. “Because even people who care deeply about specific issues, their number one issue is still their wallet.” There were some audience-specific messages: The Harris campaign, for instance, launched geotargeted digital ads aimed at college campuses to tell students Republicans were threatening the Affordable Care Act’s provision to allow children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26. There are signs the push may have worked: New York Times/Siena College polling has consistently found Trump dominant among the slice of the electorate that did not vote in 2020 — as good a stand-in as any for low-propensity voters. In May, the survey gave Trump a 48% to 33% edge. But in the newspaper’s last round of swing state polling before the election, Harris led among 2020 nonvoters, 48% to 43%.",0.126419602889857,0.184231844855531

On Instagram Monday, the Barbadian singer posted a video of herself in a vehicle, joking, “POV: me trying to sneak into the polls with my son’s passport #votecauseicant.” She added in the caption, “when protecting pussies and firing pussies can happen all in one vote,” adding the hashtag #TanSuitSeason. Ostensibly, this was an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, who has campaigned on protecting abortion rights and followed Barack Obama’s lead in wearing a tan suit this election season. But the “Diamonds” singer’s joke didn’t land with some commenters, who echoed Donald Trump’s familiar refrains baselessly accusing Democrats of voting illegally. “That attitude is why we want to make America geeat again. You want to cheat to win. So disappointing,” one person wrote. Rihanna wrote back, “Lol! When yall stop burning ballot boxes come check me.” Another comment on the post read: “Illegal voting is a crime. Maybe she should be arrested for trying.” “Shut up Karen,” Rihanna fired back. “I voted for closed borders, deportations, and staying out of foreign conflicts,” another social media user wrote, apparently referring to the Republican nominee’s plans for mass deportations. “Abortions are probably nowhere near as important as y’all are making it seem.” “You’re fucked!” replied Rihanna. “And so is the America you dream of. Hope you don’t have to find out the hard way.” Another user argued about securing the U.S. border, saying that “there is a right and wrong way to come inside” and “the people who are against having a secure border are essentially saying it’s okay to break a window & enter in that way.” “Where were you in Jan 6 sis?” Rihanna responded, referring to the day in 2021 when Trump supporters illegally stormed the U.S. Capitol, causing millions of dollars of damage. “Stick to your discounted crotch.

I think that there is a real fear that the bottom has started to fall out here at the worst possible moment, and that they are closing in about as weak a fashion as you possibly could.” Alberta summed it up in a social media post Monday: “Hard to overstate how terrible morale is inside of this campaign — and how much anger/resentment is felt toward the candidate.” In a separate interview with MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace, Alberta reported that, for months, he has spoken to senior Trump campaign aides who have seemed to feel uneasy about the former president — who has grown increasingly hateful, erratic and unhinged in the final stretch of the race. Re: my comments on CNN and MSNBC this evening... yes, there are Trump staffers who no longer much care whether he wins or loses. Not exactly breaking news. Hard to overstate how terrible morale is inside of this campaign—and how much anger/resentment is felt toward the candidate. He cited one specific conversation he said he had with a Trump campaign staffer recently, around the time John Kelly said he believes his onetime boss to be a fascist. Kelly, Trump’s former chief of staff, also said the ex-president had praised Adolf Hitler to him multiple times. The campaign staffer said, “I just don’t know, you know, how much longer I can put up with this,” according to Alberta. “There is a fatigue and exhaustion, and at times, I think, it would be accurate to say, a disgust, for some of these people that has set in,” Alberta added. He also recalled a conversation in which a “pretty high-ranking Trump person” admitted there was a very small part of them that hopes he loses. “I will probably go to my death bed still thinking about that conversation,” Alberta said. “Even among the people who have poured their blood, sweat and tears into trying to elect this man for the last couple of years, Nicolle, they know that ... something is off here.” The next four years will change America forever.

Bernice King denounced the manipulated footage Monday on X, formerly Twitter, calling for the “vile” post to be deleted. The video was first shared in February by @Ramble_Rants, a member of the “Dilley Meme Team,” a pro-MAGA movement on social media. “We’ve been told again and again that we cannot vote for the man that did more for the Black community than any other president,” says a deepfaked MLK Jr. in the video, which was shared again Sunday by another pro-Trump account. called @MAGAResource. “If a Black man dares speak out in support of Donald Trump, a Democrat is always there to call that man an Uncle Tom, a house Negro, or even worse,” it continues. “We’ve been used by the Democrats. For decades, we’ve supported the party of slavery and Jim Crow.” The original post accrued more than 1,300 likes and nearly 800 reposts, with the video itself showing former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi kneeling in honor of George Floyd, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) at the U.S.-Mexico border and Hunter Biden in court. Bernice King, whose father stood for national unity and nonviolent protest to improve the lives of all low-income, Black or brown Americans, reacted Monday after @MAGAResource shared it. She slammed it as “irresponsible” and demanded the removal of the video. “Delete this, @MAGAResource,” Bernice wrote on X while resharing the post, which has since been removed from the account. “It’s vile, fake, irresponsible, and not at all reflective of what my father would say. And you gave no thought to our family.” The “Dilley Meme Team” reportedly takes its name from Brenden Dilley, a failed congressional candidate-turned-podcaster who has curated a horde of anonymous meme-makers to promote Trump — and refers to itself as “Trump’s Online War Machine.” The deepfake-wielding team previously edited a montage of President Joe Biden falling off his bicycle, mispronouncing names and flubbing various campaign lines, which The New York Times reported in 2023 was played at one of Trump’s rallies in Ohio the previous year.

Seth Meyers Drops Ultimate Donald Trump Takedown On Election Eve","lee moran","2024-11-05","Seth Meyers, on Monday — the eve of the 2024 election — issued a breathless reminder of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s wildest moments from the last few years. The “Late Night” host acknowledged that Democratic nominee Kamala Harris may not be the “perfect” candidate. But his blistering four-minute monologue drew a stark contrast between the vice president and her twice-impeached rival. Meyers began by reminding viewers how Trump “fomented a violent coup attempt after a months-long campaign to overturn the 2020 election, undercut the nation’s response to a deadly pandemic that spiraled out of control because he tried to cover it up, lied about its severity, promoted sham treatments for it, said we could cure it by injecting disinfectant and shining powerful lights inside the body, became the first president since Herbert Hoover to oversee a net job loss.” The rest of the monologue went: “Couldn’t figure out how to close an umbrella, cosplayed as a sanitation worker, even though he almost fell while getting into the truck and pretended to work at McDonald’s, even though he couldn’t remember what the fryer was called. Laughed about firing striking workers with the richest man alive, bragged about refusing to pay overtime and said I don’t want a poor person running the economy. Oversaw an increase in corporate profits while manufacturing jobs declined, presided over an unprecedented spike in crime while home prices rose by 30%, the national debt rose by $8 trillion and the number of Americans without health insurance rose by 3 million. Tried to rip healthcare away from over 20 million Americans, but reassured everyone by saying he had concepts of a plan, told a story about the size of a dead golfer’s penis, regaled Boy Scouts with stories of sexy yacht parties, humped the American flag not once but multiple times, told women he would protect them whether they liked it or not, and would put a man who was investigated for cutting the head off a whale with a chainsaw in charge of vaccines and women’s health, insulted service members, feuded with Gold Star families and violated federal law by staging a campaign event at a hallowed military cemetery. Doctored a weather map with a Sharpie to lie about the path of a hurricane, threw paper towels at hurricane victims, hosted a speaker at a rally who called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage,’ claimed windmills, cause cancer and kill whales, said you have to flush toilets 15 times. Called Hannibal Lecter a lovely man, his national security adviser called him a ‘dope,’ his secretary of state called him a ‘moron,’ his chief of staff called him an ‘idiot’ and a ‘fascist’ who said nice things about Hitler and Hitler’s generals. He suggested shooting protesters in the legs to his secretary of defense. He reportedly suggested executing rivals and staffers for leaking information. The former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff called him a ‘fascist to the core.’ He took millions from foreign officials, including a possible $10 million bribe from Egypt. His lawyers gave a press conference at a landscaping company. He lost the popular vote twice, got impeached twice, got indicted four times and was found guilty of 34 felony counts, falsifying business records to pay hush money to a porn star. He asked a crowd whether they’d rather be electrocuted or eaten by a shark, he possibly farted and definitely fell asleep in court. Bragged about overturning Roe v. Wade, called himself the ‘father of IVF’ while admitting he didn’t know what IVF was, called the CEO of Apple Tim Apple, misspelled his wife’s name and his own name, said Nikki Haley was the speaker of the House on Jan. 6. Claimed the price of bacon goes up because the wind doesn’t blow. Got on Air Force One with toilet paper stuck to his shoe, became the first president in history to stare directly at an eclipse, melted down in a presidential debate where he claimed migrants were eating dogs, spread lies about the federal government’s response to a hurricane that caused FEMA workers to relocate due to threats. Dances like he’s punching a ghost, held a hate-filled rally at Madison Square Garden, stole classified documents, obstructed attempts to get them back, called climate change a hoax, proposed tariffs that economists say would increase prices and crater the economy, halted an equal pay rule for women, curtailed access to birth control, picked a running mate who mocked ‘childless cat ladies,’ creeped out everyone when he tried to order donuts and was accused of having sex with a couch, which he did not do even though he might have. But he didn’t, but maybe he did. But he definitely did not. Said Kamala Harris happened to ‘turn Black,’ claim his crowd on Jan. 6 was bigger than Martin Luther King’s ‘Have a Dream’ speech, was banned from doing business in the state of New York for three years, just recently posed for the single worst photo of any human being that has ever been taken on the face of the fucking planet.” Afterward, Meyers joked about the race between Harris and Trump being “a toss-up.” “I’ve been talking about this man for nearly a decade now, as evidenced by the fact that everything I just listed is in my brain still somehow,” he concluded. “The symptoms that gave rise to him will not immediately go away if he loses tomorrow, but we do have an opportunity to say as a nation that we want him to go away. And I really hope that happens, mainly so I never have to think about this ever again.” Watch from the 14-minute mark here: We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

(Watch the video below.) The 98-year-old actor on Monday endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by harkening back to a civil rights speech he gave at an event with Martin Luther King Jr. in 1964. “VOTE!!! @KamalaHarris @VP @KamalaHQ,” the actor tagged the vice president in the overline on X and Instagram while introducing the video. “Hi, I’m Dick Van Dyke. You may remember I used to sing and dance and fall down a lot,” he said, referring to his tumble over an ottoman in the “Dick Van Dyke Show” intro. The still-spry Van Dyke said he came upon a copy of the speech he gave on May 31, 1964, at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The words were written by “The Twilight Zone” creator and host Rod Serling. “I think it means as much today if not more than it did then, so if you don’t mind, I’d like to read it,” Van Dyke said. “Hatred is not the norm,” he read. “Prejudice is not the norm. Suspicion, dislike, jealousy, scapegoating ― none of those are the transcendent facets of the human personality. They’re diseases. They are the cancers of the soul. They are the infectious and contagious viruses that have been bleeding humanity for years. And because they have been and because they are, is it necessary that they shall be? I think not.” At the end of the video, Van Dyke said, “1964. A lot’s happened. Not so much as Martin Luther [King] dreamed of, but it’s a start.” The Civil Rights Act was passed a little more than a month later. Last June, as concerns over President Joe Biden’s age mounted before he withdrew from the race, Van Dyke expressed his support. “I’m old enough to be his father,” the “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang” star said.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/adult-entertaiment-sex-work-married-women_n_6715756de4b019cef4ea8c08","I Worked In A Gentlemen's Club. Here's The Uncomfortable Truth Many Married Women Won't Face.","megan thiele strong","2024-11-05","When I first applied for a job in the adult entertainment industry, I was two states and hundreds of miles away from my hometown. As I sat there, waiting to be interviewed, one of my sister’s childhood athletic coaches walked in. Once hired, seeing men I recognized from outside the club as customers was not uncommon. From fellow university students to the owner of the restaurant where I also worked as a server, I had discovered a secret male world. Even though women were the foundation of the entertainment, everyone in charge ― of the music, the drinks, the doors, the schedule, the money ― was a man. The women danced or cleaned and waited tables. The door to the women’s dressing room was either missing or left open, and if customers angled themselves opportunistically, they could see into the only bathroom stall, which never had a door. Even though men were in charge, without women, there would be no money coming in the doors. However, the men treated women as expendable. If they fired someone, it didn’t matter. More than once I walked out. I remember a manager yelling, “You’ll be back!” It was good money. Working in a restaurant in the late nineties, it was a good night when I surpassed $5 an hour. In the early 2000s, in a bigger city, I could make $14 an hour between tips and my $2.13 hourly rate. Waiting tables in the clubs, I routinely made $25 an hour between tips and an hourly rate of more than $5. Some dancers regularly made hundreds of dollars a night, even after payout to the house. I learned many things working in the industry, including discretion. Like fight club, I learned to not talk about strip clubs outside of the club. It was something I needed to keep quiet about if I wanted to be seen as legitimate in the other spaces I was in. These were separate worlds. Once, when a man entered the club, a dancer who was a parent hid and begged to leave early because she recognized him as her child’s principal. Fifteen years later, after I caught my fiancé cheating, I found solace in communities of betrayed women. These groups had little tolerance for sex workers. It was as though because of their jobs — because they were sex workers — they could not be betrayed the way other women could be betrayed. Many wives blamed sex workers more than their husbands for infidelity. Negotiating these two identities — that of a betrayed partner and also that of someone who had worked in the adult entertainment industry — was tough. I could ignore my experiences working in so-called gentlemen’s clubs and receive support, or I could out myself and speak up for sex workers and be attacked as unworthy. I blocked many people during this time. I couldn’t help but think about how to bridge this gap. As a sociologist, it is easy to argue that marriage is the ultimate form of sex work. A general rule of marriage in heteronormative patriarchal society is that men are the breadwinners and women provide sex. If men don’t uphold their end of this ideal, they are penalized, both with separation and less sex. Until the 1970s, nonconsensual sex in marriage was considered legal. Since then, many states have made spousal rape illegal, although loopholes still exist. And non-consummation of a marriage can be grounds for annulment, even in California. Of course, sexless marriages exist, and sex inside of marriage doesn’t have to be work. And still, there have long been differential and gendered associations with sex. For example, virginity before marriage is seen as a benefit for women but a stigma for men. Pornography geared toward men captures a significant share of the internet and online searches. One popular site gets 100 million viewers a day. Boys use apps to generate fake and naked images of their classmates. Meanwhile, we criminalize and shame adult sex workers. These hierarchies of sex work privilege one group of women over the other. The sex work that married women do is seen as legitimate and sacred. Marriage is highly sought after; weddings are a billion-dollar industry, and expected to grow. There are auxiliary benefits to a marriage, including financial benefits, housing and alimony. Conversely, the work that sex workers do, also for exchange, is devalued and seen as problematic, profane and rendered outside of polite society. Further, the exchange rate for this less socially acceptable form of sex work can be difficult to negotiate. Men typically have the money and power, and sex workers can lack legitimate means to ensure payment; they risk punishment, danger and sometimes death. If we recognize the commonalities between marriage and traditional sex work, we can see that when these two groups are pitted against each other, women’s work is undervalued and men, as a category, benefit. Women may fear that their partners will have more opportunities to betray — to break up their homes — if sex work is decriminalized. However, men, including married men, have access to sex while adult women are criminalized for supplying it. The American Civil Liberties Union has long worked to decriminalize sex work. In 2022, California passed the Safer Streets for All Act, which decriminalized sex work-related loitering. However, we can go further. We can, as a society, fully embrace the idea that consensual sex among adults is always legal and up for negotiation in a free market. Both married women and sex workers are safer and have more freedom when sex work is decriminalized. For example, if sex work is decriminalized, there can be more transparency about who is paying for sex. During my time working in the industry, billing went through a generic merchant company; the women at home did not see the often-crass names of the clubs that look better in neon than on a bank statement. When we decriminalize sex work, the billion-dollar sex traffic industry will be reduced. Now, as a single mom and only parent, I wish it were easier for women to thrive without a dual income. Women’s work is largely underpaid. The median income for women is still only 83% of that of men. And, 40% of births are to unmarried women. Eighty percent of single parent households have a woman as head of the household. And the poverty rate for these families is high. I understand why some educators choose to subsidize their income with OnlyFans. It is time we remove the benefits men receive when some sex workers are pushed under the rug. The majority of women support abortion rights. And women are rallying to promote the expectation that we — and not the majority-male government — are the rightful decision-makers when it comes to our bodies. We should also be able to choose what job we do with our bodies. If we can exchange our labor for all sorts of terrible and dangerous, mind-numbing work, we should be able to exchange sex work for profit. When we marginalize sex workers as not worthy of naming their price, we endorse a sexist status quo that allows men privilege at our collective expense. The double standards need to be eliminated. To do so, let’s do what we can, including voting, to decriminalize all forms of sex work. If we don’t act soon, bots will be recognized as legitimate sex workers before we are.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sephora-savings-event-beauty-sale-ano_l_672a0dd8e4b0be8c956a8553","The Sephora Savings Event Is Here! Grab These Must-Have Beauty Picks Now","tatayana yomary","2024-11-05","Prepare yourselves, beauty and self-care lovers! The annual Sephora Savings Event has arrived with deals that will make any person who loves beauty and personal care blush. Known as the créme de la créme of beauty savings events, this semiannual sale allows beauty enthusiasts and novices alike to try new products or re-up on their daily essentials at up to 30% off! With hair care, makeup and skin care up for grabs, the options are endless and deals depend on your Sephora Beauty Insider status. Access to the sale is contingent on your status in Sephora’s three-tiered Beauty Insider program. Rouge members (folks who spend a minimum of $1,000 annually) get first dibs. Starting Nov. 1, they can enjoy 20% off select brands. VIB members who spend at least $350 annually get access to the sale on Nov. 5 with 15% off. Like VIB members, Insiders will also gain access to the sale on Nov. 5 with a 10% discount. (Remember, Insider status is free and only requires signing up for Sephora’s mailing list.) Also, if you’re a Rouge member (or know someone who is), this year, Sephora’s offering the option to share the early 20% off access with a non-member. People at every tier of the Beauty Insider status can enjoy 30% off on all Sephora Collection products, using the code “SAVINGS” at checkout. Navigating Sephora’s extensive lineup of over 300 brands can be tedious but we’ve taken on that task for you. Below are the must-have products in Sephora’s Savings Event. Prices are listed by tier so consider this your comprehensive cheat sheet for the full sale from now through its Nov. 11 end date. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Foot massages after every hard day on your feet may not be in the cards for you, but there's another way to tap into some foot care. Enter the Sephora Collection's foot mask. Designed to slip onto your foot like a sock, it wraps your feet in the lap of hydrating luxury to nourish and repair the skin. Enriched with coconut extract, the foot mask is meant to leave feet with a baby-soft feel. Note: Don't forget to use the code ""SAVINGS"" to get your 30% off at checkout. Promising review: ""My feet were so hard for months and just after one use they became so soft, I left it overnight that made skin feel a bit soggy but after I washed them they were soft for days."" — Asht6 It's never too early to start focusing on improving skin texture concerns like fine lines, wrinkles, the appearance of large pores and more. After trying this moisturizing essence from SK-II, I finally realized why this treatment is a must-have. Aside from improving my skin tone and texture, this lightweight essence makes my skin softer and leaves a gorgeous, dewy glow behind. Skip the false lashes for the night and let your natural fringe be the star of the show (especially when you're running low on time!). While you may scratch your head at this thought if you're working with straight and short lashes, Sephora Collection's weightless mascara is known for working magic. It combines the best of both worlds, curling and lifting, to add some extra pizazz to your lashes for up to 12 hours. Get it in the full or the mini size. Note: Don't forget to use the code ""SAVINGS"" to get your 30% off at checkout. Promising review: ""I grabbed this on sale the first time and was shocked at how well it did. The number of compliments I got on my lashes has been insane. I don’t even have to curl my lashes first which is a huge plus!"" — Cdb16 Summer Fridays lip balm acquired its cult following via Beautytok (the corner of TikTok where beauty and personal care enthusiasts reside) — and for good reason! Featuring shea and murumuru seed butters plus vegan waxes, this silky find hydrates, soothes and smoothes parched lips on contact for a happy pout. It also works double-duty as a nighttime mask to help you maximize the nourishment. Not to mention, this lip balm comes in nine deliciously scented flavors that are almost good enough to taste. Leftover makeup on your canvas is bad news for the face. From stained bed linens to impending acne woes, removing every speck of product is key for healthy skin. Sephora Collection's cleansing wipes are infused with micellar water, allowing you to wipe away makeup down to the last drop confidently. No harsh rubbing is required! They're available in full-size but also in (cheaper) travel minis, both of which are on sale. Note: Don't forget to use the code ""SAVINGS"" to get your 30% off at checkout. On this side, we play absolutely no games with adding sunscreen to our skincare routine to shield our skin from UVA and UVB rays that cause premature signs of aging, hyperpigmentation and other harm. The Innisfree SPF 36 works overtime on sun defense but it also features ingredients like green tea and sunflower seed oil that soothes, hydrate and deliver lasting moisture with a radiant glow. I especially love that it's white-cast-free, making it suitable for all skin tones. Every makeup lover needs a reliable red lip in their collection. There's also no such thing as having too many reds in your makeup bag, and this sheer Sephora Collection formula offers the best of the must-have hue. The shade is classic and sexy, helps you exude confidence and can give anyone major sex appeal. This sheer-shine lipstick flaunts a creamy, weightless formula that's designed to keep your lips hydrated for up to 12 hours. Not into reds? You can still enjoy the hydrating lip color since it's available in loads more shades ranging from nudes to to pinks to even a sheer, shimmery look. Promising review (for the Ray of Red shade): ""I love that this lipstick is sheer and has light pigmentation it almost feels like a lip balm with color than a lipstick and I love that but also it’s buildable if you want the color to shine through. I love it."" — Helloitsmonica Olaplex is known for its bond-repairing capabilities, and its leave-in conditioner sets a new standard. Formulated with split ends in mind, this product immediately seals, hydrates, softens and detangles strands for a salon-quality look with every use. Bonus: It's also designed to protect hair from heat damage up to 450 degrees! Promising review: Honestly, I wasn't expecting much of a difference. I'm always purchasing the latest product and I'm more frequently disappointed than I hope for. At first, I didn't see too much of a difference until the third time I used it. It's amazing! It's the one product I know I can expect noticeable results and make my hair from mid shaft to ends look like I just got a haircut and color. No more split ends popping out or sticking out making my hair look like a scarecrow. By the way my hair is medium thickness but has many breakage and split ends due to hair extensions and not being able to cut all the bad off unless I wanted a short short haircut which I don't. Another main thing that I love about this product is that I put it on the next day for hydration and it doesn't leave residue or make my hair look like I hadn't washed it. It just looks healthy. This project really does hydrate. I'm so glad I purchased this item and I don't really leave reviews but I knew that I wanted other women to find something that actually works without spending hundreds of dollars."" — Foxychica On this side, we take makeup application seriously. This velour puff comes in major clutch for baking, setting, and touching up your makeup seamlessly, leaving you with an airbrushed finish. Its triangle shape is perfect for getting into hard-to-reach areas, and the rounded end is ideal for applying makeup to the larger parts of your face. The days of dealing with uneven coverage are over. As someone who sometimes deals with dry lips during the chilly season, I find the Laneige lip mask to be an absolute godsend. It delivers maximum hydration and does all the work while you get your beauty sleep. (And yes, this is the same brand HuffPost readers adore for its hydrating face cream.)The formula features a blend of berry mix complex and plant butters meant to help you wake up to a softer feeling on ur lips that lasts. Vitamin C also helps to shield your lips from external aggressors — like the sun, X-rays, and other sources. This set comes with five lip mask minis in yummy flavors including Mango and Gummy Bear. Promising review: ""My daughter absolutely loves this stuff. Her lips went from chapped and peeling all the time to moisturized in a week. She doesn’t even need chapstick anymore."" — BrittDawnW Unlike many hair glosses available, Living Proof's formula stands out for one important reason: it boasts a lightweight silicone-free formula that leaves behind no residue. Yes, you read that correctly! This hair treatment also features light-enhancing technology that layers your strands with a supreme level of shine meant to last up to three washes. Promising review: ""I have no idea what is in this but it's the best hair product I have ever used. My hair looks so shiny, healthy, and frizz-free with this product. That is saying a LOT because i have very dry, thick and frizzy hair. Further, this product keeps me away from heating tools because my hair holds its shine and shape until my next wash. This product is truly incredible."" — staceyanna123 There's a reason why this Urban Decay setting spray is a permanent fixture in my makeup bag — it works like a charm! Known as a cult-favorite makeup essential, this super-fine mist keeps makeup fresh all day. It's transfer-resistant and smudge-proof for up to 16 hours, so your makeup look will stay right where you need it to be. Also, despite the bottle's size, a little goes a long way! One bottle should last you for several months to a year, depending on how often you set your makeup — making the price a very fair investment. A popular hair care staple, Briogeo's hair mask can give dry, damaged tresses the TLC they desperately need. It strengthens hair strands from root to tip, deeply moisturizes, softens and helps prevent future breakage — all without the heavy feel. The mask also has a vanilla birthday cake scent that serves as the cherry on top of a nourishing wash day experience. If you're sensitive to fragrance, I recommend you skip. The Lancôme Beauty Sleep Routine 2024 Holiday Skincare Gift Set is one luxurious way to take revitalizing your skin to the next level with high-end products that back up their price tag with trusty formulas. The set is definitely the best way to get more bang for your buck. Best of all, the set is complete with full sizes of the brand's Advanced Génifique Serum and Rénergie Lift Multi-Action Night Cream — a beloved duo that can aid in reversing dullness and firming the skin. No matter your hair type, moisture is essential for achieving a healthy mane. Moroccanoil's value set puts the goal in motion with its full-sized shampoo, conditioner, leave-in conditioner and mini hair oil treatment. The system is designed with ingredients to help smooth frizz, boost shine and provide overall nourishment. Apologies if you're late to the party, but press-on nails are so in! Granted, they're not like our grandmother's press-on nails from back in the day. These new and improved sets, including this glitzy Glamentic offering, have superior staying power and allow you to jazz up your manicure as you see fit. The best thing about this set is that it's not a one-and-done option. The nails are reusable and last up to three weeks! Promising review: ""I have jumped on the press on bandwagon lately and have been using another brand. I tried glamnetics for the first time and their quality is so much better. it's such an easy process and took me probably 20 minutes total from prep to finish. the other brand I used last me about two weeks so let's hope these do as well."" — skydieiak Prepare to enter the world of beauty pampering from head to toe, courtesy of L'Occitane's 24 Days Of Beauty Advent Calendar. Packed with hair care, skincare and body care finds, this set features top-quality ingredients that combat dryness and deliver nourishment, making it worthy of this season's hype. (Looking for more advent calendars, do checkout the best advent calendar roundup on the entire internet curated by HuffPost Shopping reporter, Erica Kam.) If you desire a multifunctional face product that hydrates, brightens and reduces the look of hyperpigmentation, consider your search over. Glow Recipe's Niacinamide Dew Drops serum has been a staple in my routine over the past six months, surpassing my expectations. The gel formula is lightweight and immediately melts into my skin. The watermelon in the gel hydrates my skin and gives my canvas a glowy finish. As for the niacinamide, it has helped to reduce the hyperpigmentation along my chin area, which has made me feel more confident rocking a fresh face. Trust me, you don't need to think twice about adding this serum to your routine. If you want versatility, high color payoff and seamless blending, you've met your match. This Sephora Collections palette, which boasts 29 mattes, shimmers, and metallics, has the color combinations you need to bring your desired eye makeup looks to life. The shades feel smooth as butter across your lids and don't require multiple layers for a highly pigmented finish. Gentle and effective cleansing is a must for healthy skin. Dieux's gel cleanser offering — formulated with glycerin, betaine and a gentle cleansing complex — works to remove impurities from the skin sans stripping. It's specifically formulated to address acne and the appearance of deep pores. Best of all, this product is available with or without fragrance, making it perfect for all skin types, including sensitive skin. Promising review: ""I always keep going back to this cleanser. my skin loves this so much. whenever I'm using it I see less breakouts. I also enjoy that it's fragrance-free as I have really sensitive skin."" — AnaG8616 By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount (and when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why). HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Update: This deal has ended as for November 5. Cheers to everyone who tapped in! If you’re unsure where to watch Election Day coverage this year, then allow your favorite deals team to suggest Peacock. No, this isn’t an ad. The streamer just has the best deal right now for catching live news and way more. It’s not purely a subscription service for watching reruns of “The Office” or, in my case, an embarrassing amount of pro wrestling. This election year, the network will actually broadcast three different live streams of the 2024 election results. And this year, Peacock is debuting a multi-view live channel, letting you watch all three streams simultaneously while prioritizing a single audio track. The main reason we’re suggesting Peacock? You’ll get the most bang for your buck well beyond Election Day, thanks to its latest deal (especially since we anticipate the results won’t settle until after November 5). Right now, you can grab a whole year for only $20 for a limited time. Just use promo code PEAT4VNFWRKCTAK at checkout and you’ll get an ad-supported Peacock sub for just $1.99 a month, or $20 a year. That’s $60 off its typical $79.99 yearly subscription — a 75% discount! Kicking off promptly at 6 p.m. ET / 3 p.m. PT, Peacock will begin broadcasting three live shows to cover the election: NBC News Now with Lester Holt and Savannah Guthrie, real-time analysis from Steve Kornacki, National Political Correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC, and electoral college results from the NBC News Decision Desk. With its newest multi-view feature, you can watch all three streams at once and switch between the audio of each. The subscription service also added an Election 2024 section to its menu screen, which has several previous news broadcasts and specials regarding this year’s election. -inducing election night aside, with Peacock, you can also watch the network’s gritty “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” reboot, “Bel-Air,” the Kevin Hart-led crime drama “Fight Night” and your regularly scheduled Sunday Night football. If a year subscription to Peacock is just too long for you (or you tend to forget to cancel subscriptions before your promo rate ends), then you can also sign up for Peacock’s Premium subscription service for $1.99 a month for six months. Just use PEAK1AQ31JFZGIQ at checkout to nab that deal for a shorter timeframe. Note that these promo rates are valid for new subscriptions and returning members alike! Don’t worry about flipping those channels during tomorrow’s election; just prioritize one. Tune into those election results, making take a wrestling break and save big on a Peacock subscription for a limited time.

Oliver, appearing on “The Late Show,” was asked by host Stephen Colbert, “Why do you think you bug him so much?” Musk “clearly loves comedy,” Oliver replied. “So, he wants to be funny and, unfortunately, money can’t buy you that,” he continued. “So, deep down, he’s never going to be funny and that must be eating him alive, because he’s trying so hard to be funny.” “Every time he tries, it must make it seem further away from him, that laugh that he’s always chasing but will never catch up with,” Oliver added.

Rogan’s announcement came on the eve of Election Day and coincided with the release of his interview with Musk for his podcast “The Joe Rogan experience.” “If it wasn’t for [Musk] we’d be fucked,” Rogan wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.” “For the record, yes, that’s an endorsement of Trump,” he added. The great and powerful @elonmusk.If it wasn't for him we'd be fucked. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump.Enjoy the podcast pic.twitter.com/LdBxZFVsLN Trump welcomed the news, falsely telling the audience at his Pittsburgh rally that Rogan hasn’t issued presidential endorsements in the past. “He’s never done this before,” Trump said. “Thank you, Joe. That’s so nice.” Rogan endorsed then-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in 2020. Earlier in the election cycle, Rogan said he was a “fan” of independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., calling him “the only candidate that makes sense to me.” While Rogan clarified his statement about Kennedy wasn’t meant as an endorsement, Trump still lashed out at him. “It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring???” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Kennedy, who dropped out of the race in August, has since endorsed Trump. In the final weeks of the race, Rogan interviewed both Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio). While he was reportedly in talks with Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign about hosting her on his show, the interview did not materialize. Rogan said her team had proposed he travel to meet Harris for a one-hour sit-down, which he suggested was not worth making the trip for. The next four years will change America forever.

Walz sat down with Stephen Colbert for an interview that aired Monday night on “The Late Show.” Colbert asked the Minnesota governor to “bring it in” for “one final pep talk” to undecided voters using “as many sports clichés as possible.” “Folks, dig down deep,” Walz said. “We know that we’re in the final two minutes of this game. We’re going to give 110%. We know we have to leave it on the field, because, look, democracy is at stake here. We have an opportunity to bring this country together. There’s no I in country.” He continued: So, look, we’re going to win this thing. We’ve got the best candidate. We got the best quarterback out there in Kamala Harris. We got the best game plan. We know their game plan of Project 2025 isn’t going to be good for any of us. And so, creating an opportunity economy, we’re going to put the ball over the goal line. We’re going to win this thing here in the final minute. And then we’re going to celebrate come Wednesday morning with our quarterback, President Harris. In August, Walz — who helped lead Minnesota’s Mankato West varsity team to a state championship in 1999 — went viral for using a football analogy to describe his political vision, saying it’s important to work together toward a shared vision and show good sportsmanship. During the 10-minute interview with Colbert, Walz discussed a range of lighthearted subjects including the highs and lows of his campaign, how he met his wife, Gwen Walz, and his reputation as a “Midwestern dad.” Heading into Tuesday’s election, polls still signal an incredibly tight contest between Vice President Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump. Asked about the close race, Walz said, “It disappoints me, I think, because I think the choice is so stark. But it’s not surprising — the country is really divided.” “You’ve got the Constitution vs. not the Constitution,” he added. “You’ve got reproductive rights vs. ‘I don’t care if you like it or not, I’ll tell you what to do.’” According to CBS, the interview was recorded in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on Thursday, and is Walz’s last address on a national platform before the election.

But former Rep. David Jolly (R-Fla.) isn’t buying it. “A lot of people, even Republicans, even MAGA Republicans, might say, ‘Donald Trump loses and he goes away,’” Jolly told MSNBC’s Joy Reid on Monday, the eve of the presidential election. “He doesn’t go away. He might go to prison but I promise you, he will consider running in 2028,” Jolly predicted. If Trump “is not the King in ’28, he will be the kingmaker,” the former congressman added. “He will have an ‘Apprentice’ Republican primary down at Mar-a-Lago to control the ’28 process. He’s not going anywhere.” Jolly’s prediction came during a discussion about Trump’s possible post-election efforts to overturn the result, should he lose to Democratic rival Kamala Harris. “One of the first ways Donald Trump will try to say the election was stolen is there will very likely be an undervote in most states between the number of people who vote for Donald Trump and the next down-ballot state-wide Republican,” Jolly explained. Republicans will claim “votes are stolen from Trump” but they just “don’t realize people don’t like Donald Trump, that’s why they’re doing it,” said Jolly. The certification of the election in 2025 is “ultimately” what Trump will be playing to, he added. “This is a race all the way to January for Donald Trump,” he warned.

Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said he was suspending all commuter trains in northeast Catalonia, a region with 8 million people, at the request of civil protection officials. Mobile phones in Barcelona screeched with an alert for “extreme and continued rainfall” on the southern outskirts of the city. The alert urged people to avoid any normally dry gorges or canals. Puente said the rains had forced air traffic controllers to change the course of 15 flights operating at Barcelona’s airport, located on the southern flank of the city. Several highways have been closed due to flooding. Classes were cancelled in Tarragona, a city in southern Catalonia about halfway between Barcelona and Valencia, after a red alert for rains was issued. Meanwhile, in Valencia, the search continued for bodies inside houses and thousands of wrecked cars strewn in the streets, on highways, and in canals that channeled last week’s floods into populated areas. Spain’s Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said that authorities can still not give a reliable estimate of the missing. Spanish national television RTVE, however, has broadcast pleas for help by several desperate people whose loved ones are unaccounted for. In the Aldaia municipality, some 50 soldiers, police and firefighters, some wearing wetsuits, searched in a huge shopping center’s underground parking lot for possible victims. They used a small boat and spotlights to move around in the huge structure with vehicles submerged in at least a meter of murky water. Police spokesman Ricardo Gutiérrez told reporters that so far some 50 vehicles had been found and no bodies had been discovered there. The Bonaire shopping mall’s 1,800 underground parking spaces quickly filled with water and mud on Tuesday and Wednesday when the southern outskirts of Valencia were hit by a tsunami-like flooding. The team is using four pumps to remove the water. Citizens, volunteers and thousands of soldiers and police officers pressed on with their gargantuan clean-up effort to clear out mud and debris. Many people feel abandoned by authorities, their anger erupting on Sunday when a crowd tossed mud at Spain’s royal couple, the prime minister and regional leaders as they made their first visit to Paiporta, where over 60 people died and the survivors have lost their homes and still don’t have drinking water.

Climate scientists and meteorologists say the immediate cause of the flooding was a cut-off lower-pressure storm system that migrated from an unusually wavy and stalled jet stream. It was likely fueled by a record-hot Mediterranean Sea. That system simply parked itself over the region and unleashed a deluge. The Spanish navy’s “Galicia” transport vessel arrived in Valencia’s port on Monday with marines, helicopters and trucks loaded with food and water to help with the relief effort, which included 7,500 soldiers and thousands of police reinforcements.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-america-2024_n_67292920e4b0be8c956a22c5","Donald Trump Is Changing What It Means To Be 'American'","paul blumenthal","2024-11-05","In his third consecutive bid for the presidency, Donald Trump has cast the United States, yet again, as a nation in decline mired by chaos, violence, internal subversion and subjugation. The U.S. is a “garbage can,” Trump says, that has been “invaded and conquered” by “murderers, rapists, and illegal criminals” and “vermin” with “bad genes” who are “poisoning the blood of our country” thanks to the machinations of his political foes ― “the enemy within.” Some of these enemies ― immigrants and citizens alike ― are “not people.” This rhetoric underlies a policy program that aims to tear apart the country at the seams. Immigrants both with and without legal status are to be targeted for detention, deportation and denaturalization in the largest internal law enforcement project the country has ever undertaken. It will be a “bloody story,” Trump promises. Political opponents and election officials, the “enemy within” he speaks of, will be investigated and put on trial for unspecified crimes while he will pardon those who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 on his behalf. The military will be deployed against U.S. citizens who protest any of these actions. He even aims to suspend the 14th Amendment’s grant of birthright citizenship ― the foundational constitutional provision that enshrines in law the truth we hold to be self-evident, that “all men [and women] are created equal.” For nearly 10 years, Americans have sought to understand Trump, the intellectual currents that sustain his political rise and the MAGA movement that adores him. And they’ve tried to understand why he defies what were once the normal rules of politics. Scandals, whether it be his crude and insulting statements, the many allegations of sexual assault levied against him or his naked corruption, deflect off of him. Fact-checking, which boomed as a journalism endeavor during his presidency, made little difference. The problem that many observers have had in understanding Trump, is that they have been making a category error in trying to make sense of Trump by the normal means of fact-based interpretation. Back in 2016, the media was told by conservatives, like journalist Salena Zito and far-right billionaire Peter Thiel, to take Trump “seriously, not literally.” But this formula does not get to the heart of the matter. Following the Jan. 6 attack, I wrote that “Trump’s supporters were not taking his words either literally or seriously, they were taking them mythically.” What Trump has sought to do ever since he descended the Trump Tower escalator ― whether he knew it himself or not ― is to supplant our country’s national political mythos and replace it with his own new spin on a very old story. In the U.S., our politics operate on the foundation of a number of myths that hold varying interpretations to different social groups. For example, the myth of the American Founding, that guides fidelity to the original principles set forth at the beginning of the nation in the present; and the Frontier Myth, wherein the vast lands and resources to be taken from native peoples provided “a gate of escape from the bondage of the past” in order to forge a new American identity and yield unending growth, as Frederick Jackson Turner wrote in 1893. But the key to understanding what Trump means is to look at the national myth that became the national creed following World War II in the 20th century: the “electric chord” that bound the nation, and that has since been broken. The most well-known words in the American national idiom are those written by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” A close second might be the brief speech Abraham Lincoln made to commemorate the cemetery at Gettysburg: “Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address announced a revolution in American thought. Instead of locating the founding of the country with the 1787 adoption of the Constitution, 76 years prior, he argued that the nation’s true founding came with the adoption of the Declaration and its principle that “all men are created equal.” Instead of rooting national identity in white Anglo-Saxon heritage, he rooted it in principle. In calling for a “new birth of freedom,” he crafted a dramatic narrative that gave significance to the action Americans should take to fulfill their country’s promise. A myth. This myth denies that American nationhood and citizenship is defined by blood, national origin or religion. It is instead defined by belief in a principle ― an idea ― that says that all people are created equal and endowed with particular rights that exist prior to the establishment of the Constitution. Lincoln outlined this in prior speeches. In 1858, Lincoln gave a speech in Chicago addressing how recent immigrants to the country could still be considered American. While they cannot “trace their connection” to the founding “by blood,” immigrants can “look through that old Declaration of Independence” and know “that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration.” “That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world,” Lincoln said. Lincoln’s myth did not take hold after the Civil War. It took until the second World War and its aftermath for it to become gospel. This American Creed emerged as the consensus view of American nationalism in the 20th century. It came about due to the ideological nature of the war against Nazi Germany, domestic and international pressure to resolve the oppression of Black Americans, and a push for greater integration and acknowledgement of the immigrants who had immigrated in large numbers at the turn of the 20th century. “Creedal nationalism was an attempt to explain the continuity of American institutions despite the transformation of its population,” Samuel Goldman writes in his 2021 book, “After Nationalism.” “The nation could absorb so much immigration, liberal theorists reasoned, because its essence lay in ideas rather than in blood, soil, or religious confession.” Franklin Roosevelt reflected this when he told the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1938 to “Remember, remember always that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists.” This national myth provided significance to the push for civil rights at home, the ending of immigration quotas and also foreign wars against supposed totalitarian foes. Today, this myth is still expounded by politicians ― although largely from the Democratic Party. “America is an idea — an idea is stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator,” President Joe Biden said in announcing his withdrawal from the presidential race in July. “The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in her closing speech on the Ellipse on Oct. 29. It is this myth that Trump and his allies are arrayed against. Despite occasional strategic nods to the Declaration as the source of the country’s meaning, Trump’s political career has been exemplified by a rejection of Lincoln’s creed. He and his allies have repeatedly sought to draw exclusionary lines on who is and isn’t an American, often on veiled or not-so veiled ethnic and racial grounds, and rejects Lincoln’s interpretation that the Declaration’s principle means that all men (and women) are created equal in the entire world. His promises to undo the 14th Amendment’s grant of birthright citizenship, which enshrined Lincoln’s interpretation of the Declaration into law, is no doubt the clearest example of his desire to reverse Lincoln’s myth. His own vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance rather explicitly took on creedal interpretations of American identity in his acceptance speech where he drew a picture of his family’s cemetery plot in Kentucky. “Seven generations of people who have fought for this country,” he said. “Who have built this country. Who have made things in this country. And who would fight and die to protect this country if they were asked to.” “Now that’s not just an idea, my friends,” he added. “That’s not just a set of principles. Even though the ideas and the principles are great, that is a homeland. That is our homeland. People will not fight for abstractions, but they will fight for their home.” Lincoln’s Gettysburg address consecrates the war cemetery not for the dead, who “have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.” Instead, he uses it to call “the living” to be “dedicated” to ensure that “government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” To win the war that tested whether “any nation” that was “conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal … can long endure.” Vance’s framing would reject this entirely. His rhetoric claims that no one will “fight for abstractions” and instead will only fight for their “homeland.” What he describes is people joined to the soil and the blood of their ancestors. And what he rejects is people joined together by their common belief in an idea. This is by no means new to American conservatism. The Lost Cause ideology that emerged out of the South following the Civil War explicitly rejected equality as the basis of American identity. This rejection of equality was joined by Northerners who saw inspiration in southern anti-Black racism to oppose and restrict immigration by non-“Nordic” Europeans. Conservative movement thinkers also strongly campaigned against a creedal interpretation of national identity in the 20th century ― instead claiming that freedom wasn’t meant for all, but to be limited by a consensus made by conservative white Americans. But this strain largely remained submerged in the conservative movement, as the coalition that came together in the Republican Party cohere around the shared goal of opposition to communism amid the emergence of the Cold War. Anti-communism was expressed through the American Creed, as the foundation of the “Free World” in its fight against totalitarianism and what made America exceptional among all nations. “America represents something universal in the human spirit,” Ronald Reagan said in 1989 before quoting a letter he said he received from a friend. That letter read, “You can go to Japan to live, but you cannot become Japanese. You can go to France to live and not become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany or Turkey, and you won’t become a German or a Turk. … Anybody from any corner of the world can come to America to live and become an American.” Not long after Reagan’s departure from the political scene and the end of the Cold War, conservatives began reversing course. Pat Buchanan’s “culture war” speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention presaged Trump’s rhetoric in casting America as suffering from decadence and decline brought about by deference to Blacks, secularists, feminists, and gays and lesbians. A “cultural war” was underway, Buchanan announced, that is “as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as was the Cold War itself, for this war is for the soul of America.” On one side he put Democrats Bill and Hillary Clinton, who supported “homosexual rights,” “abortion on demand,” “women in combat units,” and “radical feminism.” On the other were conservative Republicans, who he said still believed in “the Judeo-Christian values and beliefs upon which America was founded.” In 1997, after two consecutive presidential election losses for conservatives, the National Review published an essay by editor John O’Sullivan called After Reaganism that explicitly rejected the American Creed. In it, he lamented as “absurd” and utopian “the neoconservative belief that America is not a country, but an idea — a ‘cre[e]dal nation’ held together not by ethnic links, cultural sympathies, or shared historical memories, but by conscious subscription to the liberal political ideas outlined in the Declaration of Independence and entrenched in the Constitution.” Between then and Trump’s emergence, something happened. The significance of the creed began to come unglued. Once used as the ideological inspiration for America’s foreign policies aimed at spreading democracy around the world, the myth crashed aground in Iraq after George W. Bush lied the country into an ill-thought out war of choice and implemented a torture policy that violated international law. In doing so, he defied global opinion and the institutions of the 20th century’s liberal international order. Free trade deals that promised both a new frontier of unending growth and to eventually spread democracy through open markets decimated communities across the country in rapid succession while failing to make any country’s political system more democratic. Myths only continue to exist as myths when they hold significance for a particular social group. “A political myth can be defined as the work of a common narrative by which the members of a social group (or society) provide significance to their political experience and deeds,” Chiara Boticci writes in her book, “The Philosophy of Political Myth.” And that becomes evident in its absence, too: Amid multiple crises and changing material conditions in the country, the American creedal myth that long sustained the country seemingly ceased to provide meaning for many Americans. Trump moved to fill the vacuum with a narrative of decadence, decline and civilizational collapse that he “alone” could fix. This apocalyptic vision mobilized supporters to believe that the end times were not just nigh, but already happening. That they needed to “root out the communists, Marxists, fascists and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country that lie and steal and cheat on elections.” “I will give you everything,” Trump said in 2016. “I will give you what you’ve been looking for 50 years. I’m the only one.” This myth of decline and promise of retribution and salvation provides meaning and justification for a non-majoritarian conservatism that has lost the popular presidential vote in seven out of the last eight elections and no longer believes it can coexist with liberals. Anything is permissible in the face of such decline, including minority rule and, if need be, overturning the will of the people. “The people are corrupt,” wrote the Trumpist intellectual Michael Anton. There are “many native-born people who may technically be citizens of the United States but are no longer (if they ever were) Americans,” Glenn Elmers wrote in a 2021 piece titled Conservatism Is No Longer Enough. Elmers called for “overturning the existing post-American order” by “counter-revolution” and exhorted his readers to start lifting weights because “strong people are harder to kill.” “As they are opposed to humanity itself, they place themselves outside of the category completely, in an entirely new misery-driven subdivision, the unhuman,” far-right conspiracist Jack Posobiec writes in his 2024 book “Unhumans,” which goes on to praise fascist dictator Francisco Franco. (Vance blurbed Posobiec’s book: “Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec reveal their plans and show us what to do to fight back.”) What does one do with “vermin,” “the enemy within,” “unhumans,” and people who are “no longer American?” The question answers itself. This has antecedents in the American tradition, most notably in the Lost Cause and the anti-immigration movements of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Following the South’s loss in the Civil War, southern partisans crafted a narrative of civilizational collapse caused by the efforts of Reconstruction to provide freed Blacks equal rights ― including voting rights ― under the law. This mythos emphasized the need for violent rebellion through vigilantism to restore a traditional way of life (white supremacy) that had been taken by an illegitimate government. It sought to “idealize the social order of the Old South, and to justify a new phase of political violence to restore that order,” Richard Slotkin, author of “A Great Disorder: National Myth And The Battle For America,” writes. The Lost Cause would provide narrative power to the establishment of the Jim Crow system, and the violence enacted against anyone who dared challenge it or, worst of all, try to exercise their legal rights. Beyond the South, Northerners pressed a similar ideology against migrant communities, applying the anti-Black racism of the South to the increasing numbers of immigrants moving to Northern cities in search of jobs in the growing industrial economy. “Universal suffrage” for freed Blacks, “swarms of foreigners” and women “is destructive both to the purity and significance of the ballot,” so no one “can place any faith in that form of suffrage,” Charles Francis Adams Jr. wrote in 1869. These exclusionary narratives have been used time after time to maintain racial and ethnic hierarchies, and perpetrate human rights abuses. And that is what is, again, at stake today as Trump resurrects this mythical narrative of an exclusionary state for our time. This narrative of victimization and decline provides the grounding for the policies he hopes to enact. That includes a sweeping mass deportation campaign never before seen in the country that is aimed at legal and undocumented immigrants alike. This program will no doubt sweep up U.S. citizens into its net and violate constitutional and human rights. He has called for investigations and prosecutions of political opponents, election workers, and anyone who stands in his way. He wants to deploy the military to crush any sign of protest against his rule. And he has shown that he does not believe that Americans who do not vote for him should have their votes counted. Trump’s “MAGA-dominated Republican Party [is] determined to fight for its cultural Lost Cause … [while] the prevalence of ethnonationalism in MAGA ideology threatens the solidarity of the nation as a community; its authoritarian and illiberal characters threatens to override the rules and structures that have governed democratic politics,” Slotkin writes. While Trump has provided a narrative myth to provide significance and justification for action in the face of the collapse of the country’s existing national myth, liberals have not found a new way to explain what the country should mean. It is not that liberals or the left should jettison Lincoln’s myth in the Gettysburg Address. Rather, they must translate its meaning for a new generation. The attempts to create national unity under a foreign policy of democracy promotion seen in Ukraine have failed, while the dumb, deaf and blind support for Israeli war crimes in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon have further proved the shattered nature of the liberal international order that is supposedly upheld by the world’s democracies. It is time for something different. To counter the forces of myth propelling Trump, liberals and the left must not abandon the idea that this country is conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. They must recall that they exist in the context of all that came before, but also aim to be unburdened by what has been.",-0.0244538902741661,0.292946368106807
"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-white-house-or-jail_n_67291cc8e4b0be8c956a18f3","For Trump, It’s Either The White House Or The Big House","s.v. date","2024-11-05","WASHINGTON ― For Donald Trump, Tuesday’s election has come to this: It’s either the White House or the Big House. If he wins, the coup-attempting former president, already a convicted criminal, will be able to postpone his Georgia and New York state prosecutions until he is no longer in office. As for his two federal cases, he would be able to make them disappear forever by simply ordering his attorney general to dismiss them. “Those will be dismissed on Jan. 20. Both of them,” said Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House lawyer and onetime federal prosecutor who thinks his old boss deserves prison time. “There’s a compelling interest for the country to deter this treasonous bullshit and the mishandling of sensitive information.” Trump himself confirmed he would end the federal prosecutions by firing special counsel Jack Smith in an interview last month with pro-Trump radio host Hugh Hewitt. “It’s so easy — I would fire him within two seconds,” Trump said. Smith has headed the election interference and classified documents investigations. The New York and Georgia cases, meanwhile, would at best go into hibernation, lawyers said, because courts have ruled that presidents must have the ability to carry out their duties under the Constitution, notwithstanding state legal cases. “The state cases, because of the supremacy clause, nothing much will occur,” said Karen Agnifilio, a former prosecutor in Manhattan. “He can be sentenced in New York state, but he will not get anything that bleeds into his presidency. So maybe community service? A fine? Nothing?” A Trump victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris would mark the first time in American history that voters have put a literal criminal into office. Among former presidents, only Richard Nixon even came close to facing charges for his attempt to cheat in the 1972 presidential election and his subsequent attempts to cover it up. He was preemptively pardoned by newly sworn-in Gerald Ford days after Nixon resigned from office in 1974. Trump, in contrast, already faces three active criminal cases against him: in state court in Georgia, for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss there; in federal court in Washington, D.C., for his actions leading up to and during his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt; and in New York state court, for falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to a porn star days ahead of the 2016 election. There was a second federal prosecution, in South Florida based on Trump’s refusal to turn over secret documents he took with him to his Palm Beach country club upon leaving the White House, that was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon. Smith is appealing to have those charges reinstated. The New York case would be his most immediate threat, should he lose. A New York City jury in May found him guilty on every count. Sentencing is now set for Nov. 26. Though it is a white-collar crime and Trump is still legally a first-time offender, Judge Juan Merchan can consider Trump’s lack of remorse, the seriousness of the crime ― intended to sway the 2016 presidential election ― as well as Trump’s multiple violations of Merchan’s gag order forbidding the former president from attacking witnesses and court officers in the case. “Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts and should be treated like any other American. He should be sentenced as scheduled,” said Norm Eisen, a former lawyer in the Barack Obama White House who later worked for the U.S. House during Trump’s first impeachment for trying to extort Ukrainian authorities. Under New York guidelines, Trump could face 16 months to four years in prison at his sentencing, but Merchan will almost certainly allow Trump to remain free until he has exhausted his appeals. The Georgia case, in which Trump and multiple co-defendants have been indicted on a variety of charges, including racketeering and conspiracy, is currently bogged down in pre-trial motions. If Trump wins the election, he would likely get a stay of proceedings until he is no longer in office. If he loses, the cases probably would not get to trial for a year, at least. Both the Georgia case and the two federal cases, unlike the New York conviction, bring with them the possibility of substantial prison time if he is convicted on the most serious charges. The racketeering charge in Georgia, for example, carries a minimum five-year sentence, while the conspiracy charges in the federal case are punishable by a decade or more. Cobb says that if Trump loses, the Jan. 6 case could come to trial by late 2025 or early 2026, depending on how quickly the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the inevitable appeal Trump will make arguing he is immune even under the revised indictment in that case. The high court this summer ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for all “official” acts, which led Smith to bring a superseding indictment that dropped some allegations regarding Trump’s demands of his own Department of Justice for help in overturning the 2020 election. The federal prosecution in South Florida is currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. That court previously overruled and strongly criticized Cannon for a ruling that benefited Trump. Cobb said that in both federal prosecutions, Trump would reasonably get six to nine years in prison under the sentencing guidelines if he’s convicted. “He will go to jail, assuming three things: One, he doesn’t win. Two, he lives long enough. And three, she doesn’t pardon him.” Cobb said it would be good for the country for Harris to do so, making him a non-issue rather than keeping him in the national headlines for years to come. It would also be good for the Republican Party, he said, which could move past Trump and return to some level of normalcy. “The reality is that without Trump, the Republicans would have 60 senators and 240 members of the House,” he said.

She did share a couple with her housemate, but said she was keeping most for her own enjoyment, and looked forward to having one or two with her coffee every morning. I was thrilled that she loved them as much as I hoped she would."" — Cookie lover If you don't think having their name or initials on something is quite your recipient's style, how about a place that means a lot to them? This custom serving tray has a slightly different take on personalization by letting you enter a specific address. Maybe it's the place you first met them, somewhere you know they love to travel or even the place they call home. The address will be marked with a star on a map that covers the base of the serving tray, which is made of felt and wood. You can also customize the title of the map. Choose between natural or burnt wood for the sides of the tray, as well as a stand or no stand. Promising review: ""Excellent quality and a fun gift for friends and family - the ability to have a dropped pin and a unique legend add to the appeal of this piece. My friends said it was the best gift they received!"" — Ms.P This rope chain bracelet can be personalized by including a ""secret"" custom photo inside the main stone that can be projected with a flashlight, viewed with a mobile phone camera or seen up close with the naked eye. In essence, you're giving your giftee a special way to carry around a cherished memory daily. The circle pendant has an anti-allergy coating that's water-resistant (so they can wear it in the shower or while swimming), and the rope is adjustable to fit their wrist. Choose from a ton of color combinations, as well as a photo template. Don't forget to clip the 10% off coupon on the product page for a discount at checkout. Promising review: ""I received the bracelet a few days sooner than the estimated delivery date. I'm very happy with the quality of both the bracelet and the image in the crystal, and I love all the different ways you can view it. I have small wrists and it fits well when tightened all the way.This was a memento for my cat who recently passed, and it helps to feel like I can keep him with me in some small way. I hope it holds up well to daily wear. I believe it will, but it came with a booklet from the seller that offers customer support just in case it doesn't."" — corinne heath The brand that makes this personalized flask, WeddingsDecorandMore, suggests that it's a great groomsmen gift, but we think it's more than suitable as a holiday gift too. The leather is laser-engraved with up to three lines of text. The flask holds 6 ounces, measuring 4-by-4.5 inches (aka pocket size). You can choose from brown, gray or rawhide leather. Promising review: ""Excellent quality. The engraving was literally perfect. I would highly recommend to anyone thinking about buying this."" — Edward Lopez Whether you have a specific song that reminds you of this person, or you just know they love music, this customizable plaque lets you show off cherished memories. You can personalize the photo, title, artist and time, as well as the text color and stand type (wood or LED). You don't have to choose a real song for this, either — it can be a message, their name or something else, as the example pictured here shows. You can even include an optional QR code for them to scan, if you want them to be able to play an actual song any time they see this. Promising review: ""I’m so glad that I purchased this gift for a friend. The material is extremely good quality, the product was sent out very promptly and it looks amazing."" — Molly For a friend's birthday once, I stored smaller gifts inside a personalized canvas tote bag just like this one, which lets you pick their initial to display on the front side with a flower. It was a nice way to have a gift-within-a-gift, and the tote is more usable than a standard gift bag. This tote has reinforced handles, an inside pocket with a zipper, a button closure on top and enough room to function as a beach bag or hold a laptop. Just be aware that only 20 out of 26 letters of the alphabet are available for this one, so you'll want to check whether your recipient's name fits the bill. You'll also be happy to know that for many options here, they're available to ship in two days for Prime members! Promising review: ""Ordered this bag as a welcome gift for a new employee. She loved it! Everybody needs a “work” bag, and this is perfect. You can throw everything in it on your way out the house and off to work you go. It’s durable and large enough to carry all your stuff for work, including your lunch."" — Nina Ruiz Sure, a good bottle of whiskey is a nice gift on its own, but an even better to gift whiskey is with this personalized oak whiskey barrel that's available in two sizes (2- or 5-liter). The barrel is handmade, and you can choose a ""distillery"" name, location and founding year to make this a real conversation piece. You can also purchase the barrel with one or three flavor essences for customized spirits. Promising review: ""The barrel itself is very sturdy and well made. The customizable portions of this barrel are absolutely beautiful and added an even more personal and sentimental element to a gift already perfect for the whiskey drinker in our family. The overall craftsmanship just really makes this barrel worth every penny!"" — Jerry This candle, made and sold by woman-owned small business Paperwhite Candles on Etsy, can be customized with one of 13 scents and a label that reads the name of your recipient and a custom ""definition"" of their name. The candle comes in two sizes and has an approximate 20- to 40-hour burn time depending on which size you pick. It's made with a natural coconut wax blend that's vegan, phthalate-free, toxin-free, and paraben-free. Promising review: ""Items were perfect for the gift I needed and the scents I got smell amazing!"" — Etsy customer This snowflake ornament deserves a closer look — literally. Its unique spikes are actually a name written over and over into a symmetrical arrangement. The ornaments are made of plywood and measure 5-by-5 inches (if you're not a fan of the look of plywood, a fun way to personalize these even more is by painting them). Each name has a unique shape, so each snowflake does, too. This can be a sweet gift they'll keep throughout the years to use during multiple holiday seasons. Promising review: ""I gave it as a Christmas gift, and it looked great on the tree. (It was backed with twinkle lights.) My mother loved it. When the tree was taken down, it was put in a window as a sun catcher, and now when the light shines through the window her name is projected into the room. ""It is a daily reminder that I am loved."" Not only is the ornament beautiful on the tree, it could not convey a better message throughout the year."" — Lollie If you're interested in the idea of personalized jewelry, this ring lets you choose names or words your recipient might want to keep close to form a ring of sterling silver, gold or rose gold. For example, you can input the names of your giftee's children, grandchildren or siblings. You can also select one of two fonts — the product page notes that you can contact the seller for a font mock-up, if you want to make sure you like how it looks before you hit purchase. Grab this ring in sizes 3.5 to 11.5. Promising review: ""Description was exactly how it was described. Quality is perfect. This is a second item I bought. I am very pleased. I intend to buy other items soon."" — Elaine A great option for someone with an at-home office or who has a their own cubicle at work, this personalized nameplate can add a nice touch to their desk. Pick from 18 designs, as well as whether you want to include a wood stand or not for the nameplate (the option without the wood stand is thicker). You can include the person's name and title, and customize the fonts and colors of both. Also thrown in is a business card holder, another practical item they may appreciate. Promising review: ""I bought this for my manager during appreciation week. It came packaged nicely. It is gorgeous and the colors are very vibrant as pictured. It is the perfect size for her desk and she immediately put it on display. For the price, it is pretty amazing and an easy choice to make someone feel appreciated."" — masseyi A beauty product fanatic or frequent traveler will likely appreciate this practical and thoughtful gift of a vegan leather cosmetics bag that can display their embroidered name. There are multiple inside pockets, including one with a zipper that separates the bag into two compartments. The bag is also stain- and water-resistant, and has a top handle for portability. You can choose between five bag colors, three font styles and eight thread colors for the text, which can go up to two lines of 10 characters each. Promising review: ""Super cute personalized cosmetic bags!! It arrived fast, less than a week after I purchased them!! I bought bags for my 2 daughters and daughter-in-law, plus I bought a non-personalized bag for myself. I’m excited to use it. I love all the little compartments to keep everything organized."" — Jennifer Christopher A gift that acts as decor, a conversation piece and a music playlist all in one, this personalized record can be a thoughtful way to nod to a loved one's favorite music and memories or accomplishments. Choose between platinum or gold for the record, and a black mat or floating glass frame. You can customize the label's color, title and subtitle, and add up to five songs that mean something to them and you. (Just know that this is made from an upcycled vinyl, so it's not really meant for actual listening.) Promising review: ""This is my 2nd purchase—yes, I'm THAT pleased. My husband has hung both records on the wall of his studio to motivate him to continue to create more music and follow his passion and it's no better feeling that I'm able to do that for him through my gift of these. He thanks me everyday and tells me that these were the best gifts he's ever received and I couldn't be more honored and proud of myself."" — Des The Best Gift Giver Okay, yes, $50 is a bit pricey for socks, but these personalized socks are more than just a stocking stuffer. The real showstopper element is the ability to add custom text up to 20 characters in two areas, by the ankle and near the toes. Just think of how you can make your giftee smile when they're getting dressed in the morning — which is priceless, if you ask me. Available in black or gray, these crew socks are made of soft Pima cotton and come in sock sizes 10-13. Promising review: ""Who hasn't struggled with what to get a male friend or relative for Christmas? How often did you end up buying him socks? Well, these socks are special socks! My stepsons were so surprised and happy with them that I'm buying them this year for my brother-in-law and nephews.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ecofriendly-artificial-christmas-trees-up_l_6724f708e4b00acf55d9b2b3","The Most Eco-Friendly Artificial Christmas Trees To Shop This Year","tessa flores","2024-11-05","It’s evident now more than ever how our consumer choices and lifestyle decisions have significant and lingering effects on the environment and the precarious ecological system on which we depend. Images of oceans packed with more plastic than fish, communities devastated by natural disasters and landscapes scorched by record temperatures are visual representations of action and reaction. Everything down to the type of artificial Christmas tree we choose has a resounding impact on how hospitable the world of tomorrow will be, which makes “eco-fying” one of your most beloved holiday traditions not only worth it, but imperative. “Artificial Christmas trees are commonly made from PVC or polyethylene plastics and imported from China or South Korea,” explained Emily Fletcher, a sustainability expert and founder of the Australian Clean + Conscious Awards. “Both of these plastics are derived from petrochemicals and create huge greenhouse gas emissions in their manufacture.” While it’s nearly impossible to find artificial Christmas trees that are not made from PVC or some kind of polyethylene plastics, there are some made from recycled PVC, which is a much better option if you’re buying your first artificial tree or replacing one that’s busted. “Depending on what the artificial Christmas tree is made and sourced from, it has the potential to be one of the most sustainable products,” said Matt Bertulli, a longtime waste management advocate and the CEO of Pela, an international sustainability company that makes everyday products out of everyday waste. “By purchasing one artificial tree made of sustainable products and materials, you are drastically reducing harmful products from being thrown into the environment.” Robert Gibson, a professor at the school of environment, resources and sustainability at the University of Waterloo in Canada, told HuffPost it’s crucial to consider “the full life cycle of the products involved. For an artificial tree, that includes the effects of extracting the materials, manufacturing, transporting, using, storing, recycling or disposing.” Although artificial trees made in the U.S.A. are very few and far between, Gibson’s words suggest that locally made trees, which likely haven’t used as much fossil fuel to arrive at your doorstep, are worth the effort in the long run if you can find one. Buying domestic can also help prevent you from experiencing the host of global supply issues that are having a huge impact on the artificial tree industry. That said, the use that you get out of the tree is perhaps the most critical factor. “The idea behind using an artificial tree is that it will be used repeatedly and therefore save a living tree from being cut down and subsequently heading to landfill just a few weeks later,” Fletcher said. “So, if you’re doing an artificial tree, the most important factor in its sustainability is to use it for as many years as possible.” Take a look at some of the artificial Christmas trees on the more sustainable side below for an earth-conscious Christmas.

Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. This elevated and rustic Christmas tree allows you to invest in a natural non-PVC material that will remain intact for years to come. This dreamy tree stands either 4 or 6 feet tall and is made with soft feather-like dried pampas grasses that doesn't need ornaments. ""There are more sustainable reusable tree options, such as a living tree in a pot or one made from driftwood, decorated branches or sustainably sourced timber,"" Fletcher told HuffPost. This unique Christmas tree alternative can be adjusted and designed in an endless number of ways and be taken apart easily for convenient storage. Standing six feet in height, the base and branches are handmade from recycled wood pine, poplar and oak by a carpenter in Pennsylvania. It comes in either 5 or 6 feet and includes the X-base. The full, lush branches of alternating evergreen colors help add to the realism of this 7-foot tree by Oncor, a company that promises you can get 30 years of use from their trees, which are made from 100% reused PVC plastic. They also donate a percentage of their sales to FTP (For The Planet) approved non-profit environmental organizations around the globe. Professor Greys Sošić is chair of the department of data sciences and operations at University of Southern California and an expert in supply chain management and sustainability. Sošić told HuffPost that ""when choosing lights, LED lights are the better choice due to their energy efficiency."" This pre-lit tree from National Tree Company uses dual multi-colored LED lights that are low heat and have 10 different functions. The nine-foot Dunhill fir is also made in the U.S., so there'll be no carbon emissions as a result of overseas shipping. It comes in three sizes starting 7.5 feet to10 feet. Another alternative material Christmas tree option that also comes from Etsy is this handmade spiral tree made from laser cut plywood. It has a slim design so it can fit into smaller spaces and stands 75 inches tall without any tools required for assembly. The seller is based in Europe and recommends express shipping to the US to avoid any holiday-related delays. Traditionally, aspen firs are seen peppering snow-capped mountains and are best identified by their slightly upturned branches. And while this aspen fir replica tree wasn't grown in such a stunning landscape, it is made with 100% recycled PVC plastic that's both non-toxic and flame retardant. With a 42-inch max diameter, this can be a good option for more narrow and taller spaces. It comes in three sizes starting at 4.5 feet up to 6 feet. This Parana slim pine stands either 5 feet or 8 tall and features pops of lighter branches, also made from 100% recycled PVC plastic. Oncor uses a hook-tree construction and knock-down packaging to reduce carbon emissions from shipping and packaging waste.

But just because something is as hardworking and practical as a kitchen trash can doesn’t mean it can’t also look good. We’re all about the melding of form and function, and these days there are are plenty of common household items that look lovely and are useful. Picking up a fresh new trash can is an unexpectedly easy way to perk up the look and feel of your kitchen. The ideal bin will blend into the space, not stand out like a large, stinky sore thumb. Depending on the kind of kitchen you’re working with, you want to look for a trash can that is large, keeps smells contained, and is made of sturdy materials built to last. We’ve rounded up kitchen trash can options that include touchless tops, dual sections to separate recycling and more. The one thing all of these bins have in common? They are all wildly popular and highly rated on Amazon, so you can trust that you’re making a sound investment. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. HuffPost Shopping deputy editor Marquaysa Battle can personally vouch for this rectangular stainless steel trash can with a pedal. ""I'm obsessed with my Simplehuman trashcan,"" she says. ""It's super durable, easy to clean and holds A LOT. It insulates odor so well that when I, embarrassingly, forgot to empty my trash before a week-long trip and opened my front door, I never smelled a thing. It wasn't until I opened the lid to throw something away that I realized my error. That's how good this thing conceals garbage odor. I never ever want another trashcan to be honest."" The can has a liner pocket so you can store new liners inside the can, a silent-close lid and fingerprint-resistant coating to keep it looking shiny and new. It's available with a steel or plastic lid in three sizes, including one with dual compartments. This can has 4.6 out of 5 stars across over 16,300 ratings. We love a multitasking item, and this wood cabinet features a tilt-out trash bin that saves space and keeps waste hidden. The waterproof surface is easy to clean and strong enough to hold kitchen appliances like microwaves, mixers, blenders and coffee machines. Available in five different colors to match your kitchen design, it has 4.3 out of 5 stars with over 1,500 ratings. (Heads up: This one is technically a trash can holder and not a can itself, so you'll need to buy one separately. The cabinet will fit any trash can up to 10 gallons, like this highly-rated option from Rubbermaid.) Promising review: ""I use to hide my trash container underneath the kitchen sink because I hate the look of trash sitting in the house. I found this cabinet that not only hides the trash can but also looks good. I live in a small apartment so i like that it does not take up much space but it holds a lot. It is a wonderful accent piece. It is very sturdy and it matches my dining room table perfectly."" — Anita A. Dispose of your recycling alongside your trash with this stylish 16-gallon step bin. It has two separate easy-to-clean removable buckets, hinged lids, handles and a soft, quiet closure. The can comes in six colors and has 4.5 out of 5 stars and over 17,300 ratings. Promising review: ""I am writing this review as I order my second garbage can. I ordered this exact can 6 years ago. It has been amazing. It took 6 years of a large family using it constantly to finally have one of the lid covers break. My kids are very hard on this can. It is roomy on both sides and bags stay in place well. I happily order a new one today. Hopefully it lasts as long as it’s predecessor."" — KramerK This no-touch 13-gallon trash bin from Homelabs uses infrared technology to open and close the butterfly lid. The slim, low-profile design is perfect for small spaces and can be tucked under countertops since the split doors provide better clearance for low spaces. It is rated 4.3 out of 5 stars with over 6,800 ratings. You can also get it a 21-gallon size. Promising review: ""We currently have our grandmother living with us, she has poor eye sight. With that comes a multitude of issues. However, having a trash can that allows you to just wave your hand and the lid pops open is genuinely worth it! It even closes after a certain amount of seconds. No extra hassle or worries! In addition to that, it can either be plugged in or run on batteries, your choice! Lastly the replacement of a bag is so easy, my grandmother could do it! Thank you!"" — Rena'e One of Simplehuman's most popular kitchen trash cans, this model features a strong steel pedal, a silent-close lid that stays open for as long as you need and a non-skid base. It's a stylish receptacle that doesn't pull visual focus in a room. It's rated 4.7 out of 5 stars with over 13,700 ratings, and comes in four sizes, including one with a dual recycling compartment. Promising review: ""I had another stainless steel trash can from Walmart. It was very nice but the lid accelerated and rocked back as I pushed the pedal toward the floor. Not a very good design because I set mine beneath the counter and the lid kept slapping the counter when guests who didn’t know how to use it would come over. With this new trash can, the lid opens perfectly and never slaps the counter or wall. It sits just below counter height when fully open so it is perfect. Also, it is hard to describe, but this trash can is different than other trash cans because the mechanism that controls the lid opening does so in a way that the lid does not accelerate as it opens or “open abruptly”. Smooth action all the way up and down. Never thought I’d be writing a review about a trash can."" — James If you prefer a plastic bin, this 13-gallon Rubbermaid can is a classic. It has a stainless step pedal and interlock technology to keep it sealed tightly and prevent smells from escaping. Liner bands around the rim ensure that trash bags stay in place without slipping. This can comes in four colors and has 4.1 out of 5 stars across over 19,800 ratings. Promising review: ""My family has had these trash cans for years, and they've never had any issue with them. They are easy to clean. There is a piece that hold that trashbag, and when the lid sits on top of it, it pushed the piece down to add extra security to hold the trashbag in place more securely. I don't have to worry about rust, or smudge marks, or dents with this trash can. Plus, it holds a lot, too."" — Elizabeth DeCanio Boasting a sleek, unobtrusive design, iTouchless' 13-gallon automatic trash can features an odor-absorbing and neutralizing filter and lid lock to keep your kitchen smelling fresh and clean. The automatic lid is powered by batteries or an optional AC adapter that is sold separately and lowers the chance of cross-contamination. It makes for easy, mess-free trash disposal. An incredibly popular option on Amazon, this can has 4.3 out of 5 stars and over 46,000 ratings. Promising review: ""This is my 2nd one. The original lasted 4 years. I loved it enough to buy another. The hands free is great when you are carrying multiple items. It is also great from a avoiding germs point of view. Your hand never touches the trashcan. Highly recommend. I got the one with the electric cord so I don't have to worry about batteries. You'll be happy you bought it."" — Jo Ann Moschetto Keep things simple with Umbra's classic swing top 16-gallon can — a low-maintenance bin with a streamlined, modern vibe. You can use either 20- or 30-gallon garbage bags, depending on what you have or need. The can is available in five colors and is rated 4.6 out of 5 stars, with over 6,200 ratings. Promising review: ""We wanted a large trash can that did not have a lid sensor that would stop working. Plus, the edging around that type of lid gets cruddy no matter how many times you clean it thoroughly and wipe it down. The other best option was a swing-top lid. This trash can fit the bill. It holds a lot if you cook a lot, and I do. When it comes time to take out the trash, the bag is easy to remove, replace, and snaps into place automatically. The last one we had, with its fancier sensor lid, was tough to snap in place, you would have to fight with it to snap into place. The more expensive can also had a lid that wound up snapping where it was hinged. I wash my hands all the time. It is not a stretch or inconcvenience to wash my hands after finishing up food prep and tossing things."" — Mizz B Glad's 13-gallon stainless steel can has special technology to inhibit the growth of odor-causing bacteria, making it ideal for those with sensitive noses. It also has a rear bag compartment so you can store extra bags right behind the trash. It's also fingerprint- and smudge-resistant, and has a quiet closing lid. This bin has 4.7 out of 5 stars and over 14,700 ratings. Promising review: ""I got this great trash can almost a year ago and my only regret is that I didn’t get it much sooner. My old 40 gallon dog proof can wasn’t bad but this one is MUCH more sleek and I really like it. The bags fit better and are easier to change and it just looks nicer. The biggest issue I had was deciding between stainless and black stainless to match my appliances. I went with stainless and still have no regrets. This was worth every penny. I love the hands free lid opening because it keeps it clean and tidy. I had no idea that it would make such an extreme difference but it really does. The difference is radically different and I didn’t expect that. I’m very happy with this product."" — pdat Perfect for homes with little ones, this Ninestars bin has a fingerprint-resistant stainless steel base as well as a water-resistant infrared motion sensor that prevents accidental spills from damaging the unit. It seals in smells, prevents cross-contamination and looks good while doing it. It has 4.3 out of 5 stars and over 13,600 ratings. Promising review: ""I purchased this trash can in 2013, & it's still working like a dream! I've thoroughly enjoyed using it bc it has simplied my life by allowing me to easily discard veggie & fruit peelings, emptying small trash cans, vacuum cleaner dust cups, & so much more, without touching the can in any way & hiding the garbage when not in use. The size is perfect for kitchen trash bags, & the can isn't too heavy for me to lift. Changing trash bags is easy, & I've rarely had leakage into the can itself. That has happened only when I put something sharp in the can & put a hole in the bag; I clean it with antibacterial wipes, spray the interior with Lysol, & let it dry before putting in a fresh bag.. The noise when the lid opens is minimal. The batteries last forever, so I've rarely had to replace them. I've even bought one to give as a wedding gift. If I ever need to replace it, I'll definitely buy this brand & style again."" — Dee D. Get one of these wildly popular and durable 13-gallon stainless steel cans in your kitchen. It features a manual foot lever, a soft-close lid, and is smudge- and fingerprint-resistant. The interior is easy to clean, and designed to make it simple to replace bags and dispose of waste. The can is rated 4.4 out of 5 stars with over 40,800 ratings. Promising review: ""This is THE best trash can I have ever had! The soft closed lid is just that ALL the time. It is large and roomy and the trash bags fit and are full when removed- not half full like my in cabinet one. Cleans beautifully and is a perfect addition to my new stainless kitchen."" — Radean V.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/primula-stovetop-espresso-coffee-maker-amazon_l_672042ece4b0a4f117c7eb4c","One Of The Most Popular And Highest Rated Espresso Makers On Amazon Is Just $20","tessa flores","2024-11-05","HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. When it comes to the many methods of coffee making, people are very particular about their techniques and tools of choice. But for anyone who is open to expanding their arsenal of java tools, look no further than one brewing system that’s possibly one of the most laid-back options we’ve ever found. The Primula coffee and espresso maker is a 4.4-out-of-5-star gadget that’s amassed well over 21,400 5-star reviews on Amazon and is by no means a recent innovation. It’s actually a replica of the traditional moka pot, which has Italian origins dating back to the 1930s and has remained an adored tool of choice for its capacity to rapidly brew flavorful and great-tasting coffee, with only a stovetop. (The original moka pot, The Bialetti, is also available and highly rated on Amazon, but for nearly twice as much as the Primula.) Aside from its supreme functionality, this display-worthy apparatus is also the choice of many coffee lovers because it can be used to create virtually any type of beverage; be it a potent espresso shot for home lattes or cappuccinos, regular coffee and Cuban-style coffee. This is because it works well with any type of ground beans plus, it uses a reusable filter system, which means no need to repurchase packs of paper filters every month. And like its predecessor, the Primula is crafted with cast aluminum that promises to be durable and offer “thorough and even heat distribution for enhanced flavor, aroma and consistency.” According to its maker, each time you want to make a coffee with the Primula, simply fill the lower chamber with water, add your ground coffee or espresso to the filter portion, screw the pitcher part back on before heating over a stovetop at a slight angle, making sure that the handle is not directly above the heat source to prevent it from getting too hot or melting. It’s compatible with all electric, ceramic and gas stovetops so it’s perfect for camping or other traveling. You’ll know that your coffee is done when the heating process has pushed the freshly brewed coffee into the above pitcher through a safe stainless steel valve and it’s ready to pour right into your cup through the non-drip spout. Clean up also promises to be as equally as low-maintenance. Though the Primula isn’t dishwasher-safe, you only need to rinse out the components after each use. Now on to an important note about size. You’ll notice that the Primula comes in five different cup-capacities ranging from one to 12 cups, but this isn’t measured in the traditional cup sizes that you would use for baking. Rather, its referring to demitasse or espresso cup sizes, which roughly equates to one fluid ounce. So, if you’re wanting to use this for larger cups of traditional brewed coffee, you’ll want to opt for the larger Primula size. There’s also a selection of four different colors and an option that includes a frother for crafting rich foamy milks to accompany all your creamy lattes and airy cappuccinos. The general consensus among reviewers is that this straightforward and iconic essential is worth the purchase because it’s affordable, consistent and even “makes coffee better than” pour-over methods and even a Keurig, which is arguably the most no-fuss coffee contraption of all. Read these endorsements and more up ahead or order a Primula of your very own. Promising Amazon reviews: “A must-have for coffee lovers. As a Dominican who loves coffee, the Primula Classic Stovetop Espresso and Coffee Maker has become an indispensable part of my daily routine. This Moka pot, also known as a greca, delivers rich and flavorful espresso that reminds me of the coffee I grew up with.The design of the Primula Moka pot is both classic and functional. Made from durable aluminum, it heats up quickly and evenly, ensuring a consistent brew every time. The 9-cup capacity is perfect for sharing a morning coffee with family or friends, or for making multiple servings to enjoy throughout the day.Brewing with this Moka pot is straightforward and reliable. Just fill the bottom chamber with water, add your favorite finely-ground coffee to the filter, and place it on the stove.” — Rumbo Sin Limite ″I was once a Keurig girl, for many years, actually. I gave that up for the pour-over method because (in my opinion) it tastes better. That was me leveling up my coffee snobbery just a little bit. I have relatives with the fancy home espresso machines with the pods (you know what I’m talking about). No complaints - that stuff tastes great. But I didn’t want to go back to a machine with pods. So, I stick with my pour-over. However, I got this moka pot and sometimes I use it. Not EVERY single day, but usually 2-3 mornings a week. In my opinion (again), this pot makes better coffee than pour-over, which is better than keurig coffee. So I have once again leveled up my coffee snobbery, and I’ve been quite happy with it. Bonus points, the gray blue color is my favorite color...it’s beautiful and functional and I love it. Other reviewers made comments about the plastic handle melting or breaking off. To avoid these things with my pot, I just keep those things in mind and I don’t hold the handle while I’m twisting the pot together or apart. I also have been very careful to position the pot on the stove burner such that the handle is NOT directly over the burner. I have not had any issues and my handle is still intact and has not melted at all. Very happy with my beautiful blue moka pot.” — J Leigh “I love this pot for several reasons - it’s inexpensive and it makes great espresso for lattes!!!! I’m so happy I got this instead of an espresso machine - this is not a hands off sort of morning coffee but I love making it and I feel like a bit of a scientist. I highly recommend boil water first before filling the lower chamber (trust me you’ll be happy you did! You’ll have coffee quicker and it won’t taste burnt!)—-(adding boiling water to the lower part will make it very HOT so use a hot pad to hold the bottom while you screw on the top) then always fill up the coffee section all the way and you have a great cupa in just a few minutes! This makes my house smell amazing and I love seeing it on the stove when not in use (it’s adorable!) and I get lots of compliments.” — Lind-says “I have seen these type of coffee makers all my life but have never tried one. Recently I had a friend ask me to bring him one to Mexico that is this specific brand, so I bought one for myself as well. Using it was super simple, it was so simple that I looked at two or three videos online to make sure I was doing the right thing (because it was so simple).You put the water in the bottom, put the filter in, put ground coffee in it without packing it, lock on the top part, put over fire (I tried medium fire so the coffee sips upwards slowly) then pour!Two things:I made the mistake of putting this in a right angle to get the last of the coffee out and that made the ground coffee sip through into my coffee. Boo, totally my fault - lesson learned!My stove has 3 different sized flames - I used the smallest in fear that the black wooden handle might burn if I used the strong flames.Overall, very happy with my purchase! The coffee came out strong and flavorfully, this is the same ground coffee I use on my single-cup-coffee maker, and it tasted completely different! Highly recommended if you like expresso (or just strong coffee).” — Kahlos Mahn By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Harris’ campaign feels “disciplined” and “organized” while Trump is “trying a new message every other day” and his team is “blaming each other already,” Carville told MSNBC’s Ari Melber. Carville drew on his lengthy political experience, which has included being on the losing side of elections, when he said: “I kind of know what they feel like and look like and my chief takeaway is that the Harris campaign does not feel like it’s losing.” And although he didn’t have polling data to back up the claim, he said: “I do know smell when I smell it and [Trump’s] campaign has the smell of a loser, to me.” The next four years will change America forever.

Speaking at a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday, the Republican vice presidential nominee said, “In two days, we’re going to take out the trash in Washington, D.C., and the trash’s name is Kamala Harris.” On MSNBC soon afterwards, Wallace watched the clip three times in a row. “Oh my God,” she said after the first time. “Can I see that again?” “Forgive me. One more time,” she said after the next. After watching it three times, she told viewers, “In my humble view, lights are out.” “Women. You can disagree with us; we’ve actually learned to take it for our whole careers all the time in every form, but you call us trash?” she continued. “Oh, oh, oh. You just effed up in a way that I’ve never seen in my political life — and I worked for Sarah Palin.” Vance and his running mate, Donald Trump, have alienated women during the 2024 campaign by making and amplifying sexist and creepy comments, and campaigning with misogynists. Trump has also attempted to rewrite his record on reproductive rights, after paving the way for extreme abortion bans to be enacted across the country. The former president is still dealing with the fallout, particularly in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, after a comedian at his New York City rally late last month called Puerto Rico an island of “garbage.” The next four years will change America forever.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/calm-happy-vacation_l_67224277e4b03a564e7cea67","Want To Take Your Calmest, Happiest Vacation Yet? Follow These 10 Tips.","ashley broadwater","2024-11-05","As fun and exciting as travel can be, it sure can come with some chaos. To some degree, we have to accept that stressors are just a part of life and travel. However, there are also plenty of ways to plan for a happy and calm trip — and who better to ask than therapists who travel? Ahead, check out 10 ways that mental health pros help their own trips go smoothly. The last thing you want while traveling is extra, unnecessary stress — like running through the airport so you don’t miss your flight. To some extent, that’s in your control. The key is doing what you need to do before you need to do it. “There’s nothing that stresses me out more than being rushed,” said the Rev. Connie L. Habash, a psychotherapist. “So when I travel, I plan as much extra time for every step of the process as possible.” Arriving early may entail more time sitting around, but Habash said she likes to bring a book or listen to a podcast to fill the time. For her, that’s more desirable than stressing about missing a flight ― which would also stop her from being present on her trip. On the note of staying present and mindful, another tip is to reduce expectations and be flexible. “This does not mean I don’t make plans,” said Amelia Kelley, a trauma-informed therapist, author and podcaster. “But once I do, I try not to predict how they will go and rather be open to whatever happens ― especially because sometimes the unexpected ends up being the best parts.” This makes you less likely to experience anger or resentment when plans get disrupted, she explained. An actionable step is to create and repeat a mantra. Kelley and her friend went with “everything is a story” on their last trip. Besides time, another common stressor on trips is money. What can you do? “I like to make sure that even before I go on the trip, all known expenses, travel excursions and accommodations are already paid for, so I have no choice but to enjoy the time away,” said Jamie Downie, an associate therapist at the Gateway to Solutions practice. “I also make sure that I have extra money set aside ahead of time for meals and leisure expenses, too, so that the time away does not cut into regular monthly expenses.” Something to keep in mind while planning, he added, is to pick a trip or destination that fits your budget and to start saving as early as needed. Strategize how you can use rewards points or discounts if you need them. Then, when you’re away, your ”main focus can remain recharging, having fun and making new memories and positive experiences,” Downie said. That first day back after travel can be a doozy. There’s laundry to do, weekly episode releases that need watching, groceries to buy, sleep to catch up on and emails awaiting responses. It’s OK to give yourself time to get those things done. “Having an open day on the day after I return from a trip gives me space that I probably haven’t gotten during my travels, and allows me to do whatever I need to do to get back into my body and into a good headspace after traveling,” said Laura Walton, a therapist and the founder of the platform Lovelew. That day doesn’t always look the same, she continued; sometimes Walton needs a massage and yoga, sometimes she needs dog time and other times she’s unpacking and checking email. But regardless, she knows that free day is necessary. One of the beautiful things about vacation is that it can be a break from the mundane or stressful routine of daily life. At the same time, maintaining some aspects of your routine can help you feel more grounded in a different space. “This approach is helpful because sticking to your daily routines while traveling provides a sense of stability and comfort amidst the unpredictability of a new environment,” said Racheal Turner, a counselor who specializes in trauma, grief and life transitions. For her, this means continuing to journal every morning, taking her usual supplements and vitamins, and giving herself time to rest throughout the day. “By keeping up with these small yet meaningful habits, I find it much easier to manage stress and stay centered during trips,” she added. “These familiar routines also serve as a mental anchor. … You remain centered and in control.” Being in a different town — let alone another country — can throw anyone for a loop. You have to learn your way around and maybe even deal with a language barrier. Getting info ahead of time can reduce stress when you’re there. “I familiarize myself with the area, the culture, the customs, transportation options and even the language so that I am as prepared as I can be,” said Janet Bayramyan, a trauma therapist. Besides helping you feel safe and comfortable, she continued, doing this can make the trip more meaningful. “When you know a little bit about your destination’s culture, you’re more likely to experience it in a meaningful way,” she said. An overwhelming situation can make you lose confidence in yourself or feel like you have no way out. But that may be misguided. “The best way to deal with it is to remember that ‘I have handled stress in the past and have always come out of that experience feeling strong, confident and efficacious,’” said Jennifer Kelman, a mental health and relationship expert with the company JustAnswer. She also voted for the mantra approach, sharing the example “I have done this before, I have felt these feelings, but I have come out of it all right and I will again this time.” “This gives me the sense of mastery over the new travel stress,” she explained. “It prevents a downward spiral into the anxiety.” Yes, your support system can include flight attendants (or other travel attendants)! Their job is to support you, and they know how to do so more than you may realize. “Flight attendants are extremely knowledgeable about flight-related anxiety and about the things that tend to be triggers for flight anxiety,” said Alexandra Stratyner, a licensed psychologist with the practice Stratyner + Associates in New York. “Many flight attendants even receive training in responding to mental health concerns (also known as mental health first aid), including helping passengers with flight anxiety.” Stratyner described the various ways they can be of help: checking on you when turbulence is anticipated, giving you information that may ease your worries, suggesting relaxation exercises and making sure you have water if sipping calms you. “I even know people who have received personal notes from flight attendants at the end of their flights, acknowledging and commending them for flying despite their anxiety,” Stratyner added. Make your flight as luxurious and cozy as possible by bringing items with you that will make you feel comfortable. When you arrive at your destination, make sure to take a few steps to ensure you’ll feel healthier and happier, too. “I tend to do everything I can to minimize the impact,” suggested Karin Voelker, a clinical psychologist who specializes in behavioral sleep medicine. She wears layers of comfortable clothing; brings a mask, earplugs and a neck pillow; takes supplemental melatonin on the flight; stays awake through the evening once she arrives at her destination; and aims to get lots of sunlight and physical activity. “This tip is helpful because it addresses your wellness when traveling,” Voelker said. Matthew Solit, a therapist with the company LifeStance Health, is all about getting proactive, too. He prepares go-to snacks and a book or audiobook. “It’s all about controlling what I can and being prepared to accept or respond to that which I cannot control,” he said. Even when you do all the “right” things to avoid stress, challenges can still arise: An Uber or Lyft driver may cancel your ride, you might spill wine on your favorite dress, or something else could happen. How do you deal? “As a therapist, one of the most effective ways I personally deal with travel stressors is by practicing mindfulness and grounding techniques,” said Monica Cwynar, a therapist with the practice Thriveworks Counseling & Psychiatry Pittsburgh. She shared lots of ways to do this, explaining that these can keep you present and reduce anxious feelings: “This shift in focus can help create a sense of calm and control,” Cwynar said. Though travel stress is very real — and it’s important to validate that — it can be managed so you can have your happiest vacation yet.

Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) where he mouthed the word “bitch” as he railed against the former House speaker. “She’s a crooked person, she’s a bad person, evil, she’s an evil, sick, crazy b-,” Trump said, catching himself. He then mouthed the word twice without actually saying it. “It starts with a ‘B,’ but I won’t say it,” Trump said. “I wanna say it!” The audience cheered him on. Trump has repeatedly demonized Pelosi, recently naming her as part of what he calls the “enemy from within” that he has suggested could be dealt with by the military. In 2022, a right-wing conspiracy theorist broke into the Pelosi home and attacked her husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer. Paul Pelosi was hospitalized for nearly a week, but Trump and his allies have repeatedly mocked the Pelosis over the incident. Critics slammed Trump over his newest attack on Pelosi: I guess the first attack they incited on the Pelosi family wasn’t enough. Every day this man says something disqualifying. Shame on the GOP. I have no idea why this guy is struggling with women voters. https://t.co/8KvKA1DgoE Not the way you appeal to women, and so very gross.

Vance then undid all that posturing, though, as — in a reference to President Joe Biden’s since-clarified statement that Trump supporters are “garbage” — he listed why Trump fans aren’t. “Our message to Kamala Harris is very simple,” Vance said. “The citizens of this country are not garbage for thinking you’re doing a bad job.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/koreas-tensions_n_6729da85e4b0be8c956a61d9","North Korea Fires Barrage Of Ballistic Missiles Toward Sea Ahead Of U.S. Election","kim tong-hyung, hyung-jin kim , mari yamaguchi","2024-11-05","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired a barrage of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea on Tuesday, its neighbors said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations hours before the U.S. presidential election. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said at least seven North Korean missiles flew as far as 400 kilometers (250 miles) with a maximum altitude of 100 kilometers (60 miles). He said they landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. “North Korea’s actions, including a series of repeated missile launches, threaten the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community,” Nakatani said. South Korea’s military also detected several missile launches by North Korea and subsequently boosted its surveillance posture. The North Korean missiles could be used to target key facilities in South Korea, including U.S. military bases there. The launches came days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised a flight test of the country’s newest intercontinental ballistic missile d esigned to reach the U.S. mainland. In response to that launch, the United States flew a long-range B-1B bomber in a trilateral drill with South Korea and Japan on Sunday in a show of force. That drew condemnation from Kim’s powerful sister Kim Yo Jong, who on Tuesday accused North Korea’s rivals of raising tensions with “aggressive and adventuristic military threats.” South Korean officials have said that North Korea was likely to dial up its military displays around the U.S. presidential election to command the attention of Washington. South Korea’s military intelligence agency said last week that North Korea has also likely completed preparations for its seventh nuclear test. Outside officials and analysts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win concessions such as sanctions relief after a new U.S. president is elected. There are widespread views that Kim Jong Un would prefer a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, with whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, seeing him as a more likely counterpart to give him what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigning, Harris said she won’t “cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.” North Korea claimed that the Hwasong-19 it tested on Oct. 31 was “the world’s strongest” ICBM, but experts say the solid-fuel missile is too big to be useful in war. Experts say North Korea has yet to acquire some critical technologies to build a functioning ICBM, such as ensuring that the warhead survives the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry. Tensions between the Koreas are at their highest point in years as Kim has repeatedly flaunted his expanding nuclear weapon and missile programs, while reportedly providing Russia with munitions and troops to support President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that as many as 10,000 North Korean soldiers were in Russia’s Kursk region near Ukraine’s border and were preparing to join Moscow’s fight against Ukraine in the coming days. If they engage in combat, it would be North Korea’s first participation in a large-scale conflict since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. After a meeting in Seoul on Monday, senior South Korean and European Union officials expressed concerns about Russia’s possible transfer of technology to North Korea to enhance its nuclear program in exchange for its troops. Such transfers would “jeopardize the international non-proliferation efforts and threaten peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and across the globe,” they said. In response to North Korea’s growing nuclear threat, South Korea, the United States and Japan have been expanding their combined military exercises. North Korea has portrayed such U.S.-led military drills as rehearsals for an invasion and used them to justify its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles. At a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, North Korea’s ambassador, Kim Song, defended the North’s nuclear and ICBM programs as a necessary response to what it perceives as nuclear threats from the United States. U.S. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood warned that the U.S. cannot stand back from North Korea’s expanding nuclear program and the growing threat to U.S. security “without a response.” Wood also repeated last week’s call for Russia to say whether there are North Korean troops on the ground in Russia. “We’re not in a court here,” Russian Deputy Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva replied, “and the questions of the United States, in the spirit of an interrogation, is not something I intend to answer.” ___ Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/united-states-israel-gaza-aid-mideast_n_6729d8b0e4b0be8c956a60da","U.S. Gives Israel A 'Fail' Grade On Improving Aid To Gaza So Far","matthew lee","2024-11-05","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is stepping up criticism of Israel for not doing enough to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza as a 30-day deadline looms for Israeli officials to meet certain requirements or risk potential restrictions on military assistance. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller on Monday gave Israel a “fail” grade in terms of meeting the conditions for an improvement in aid deliveries to Gaza laid out in a letter last month to senior Israeli officials from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. He said there were still roughly nine days until the deadline expires, but that limited progress so far has been insufficient. “As of today, the situation has not significantly turned around,” Miller told reporters. “We have seen an increase in some measurements. But if you look at the stipulated recommendations in the letter — those have not been met.” A day before the U.S. election, the Biden administration called out its close ally, with support for Israel a key issue for many voters and the humanitarian crisis for Palestinians also a factor for many in the race. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been competing for Muslim and Arab American voters and Jewish voters in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. Among other conditions, Austin and Blinken’s letter from mid-October said that Israel must allow in a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying desperately needed food and other supplies for Palestinians besieged by more than a year of war between Israel and Hamas. By the end of October, an average of just 71 trucks a day were entering Gaza, according to the latest U.N. figures. “The results are not good enough today,” Miller said. “They certainly do not have a pass. … They have failed to implement all the things that that we recommended. Now, that said, we are not at the end of the 30-day period.” He would not say when asked what the U.S. would do when the deadline comes up next week, just that “we will follow the law.” Blinken spoke Monday with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, urging additional steps to “substantially increase and sustain humanitarian aid” to civilians in Gaza, according to a State Department readout of their call. Similarly, Austin has been reinforcing “how important it is to ensure that humanitarian assistance can flow and flow faster into Gaza” in calls with Gallant, said Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary. The Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid to Gaza, known as COGAT, said it had evacuated 72 patients from hospitals in northern Gaza to other medical facilities Monday and had brought medical supplies as well as fuel, food, water and units of blood. The head of UNICEF, the U.N. agency for children, said over the weekend that “the entire Palestinian population in North Gaza, especially children, is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine, and the ongoing bombardments.” Miller also said the U.S. is looking into a decision by the Israeli government to end an agreement facilitating the work of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, which is the main aid provider in Gaza. It followed the passage of Israeli laws last week to sever ties with UNRWA, a move that Blinken and Austin opposed in their letter. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement Monday that it has notified the U.N. of the cancellation of an agreement dating back to 1967 that facilitates UNRWA’s work. It said UNRWA “is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution.” Israel alleges that UNRWA has been infiltrated by Hamas, which the agency denies and says it takes measures to ensure its neutrality. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated that UNRWA is essential and there is no alternative to its work in the Palestinian territories, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. At the same time, Miller said the U.S. is “deeply concerned” by a recent escalation in attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank, including several cars being torched overnight just a few kilometers (miles) away from the Palestinian Authority’s headquarters and attacks on Palestinians harvesting olives, their livestock and other property. “These violent actions cause intense human suffering for Palestinians and they threaten Israel’s security,” Miller said. “It is critical that the government of Israel deter extremist settler violence and take measures to protect all communities from harm in accordance with its international obligations.” He noted that the U.S. has since the beginning of the year imposed sanctions against Israeli groups and people implicated in violence against Palestinian civilians and warned of more to come. ___ AP reporters Ellen Knickmeyer and Lolita C.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/check-if-vote-counted-ano_n_67252798e4b01f6919da0625","How To Check If Your Vote Was Counted","monica torres","2024-11-05","Once you vote in a midterm or presidential election, how do you check to make sure your ballot has been counted? This answer varies depending on where you live and how you voted. There is no standardized national system for tracking whether a ballot was counted. The ballot tracking landscape is a “mess, because it’s 50 different systems, and within each of those 50 systems, there [are] county registrars, so everybody has slightly different methods,” said Jessica Levinson, a professor and expert on election laws at Loyola Law School. When you vote in person, you can see your vote be submitted, and it’s “a fair bet” that your ballot will count, Levinson said. As such, no state offers ballot tracking for in-person voting. But when you mail in your vote, you don’t see it being processed and there’s more opportunity for mistakes to be made, so most states offer some form of confirmation for those ballots. “People are worried about vote-by-mail because they’re not the ones physically putting it in somebody’s hands or putting it in the box, and I think that’s why the tracking is so much more robust,” Levinson said. By and large, most mail-in votes do end up counting. Over 98% were counted and only 0.8% were rejected in the 2020 general election, according to a survey by the federal Election Assistance Commission. Among the most common reasons ballots were rejected were that the signature on the ballot did not match the signature on file; the ballot was missing an important document, such as an affidavit; the voter was not actually eligible to vote in their jurisdiction; the ballot was not received in time; or the ballot lacked a voter’s signature. Sometimes people can only vote a provisional ballot at their polling site, and these ballots often need follow-up from either the voter or election officials. If this happens to you, you can ask your local election official to explain how you can check to see if your provisional vote was counted or rejected (some states’ processes are listed below). A written explanation is your legal right under the Help America Vote Act. If you want to double-check the status of your vote, here are your options: You can check the status of your absentee ballot online. If you have further questions, contact your local election office. Track your absentee ballot status at myvoterinformation.alaska.gov. The Grand Canyon State offers both absentee and provisional ballot tracking at my.arizona.vote, and some counties go a step further. In Maricopa County, for example, you can sign up for text updates on your mail-in ballot. View ballot status by entering your name and date of birth at the Arkansas elections website. You can look up your mail-in ballot status and also sign up to get text or email notifications as information is updated. Colorado offers status updates and alerts for mail-in ballots. See if and when your absentee ballot was received. The state offers look-up service for both absentee and provisional ballots. In D.C., you can check your absentee ballot status online. If you are asked to cast a special ballot, check its status here. The Sunshine State offers tracking for mail-in ballots. For help with provisional ballots, contact your local elections office. Both absentee and provisional ballots can be tracked at the state’s “My Voter Page.” Residents can head to ballotstatus.hawaii.gov to see if their mail-in vote was received. Enter your info in Idaho’s voter record tool to check your mail-in ballot status. Although some counties use mail-in ballot tracking software (Cook County has portals for both suburban residents and those in the city of Chicago), Illinois offers statewide tracking only for provisional ballots. Check your local election authority for absentee ballot tracking information. Check if your ballot was received and counted with Indiana’s “My Voter Portal.” Absentee ballot tracking is available for the entire state. Contact your county auditor for questions about provisional ballots. Kansas offers tracking for mail-in ballots. Nervous about your absentee ballot? Check its status with a statewide tool.

Find out if your mail-in vote was rejected or accepted here. You can check if a provisional ballot was counted by calling 1-800-462-VOTE after Election Day. You can track the status of your absentee ballot. For provisional ballots, Michigan recommends contacting your city or township clerk’s office. You can see if your mail-in ballot was received and counted. Minnesota, one of the few states with same-day voter registration, is not required to offer provisional ballots. Mississippi does use ballot tracking software to track absentee and affidavit ballots. If you have doubts about your vote counting, contact your county election official. Although some jurisdictions offer tracking for mail-in ballots, including the city of St. Louis and Calhoun County, Missouri does not have statewide ballot tracking. Track your mail-in ballot status at app.mt.gov/voterinfo. Nebraska offers mail-in ballot status in its voter information tool. The state’s Ballottrax site provides tracking information and the opportunity to sign up for text or email alerts when your mail-in ballot is received and counted. You can call (877) 766-8683 to find out your provisional ballot status, according to Nevada’s explainer. You can find out if your ballot was received by your clerk’s office with this state tracker. Garden Staters can check their ballots at the state’s website. Absentee ballot tracking is available. Check on your absentee ballot with the state’s voter lookup website. There’s one system for checking absentee ballot status and another for viewing provisional ballot status. Mail-in ballots can be tracked at a statewide portal. Ohio offers statewide tracking for mail-in ballots. Just choose your county on the map. Check the status of absentee ballots in the state’s voter portal. Oregon mails a ballot to every registered voter. They can be tracked at the state’s “My Vote” site.

At the time, I couldn’t understand my couple friends who slept separately. I wondered to myself if it was a sign of a bigger problem in their relationship. I’m older now, and hopefully wiser. I’ve had more than seven years’ practice sleeping alone since Remi died. Now I find myself in a relationship again. And it’s going well — really well. But we don’t have many sleepovers. My partner and I have the luxury of living right around the corner from one another. I know there’s nothing wrong with having our separate lives, but it feels in stark contrast to my relationship with Remi. Is it possible that sleeping in separate bedrooms, or even separate houses, is sustainable and even healthy for some couples? Or should we want to sleep in the same bed every night? Depending on which study you consult, the number of couples sleeping separately ranges from one in three (a recent survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine), to one in four (a 2012 survey by the Better Sleep Council and a 2017 survey from the National Sleep Foundation), to one in five (a 2023 survey of 2,200 Americans conducted by the International Housewares Association for The New York Times). Therapist Megan Lara Negendank, the executive director of Love Heal Grow, told HuffPost that she was “starting to notice that a lot of couples that were coming in were reporting that they slept in different beds, and at first, I think I had my own biases, because I was like, ‘Oh, I bet this is why they’re having problems…’ but then I got really curious about it.” Negendank said that she has since realized that “a lot of happy couples [are] sleeping apart…people are just getting better sleep in different rooms, and that’s OK.” Psychologist Morag Yule, the director of Ontario Sex Therapy, said that sleeping separately is not a sign of a bigger relationship problem. “As a sex therapist, I spend a lot of time talking to people about the ‘shoulds’ of our relationships…a lot of the work I do is trying to identify what is actually right for each person as an individual, translating that to a couple, and trying to get away from the social expectations and norms around it,” she said. Remi and I had no barriers to sharing a bed, but I’m learning that this was something of a unicorn situation. There are many reasons a couple might choose to sleep apart: snoring, restlessness, insomnia, frequent trips to the bathroom, incompatible sleep schedules, shift work, conflicting circadian rhythms and wind-down routines all come to mind. Emma C., a 38-year-old in Toronto, Canada, has been with her partner for 4 1/2 years. For the past year, they’ve been sleeping apart. Her partner snores, and they have different circadian rhythms — he’s a night owl and she’s an early bird. Emma said that spending the night together was bad for her sleep and was affecting other areas of her life. “It was only ever supposed to be temporary, but we’ve kind of made peace with the fact that this is how it is for now,” Emma, who asked to withhold her last name for privacy reasons, told HuffPost. While the logistics of sleeping separately are “a pain in the butt…knowing that we’re both getting what we need…lets us focus our energy on more important things in our relationship,” Emma said. “There are many reasons a couple might choose to sleep apart: snoring, restlessness, insomnia, frequent trips to the bathroom, incompatible sleep schedules, shift work, conflicting circadian rhythms and wind-down routines all come to mind.” The first time I spent the night with my current partner, I didn’t sleep at all. He snored off and on, and I felt restless. We’ve since had a few more sleepovers, always at his place because he has a dog to look after, and we’re getting better at sharing a bed. But I still sleep better alone and in my own bed. Research backs up my experience. A 2024 study of mice published in ScienceDirect found that co-sleeping can negatively impact sleep. But researchers also found that, although overall sleep quality was worse when the mice slept together, they still chose closeness over uninterrupted sleep. This desire for prolonged physical contact — or “somatolonging,” a term coined in the study — appears to be the motivation behind sacrificing good sleep for a sense of safety and physical connection with a partner. Jennifer V., a 38-year-old in Zurich, Switzerland, has lived with her partner for four years, and the two sleep in separate bedrooms. They often have different work schedules, so their sleeping arrangement is convenient. Jennifer, who requested her last name be withheld, admitted that while she loves the closeness of sharing a bed occasionally, she sleeps better on her own. For her partner, it was a condition of moving in together that they each have their own bedroom. At first, Jennifer felt hurt by this, she said. It took her a long time to not see his desire for space as a rejection. Jennifer said that when she and her partner do spend the night in the same bed, “it’s much more special…It’s like a sleepover. It’s exciting.” Emily G., a 40-year-old in Montreal, Canada, who also requested her last name be withheld, has been with her fiancé for 15 years. In their first apartment as a couple, they had a primary and a guest bedroom. While they usually started off sleeping in the same bed, her partner would often move to the guest bed in the middle of the night. “I remember being really hurt by that…I didn’t realize the benefits of being able to sleep separately initially,” Emily said. The pair recently bought their first home, which only has one bedroom. Emily said that they still occasionally start the night apart, with one of them hanging on the couch if they want to stay up later, but they always end up in the shared bed. While Emily said that she enjoys falling asleep in her fiancé’s arms, she recognizes that sleeping apart is sometimes the best way to get good quality sleep.

A 2020 study published in Frontiers in Psychiatry, found a positive correlation between sleep quality and couples who sleep in the same bed. Co-sleeping was associated with 10% more REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, compared to when couples sleep separately. And a 2022 study published in SLEEP journal concluded that sleeping with a partner is correlated with lower depression, anxiety, reduced stress, overall greater social support, and life and relationship satisfaction. It’s still early days for my partner and me, but I’m starting to think about what I might want in my next long-term relationship, whether that means sleeping in the same bed, living together or getting married.

An estimated 69% of Americans say the 2024 race is a significant source of stress in their lives, according to recent data from the American Psychological Association. “The implications of the election are huge, no matter your value set, and no matter for whom you plan to vote,” Dr. Nzinga A. Harrison, co-founder and chief medical officer of Eleanor Health, told HuffPost. Given the potential impact of the election’s result, it’s unsurprising that emotions are heightened — including feelings of anxiousness and worry. But election-related anxiety doesn’t always manifest in ways you might expect. HuffPost spoke with professionals about the sneaky signs it may be impacting you, and how to keep it in check. In recent months, maybe you’ve found yourself constantly refreshing your X (formerly Twitter) feed, endlessly swiping through TikTok or losing hours perusing Google News. Some experts say this is a good indication that you’re experiencing some anxiety. “News stories trigger our instinctive need to know, even when the information has no practical value,” said Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center, adding that seeking out new information is a “way to try to control the environment and make it less scary.” Harrison noted that when it comes to reading or watching the news, “moderation is key.” Limiting the amount of time you spend consuming the news (and limiting the number of sources you read) can curb worry surrounding the election. Setting your phone to “do not disturb” mode during designated hours can also help you break the cycle. “Unfortunately, the way algorithms work on some popular social media platforms, the negative content gets filtered to the top,” said Dr. Nina Vasan, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine. This can easily lead to “doomscrolling,” a term coined to describe the tendency to seek out disheartening or traumatizing media. If you find yourself doing this, it’s probably a sign that your anxiety is heightened. But, as Rutledge explained, “Allowing our emotions to be continually triggered is exhausting, and leads to lack of self-control.” So, how can you feel a little more empowered and less burnt out? Vasan explained that choosing a few ways to participate in politics can help you to feel a little more in control of your environment. This can look like registering people to vote, sending a letter to one of your representatives or volunteering with local organizations. “It’s helpful to feel engaged in the world, and [feel] that you’re fulfilling your civic responsibility,” Vasan said. It’s no secret that anxiety is linked to sleep issues, especially if you tend to dwell on your fears about the election late at night. “We carry our stressors into our dreams. We carry our muscle tension into our sleep — or lack thereof,” Harrison said. “Difficulty sleeping, whether that is trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep or early morning awakening, is often the first sign that you are anxious.” In addition to avoiding doomscrolling well into the evening, experts have found that practicing good sleep hygiene can lead to a better night’s rest. Sleep hygiene goes beyond going to bed at a certain time every night; it can include healthy habits like reducing your caffeine intake, creating a relaxing environment, improving your nighttime routine and exercising. Vasan explained that speaking about the election in an “unconstructive or ruminative manner” is a sure sign that stress is getting the best of you. (Rumination is a thought pattern that occurs when you think about a problem over and over, which can reinforce feelings of anxiety or depression.) For example, you may find yourself rehashing the presidential debates, or frequently discussing an upsetting interview with no real end goal for the conversation. Rutledge recommended trying to shift the topic of conversation with family or friends, even if it’s just for a few minutes, to reduce your stress. Another coping skill she suggested is pulled directly from cognitive behavioral therapy: Take a small note card, and write affirmations with phrases such as “I have all the information I need,” or “I won’t waste my emotions and energy on things I can’t control.” This will cultivate new self-talk, and disrupt the tendency to ruminate. If you notice that you’re feeling more tense in your daily activities, election-related stress might be to blame. “Even when our brains don’t recognize the trigger, we will develop negative emotions that come from anxiety as our brains try to get us to recognize that something is worrying us,” Harrison said, adding that it’s important to “intentionally schedule activities that bring you joy” to counteract feelings of anxiousness that may also be stirring up irritability or hopelessness. If you feel as though your anxiety symptoms are impeding your ability to function, consider seeking out a therapist to support you through the next few months.

This is pretty common — especially among those who are all about efficiency and love an easy cleanup. But recently, rumors have been spreading, particularly on TikTok, saying that cooking with aluminum foil poses health risks and can lead to aluminum poisoning. But is this actually true? Is cooking with aluminum foil bad for you? Aluminum foil is ehhhh not the best heres why  #santacruzmedicinals #healthyrecipes #nontoxicliving #breakingnews #healthscience Determined to get to the bottom of this, we reached out to food safety experts for their take on whether cooking with aluminum foil is risky or if this topic has been drawing unnecessary attention. Here’s what we learned. For the most part, cooking with aluminum foil isn’t something you need to worry about. “Aluminum foil is generally safe for cooking at regular oven temperatures,” said Darin Detwiler, chair of the National Environmental Health Association’s Food Safety Program, professor of food policy and corporate social responsibility at Northeastern University, and author of the book “Food Safety: Past, Present, and Predictions.” That said, as with many aspects of nutrition, there’s a bit of nuance to consider here. For example, research shows that cooking acidic or salty foods at high temperatures could lead to more aluminum leaching into the food you’re cooking. “High temperatures, especially with acidic foods like tomatoes, citrus or vinegar, may cause aluminum to leach into food,” Detwiler said. “Although this is typically in small amounts, excessive intake of aluminum over time has been linked to potential health concerns, including neurodegenerative diseases.” Now, what’s the highest temperature aluminum foil can be used at while cooking? “The U.S. Food and Drug Administration notes that aluminum foil can be safely used at temperatures up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit,” said Tamika Sims, the senior director of food technology communications at the International Food Information Council. She also noted that the FDA regulates all sorts of food packaging materials for safety, including aluminum, glass and paper. Jessica Gavin, a certified food scientist and culinary scientist, explained that while there is an increased risk of leaching aluminum when cooking acidic foods at high heat, the risk is still low in most situations. “To minimize any transfer, avoid cooking or storing acidic or salty foods in foil for long periods, as this can cause a metallic taste and pitting on the foil,” Gavin said. When considering whether it’s risky to cook with aluminum foil, it’s important to understand that we all consume a bit of aluminum every day. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the average person in the United States ingests between 7 and 9 milligrams of aluminum each day through their food. That said, most of this aluminum leaves your body quickly through feces and urine. “The risk from cooking with aluminum foil is low, with only about 4% of our aluminum intake coming from items like utensils, grilling trays or foil,” Gavin said. The other aluminum you ingest can come from food, products like cosmetics, medications and antiperspirants, breathing in suspended particles in the air, or from drinking water. Healthy individuals can easily expel small amounts of aluminum, but people with kidney disease may store more, which could lead to health issues. Given that aluminum is a metal, concerns about aluminum foil leaching into food are valid under certain conditions. “While occasional use poses minimal risk, regular ingestion of higher amounts may be linked to health concerns, particularly for individuals with kidney issues who may have trouble excreting excess aluminum,” Detwiler said. Sims said that aluminum foil is generally safe to use in most ovens, where most foods cook below 450 degrees Fahrenheit, which is below aluminum’s melting point. “However, when cooking for an extended amount of time over very high temperatures above 400 degrees Fahrenheit, migration [of aluminum into food] can potentially increase, and this is not advised by FDA or foil manufacturers,” she added. If you’re concerned about aluminum leaching into your food when cooking with aluminum foil, you can reduce exposure by not using it when cooking acidic or salty foods. Some other simple swaps can also be helpful. “If you need to bake over a temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit, skip the foil and use a baking pan or tray that is labeled as capable of being exposed to this heat and for an extended period,” Sims said. Glass baking dishes are another option, since glass is generally nonreactive and won’t leak chemicals or other substances into the food you’re cooking.

If you search “Guys in Gray Sweatpants” or “When He Wears Gray Sweatpants,” you’ll see over 132 million posts on TikTok. Over the past couple of months, creators have been getting hot and bothered waiting for gray sweatpants season to arrive. Take these tweets, for example: OMG, HOW DID I MISS THIS?Taylor, you are getting blessed 👀👀👀🍆🫣🤭🥵#traviskelce #graysweatpants pic.twitter.com/kbNysjuNrE i love grey sweatpants #graysweatpants Grey sweatpants and a backwards hat 🥵 lookin HOT!

Other shades and fits still “count,” but they don’t hit quite the same. (You’ll find theories on why that is below.) But why does something as simple and casual get so many of us going? Let’s dive into the psychology behind it. “Gray sweatpants are the ‘no makeup’ choice of male attire,” explained Renee Zavislak, a licensed psychotherapist who hosts “Psycho Therapist: The Podcast.” “A man in gray sweatpants isn’t trying too hard. Gray sweatpants say, ‘I put no effort into this outfit.’” Gray sweatpants give the energy of the morning after, spent cuddling and making scrambled eggs together. “This combination of this decidedly casual, no-effort look with unmistakable sexual imagery has a potent psychological effect on the admirer: The man in gray sweatpants is at once virile and insouciant,” Zavislak said. “This dialectical draw has elevated gray sweatpants to mythical status in men’s attire.” The vibe may make you feel like you can just be yourself, too. And is there anything hotter than feeling like you don’t have to try too hard? Amandine, a fashion model and clinical psychologist, has seen firsthand how clothing affects people’s perceptions. She said gray sweatpants are a perfect example. First, she explained the physical perception. “Light gray is neutral and understated, allowing people to notice the body, not just the clothing,” Amandine said. “It subtly highlights natural contours with light and shadow, making the body’s details pop without being too revealing.” While patterned clothing or clothing with cutouts can be attractive, too, it can distract from the body. Neutral colors also give off a vibe that many people find attractive. While wearing bright colors can boost your mood — aka dopamine dressing — neutral colors have their own strengths. Amandine said men in gray sweatpants are more likely to seem calm, approachable, relaxed, comfortable and grounded. Many experts agree with this color psychology. Mental Health America said gray can be associated with comfort, maturity, calmness and sophistication. The Career Exploration Center at Cornell University said gray gives off trustworthy, confident and capable vibes. There’s also a reason light gray, in particular, gets a few extra points. “It contrasts well with skin tones and enhances visibility, making it easier for observers to appreciate the contours of the body,” said Peter Martinez, co-founder and fashion stylist/designer at Leather Skin Shop, a U.S. fashion brand. As mentioned earlier, wearing gray can have a calming effect on others, too. “In a way, gray sweatpants create a visual cue that says, ‘I’m relaxed, and you can be too,’” Amandine said. “In a world where people often feel pressure to maintain a polished image, the casual comfort of sweatpants can signal authenticity,” Martinez added. Amandine said gray sweatpants look great both fitted and loose, but there’s a reason why a tight-but-not-too-tight pair arguably takes the gold medal. “They really show off the body’s shape and create a casual yet flattering look,” Amandine said, adding that well-fitted clothes are a hit in Hollywood and the fashion world. “When something is tailored to you, it highlights your best features.” Martinez agreed. “I believe the primary reason for their popularity is that they subtly showcase a man’s physique,” he said. “The fabric of the sweatpants is often form-fitting, providing a comfortable and flattering silhouette.” The looser fit has more effortless charm, too, Amandine explained, like the “no-makeup” look Zavislak mentioned. “There’s something approachable and disarming about that kind of laid-back style, compared to a suit, for example, which feels much more formal.” While light gray, fitted sweatpants have their fans, they’re likely not the only reason you can’t stop looking at the person wearing them.

Kimmel said he was baffled that bombshell newly released audio recordings of late convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein bragging that he was Trump’s “closest friend” for a decade have gotten so little attention. “Remember when Mitt Romney went down because he put a dog carrier on the roof of his car?” Kimmel asked. “We just got 100 hours of Jeffrey Epstein saying he and Trump were BFFs. I didn’t even get an alert about it on my phone.” Kimmel recapped some of the former president’s bizarre rants, ramblings and digressions during his final rallies, from lies about crowd size to attacks on the media to a bizarre moment with a microphone. Then, the late night host delivered an Election Day “closing argument” of his own. “Forget about what side you’re on.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-trump-final-rallies_n_6729a725e4b0be8c956a4a57","Kamala Harris, Riding Last-Minute Momentum, Rallies Pennsylvania Supporters One Last Time","daniel marans","2024-11-05","PHILADELPHIA — The vibes on the eve of the 2024 election are offering mixed messages about what to expect Tuesday: The polls are deadlocked, and both sides are projecting confidence. In Pittsburgh, former President Donald Trump predicted he has a “96.2%” chance of winning a second term. On Monday night, Joe Rogan, one of the country’s most popular podcasters, endorsed Trump on the heels of Trump’s three-hour interview with Rogan last month. Rogan said Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a top Trump surrogate, helped him come to the decision. Democrats don’t seem to be sweating the outcome. Harris campaign adviser David Plouffe claimed Vice President Kamala Harris has a path to carry all seven battleground states and is “positioned to win” late-breaking undecided voters. Trump hosted four rallies across battleground states, nearly crossing paths with Harris in southeast Pennsylvania, where Harris rallied supporters in Allentown just after Trump spoke in Reading. That part of the state is home to a large Latino population, including many Puerto Ricans, who were the target of a racist joke from a comedian at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally in New York City last weekend. Trump’s appearances provided more fodder for his critics to say his campaign lacks direction and momentum. Trump spoke at a venue that was only about 70% full in Raleigh, North Carolina, with thousands of empty seats and no line to get inside, according to NBC News. These smaller crowds are becoming more common at Trump events, NBC reported. Trump went off on bizarre and nasty tangents throughout the day, such as wondering aloud whether he should “hit back” at former first lady Michelle Obama. He seemed annoyed at his top campaign adviser, Susie Wiles. The day before in North Carolina, Trump seemed to forget where he was as he name-checked the GOP nominee for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick. “If you vote for Kamala, you will have four more years of misery, failure and disaster, and our country may never recover,” Trump said in Pittsburgh. “Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win!” In his rally earlier on Monday in Reading, Trump also returned to his familiar tactic of playing up crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, even though the data shows that undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than the native-born population. He promised not to let “savages” and “animals” ― his terms for immigrants who commit violent crimes ― come in to “take out” the United States’ “incredible people.” The Democratic nominee capped off election eve with back-to-back rallies in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia which carried an upbeat tone that could not have been more different than Trump’s gloomy characterization of the status quo. The Philly rally, teeming with tens of thousands of people and symbolically located in front of Philadelphia Museum of Art’s famous “Rocky” steps, interspersed speeches from top Pennsylvania Democrats with high-profile musical acts from the likes of The Roots, Ricky Martin and Lady Gaga, and contemporaneous video transmissions from pro-Harris rallies in the other battleground states. Oprah Winfrey introduced Harris following the performance of an original song by Will.i.am, “Yes She Can.” The rally was draped in patriotic colors and imagery. Lit up behind Harris on the “Rocky” steps themselves was a blue sign with white letters with the words, “A president for all,” as rows of supporters waved placards in red, white and blue behind her. Some placards advertised the Harris campaign; others simply said, “USA.” Harris began by acknowledging the symbolism of the location ― in the city where the Founding Fathers declared independence from England and at the foot of the steps where a plucky fictional boxer began his journey to an upset victory. Then she made a prediction. “Hard work is good work. Hard work is joyful work. And make no mistake, we will win!” Harris said. Harris’ speech, just shy of 20 minutes, focused less on policy details and more on the opportunity to move forward from the divisive rhetoric of Trump, whom she did not mention by name, toward a future that reflects the country’s promise. “We are done with that. We’re done! We’re exhausted with it,” Harris said of Trump’s routine. “America is ready for a fresh start.” “Tonight we finish as we started ― with optimism, with energy, with joy ― knowing that we the people have the power to shape our future,” she concluded. The Harris supporters who converged on the iconic 1976 film’s steps arrived bundled up for chilly weather as temperatures dipped into the low 50s. But numerous camouflage baseball caps naming Harris and running mate Tim Walz, blue Harris pins and smiles were visible among the hoodies, flannels and scarves. Summer Cirino, an aide to Pennsylvania state Rep. Melissa Schusterman (D) from the Chester County suburbs, expressed cautious optimism about the outcome after weeks of canvassing. “There’s definitely a silent majority that is going to carry Harris over the finish line that people aren’t talking about,” said Cirino, who was wearing a Harris campaign scarf with an American flag pattern and a matching American flag sweater. “Obviously, it’s a silent majority, but it’s been hard to convince people from the other side ― people are sticking to their guns this election.” Janiyah Bryan, a cashier from South Philadelphia wearing the Harris-Walz camo hat backwards, said she came to the rally because she wanted to be a “part of history.” “Voting for her, it means a lot to me as a Black woman, because representation is very important to me, and being here tonight is very, very important, because a lot of people are showing up for someone who is ready to take on the job,” Bryan said. Mariama Diallo, a registered nurse and immigrant from Guinea, said she appreciates Harris because she is the daughter of immigrants. “When I see her, I think about my children,” said Diallo, a southwest Philadelphia resident. Underneath the joyful atmosphere, though, there was an undercurrent of anxiety about the possibility of a Trump victory after Tuesday’s vote. Marcia Ruberg, a retired school psychologist from Philadelphia’s Northern Liberties neighborhood, was attending with her husband, Gary Goldberg, a retired software developer.

Ruberg, who was sporting a Planned Parenthood stocking hat, interjected: “And be with other people who share our ideals ― the alternative is just too horrible to bear!” Ruberg fears that Trump will use a second term to exact “retribution” on federal employees and journalists, undo Biden’s climate policies, make vaccines “no longer available” and, of course, erode American democracy.

The deal between the airplane manufacturer and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers gives employees a 38% raise over four years, an increased 401(k) contribution and a one-time payment of up to $12,000 for ratifying the contract, among other provisions. The agreement, approved with 59% of ballots, is much closer to the original 40% raise that the union had pushed for; the company had been offering 25% when workers walked off the job on Sept. 13. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said the company was “pleased” to settle a contract and get back to building planes. “There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company,” he said in a statement. The deal also includes a minimum 4% annual bonus that Boeing had proposed eliminating in earlier negotiations. However, it does not restore the defined-benefit pension that had been phased out in a previous contract — something many workers had demanded. Jon Holden and Brandon Bryant, local union leaders for the machinists, said in a joint statement that the deal creates “a new foundation to build on for the future.” “We are ready to help Boeing change direction and return to building the highest quality and safest airplanes in the world,” they said. “Our members are critical to that mission, and now have a stronger voice in the decision making process to ensure those needed improvements are made.” The union said the deal had been negotiated with a hand from acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, who also helped broker a temporary deal to end the dockworkers strike last month. Su said in a statement that the deal showed “what is possible when workers have a real voice on the job.” “This agreement proves yet again that collective bargaining works,” she said. The Boeing strike halted production of the 737 MAX, 777 and 767 planes in the Puget Sound region of Washington. It involved more than 30,000 workers, making it one of the largest work stoppages of the year. It was just the latest setback for a company that’s been plagued by manufacturing delays, a credit downgrade and a series of safety scandals that damaged its reputation. In January, a door panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight, forcing an emergency landing and prompting a fresh round of congressional scrutiny. The Federal Aviation Administration put a cap on Boeing’s plane production following the incident. Boeing logged a $6 billion loss in the quarter that ended in September, the company announced. It is in the midst of slashing its workforce. Ortberg had announced last month that the company would undertake a “fundamental culture change” to get itself back on track.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mark-robinson-lashes-out-republicans_n_67295679e4b0266a3458772b","Mark Robinson Seems To Lash Out At Republicans Who Ditched Him","jennifer bendery","2024-11-04","WASHINGTON ― Days before the election, North Carolina gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson appeared to lash out at the Republican Party for abandoning him amid his controversies, not the least of which are disturbing comments he reportedly made on a porn site. Robinson, the state’s lieutenant governor, ripped unnamed Republican politicians during a Friday rally with Michele Morrow, a far-right GOP nominee for state superintendent of schools. After hailing Americans who fought in the Revolutionary War and in world wars, Robinson contrasted them with today’s elected officials, who he said “tuck tail and run” when faced with challenges. “We have so-called elected officials, people that I call politicians, that are afraid to stand up and fight for what’s right,” Robinson said to a room of supporters. “As soon as they get a little trouble, they tuck tail and run,” he said, apparently alluding to Republicans cutting ties with him after CNN’s September report on his porn site comments. “They’ll send you a message on the phone and say, “Uh, uh, uh, I’m, I’m sorry, but, uh, uh, uh, I got, I got, I can’t, I can’t supp– uh, uh.’ It makes me sick to my stomach.” Robinson said when certain Republicans win their elections on Tuesday, they’ll realize they’re not prepared to defend the Constitution as much as defend their own “position of power.” “Then what are you going to do, Mr. Coward that wouldn’t stand up and fight? What are you going to do then?” he shouted. “You’re going to tuck tail and run. You’re going to turn on your fellow Republicans. You’re going to turn on your fellow so-called conservatives.” The GOP all but ditched Robinson in the wake of the CNN report, which uncovered years of disturbing comments he’d made in a forum on a porn site, Nude Africa. He referred to himself as a “Black Nazi.” He described being sexually aroused by spying on women and girls in public showers. He called himself a “perv” who likes pornography featuring transgender people ― a sharp contrast to the transphobic rhetoric he uses as a candidate. Even Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who enthusiastically endorsed Robinson in March and has shared stages with him at campaign events, is now pretending he doesn’t know who he is. Robinson has denied the CNN report and is suing the network for $50 million. But CNN’s report meticulously laid out how it connected Robinson to the trove of comments in the porn site forum, and Robinson hasn’t presented any new evidence that refutes the report. He even initially suggested that maybe all those comments were by him. Robinson was already trailing his Democratic opponent, Josh Stein, before the CNN report came out. The North Carolina Republican has made vile comments for years, fanning conspiracy theories and making countless sexist, transphobic and otherwise offensive claims. But his campaign has collapsed in the last month, with his staff resigning en masse and GOP groups cutting him off financially. You can watch the full clip of Robinson’s Friday remarks here. His attacks on nameless Republican politicians start around the three-minute mark. At another point during Friday’s rally, Robinson sort of gave credit to Democrats for being united behind Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, who he said was “the worst” candidate ever. “They don’t tuck tail and run. We don’t need to either, folks,” he said, adding, “We are not up against people who are going to back down and stop.” Ironically, he urged his supporters to be like Trump ― who has publicly cut ties with Robinson ― to go up against Democrats. “We have got to continue to do what our former president and soon-to-be next president always does, and stand up and fight!” he said to applause. Robinson and Stein, who is currently the state’s attorney general, are competing for an open seat in the governor’s race. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) is term-limited out. The most recent poll in their race was conducted this week and put Stein with a 17-percentage-point lead over Robinson, according to the polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Robert O’Neill is famous for killing Osama bin Laden in 2011 and for being a Fox News contributor between 2015 and 2021. On Saturday, however, he decided to pick a fight with some Gen Z voters. Harry Sisson, a content creator working to get other young voters to support the vice president, posted that he and his peers were trying to get more Harris supporters to the polls. “We’re Gen Z voters and we all PROUDLY voted for Kamala Harris! Real men support Harris!” Sisson wrote. We’re Gen Z voters and we all PROUDLY voted for Kamala Harris! Real men support Harris! pic.twitter.com/EUnKOuIko4 Although most reasonable people would see the post as basic get-out-the-vote boosterism common during the last weekend before a presidential election, it really seemed to set O’Neill off. He was so offended by the (checks notes) five college-age males happy they voted for Harris that he suggested the young men could be his sex slaves in a slightly different universe. “You’re not men. You’re boys. If there was no social media, you would be my concubines,” he wrote. You’re not men. You’re boys. If there was no social media, you would be my concubines. https://t.co/EUwCiB4o1b But since there *is* social media, many people found O’Neill’s post — insinuating that he would sexually subjugate five young men — to be extremely disturbing. Still, O’Neill decided to double down on his comments on Monday “for the communists who missed it.” I wanted to re-post this for the communists who missed it… https://t.co/zqHD6OCqv0 Oh, Puddin!! You’re so sweet… https://t.co/EUwCiB4o1b These liberal, pussy “males” will never defend you. I got you .. they don’t. Eventually, Sisson asked O’Neill to clarify if what he sounded like he was suggesting was really what he was suggesting. “So you want 5 young “boys” to be your sex slaves…? That’s pretty f*cking weird. Also, ratio bozo,” Sisson wrote. So you want 5 young “boys” to be your sex slaves…? That’s pretty f*cking weird. Also, ratio bozo You should probably just stop posting about us. Saying you want young “boys” is pretty weird Dean Withers, a Harris supporter who was in the photo, also pointed out to O’Neill that his posts sure sounded like both a sex fantasy and a political attack. Hey i’m the “boy” on the right.So just to confirm… you want 5 “boys” to be your sex slaves?oh and ratio btw looser insane crash outi’m not interested, old man. HuffPost reached out to O’Neill via X for comment on the tweets, but no one immediately responded. However, many people on social media were outraged by his posts. Congratulations on coming out of the closet. Weird way to announce it but it is 2024. The funny part is you once swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. The very document that allows these young men to state their political beliefs and vote. But...here you are. I know that how somebody chooses to come out is their business and should be respected. But this is weird. My man.You do not actually mean that you would forcibly recruit these young men to be in your homosexual harem should social media not exist, surely.That is what you said, and now you’ve doubled down, but you must be mistaken.You cannot mean “concubine.”Please, bro. last i checked real men don’t threaten sexual slavery .

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-us-nashville-power-grid-targeted_n_67296c0ce4b0266a34587e52","Man Allegedly Planned To Destroy Nashville Power Site With Explosive-Laden Drone","kimberlee kruesi","2024-11-04","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Department of Justice said Monday that federal agents have arrested a Tennessee man with ties to white nationalist groups who they say attempted to use what he believed to be an explosive-laden drone to destroy a Nashville energy facility. According to court documents, 24-year-old Skyler Philippi is accused of planning to attach several pounds of C-4 explosives to an aerial drone with the intent of destroying an electric substation in Nashville. The newly unsealed court records reveal that Philippi in July allegedly told a confidential source who was working with the FBI that he wanted to attack several substations to “shock the system.” That confidential source later introduced Philippi to an undercover FBI employee, who began to collect information about Philippi’s plan with other undercover agents. “Philippi researched previous attacks on electric substations and concluded that attacking with firearms would not be sufficient,” wrote Angelo DeFeo, an FBI special agent, in the court records released Monday. “Philippi, therefore, planned to use a drone with explosives attached to it and to fly the drone into the substation.” Philippi allegedly told undercover law enforcement officials that he was affiliated with several white nationalist and extremist groups, including the National Alliance, which calls for eradicating the Jewish people and other races. Such extremist groups increasingly have viewed attacking the United States’ power grid as a means of disrupting the country. The U.S. grid includes more than 6,400 power plants and 450,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines that span the country. In September, Philippi provided the undercover officials with excerpts of his so-called manifesto, which focused heavily on preserving the white race. On Saturday, Philippi and undercover employees drove to his intended Nashville launch site and prepared to fly a drone that authorities say Philippi believed had three pounds of C-4 attached to it. The material had been provided by the undercover employees, according to court documents. Law enforcement agents arrested Philippi shortly after arriving at the site. “As charged, Skyler Philippi believed he was moments away from launching an attack on a Nashville energy facility to further his violent white supremacist ideology – but the FBI had already compromised his plot,” Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said in a statement. A federal public defender was appointed to represent Philippi and a request for comment was sent to the attorney on Monday. Philippi is expected to appear in court on Nov. 13.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-oliver-last-minute-plea-pro-palestinian-voters-kamala-harris_n_67294e74e4b0be8c956a35cc","John Oliver Makes 11th-Hour Plea For Pro-Palestinian Voters To Support Harris","sanjana karanth","2024-11-04","In the final “Last Week Tonight” episode before Election Day, host John Oliver made a last-minute plea for hesitant pro-Palestinian voters to cast their ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris, arguing that she will be easier to hold accountable than former President Donald Trump when it comes to the U.S. role in Israel’s ongoing attacks on Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon. With just one day left in the presidential campaign, the Democratic nominee continues to struggle to earn the trust of voters who strongly oppose the Biden administration’s nearly unconditional military and diplomatic support for Israel ― specifically in Michigan, a crucial swing state with large Muslim and Arab American populations. “First, let me say I wish Harris had done more to reach out to you, beyond sending Bill Clinton to basically scold you this week,” Oliver said in Sunday’s episode, referring to the former president’s incendiary speech in Michigan, where he defended Israeli military strikes that have killed tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians. Some pro-Palestinian voters hoped that Harris would do more to reach out to Palestinian Americans after she replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. But with the vice president publicly claiming that her stance on Gaza policy would essentially be unchanged from Biden’s, many Democratic voters who support a free Palestine are on the fence about whether to continue backing their party’s chosen candidate. “What I have endorsed is that people come out and vote, to not sit on the sideline, regardless of all that has unfolded and happened to you directly or indirectly,” Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud told Democracy Now. “What I can assure you is that sitting on the sideline will accomplish nothing.” “And so, I’ve called on people to vote their moral conscience,” Hammoud said. “To go out, to at least begin with the local ballot questions, the local elections, and then work their way up to the ballot as they get to that presidential question.” Oliver pointed to the positions of some Muslim and Arab American leaders with the so-called Uncommitted movement, who organized a protest vote during the primary election which gained so much traction that the movement sent at least 30 delegates to represent the pro-Palestinian vote at the Democratic National Convention, although they were denied a speaking slot. The movement’s leaders declined to formally endorse Harris after she didn’t meet with them to discuss potential policy changes, nor would she meet with Palestinian families in Michigan whose loved ones have been killed in Gaza. Yet they vehemently warned the movement’s followers against casting their ballot for Trump or a third-party candidate, such as Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee who has won noticeable support from some pro-Palestinian voters after hinging her campaign on calling out Israel’s attacks on Gaza with U.S. weapons. “The push for Palestinian human rights will never be easy. But with a second Trump presidency, both civilians in Palestine and our antiwar movement here in our country will suffer,” Uncommitted co-founder Abbas Alawieh said in a Friday ad mobilizing Michigan voters against the Republican candidate. 🚨 Trump's in Dearborn today, spreading lies aimed at Michigan's Arab and Muslim communities. Help raise $50K to make sure Uncommitted Democratic primary voters in Michigan see this anti-Trump ad before Tuesday's election: https://t.co/FL81KcSw1P pic.twitter.com/KG6VbGb3fD Oliver echoed that sentiment, highlighting Trump’s cozy relationship with right-wing leaders in Israel and his stated plans for the future of Palestinian enclaves, as well as proposals in the right-wing presidential transition blueprint, Project 2025, that threaten aggressive action in the U.S. against pro-Palestinian protests. On top of that, the late-night host stressed that a Trump reelection will reverberate far beyond four years in the White House if he is again given the opportunity to appoint U.S. Supreme Court justices. Some of the Uncommitted leaders have stressed that they are voting for Harris because she can be more easily pressured to change policy positions. Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Romman recorded a TikTok post last month saying that she voted for the Democrat in her crucial swing state as a “promise that I and those who stand with me will not stop demanding the end of mass slaughter and violence everywhere.” Harris told reporters on Sunday in Detroit that she is “honored” to have the support of some Arab American leaders but that she knows the community is “not a monolith.” “There are many issues that are the issues that all Americans face and then, of course, some that are specific to what is happening in Gaza,” she said, repeating the messaging from her campaign and the current White House that the U.S. is committed to a cease-fire deal, the return of hostages, the security of Israel and the self-determination of Palestinians.

"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/harris-trump-final-push-pennsylvania_n_67296255e4b0be8c956a3f37","Harris And Trump's Final Push Before Election Day Brings Them To The Same Patch Of Pennsylvania","jill colvin, darlene superville , bill barrow","2024-11-04","ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump made their final pitches to voters Monday in the same parts of Pennsylvania at roughly the same time, focusing on the state that could make or break their chances during the last full day of the presidential campaign. In Pittsburgh, Trump delivered what his campaign aides described as his closing argument after his previous attempt — a mass rally at Madison Square Garden in New York ― was derailed by crude and racist jokes. He has also veered off message with falsehoods about voter fraud and invocations of violence. “Over the past four years, Americans have suffered one catastrophic failure, betrayal and humiliation after another,” said the Republican nominee, sounding raspy yet energetic after speaking for hours each day. “We do not have to settle for weakness, incompetence, decline and decay,” he went on. “With your vote tomorrow, we can fix every single problem our country faces and lead America, and indeed the whole world, to new heights of glory.” The crowd exploded in cheers when the Republican nominee said the country should tell Harris, “You’re fired,” his catchphrase from “The Apprentice,” the reality television show that made him a nationally recognized star. Trump started Monday in North Carolina and he’s scheduled to hold his last rally of the election in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he concluded his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Harris, the Democratic nominee, is spending all of Monday in Pennsylvania, and she was en route to Pittsburgh while Trump was speaking there. She’s holding her final rally in Philadelphia later in the evening. “This is it,” Harris said in Pittsburgh in front of the Carrie Furnaces, a historic steel facility that nodded to the city’s industrial legacy. “Tomorrow is Election Day and the momentum is on our side.” “We must finish strong,” she added. “Make no mistake, we will win.” With 19 Electoral College votes, the state is the biggest prize of any battleground. A Trump victory there would puncture the Democrats’ “blue wall” and make it harder for Harris to win the necessary 270 votes. “If we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole ball of wax,” Trump said during an event in Reading, in the state’s southeast corner. Both candidates visited the area, which is home to thousands of Latinos, including a sizable Puerto Rican population. Harris and her allies have repeatedly hit Trump for a comedian’s dig at Puerto Rico during the former president’s marquee Madison Square Garden event. The comedian, Tony Hinchcliffe, referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” “It was absurd,” said German Vega, a Dominican American who lives in Reading and became a U.S. citizen in 2015. “It bothered so many people — even many Republicans. It wasn’t right, and I feel that Trump should have apologized to Latinos.” But Emilio Feliciano, 43, waited outside Reading’s Santander Arena for a chance to take a photo of Trump’s motorcade. He dismissed the comments about Puerto Rico despite his family being Puerto Rican, saying he cares about the economy and that’s why he will vote for Trump. “Is the border going to be safe? Are you going to keep crime down? That’s what I care about,” he said. Harris told the crowd, “I stand here proud of my long-standing commitment to Puerto Rico and her people.” “And I will be a president for all Americans,” she said, adding that “momentum is on our side. Can you feel it?” Trump, meanwhile, stuck to talking about his proposed crackdown on immigration. He called to the stage Patty Morin, the mother of 37-year-old Rachel Morin, who was found dead a day after she went missing during a trip to go hiking. Officials say the suspect in her death, Victor Antonio Martinez Hernandez, entered the U.S. illegally after allegedly killing a woman in his home country of El Salvador. About 77 million Americans have voted early. A victory by either side would be unprecedented. Trump winning would make him the first incoming president to have been indicted and convicted of a felony, after his hush-money trial in New York. He will gain the power to end other federal investigations pending against him. Trump would also become only the second president in history to win nonconsecutive White House terms, after Grover Cleveland in the late 19th century. Harris is vying to become the first woman, first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent to reach the Oval Office — four years after she broke the same barriers in national office by becoming President Joe Biden’s second in command. Heading into Monday, Harris has mostly stopped mentioning Trump by name, calling him instead “the other guy.” She is promising to solve problems and seek consensus. Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said on a call with reporters that not saying Trump’s name was deliberate because voters “want to see in their leader an optimistic, hopeful, patriotic vision for the future.” Harris also offered some insights into her personal formation as a politician that she doesn’t often divulge. In Scranton, she talked about once being a longshot while running for San Francisco district attorney in 2002 and how she “used to campaign with my ironing board.” “I’d walk to the front of the grocery store, outside, and I would stand up my ironing board because, you see, an ironing board makes a really great standing desk,” the vice president said, recalling how she would tape her posters to the outside of the board, fill the top with flyers and “require people to talk to me as they walked in and out.” In Allentown, Harris rallied with rapper Fat Joe. She then made her own visit to Reading after Trump’s rally had concluded, visiting Old San Juan Cafe, a Puerto Rican restaurant, with Ocasio-Cortez. Both Fat Joe, whose real name is Joseph Cartagena, and Ocasio-Cortez are of Puerto Rican heritage. Supporters chanted “Sí se puede” and “Kamala” as the vice president’s motorcade pulled up. Once inside, Harris chatted with some diners, even mixing in “Gracias” and a few Spanish words. The vice president later ordered cassava, yellow rice and pork, saying, “I’m very hungry” as she noted that she’s been too busy campaigning to find time for many meals. Harris did some of her own canvassing afterward, stopping at two homes in Reading while flanked by campaign volunteers. “It’s the day before the election and I just wanted to come by and say I hope to earn your vote,” she said at one house. The woman replied, “You already got my vote” and said her husband would be casting his ballot the next day. Standing in line for Harris’ Allentown rally, 54-year-old Ron Kessler, an Air Force veteran and Republican-turned-Democrat, said he planned to vote for just the second time in his life. Kessler said that, for a long time, he didn’t vote, thinking the country “would vote for the correct candidate.” The next four years will change America forever.

James Lankford (R-Okla.) is using a sports metaphor to describe what happened to him when his fellow Republicans, with the urging of former President Donald Trump, rejected a carefully negotiated border security and foreign aid bill in early February. “When I called the play as the quarterback that day, and my own line turned around and sacked me, that was definitely a surprise to me. Because everybody was fully aware what the play call was,” Lankford said in an appearance this week before the conservative Ripon Society in Washington, D.C. Lankford was one of three main negotiators on the bill, along with Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.). After Republicans in September rejected sending more weapons to Ukraine to defend itself against a Russian invasion, and instead demanded that any aid be tied to border security changes, the trio started writing a bill of their own. The final product would have enhanced the president’s ability to shut down the U.S. border in certain circumstances, and would have provided about $60 billion in aid to Ukraine. But many Republicans said it did not go far enough, and some openly worried it would give President Joe Biden a political win in an election year. Trump publicly urged Republicans not to agree to the proposed deal, saying it would benefit Democrats and Biden. House Leader Mike Johnson (R-La.) obliged, saying that even if the bill passed the Senate, he would not bring it up for a vote in the House. “Please, blame it on me,” Trump said in a Las Vegas appearance. Some senators said they were shocked by the bill’s provisions, including the circumstances under which a border shutdown would be allowed. “This is worse than bad negotiation. It’s betrayal,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called the bill “INSANE” in a social media post. But Lankford said Tuesday that none of the Republican senators could honestly claim surprise at the bill’s provisions, because he had briefed them on it well in advance. “I met personally with every single Republican, sat down with him, talked him through all the details, five weeks before it came out, as we’re finalizing text,” Lankford said. “We went through every section of it — the good, the bad and the ugly, both the salad and the steak.” “Everyone knew what was in that bill,” he said. “Everybody knew what was in it.” In the end, only three other Republicans besides Lankford voted to advance the compromise: Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Mitt Romney (Utah). The Senate later passed — with 70 votes — a bill to send aid to Ukraine without any border provisions, but it has not been taken up in the House yet. Ukrainian forces have since lost the strategic eastern town of Avdiivka, a loss attributed to having to ration ammunition and artillery. The next four years will change America forever.

Lankford said what happened with the border bill reflected a party base that increasingly prefers getting nothing over having to compromise to get something. “For me, the challenge that we have right now is this sense of an activist base that says ‘I want everything or I want nothing, and nothing is better than something.’ [That] does not not align with many people across the country,” he said. “Because many people across the country are saying, ‘These are hard problems.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obstruction-money-courts-and-trump-how-mitch-mcconnell-changed-american-politics_n_65e246cbe4b005b8583462a0,"Obstruction, Money, Courts and Trump: How Mitch McConnell Changed American Politics",kevin robillard,3/1/2024,"In the days since Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he would step down from his role leading Senate Republicans, evaluations of his tenure have often deployed a word McConnell loves to use to describe himself: “institutionalist.” “I love the Senate,” McConnell said Wednesday during a speech on the Senate floor. “It has been my life. There may be more distinguished members of this body throughout our history, but I doubt there were any with any more admiration for the Senate.” To describe McConnell as an institutionalist, however, is to give him an incredibly short shrift. No single man has done more to shape modern American politics, and the modern Senate, than McConnell. He helped create the era of big-money politics; shaped the Supreme Court’s archconservative majority; and ratcheted up Senate obstruction to new levels. All of those came together to define his relationship with former President Donald Trump, the man who would ultimately take over the GOP McConnell built. McConnell’s disdain for Trump — and for the business mogul’s isolationist and protectionist policies — has been obvious at times, but he continued to justify working with him to achieve broader conservative goals, even as Trump brought American democracy to the brink. He rarely backed up his tough talk about opposing Trump with hard actions, and is now stepping aside as Trump is poised to seize control of the GOP yet again. McConnell’s defenders have long portrayed him as holding up the grandest traditions of the upper chamber. But even his longstanding opposition to weakening the filibuster could not stand once it got in the way of an otherwise attainable bit of political power. Well before McConnell was a household name, his name was on a 2003 lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission seeking to overturn the McCain-Feingold reform law, which put restrictions on campaign financing. He had led multiple filibusters against it before its final passage. McConnell’s opposition to the campaign finance reform law flowed from his work raising money for the Republican Party in the 1990s. As momentum built towards reform following the 1996 presidential campaign, McConnell promised, “That will not happen.” But the reform bill did pass in 2002, and was reluctantly signed by President George W. Bush. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld most of the law. But dissents from the conservative justices laid the groundwork for Citizens United vs. FEC. That case and others led to the super PAC era in American politics, in which donors can give infinite sums — sometimes even anonymously — to PACs that support their chosen candidate. McConnell does not deserve sole credit here. Democrats, eager to gain fundraising advantages, also contributed: The California Democratic Party, for instance, also sued to overturn parts of McCain-Feingold. But Americans for Tax Reform head Grover Norquist credited McConnell for essentially waging a solo battle against campaign finance reform in the 1990s and 2000s. “Mitch McConnell changed the direction of the world,” the conservative political activist wrote on social media. “He stopped the destruction of the Republican Party by opposing, delaying and weakening and ultimately defeating the drive for ‘campaign finance reform’ that would have left union bosses as the sole power in America.” That battle, along with McConnell’s own prowess at raising campaign money, helped solidify his support among his GOP colleagues as he sought to lead the caucus. McConnell became the GOP’s Senate leader in 2006, but most Americans first saw his impact in 2009, when Obama entered the presidency amid lofty rhetoric about bipartisanship. McConnell ensured that rhetoric would not become reality. He made the GOP’s main strategy one of obstruction, pressuring Republican senators not to break off and support Obama administration policies — even if some would later go on to support bipartisan deals on immigration and gun control during Obama’s second term. The use of the filibuster — a procedural hurdle requiring bills to receive 60 votes instead of 50 to pass — went from a tactic to an expectation. He put it bluntly in an interview in October 2010: “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.” His obstructionist goals culminated in 2016, when he refused to meet with or consider Obama’s nomination of then-D.C. Court of Appeals Judge Merrick Garland to serve on the Supreme Court (more on this later). Once Trump became president, however, the reputation McConnell had earned as a master tactician faltered. His long-hyped, long-awaited attempt to repeal Obamacare went down with the late Sen. John McCain’s thumbs-down “no” vote in July 2017. “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!” Trump tweeted. But Trump and McConnell’s efforts to stop Democrats’ expansion of health insurance had permanently failed. Republicans successfully passed tax cuts favoring corporations and the wealthy — the GOP equivalent of low-hanging fruit — later in 2017, but that was the last of their legislative accomplishments. Arguably, McConnell’s most lasting legacy is how he reshaped the nation’s courts — and blew up Senate norms to put as many conservatives into lifetime federal judgeships as possible. He will forever be remembered for denying a Supreme Court seat to President Barack Obama. In February 2016, barely an hour after Justice Antonin Scalia had died, McConnell made the unprecedented announcement that he would block any Obama nominee to fill the vacancy, saying voters should first choose the next president in November and allow the winner to appoint the next justice. Trump won in November, and when Democrats filibustered his appointment of Neil Gorsuch, McConnell used the Senate’s rarely invoked “nuclear option” and eliminated the filibuster — an institution he had long defended — for Supreme Court nominees. Thanks entirely to that change, Republicans were able to confirm Gorsuch. Three years later, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September 2020, McConnell ignored his own precedent and raced to fill the vacancy with Amy Coney Barrett just weeks before Joe Biden was elected. McConnell delivered both of those vacancies to Trump, who reliably filled them, along with a 2018 vacancy, with conservative picks. Without McConnell, Trump would have filled just one seat, and today’s Supreme Court wouldn’t have its current 6-3 conservative supermajority — responsible for the court’s most stunning decisions in recent years, including the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Asked Wednesday to name McConnell’s greatest accomplishment, Senate Republicans said the same thing again and again: his hand in reshaping the Supreme Court. “Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Coney Barrett,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told HuffPost. “For sure.” McConnell is also how Trump was able to put more than 230 people into lifetime federal court seats, a massive number of judges to confirm in a single presidential term. McConnell made judicial confirmations his top priority as Senate majority leader, and he worked closely with Trump’s White House and the Federalist Society to keep the pipeline of district and appeals court nominees flowing. Virtually all were male, white right-wing ideologues. By the end of Trump’s term, he had filled almost every vacancy on a U.S. appeals court. Nearly one in every three U.S. appeals court judges was a Trump pick by the end of 2020. “Mitch’s tenure has had many legacies, but no legacy is more consequential than the nomination and confirmation of hundreds of principled constitutionalists to the federal judiciary,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a member of the Judiciary Committee who has butted heads with McConnell, told HuffPost Wednesday. “That is a lasting benefit to the American people, for which I’m deeply grateful.” McConnell had to do business with Trump to win the courts. The relationship between the two Republican leaders was always rocky. Trump ran in the 2016 GOP primaries as a hard-right insurgent against the party elite, including McConnell. His victory forced longtime party leaders to find common ground where they could. For McConnell, that meant blunting Trump’s populist and anti-internationalist instincts while getting what he could out of him. Trump appointed McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, to be his Transportation Secretary, a conciliatory move following Trump’s election-year attacks on the Senate leader. McConnell, meanwhile, covered for Trump’s most inflammatory conduct, brushing off the continued operation of his business as it received millions from foreign governments and claiming ignorance of Trump’s bizarre tweets. After their legislative ups and downs, the relationship between the two Republicans became increasingly frosty, until it ultimately fractured with Trump’s 2020 re-election loss to Biden. When Trump lied and claimed that he had won, McConnell humored him, stating that Trump was “100% within his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his legal options.” Then came the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. As Trump directed a mob of supporters to march on the Capitol as electoral votes were being counted, McConnell and the rest of Congress were forced to flee from the violent assault. In a speech from the floor of the Senate after the insurrectionists were cleared, a furious McConnell said that the Senate would not “bow to lawlessness or intimidation” from “thugs, mobs or threats.” The next day, McConnell reportedly told journalist Jonathan Martin that he was “exhilarated” by the fact that Trump had “finally, totally discredited himself.” “He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger,” McConnell told Martin, according to his book, “This Will Not Pass.” But Trump had not discredited himself — not in the eyes of his followers, nor in the eyes of the conservative media that relies on those followers to profit. All Trump had done was to load the metaphorical gun and leave it for McConnell to pull the trigger. McConnell refused. Trump’s second impeachment trial in the Senate, this time for incitement of insurrection, would be the first impeachment of a president who’d already left office. This bit of unprecedented procedure gave McConnell an excuse to let Trump slide. Seven Republicans joined the entire Democratic Party caucus to vote to convict Trump — 10 votes short of the total needed for conviction. McConnell was not among them. “There is no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day,” McConnell said afterwards. “The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president.” But McConnell claimed that a post-office impeachment was unconstitutional. This proved highly consequential: Had Trump been convicted, the Senate could have banned him from seeking office in the future, preventing him from running for president again. And then Trump announced he would run again in 2024. His third presidential campaign would focus on valorizing the insurrection he inspired on Jan. 6 and getting revenge on all his enemies — real or imagined, Democrat or Republican. And yet McConnell is in talks to endorse Trump, whom he has labeled as “despicable” and “practically and morally responsible” for Jan. 6. McConnell’s relationship with Trump, in all its ups and downs, shows what lies at the heart of the soon-to-be-departing Republican leader’s career: Personal humiliations, policy losses and threats to the constitutional order were all part of the price he paid for Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

On the same day McConnell announced his forthcoming retirement as leader, the Supreme Court said it would hear arguments on April 22 on Trump’s absurd claim of “absolute immunity” from prosecution for his actions surrounding Jan. 6. The decision to take up the case for arguments could fatally delay Trump’s prosecution, helping him win re-election, whereby he could become immune from prosecution or even pardon himself.

The show takes a group of reality stars and famous folks and places them in a castle in Scotland to compete for a prize fund. The twist is that among the main cast are “traitors,” deceitful players manipulating non-traitors, or “faithfuls.” That in itself is enough to sell me on watching the show, but one cast member had me hooked week after week. This show, which airs on Peacock, was made for Phaedra Parks. For 10 episodes, Parks has masterfully played the game and reminded viewers why we love seeing her on our screens so much. The former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star has, hands down, been the best traitor Season 2 has seen. And though she doesn’t win it all this season, I make a case on this week’s episode of “I Know That’s Right” for why she should’ve come out on top. For weeks, each time a contestant made an argument for Parks — who’s also a new cast member on Bravo’s “Married to Medicine” — being a traitor, she showed them why it’s not smart to go toe-to-toe with her. That was proved when fellow traitors ― “Big Brother” winner Dan Gheesling and “Survivor” star Parvati Shallow ― at risk of banishment, turned on Parks. They were both voted out. Then it was proved again most recently when “The Bachelor” star Peter Weber, known as “King of the Faithfuls,” organized a campaign to rally the remaining house members to vote Parks out of the castle. Parks walked Weber’s accusations down like the lawyer she is — and she cut every opponent with razor-sharp one-liners and comebacks. Parks maintained her cool the entire game and managed to talk her way out of elimination until right before the finale.

In a statement shared with HuffPost on Friday, the sheriff’s office said the body of Madeline Soto was located in a wooded area about 4:30 p.m. local time and that her family has been notified. Speaking at a news conference earlier Friday, Sheriff John Mina had said authorities were “confident” Madeline was dead after they reviewed disturbing video evidence that appeared to show her mother’s boyfriend, 37-year-old Stephan Sterns, throwing items into a dumpster behind their apartment building in Kissimmee. Madeline’s mother, Jenn Soto, told police she thought Sterns was taking her daughter to school but later found out that the girl never arrived there and she reported her missing. Police had previously said Sterns had dropped Madeline off near her school, but they later learned he never dropped her off at all, Mina said. Video footage appears to show that when Sterns returned to the apartment complex, Madeline was in the car. Police say they think she was already dead at that time. According to Mina, investigators searching the dumpster found Madeline’s backpack and her school-issued laptop. Stern was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of sexual battery and possession of child sexual abuse material. According to an emergency arrest warrant shared with HuffPost, police alleged that Sterns was in possession of several images that were criminal and sexual in nature and videos that depicted an underaged girl. It’s unclear whether the girl in the videos was Madeline, but authorities said in an earlier news release that the “crimes were committed at the family home in Kissimmee.” Madeline’s mother is not considered a suspect in the investigation.

Attorneys for Trump and other co-defendants accused Willis of corruption, saying she improperly hired attorney Nathan Wade as one of three special prosecutors in the sprawling racketeering suit. Willis and Wade admitted to having a past romantic relationship in February after it was unearthed in January. “I think it’s been very much made clear by the argument made today that there are several legal issues to sort through, several factual determinations I have to make, and those aren’t ones I can make at this moment,” Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee said Friday after listening to closing arguments from both sides. “And so I will be taking the time to make sure that I give this case the full consideration it’s due.” Willis has forcefully defended herself from accusations of impropriety. John Merchant, an attorney for co-defendant Michael Roman, argued that the district attorney hired “her boyfriend” and paid him with public funds; thus when the pair had taken trips together, Merchant suggested it had been on the public’s dime. “She put her boyfriend in the spot, paid him, and then reaped the benefits of it,” Merchant said Friday. Roman is a Republican opposition researcher who worked on Trump’s failed 2020 presidential campaign. Willis maintained that she and Wade split costs evenly throughout their relationship, which she said began in the spring of 2022 — after she’d hired Wade, in November 2021. (The relationship ended last summer, Willis said.) When the relationship started has been a main source of contention, as defendants’ attorneys claim that it began in 2019, long before Willis hired Wade. “They knew it was wrong, they hid it, and even when they were called out on it they tried to create an excuse for it by saying it happened after the fact,” Merchant said. McAfee hinted at the questions he considers to be outstanding during an exchange with Fulton County Chief Deputy District Attorney Adam Abbate. “The original and the core financial allegations — there is a relationship, and money has changed hands. There is maybe still an open question of where the ledger stands, but I think it was conceded that the balance could run in the district attorney’s favor,” McAfee told Abbate. “It’s no longer just a theory that money changed hands, it’s no longer just speculation and conjecture,” the judge added. Abbate responded to say that “whether the money had any financial benefit or gain to the district attorney that is all speculation and conjecture.” “Absolutely all speculation and conjecture,” Abbate emphasized. The defendants’ attorneys argued before the judge that a former college friend of Willis vouched for the idea the Willis-Wade relationship began earlier than admitted. Ashleigh Merchant, an attorney for Roman who is married to John Merchant, alleged that a text message from Wade’s former law partner, Terrence Bradley, further proved that point. But Bradley only proved to be an ineffective witness. He evaded questions on the stand earlier this week, saying that he had just been “speculating” in the text message when he said he “absolutely” thought Willis began dating Wade before she hired him. “There’s absolutely no evidence that contradicts that the relationship did not begin around March 2022,” Abbate told the judge Friday.

As of Friday afternoon, Animal Haven in Manhattan received nearly $50,000 in memory of Dipper, who was adopted by Stewart and his family from the shelter over a decade ago, said Animal Haven Executive Director Tiffany Lacey. “In Jon’s message, he never said, ‘Donate to Animal Haven.’ And literally almost minutes after that aired, the donations started coming in,” Lacey told HuffPost of Stewart’s on-air tribute. “I think that it’s a testament to the fact that so many people have lost animals. He touched a nerve that everybody knows the feeling of.” On Monday’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Dipper was memorialized by Stewart as “the best” canine companion after he and his children met the pooch during a fundraiser for the shelter. “They put the dog in my lap, and we left that day feeling really good. We’d helped this great organization, and we also left with this 1-ish-year-old brindle pitbull,” he said while choking back tears. “We named him Dipper, and in a world of good boys, he was the best.” “My wish for you,” he told viewers, “is that one day you find that dog, that one dog. It’s just, it’s the best.” Lacey said the on-air tribute came as a “total surprise” to everyone at the shelter. “We didn’t know that Jon was going to mention us,” she said. In addition to a wave of financial donations following the “Daily Show” episode, the shelter has seen an increase in adoption inquiries and purchases from its online wish lists, she said. “At this time we are overcapacity like so many other shelters, and have well over 100,” Lacey said, tallying the dogs and cats now at Animal Haven. “The money will go directly to care for our current 60 dogs, puppies looking for a home, via vet care, training, food, medicine, treats and love.” In honor of Dipper, the shelter said that it is reducing its adoption fees by $100 for all dogs through March. The hope, the organization said in an online statement, is “that we can fulfill Jon’s wish of helping you find ‘that one dog.’” “Everything kind of surges when something like this starts to happen so I’m hoping the end result, when we look back after a couple of weeks, [is that] our adoption numbers will be up,” Lacey said.

Those not able to donate financially are encouraged to mail or drop off towels or other linens for the animals, Lacey said.

The woman’s stepmother told officers that the victim “was being held against her will” at a motel, and detectives found her at the Evergreen Motel in Inkster, a western suburb of Detroit, according to the police announcement. According to police, officers heard the woman screaming and crying from inside a motel room before they rescued her. The unidentified woman, who is in her 30s, was taken to a hospital for a medical evaluation before being reunited with her family. Investigators who searched the motel seized drugs, cellphones and a firearm, according to the news release. A suspect was also identified in the case, but no one was taken into custody. Detectives are trying to determine if human trafficking was involved, according to the news release. “This may turn out just to be a domestic violence type of deal. This may turn out to be a big human trafficking thing. And it may turn out to be that she finally decided she wanted to go home and just called her stepmom,” Michigan State Police Lt. Mike Shaw told WDIV-TV in Detroit. Investigators are also working to determine what happened when the woman disappeared seven years ago, Shaw told WWJ-TV in Detroit. “It may take us nowhere. It may not be something that we can charge criminally, but at least we got her out of the situation,” he said.

Click here to subscribe. With royal rumors swirling this week, it seems like most internet users’ preferred form of exercise is jumping to conclusions. Folks have been playing a game of “Where’s Waldo” with Kate Middleton, Princess of Wales. On Jan. 16, the palace informed the public that Kate had undergone a “planned” abdominal surgery, as detailed by HuffPost senior reporter Carly Ledbetter. In a statement, the palace said that “based on the current medical advice,” Kate probably won’t return to public duties until after Easter. But people riding the two horsemen of the online apocalypse — X, formerly known as Twitter, and TikTok — have dismissed the official story, instead producing a deluge of memes and theories about Kate’s absence. “yeh so basically Kate Middleton hasn’t been seen in months like she’s actually missing. word on the conspiracy street is that she’s doing 1 of many things - gone for a BBL, growing out her bangs, lost at the Wonka experience. also she’s possibly banksy x” pic.twitter.com/IP20NIKgGl The Kate Middleton reveal on Masked Singer is going to make all of us look silly. BREAKING: Kate Middleton has been spotted at the Willy Wonka experience in Glasgow pic.twitter.com/R4Nf8HMCrP kate middleton’s bbl, rhinoplasty, and facelift is healing. i will not entertain any other conspiracy theory until (if) she reappears. everyone’s speculating on why kate middleton and king charles are out of the public eye i think the answer is obvious ..they got freaky fridayed The speculation comes after news that King Charles had been diagnosed with cancer on Feb. 5. In January, the king underwent surgery after seeking “treatment for an enlarged prostate” earlier that month. (Kate was also receiving her operation at that same hospital.) Although the palace has not disclosed the precise nature of Charles’ illness, they have confirmed it is not prostate cancer. Some folks online have pointed out the contrast between the British press’ dedication to preserving Kate’s privacy and their treatment of Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex — recalling the racist vitriol that myriad tabloids directed toward the duchess. I remember very well when the British press and public demanded to know every detail about Meghan’s childbirth. But when the white duchess goes into hiding for over 2 months they stay mute and claim she deserves privacy and peace. #KateMiddleton pic.twitter.com/EmYOFyIrvT I have no problem with Kate Middleton taking time to recover from whatever is going on with her. I think it’s wonderful, because every day that she enjoys privacy & respect regarding whatever ails her, is further proof that Meghan Markle was intentionally bullied & abused. It needs to be said that the British press’s respect and deference shown to Kate Middleton would have *never* been extended to Meghan in a million years. To all the people vehemently defending Kate Middleton’s privacy, do Meghan Markle next… pic.twitter.com/6jeUNT8wub In December 2021, Meghan won a legal battle against the Daily Mail, claiming that the publication “violated her privacy” by publishing a letter she sent to her father in 2018. Moreover, in December, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, was awarded $180,000 in a lawsuit against tabloid conglomerate Mirror Group Newspapers, alleging that they hacked his phone. Nonetheless, on Thursday, the palace sought to put to bed the rumors regarding Kate’s status.

Lisa Murkowski And Susan Collins Back Nikki Haley In GOP Presidential Race,igor bobic,3/1/2024,"WASHINGTON ― Nikki Haley got her first Senate endorsement on Friday from Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski, a vocal critic of former President Donald Trump. “America needs someone with the right values, vigor, and judgment to serve as our next President — and in this race, there is no one better than her,” Murkowski said in a statement ahead of the Alaska GOP primary on Tuesday. “Nikki will be a strong leader and uphold the ideals of the Republican Party while serving as a President for all Americans,” the senator added. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) swiftly followed, telling the Bangor Daily News that she considered Haley to be “extremely well-qualified.” “She has the energy, intellect, and temperament that we need to lead our country in these very tumultuous times,” Collins told the outlet. Both Murkowski and Collins voted to convict Trump in his Jan. 6 impeachment trial. Collins has offered only mild criticism of the former president in recent months, and spoke out against Maine’s decision to leave him off the GOP primary ballot. Murkowski, meanwhile, has been sharply critical of the former president’s tone and conduct, saying recently that his rhetoric is “poisoning our country.” She and Collins are only Haley’s second and third congressional endorsements so far. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) is the lone House member backing her 2024 campaign. Republicans who oppose Trump are on an island in their party right now. Trump swept all four early GOP presidential nominating states and he has the backing of more than 130 Republicans in the House and over 30 Republicans in the Senate, despite facing 91 criminal charges across several jurisdictions. Haley acknowledged earlier this week it’s “very possible” the GOP has fully become the party of Trump. The next four years will change America forever.

The “Cruel Intentions” star has officially parted ways with her agents at Creative Artists Agency (CAA), as well as with her publicity team at Narrative PR, according to reports from Deadline and inside sources who confirmed the news Friday to The Hollywood Reporter. Blair has apparently also dropped Troy Nankin as her manager and parted with attorney Cheryl Snow, as suggested by changes Thursday to her official profile on IMDb Pro. Her newly listed representatives — manager Ben Gaynor and attorneys Berlandi Nussbaum and Joshua Reitzas — did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Blair, who signed with CAA in 2021, made these changes after facing severe backlash for her comment. The actor deleted and apologized for remarks under an Instagram video that slammed Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) for voting against a bill that purportedly would prevent immigration into the U.S. by people who “facilitated” the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Gaza-based Hamas militants. Tlaib said the bill was “unnecessary” and “redundant with already existing federal law.” “Deport all these terrorist supporting goons,” wrote Blair in the since-deleted comment. “Islam has destroyed Muslim countries and then they come here and destroy minds. They know they are liars. Twisted justifications. May they meet their fate.” Many social media users were outraged by the statement. Since the Oct. 7 surprise attack by Hamas, in which an estimated 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 200 were taken hostage, the Israeli military has killed more than 30,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Much of northern Gaza has been bombarded, and evacuees jammed into the southern areas face starvation as aid deliveries are blocked. The next four years will change America forever.

Appearing on author Malcolm Gladwell’s “Revisionist History” podcast this week, Gaghan recalled his experience developing a film adaptation of Gladwell’s 2005 book, “Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,” with Leonardo DiCaprio in mind for the starring role. While working on the “Blink” script, Gaghan was introduced to Ledger, and ultimately decided that he was better suited for the part. “I’d just had a real connection with him that was kind of unusual and really special to me,” he explained. “I had a feeling that I just love this guy, and I was going to make a bunch of movies with him.” Sadly, those plans came to a halt when Gaghan received a phone call from Ledger’s father and one of the actor’s close friends, who informed him that Ledger had been found dead in New York. “I got a phone call, they were on speakerphone, and it was Heath Ledger’s father, who I had never met,” he told Gladwell. “The dad and the guy who was closest to him in his professional life, they were there with the body. Our script was in bed with him and your book was on the bedside table.” He went on to note: “I think my number was on the script. These guys are, as you can imagine, in shock, and they dialed that number.” Ledger died Jan. 22, 2008, of an accidental overdose that involved several prescription medications. At the time of his death, the 28-year-old had recently completed filming on “The Dark Knight,” and would later posthumously receive an Academy Award for his portrayal of the Joker. Gaghan, whose Hollywood credits include 2000’s “Traffic” and 2005’s “Syriana,” said that he’d never spoken publicly about Ledger’s death prior to his chat with Gladwell. At the time of the phone call, Gaghan and his wife, Minnie Mortimer, were traveling through an airport. “I literally just collapse. It’s never happened to me before or since,” he said. “My feet went out from under me. I just literally sat down because I was like: ‘What? What?’ ... My wife was looking at me. I remember her face and I was just speechless. I just listened and listened and listened. It was just really, really sad. And it’s still sad.” Though the “Blink” adaptation fell by the wayside after Ledger’s death, Gaghan said that he reread the film’s script in advance of his podcast interview, and hinted that it might someday be worth revisiting.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/court-rules-against-sentence-booster-in-jan-6-cases_n_65e2328be4b0d2a2475954c7,Court Rules Against Provision Used To Beef Up Sentences For Jan. 6 Attackers,jonathan nicholson,3/1/2024,"A Washington, D.C., court said Friday that a lower court was wrong to apply a provision boosting the punishment for a Texas man convicted in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol — a ruling that could raise questions about many other Jan. 6 defendants’ sentences. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the so-called sentencing enhancement did not apply to one of Larry Brock’s six convictions for his participation in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Brock was briefly on the Senate floor during his 38 minutes in the U.S. Capitol during the attack — which the lower court found was enough to be considered “substantial interference with the administration of justice,” making him eligible for a harsher sentence. The appeals court disagreed. “We hold that the ‘administration of justice’ enhancement does not apply to interference with the legislative process of certifying electoral votes,” said Judge Patricia Millett in a written opinion. The case may be significant because that enhancement has been used by federal prosecutors in many other cases involving Jan. 6 insurrectionists. The Washington Post reported it could mean more than 100 could have to be resentenced. The court sent Brock’s case back to district court so the sentence for his felony conviction for obstructing an official proceeding could be reassessed, this time without the enhancement. His initial sentence on that charge was 24 months in prison. But the court left intact Brock’s five other convictions, with concurrent sentences of six to 12 months each and 24 months of probation. Millett wrote in her opinion that the electoral certification process that the Jan. 6 rioters sought to interrupt was not the same as a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding whose disruption would could be seen as obstructing justice, and thus Brock did not qualify for enhanced penalties. “The multi-step process of certifying electoral college votes—as important to our democratic system of government as it is—bears little resemblance to the traditional understanding of the administration of justice as the judicial or quasi-judicial investigation or determination of individual rights,” she wrote. “To the extent that law enforcement is present, it is there to protect the lawmakers and their process, not to investigate individuals’ rights or to enforce Congress’s certification decision. After all, law enforcement is present for security purposes for a broad variety of governmental proceedings that do not involve the ‘administration of justice’—presidential inaugurations, for example, and the pardoning of the Thanksgiving Turkey.” Former president Donald Trump has said the Jan. 6 convicts have been mistreated, likening them to “political prisoners,” and a cottage industry has sprung up in right-wing circles portraying the convicts as victims of political oppression. Brock is one of the highest-profile Jan. 6 insurrectionists, having been caught on camera as one of the older attackers in the Senate chamber wearing a combat-style helmet and a tactical vest. The appeals court said Brock, one of many former military personnel who participated in the attack, told other rioters to “calm down” and not to sit in the Senate president’s chair because it would be disrespectful. But the court also noted that before the attack, Brock called the 2020 election stolen and fraudulent on social media, and told a fellow veteran there needed to be a “plan of action” if Trump was not certified the 2020 winner.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/marjorie-taylor-greene-hunter-biden_n_65e2123fe4b005b858343f93,Nudes For Nothing: Marjorie Taylor Greene Doesn't Ask Hunter Biden About Alleged Sex Crimes,arthur delaney,3/1/2024,"WASHINGTON ― Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) passed up her chance to ask Hunter Biden about the compromising photos she had showed during committee hearings. Greene attended an hourslong deposition with President Joe Biden’s son on Wednesday but was among many lawmakers who asked no substantive questions, according to a transcript released Thursday evening. One of Hunter Biden’s vocal antagonists on Capitol Hill, Greene has repeatedly used her time during committee hearings to display images of him apparently engaged in sex acts with prostitutes. Greene said the photos showed that the younger Biden had committed crimes — namely, violations of the Mann Act, a federal law that forbids transporting a person across state lines for illegal sexual activity. “This is showing Hunter Biden paying for a victim’s United flight,” Greene stated during a July hearing, saying that the flight went from Los Angeles to the Washington area. She held up posters with censored images of a naked Biden with unnamed women alongside images of documents that she said indicated he had paid them for sex. “I believe this is a violation of the Mann Act. This is Hunter Biden’s, this is his proof that he bought the ticket. He bought it for this woman right here,” Greene said. The accusation has nothing to do with the corruption allegations that Republicans have chased in their impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden. But Greene claimed that she’s trying to expose the double standards of a Justice Department that had not prosecuted an obvious crime and had failed to “vindicate the rights of these women.” When the House oversight committee in January voted to recommend holding Hunter Biden in contempt of Congress for refusing to sit for a deposition, Greene displayed the pictures again. “This is important evidence of human trafficking, Mann Act violations that we had questions for the president’s son about,” Greene said. The images came from Hunter Biden’s hard drive when he was in the depths of an addiction to crack cocaine while earning millions of dollars from a Ukrainian energy company and other foreign sources. Republicans have claimed that a Ukrainian oligarch used the younger Biden to influence his father, though their main bribery allegation collapsed last month when the Justice Department said that an FBI informant had made it up. In his memoir, Hunter Biden acknowledged that he had perused ads for escort services, though he claimed that he was only looking for drugs. During Wednesday’s deposition, it was Biden who first asked a question of Greene, challenging her to say whether she trusted certain FBI agents and informants involved in his case. The transcript suggests there was some cross-talk before Biden and Greene had a sarcastic exchange that went nowhere. “Are you a businessman, or are you involved in government, Mr. Biden?” Greene asked. “Here’s what I am,” Biden said. “I’m both an attorney, a businessman, and a concerned citizen, Ms. Greene. That’s what I am.” “Just an average citizen,” Greene said. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the House Judiciary Committee chair, then cut them off and directed a staff attorney to ask a question. Greene later chimed in during a round of questions from Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), prompting Biden to say, “Come forward, Ms Greene.” Gaetz then resumed his questioning. Other Republicans asked Biden about his past drug addiction, but nobody brought up his use of escort services. Biden conceded that he’s “made mistakes” but said that they had nothing to do with his father. He said he’s been sober since 2019. Investigatory material obtained and released by Republicans shows that the Justice Department did consider prosecuting Biden for Mann Act violations. He has since been charged with failing to pay his taxes on time and illegally owning a firearm. It’s possible he will face more charges. Hunter Biden has said that he believes Joe Biden’s enemies are trying to humiliate him into a relapse to destroy his father’s presidency. The next four years will change America forever.

CVS and Walgreens both confirmed Friday that they’ve completed the Food and Drug Administration’s certification process to start filling prescriptions for the pills, which can be used to terminate some pregnancies in the first trimester and account for more than half of abortions in the U.S. Walgreens “expects to begin dispensing within a week, consistent with federal and state laws,” said the pharmacy, which operates more than 8,000 locations across the country. Its rollout will begin in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California, and Illinois ― all states that have protected access to abortion in the wake of Roe v. Wade falling in 2022. CVS said it’s starting with a smaller rollout on a slightly later timeline. “We’ll begin filling prescriptions for the medication in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the weeks ahead and will expand to additional states, where allowed by law, on a rolling basis,” said the company, which operates more than 9,000 pharmacies nationwide. The New York Times was the first to report the news. Neither pharmacy will offer mifepristone by mail. That practice has been a source of debate in recent years, though a recent study found that using telehealth to obtain abortion pills through the mail is as safe and effective as seeing a doctor in person for the same purpose. President Joe Biden praised CVS and Walgreens for their announcements Friday and encouraged more pharmacies to seek the certification. “Today is an important milestone in ensuring access to mifepristone, a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for more than 20 years,” he said in a statement. “With major retail pharmacy chains newly certified to dispense medication abortion, many women will soon have the option to pick up their prescription at a local, certified pharmacy—just as they would for any other medication. I encourage all pharmacies that want to pursue this option to seek certification.” More than a dozen states have successfully outlawed abortion following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in 2022 removing federal protections for the procedure. Several other states are enforcing bans on abortion after just a few weeks into pregnancy, leaving the procedure accessible in about just of half of the states. Mifepristone is one half of the two-drug combination usually used in medication abortions, along with misoprostol. But mifepristone has been targeted more intensely for restriction, and even in states where mifepristone remains legal, political maneuvering has stymied access.

After Walgreens announced last year that it would seek certification to sell it in pharmacies, a group of 20 attorneys general from conservative states threatened legal action against the pharmacy if they proceeded with distribution in their states. That included four states where mifepristone is legal: Alaska, Iowa, Kansas and Montana. Walgreens acquiesced to the threat, with a spokesperson calling the matter “a very complex and in flux area of the law.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) chastised Walgreens for bowing to the pressure and canceled a a $54 million contract with the company.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arizona-republicans-legalize-murder_n_65e22084e4b0d2a247594783,Arizona Republicans Push Law That Critics Say Legalizes Murder,roque planas,3/1/2024,"Arizona Republicans are rallying behind a proposed law that critics say would amount to legalizing murder. House Bill 2843 would expand the “Castle Doctrine,” which gives people the right to use deadly force when threatened by home intruders, to include trespassers. State Rep. Justin Heap (R) filed the bill to give people living in the border state wider latitude to use force against unauthorized migrants who cut through private property on their way into the United States. “It’s horrifying that Republicans want to allow people to legally shoot and kill migrants,” state Rep. Analise Ortiz (D) told HuffPost. “Especially when so many folks are seeking their legal right to seek asylum in the United States. It’s just wrong.” The bill stems from a decadeslong trend in conservative state legislatures to expand the right of individuals to protect themselves with firearms. Such “stand your ground” laws typically remove the obligation for people to retreat to safety when they feel threatened, and extend immunity to prosecution for those who commit a homicide in cases where they believe they face an attack. Heap said at a Judiciary Committee hearing last month that he filed the bill over concerns brought by local prosecutors who were “having issues in the case where you have farmers and ranchers who want to trespass someone from their property,” by which he meant “remove someone from their property.” He noted concerns about migrants and human traffickers specifically. But Heap’s proposal is more unique than that description suggests, according to Lindsay Nichols, policy director for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Castle Doctrine laws, including Arizona’s, have not historically applied to areas outside a person’s home. “It’s a particularly alarming instance of this trend,” Nichols said. “The prospect of a world in which you can be executed without due process for accidentally stepping onto someone’s property is terrifying.” Dustin Williamson, the regional legal director at Everytown for Gun Safety, said Arizona’s expansive gun laws would make the proposal even more dangerous. “Arizona already has a dangerous Shoot First law on the books that allows people to shoot and kill others even if they know they can easily and safely walk away from a confrontation,” Williamson wrote in an email. “To prevent senseless acts of gun violence, lawmakers in the state should reject any attempt to broaden its self-defense laws to further encourage armed vigilantism.” The Arizona House of Representatives passed the bill last week on partisan lines and it has favorable odds in the Senate. Republicans control both houses of the Arizona legislature with slim majorities. The bill is unlikely to become law. Observers expect the state’s Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, to veto the bill if both bodies pass it. Hobbs’ office did not respond to a request for comment. Still, opponents say the proposal harnesses hostility over the hot-button issue of immigration to legalize activity that today constitutes murder. The real-life example of rancher George Alan Kelly is playing out in state court as Heap’s bill moves through the legislature. Heap did not cite the case specifically when explaining his proposal, but Kelly has made headlines for allegedly shooting into a group of unauthorized migrants traveling across his ranch. Prosecutors portray Kelly’s case as far from one of self-defense, however. Kelly, 75, has contended that a man within a group of migrants traveling along his property wielded a semi-automatic rifle. But the criminal complaint against Kelly says that no one within the group possessed a weapon and that Kelly fired without warning from a hidden position. Kelly changed his story about why he opened fire several times. He told sheriff’s deputies that he did not know how Gabriel Cuen Butimea, 48, died and had backed away from the body when he found it, according to court records.

But the rich economies cumulatively responsible for much of the carbon in the atmosphere saw their average emissions drop down to 1973 levels, driven largely by a transition away from fossil fuel power plants. For the first time in history, zero-carbon sources of energy generated half the total electricity in the world’s advanced economies, according to new data from the Paris-based energy watchdog. Renewables like wind and solar accounted for an “unprecedented” 34% share of power generation. Nuclear power, which a separate IEA report last month forecast would hit record global production next year, made up the rest. Nearly two-thirds of the decline came from the electricity sector. Emissions fell even as the overall gross domestic product of the world’s advanced economies grew by nearly 2%, making 2023’s drop in greenhouse gas the largest percentage decrease outside of an economic recession. Despite a resurgence in countries like Germany that shut down their nuclear power stations, meanwhile, coal’s share of the electricity mix across the rich world plummeted to what the IEA called “an historic low” of 17%. Outside of the Great Depression, demand for coal fell to its lowest level since 1900. The new IEA data came out a day after the Biden administration announced plans to loosen forthcoming rules on planet-heating pollution from power plants, providing a carve-out for existing natural gas-burning facilities, which now generate the bulk of U.S. electricity. The Environmental Protection Agency promised to pursue a “stronger, more durable approach” with a different regulation. Electricity demand in the U.S. is growing for the first time since the 1990s, as the grid takes on powering not just electric cars and appliances, but data centers as well. The landmark climate laws President Joe Biden passed in 2022 are funneling billions toward renewables, new transmission lines, and battery factories. The first climate legislation likely to pass Congress this year, meanwhile, is a bill to make permitting and building new types of nuclear reactors easier.

Michael Meyden, 57, is facing three counts of causing another to ingest a controlled substance, application of a Schedule 4 controlled substance to another, and delivery of a controlled substance to a minor after detectives determined he allegedly exposed his daughter’s friends to a prescription drug, police said. Staff at a local hospital had notified police on Aug. 26, 2023, of three 12-year-old girls whose bloodstreams contained the drug. Meyden pleaded not guilty to all charges at his arraignment on Wednesday, according to The Oregonian. Police alleged that Meyden had laced mango smoothies with benzodiazepines, depressants that slow the nervous system, and served them to the three girls at his daughter’s sleepover, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by HuffPost. Detectives noted that when they interviewed the girls on the morning after the sleepover, one of them “walked slowly and used the assistance of her mother for balance, her eyelids were heavy, and she spoke slowly.” The girls told police that Meyden had been “very involved with their activities during the sleepover, ” that night and made them smoothies that had “tiny white chunks throughout and sprinkled on top,” the affidavit said. “Mr. Meyden was adamant that the girls drink out of their own cups,” detectives said. One of the girls told police she didn’t like the smoothie, but Meyden allegedly insisted she drink it and made her a second one to try. Police also alleged that after the girls went to bed in the home’s basement, Meyden visited them throughout the night to check if they were awake by waving his hands or putting his finger under their noses. One girl recounted that Meyden moved her body, but she “remained awake in fear that Mr. Meyden was going to do something. When Meyden left the room, one girl sent a text to her mom for help at around 1:43 a.m. “Mom please pick me up and say I had a family emergency. I don’t feel safe. I might not respond but please come get me (crying emoji), Please. Please pick up. Please. PLEASE!!” the message read. One girl called and texted several friends requesting a ride, police said in the affidavit. And one girl texted a family friend that “she felt unsafe because of her friend’s dad.” She wrote that she was “scared” and that the father “kept moving us away from each other but kept doing tests to make sure we weren’t awake.” She added that one friend woke up “for like 2 seconds,” but “kept her eyes closed and didn’t talk.” The family friend agreed to pick the girl up. It was not clear from the affidavit whether all the requests for help were sent by the same girl, or if multiple girls were texting for help. Meyden allegedly returned to the basement to check if the girls were asleep several times. The family friend who had received the message came to pick her up in the middle of the night. When the family friend arrived, she was greeted by Meyden, who she later told police “seemed drunk” after noticing his speech was slurred, according to the affidavit. The family friend told Meyden the girl had a family emergency and he allowed her to leave. The family friend drove the girl home, where she woke up the child’s parents so they could contact the other parents and tell them to pick the girls up. When the other parents arrived at Meyden’s home, they were met with resistance from the host when told they were taking the girls home, according to the document. Meyden allegedly said the girls were asleep and “insisted” the parents come back later. In an email to HuffPost on Friday, defense attorney Mark Cogan emphasized that Meyden is “presumed innocent,” adding, “We have not seen the evidence.” According to Cogan, the grand jury that indicted Meyden “convened in secret without a judge or defense counsel present.” “We ask everyone to withhold judgment until all the facts are known,” Cogan stated in the email.

The moment I can sense spring on the horizon, my mood gets better and my shopping cart fills up with warm-weather outfits. This year is no exception, and my hyperfixation clothing item is one that has seemed to captivate the internet, as well: The Snug Crop Tank from Old Navy. I’ve seen this top all over my TikTok For You Page ― and I totally understand the hype now that I have two of my own. And lucky for you, they’re on sale right now at a shockingly affordable price. This tank features a high, crewcut neckline and ribbed fabric. It’s form-fitting without being suffocating. If you hate crop tops, don’t let the name fool you: This isn’t a midriff bearing shirt. It skims the top of your waistband for an effortless look, but its stretchy fabric also allows you to tuck it in if you want to appear more polished. It works perfectly as a layering piece, but it’s high-quality enough to wear alone. Talk about versatility. Best of all, like most of Old Navy’s clothing items, it comes in a range of sizes and lengths. This tank starts at an XS and goes up to a XXL; it also comes in petite and tall. I’m 6 feet tall and take a size large normally, and a large tall worked perfectly for me. I’m a neutral girl, so I own it in black and white, but they also come in a bunch of other colors like olive, peach, red and more. While I wouldn’t normally let TikTok influence me so easily, I’m glad it did in this case. Now all we need is for the temperature outside to be fully influenced, too.

The “Pose” star and his sister, Mary Martha Ford, shared their loss Thursday on Instagram with a tribute. While the post included a carousel of happy family photos, it acknowledged just how devastated the siblings are at losing their mom at 79. “With heavy hearts we announce the passing of our loving mother, Cloerinda Jean Johnson Porter-Ford,” it read. “We were right behind her when she took her last breath, wrapped in our arms. Mommy lived life to the fullest despite physical limitations pressed upon her.” “She was the personification of true Christianity and her unconditional love is a template that the world could benefit from employing,” the post, which both siblings shared on their individual Instagram pages, continued. “Her example is what we continue to strive for.” Porter shared in his memoir “Unprotected” (2021) that his mother “was born with a degenerative neurological condition” that “no doctor or specialist has been able to name.” She initially relied on a walker but was relegated to a wheelchair in her later years. “We are heartbroken she is no longer here with us, but find solace that her suffering has ended,” he wrote Thursday. “Her fight was long and hard—she did it with grace and integrity. Mommy will remain forever in our hearts as she continues to guide us from above.” Porter was very close to his mother but had a difficult childhood. He told The Hollywood Reporter in 2021 that he was sexually abused by his stepfather as a child and came out as gay at 16 “in the middle of the AIDS crisis” — which wasn’t easy for him or his religious mom.

The president announced the move after at least 115 Palestinians were killed and more than 750 others were injured, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, on Thursday when witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire as huge crowds raced to pull goods off an aid convoy. Biden said the airdrops would begin soon and that the United States was looking into additional ways to facilitate getting badly needed aid into the war-battered territory to ease the suffering of Palestinians. “In the coming days we’re going to join with our friends in Jordan and others who are providing airdrops of additional food and supplies” and will “seek to open up other avenues in, including possibly a marine corridor,” Biden said. I condemn Thursday’s incident in Gaza in which more than 100 people were reportedly killed or injured while seeking life-saving aid.The desperate civilians in Gaza need urgent help, including those in the north where the @UN has not been able to deliver aid in more than a week. Access to food is a human right.As the hostilities in Gaza continue to escalate - access to food is scarce with reports of children starving to death.Humanitarian organizations must have unhindered access to people in need wherever they are. pic.twitter.com/2ZPdaqHRrg The president twice referred to airdrops to help Ukraine, but White House officials clarified that he was referring to Gaza. Israel said many of the dead were trampled in a stampede linked to the chaos and that its troops fired at some in the crowd who they believed moved toward them in a threatening way. The Israeli government has said it is investigating the matter. The head of a Gaza City hospital that treated some of those wounded said Friday that more than 80% had been struck by gunfire. Biden made his announcement while hosting Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni at the White house. “Aid flowing to Gaza is nowhere nearly enough,” Biden said. “Now, it’s nowhere nearly enough. Innocent lives are on the line and children’s lives are on the line. We won’t stand by until we get more aid in there. We should be getting hundreds of trucks in, not just several.” The White House, State Department and Pentagon had been weighing the merits of U.S. military airdrops of assistance for several months, but had held off due to concerns that the method is inefficient, has no way of ensuring the aid gets to civilians in need and cannot make up for overland aid deliveries.

The incident on Thursday appeared to tip the balance and push Biden to approve airdrops. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said that airdrops are difficult operations, but the acute need for aid in Gaza informed the president’s decision. He stressed that ground routes will be continued to be used to get aid into Gaza, and that the airdrops are a supplemental effort. “It’s not the kind of thing you want to do in a heartbeat. you want to think it through carefully,” Kirby said. He added, “There’s few military operations that are more complicated than humanitarian assistance airdrops” Pressure has been mounting for Biden to move more aggressively to ease Palestinian suffering, including from lawmakers of Biden’s Democratic Party. Even before Thursday’s deaths, Sen. Jack Reed, chairman of the Senate’s Armed Services Committee, wrote Biden this week to urge that the administration deploy a military hospital ship and support units to help treat Gaza’s wounded and open a sea route to Gaza for delivery of humanitarian aid. “Yesterday’s event, I think, underscores the need to find more creative ways of getting assistance in faster and at greater scale,” Kirby said. Egypt, France, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates have already used airdrops to get aid into Gaza since the conflict started in October. Biden in his visit with Meloni at the White House also sought to assure European leaders that the U.S. remains behind Ukraine even as he’s been unable to win passage of a supplemental foreign aid package that includes $60 billion for Ukraine in addition to $35 billion for Israel and Taiwan. The legislation has passed the Senate, but Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to put it up for a vote in the House. Ahead of Meloni’s visit, White House officials said they don’t have good answers for allies about finding an end to the impasse with House Republicans and reopening the American spigot of aid to Kyiv that’s badly needed as Ukraine tries to fend off Russia’s invasion. Biden, along with top Democrats and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, strongly urged Johnson during a White House meeting this week to take up the foreign aid package, but Johnson responded by saying that Congress “must take care of America’s needs first.” The leaders also discussed efforts by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar to broker an extended cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, Italy’s priorities for a G7 presidency, migrant flows into Italy from North Africa, and their countries’ China policies. Biden said earlier this week that a cease-fire deal could be reached by Monday, before tempering his optimism after Thursday’s incident. But on Friday, Biden said he still held hope that a deal can be struck, possibly before Muslims around the globe begin observing the holy month of Ramadan that is expected to begin on March 10. “I’m still hoping so,” Biden told reporters on Friday evening before departing the White House for the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland. “We’re still working real hard at it. We’re not there yet.” Meloni said solving the humanitarian crisis in Gaza was Italy’s top priority. “We need to coordinate our actions to avoid an escalation, and this regard we fully support the U.S. mediation efforts,” she said. ___ Associated Press writers Colleen Barry in Milan, Seung Min Kim, Ellen Knickmeyer and Will Weissert contributed reporting.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-supreme-court-jan-6-trial_n_65e1ef59e4b013678e150311,‘Bush v. Gore 2.0’: Fears Grow Supreme Court Will Bail Donald Trump Out,igor bobic,3/1/2024,"WASHINGTON ― The Supreme Court’s decision this week to hear arguments over Donald Trump’s claims for immunity from prosecution is fanning fears that the former president won’t go to trial before the November presidential election and could escape accountability for his efforts to overturn his loss in the last one. The 6-3 conservative high court could have simply declined Trump’s request for a hearing, letting stand a prior unanimous D.C. appeals court decision that flatly rejected his argument that everything he did related to Jan. 6, 2021 he did as an “official act” as president. Instead, the justices agreed to take up the case and set oral arguments for April 22 ― a two-month delay that will prevent Trump’s trial from starting in May, as had been previously scheduled. How long the court takes to reach a verdict after that hearing and whether it decides it needs to hear more information from the appeals court could delay the start of Trump’s trial even further. The delays in the case are starting to add up, unnerving Trump critics who fear that if his federal prosecutions stretch past November’s election and he manages to win another White House term, he could order the Department of Justice to put them on hold or simply dismiss them. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) called the case “a ginormous self-test” for the Supreme Court, invoking its controversial Bush v. Gore decision that ensured George W. Bush’s victory in the 2000 presidential election over then-Vice President Al Gore. “If they quickly rule 9-0 that there is not the kind of presidential immunity that Trump asserts, then it will be all to the good,” Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told HuffPost. “If not, then it stands to be Bush v Gore 2.0 with them inserting themselves into a presidential race.” “Delaying the January 6 trial suppresses critical evidence that Americans deserve to hear,” former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) wrote Friday on X, formerly Twitter. “Donald Trump attempted to overturn an election and seize power. Our justice system must be able to bring him to trial before the next election. SCOTUS should decide this case promptly.” “The hope of a trial in the Jan 6 case before the election is fading fast. Very fast,” former U.S. attorney and CNN commentator Preet Bharara added. Of course, the Supreme Court may move more quickly than expected. A ruling affirming the appeals court decision in May, for example, would allow jury selection for Trump’s trial in D.C. to begin sometime in the fall. It’s not clear, however, that a trial would conclude before the Nov. 5 presidential election or even January 2025, when the winner of the 2024 presidential election is due to be sworn in. The justices also have yet to rule in a separate case seeking to take Trump off the ballot in the state of Colorado due to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The oral arguments over that question, which the court is very likely to reject, took place nearly a month ago. “By not expediting this case, the MAGA Supreme Court once again proves they’re not there to defend the law—they’re there to protect Trump,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote Friday of the Jan. 6 election subversion case. “The Court has sped up trials when it wants—but not in this case,” he added. Trump appointed three justices to the court: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Comey Barrett. Two other justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, are also reliable conservative votes who have ruled in his favor in past cases. Thomas has rejected calls to recuse himself in the Jan. 6 case — even though his wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, was involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Republicans are counting on the court to side with Trump and make the whole thing go away. “This is an abuse of power and a persecution of President Trump, and I very much hope the Supreme Court puts a stop to it,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said during a NewsNation interview this week. Trump is charged with conspiring to defraud the United States; obstructing an official proceeding; conspiring to obstruct an official proceeding; and conspiring to deprive millions of Americans the right to have their votes counted. If convicted, he could face decades in prison. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith on Thursday proposed a July 8 trial start date in a separate federal criminal case over former President Trump’s handling of classified documents. But the former president’s attorneys argued that “a fair trial cannot be held until after the 2024 Presidential election is concluded.” However, the DOJ said Friday that Trump’s criminal trials could take place near the election and that they would not be in violation of a rule that prevents the department from engaging in activities that could influence an election 60 days before it takes place. The government told U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge who is presiding over his classified documents case in Florida, that the rule doesn’t apply to cases that have already been brought.

(Watch the video below.) The high court decided to rule on Trump’s assertion that, as president, he was exempt from prosecution for his actions around the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. The court set arguments for late April, delaying the federal trial until at least summer. “Some people are blaming the Supreme Court for dragging it out on purpose to help Trump,” the “Tonight Show” host said. Then, Fallon imagined how the justices would respond. The speed of the reactions suspiciously corresponded to whether the judge was considered liberal or conservative. According to Fallon, Obama-nominated Justice Elena Kagan said, “We should be acting faster to move this along.” On the other end, Trump-nominated Neil Gorsuch said, “We... are ... going ... as ... fast .. as ... we c .... a.... n.” Check out the rest of the bit at 2:05: We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The event promised “captivating” live performances, “extraordinary props, oversized lollipops, and a paradise of sweet treats and interactive experiences,” according to the event’s website. Last weekend’s attendees got anything but that. Instead of the 45-minutes-to-an-hour experience promised on the website, Stuart Sinclair, a father who brought his children to the event, said it “took two minutes to get through to then see a queue of people surrounding the guy running it complaining,” according to his Facebook post. Instead of “a paradise of sweet treats and interactive experiences,” families and children said they got a mostly empty warehouse with scattered decorations and the scarce offerings of a quarter-cup of lemonade. Some attendees were so unhappy that they called the police. The Willy Wonka actors themselves have since said they got “AI-generated gibberish” scripts, and that they feel “really embarrassed” by the jobs they were hired for. Since the event, a Facebook group called “House of Illuminati Scam” has been created for disappointed participants seeking a refund. In a since-deleted social media statement, the event company House of Illuminati, which organized the Chocolate Experience, said it would “be giving full refunds to each and every person that purchased tickets.” Hopefully, you will never have to pay £35, or about $44, for your child to reportedly get three jelly beans from a disenchanted Oompa Loompa actor. But at some point in your life, you very well might buy tickets for an event that ends up being wildly different from what it advertised. Here are the warning signs that the event you bought tickets for might not be what it claims ― and what you need to prove so you can fight for a refund. On the Willy’s Chocolate Experience website, there are missing apostrophes and garbled terms like “cartchy tuns” and “catgacating.” Most organizations take the time to proofread what they advertise. “Scammers often have poorly designed websites, numerous spelling errors, or a lack of social media presence, which seemed to be a red flag for the Wonka experience,” said Mike Lemberger, Visa’s regional risk officer for North America. Bad actors take advantage of your enthusiasm for the popular movie or artist you want to see, so that you don’t look more closely at the details. The House of Illuminati event acknowledged on its website that its event was “in no way related to the Wonka franchise,” which in hindsight feels like a bad sign. If the event is not an authorized retailer for merchandise or is not officially associated with the franchise, that should set off alarm bells, said Melanie McGovern, director of public relations and social media for Better Business Bureau, a nonprofit that tracks bad advertisements and customer complaints in North America. “You don’t know what to expect if it’s not affiliated with the company that licenses and owns that image,” McGovern said. “You might not be getting what you think you’re getting. So that is definitely a red flag, and it’s very important for people to scroll to the bottom of a lot of websites to see all the information to make sure that it is what it says.” Lemberger said few or zero reviews can be a sign that the event is a scam. If you still want to buy tickets from a business that has little social media presence and is a first-time organizer of the event, call the organizer and the promotional company about your concerns, McGovern suggested. “Reputable companies will always answer your questions,” McGovern said. “They’ll work hard to earn your trust.” Try to find out if there have been any other complaints about events that the company has run. “If you see the same complaint over and over again, that could give you a pause to maybe say ‘I might not want to do this,’ or ‘I’m going to do it anyway,’” McGovern said. And double-check the name of the event and the organizers behind it. McGovern cited the example of how consumers complained to Better Business Bureau in 2021 about buying tickets for “Van Gogh: The Immersive Experience” ― an event that used virtual reality headsets ― thinking it was “Immersive Van Gogh,” a large-scale projected installation. When you buy a ticket for an event, you want to know what will happen if the venue suddenly changes, if weather conditions shift, or if a performer drops out. The terms and conditions on the event’s website will typically outline that information. “If the event details are vague, or if the organizer cannot provide specific information about the venue, performers, or event schedule, it might be a scam,” Lemberger said. It’s frustrating to have an underwhelming time at an event you paid significant money for. But there’s a difference between a disappointing experience and a potentially misleading one that can get you a refund. For Lemberger, the difference is that a disappointing experience still delivered its product or service as promised by the organizer. “On the other hand, a scam is something that is intentionally misleading in an effort to make money,” he said. If you believe you’re dealing with the latter category, here are actions you can take: “You should always reach out to the company where you made the purchase,” Lemberger said. “They may have policies in place to handle such situations and can handle it for you directly.” If the company refuses to provide a refund, you can dispute the charge with your bank. Save any receipts as proof of purchase and attendance, and take screenshots of what you believe the organizer sold as false advertisement to help your claim. “Customers will need to provide documentation they have around the situation, including all receipts, emails, photos and screenshots related to the purchase,” Lemberger said. “When you dispute something with your bank, your bank [will] work with the merchant’s bank to investigate the situation and side with the appropriate party.” But if you bought the tickets with cash or a debit card, you might be out of luck. Unless the event’s refund policy states otherwise, you probably will not be able to get your money back with cash or a debit card, McGovern said. If you’re in the U.S. or Canada, you can use Better Business Bureau to help you escalate your complaint and present it to the company on your behalf. “Then the company would come back with, ‘OK, we’ll refund your money,’ or ‘According to our terms and conditions, there are no refunds,’ and then we would go back to the consumer,” McGovern said. You can also file a consumer complaint to your local attorney general’s office. Ultimately, it takes extra homework and research to avoid getting fooled. Lemberger noted that in the case of the Willy Wonka-themed event, the illustrations that appear AI-generated created a false impression of what the event would be like.

The talk show co-host revealed during a segment of “The View” on Thursday that she has purposefully shared false stories in the past to see who was gossiping. Following a discussion about gossip, co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin had mentioned the method of planting false information to expose a gossiper when Goldberg chimed in that she was all too familiar with that approach. “We have done that, we have done that,” she said while looking at fellow veteran co-host Joy Behar. “We did that to see who was talking.” Behar, who initially looked confused by Goldberg’s remarks, appeared to recall the situation moments later. “Oh,” she said, seemingly trying to keep a straight face. Goldberg and Behar didn’t divulge further, and it’s unclear whether the EGOT winner was talking about a former on-set member, ex co-host or someone who currently works on the show. Behar said she was “sworn to secrecy” when Farah Griffin and another co-host, Sunny Hostin, pressed the two to spill more details. (See a clip of the entire discussion below.) Some of “The View” co-hosts have played coy about spilling the tea in another recent episode. Last month, Hostin and Behar were apparently passing notes to each other while taping the talk show. Goldberg was discussing a story about a wedding when she abruptly paused and glanced at her colleagues. “You guys are passing notes on television?” Farah Griffin asked. Goldberg then suggested that the two share their notes “with the rest of the class,” but they refused. Hostin admitted that her conversations with Behar are often “inappropriate.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The outspoken Oscar winner recently appeared in “The Greatest Love Story Never Told,” a documentary about Lopez making her latest album, “This Is Me…Now,” and its accompanying music film. Fonda shared “concern” about Lopez’s rekindled relationship with Ben Affleck. The newlyweds famously dated previously in the early 2000s, but endured so much tabloid fodder and attention that “Bennifer” broke off their engagement in 2004. Fonda, who starred opposite Lopez in “Monster-in-Law” (2005), is now worried about a potential repeat. “First of all, I want you to know that — I don’t entirely know why — but I feel invested in you and Ben, and I really, really, really want this to work,” she tells Lopez over the phone in a scene from the documentary, which premiered Tuesday on Prime Video. “However, this is my concern,” Fonda says. “Like, it feels too much like you’re trying to prove something instead of just living it. You know, every other photograph is the two of you kissing, the two of you hugging.” While Lopez argues they’re just “living our life,” the film does probe their contrasting views on the spotlight. It reveals Affleck gifted her a book for Christmas in 2021 of every letter and email they ever exchanged, only for Lopez to reportedly share them with others. Affleck had titled the book, “The Greatest Love Story Never Told,” inspiring the name of the film. “I had a very firm sense of boundaries initially around the press, while Jen I don’t think objected to it in the way I did,” he says in the film. “I very much did object to it. Getting back together, I said, ‘Listen, one of the things I don’t want is a relationship on social media.’” “Then I sort of realized it’s not a fair thing to ask,” Affleck continues. “It’s sort of like, you’re gonna marry a boat captain and you go, ‘Well, I don’t like the water.’ We’re just two people with different kinds of approaches trying to learn to compromise.” Lopez, who recently clarified what caused their first relationship to falter, rekindled their romance in April 2021. The couple got engaged one year later and eloped in July 2022, but held a more traditional wedding in Georgia at the end of that summer. Lopez explained in a new Apple Music interview with Zane Lowe that “it didn’t feel like we were going to make it” the first time around — and they simply weren’t “mature” enough at the time.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cdc-drops-5-day-isolation-time-for-covid-19_n_65e21988e4b0d2a24759403f,CDC Officially Drops 5-Day Isolation Time For COVID-19,mike stobbe,3/1/2024,"NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who test positive for COVID-19 no longer need to stay in isolation for five days, U.S. health officials announced Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its longstanding guidance, saying that people can return to work or regular activities if their symptoms are mild and improving and it’s been a day since they’ve had a fever. The change comes at a time when COVID-19 is no longer the public health menace it once was. It dropped from being the nation’s third leading cause of death early in the pandemic to 10th last year. Most people have some degree of immunity to the coronavirus from past vaccinations or from infections. And many people are not following the five-day isolation guidance anyway, some experts say. “Our goal here is to continue to protect those at risk for severe illness while also reassuring folks that these recommendation are simple, clear, easy to understand, and can be followed,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the CDC’s director. However, some experts worry that the change may increase the risk of infection for those people who are more vulnerable to developing severe illness. WHY ARE THE GUIDELINES CHANGING? COVID-19 is not causing as many hospitalizations and deaths as it did in the first years of the pandemic. The change is an effort to streamline recommendations so they are similar to longstanding recommendations for flu and other respiratory viruses. Many people with a runny nose, cough or other symptoms aren’t testing to distinguish whether it’s COVID-19, flu, or something else, officials say. This may not be as stringent, but also emphasizes that all people with respiratory symptoms should stay home while they are sick, said Dr. David Margolius, the head of Cleveland’s health department. There’s been no recent change in the science of how long people with COVID-19 are likely contagious, said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. “What has changed is how much COVID is harming us as a population,” Nuzzo said. WHAT ARE THE NEW GUIDELINES? If you have symptoms, stay home until your symptoms are mild and improving and it’s been a day since you’ve had a fever. But then you can remain cautious by wearing a mask and keeping a distance from others. There is no change to guidelines for nursing homes and health care facilities, however. The agency is emphasizing that people should still try to prevent infections in the first place, by getting vaccinated, washing their hands, and taking steps to bring in more outdoor fresh air. CDC recommends adults ages 65 years and over receive an additional updated 2023-2024 #COVID19 vaccine dose, which can provide additional protection to older adults, who are at highest risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Read the full release here: https://t.co/9x0OvqbHhl pic.twitter.com/9fki2Y606Z IS THERE OPPOSITION TO THIS CHANGE? Yes, and even some who understand the rationale for the change have concerns. “My biggest worry in all of this is that employers will take this change in guidance to require employees to come back to work ... before they are ready to, before they feel well enough, and before they are not likely to pose harm to their co-workers,” Nuzzo said. IS THIS THE FIRST CHANGE FOR COVID-19 ISOLATION GUIDELINES? No. The CDC originally advised 10 days of isolation, but in late 2021 cut it to five days for Americans who catch the coronavirus and have no symptoms or only brief illnesses. Under that guidance, isolation only ends if a person has been fever-free for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications and if other symptoms are resolving. At the time, agency officials said the changes were in keeping with evidence that people with the coronavirus were most infectious in the two days before and three days after symptoms develop. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alexander-smirnov-biden-impeachment_n_65e1f193e4b005b858341e98,Republicans Say FBI ‘Motivated By Politics’ In Case Of Lying Informant,arthur delaney,3/1/2024,"WASHINGTON ― Republicans in Congress want answers from the FBI after basing their impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden largely on faulty information from an FBI informant. In a letter to FBI director Christopher Wray on Friday, Republicans asked for documents showing how they vetted the informant and how much they paid him ― and suggested the Justice Department arrested him to protect the Biden family. Federal prosecutors revealed the informant to be a dual U.S.-Irsaeli citizen named Alexander Smirnov last month when it announced charges against him for fabricating a bribery allegation against the president. Republicans publicized Smirnov’s bribery allegation despite Justice Department warnings that the raw material had not been vetted. Still, the department vouched for Smirnov, saying he’d been a trusted informant on the FBI payroll for years. “Only after Mr. Smirnov reported that President Joe Biden accepted a bribe from a Ukrainian energy company in exchange for using his official position to oust the Ukrainian Prosecutor General did the FBI apparently take a hard look at this CHS,” House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said in a letter to Wray. “This episode is just another example of how the FBI is motivated by politics,” Comer and Jordan wrote. Senior U.S. diplomatic officials have maintained for years that when Biden was vice president, his push for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor reflected U.S. policy and had not been done as a favor to his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Smirnov’s bribe claim, memorialized in an FBI document known as an FD-1023 form, reinvigorated Republican allegations that ousting the prosecutor reflected corruption by the Bidens. The revelation that Smirnov made it up dealt a death blow to their impeachment inquiry. The indictment revealed that investigators figured out Smirnov was lying when they checked his story after Republicans made his bribe bluff public. Prosecutors said he made up this allegation in 2020 because he opposed Biden’s bid for the presidency. Comer and Jordan insinuated the Justice Department was protecting the Biden family and demanded information about Smirnov as part of their impeachment inquiry.

Candidate With KKK Ties Seen Giving Nazi Salute,sebastian murdock,3/1/2024,"The Missouri Republican Party said it is working to remove a Republican candidate for governor after it was revealed he has ties with the Ku Klux Klan, and was seen in a photo giving a Nazi salute while standing in front of a burning cross. Darrell Leon McClanahan III “filed for Governor as a Republican despite his affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan, which fundamentally contradicts our party’s values and platform,” the Missouri GOP said in a statement Thursday. “We have begun the process of having Mr. McClanahan removed from the ballot as a Republican candidate,” the statement added. In a photo first uncovered by the Anti-Defamation League in 2022, McClanahan can be seen standing next to a robed member of the KKK in a 2019 photo, giving a Nazi salute with the member while a cross burns behind them. McClanahan, who has attempted to run for multiple seats of office including a failed bid for U.S. Senate, said in a failed lawsuit against the ADL last year that the cross-burning was instead a “Christian Identity Cross lighting ceremony,” the Riverfront Times reported. The lawsuit added that McClanahan is not a full member of the KKK, but instead has been “provided an Honorary 1-year membership” to the group. In its statement, the Missouri GOP said they “condemn any association with hate groups and are taking immediate action to rectify this situation.” In a post on X, McClanahan said the “Missouri GOP knew exactly who I am” and called them a “bunch of Anti-White hypocrites.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The “Interstellar” actor let her social media followers in on a hilarious encounter with designer Donatella Versace last week, when Hathaway attended the luxury fashion label’s Fall/Winter 2024 show last week. For the occasion, the “Princess Diaries” star donned a skintight red leather Versace dress. And while it looked amazing, the actor struggled to get seated in the mini dress while posing for a picture with Versace: obsessed with this video of anne reacting to the versace dress she is wearing! the corset wont let her sit properly lols pic.twitter.com/mCZRAJySSG “I just want to respect the integrity of the corset,” Hathaway says in a video of the moment, bursting into a fit of giggles as she lies flat on her back. “Help her, she can’t move!” Versace says as people in the background continued to laugh. “No! I’m fine, I’m fine,” Hathaway insisted, as she gamely struggled to pose. “It’s for Donatella! I’m so happy. Thank you for having me to Milan.” Hathaway poked fun at the moment by posting a video of the incident in a carousel of photos and videos last week. “Breathing? 😎 Sitting? 🙃 😂 love you @donatella_versace,” she captioned the post. It looks like Hathaway was eventually able to find a way to sit down, at least according to photos from the Versace show: While at the show, Hathaway encountered Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of Vogue and the reported inspiration for Meryl Streep’s menacing, complicated character in “The Devil Wears Prada,” which Hathaway also starred in.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cordless-water-flosser-sale_l_65e2006ee4b013678e151023,Waterpik's Extremely Portable Water Flosser Is At Its Lowest Price Of The Year,emily ruane,3/1/2024,"HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Water flossers are a popular dental hygiene tool for many — and Waterpik is one of the most recognizable names in the game. The brand’s American Dental Association-approved tools are beloved by reviewers for their powerful plaque-busting abilities, but some of the more heavy-duty models can occupy more real estate, making them inconvenient for smaller bathrooms and unfeasible for traveling. Luckily, there’s a streamlined option available at Amazon right now — Waterpik’s cordless “Pearl” model — for less than $50, which is almost 30% off its typical price of $69.99. It has a 4.4-star rating on Amazon and 8,751 reviewers have given the device five stars. While most of Waterpik’s cordless water flosser are created fairly equal, this pared-down option makes a really smart buy for anyone who wants Waterpik’s powerful pressurized cleaning stream but doesn’t need a lot of bells and whistles. Based on the comparison chart on Waterpik’s website, the Pearl’s main difference from the brand’s normally twice-as-expensive “Advanced” model is that it lacks an LED charging light and isn’t safe for use in the shower, which don’t feel like dealbreakers to us. The Advanced offers three setting as opposed to the Pearl’s dual settings, but the Pearl pumps out 1,450 pulses per minute, which is more than the Advanced. (If any of these are dealbreakers, know that the Advanced model is priced at about $80 on Amazon right now.) What the Pearl does offer is a promise to banish 99.99% percent of plaque bacteria from your — ahem — pearly whites with an effectiveness rate double that of dental floss. It comes with four interchangeable tips and a 7-ounce water reservoir for up to 45 seconds of continuous cleaning, and the higher-capacity battery life will power the device for a maximum of 36 minutes. It also has global voltage compatibility and a compact 3-inch footprint, so you can whisk it in into your suitcase on your next trip without a second thought (as many of the reviewers below have done). See what some Amazon reviewers had to say about this compact device, or just scroll all the way down to get one for yourself during this dazzling sale. “My dentist recommended this product and I’m glad I purchased it. Works well, easy to use, and doesn’t take up too much room in my suitcase when I travel.” — Amazon Customer “I have braces and at times even with orthodontic flossers, it is hard to get in between my teeth or the brackets. This water flosser does the trick. The lowest setting is perfect for cleaning all of the small seeds or other food debris that gets caught in my brackets or between my teeth. It’s portable and cordless and the charge lasts a long time. I just fill it with warm water and it does a great job. One cycle will usually get all the debris loose but on occasion, I fill the reservoir again and give my mouth a second cleaning before brushing. Highly recommend.” — Patti Mcclure “My teeth are very close together which makes standard flossing difficult. I love this water pick as it is easy to use and does a good job.” — Clarence Thistle “This waterpik is made for travel. It only holds 45 seconds of flossing water. You have to refill water chamber if you need more flossing. Its easy to hold and use. It has 2 power levels for the water floss.

(Watch the video below.) In a chat posted to the Oscars’ YouTube channel on Friday, the conversation got around to superheroes and “The Dark Knight,” triggering Eilish’s revelation about the film’s Batman-playing star. “A couple years ago, I had a dream about Christian Bale, and it was in a little cafe in the sunlight, and it made me realize I had to break up with my boyfriend at the time,” she said. Her brother Finneas O’Connell laughed. “No, like, genuinely. I woke up and I was like [gasps] and I came to my senses,” Eilish continued. The clip cut to another segment featuring the siblings and host Amelia Dimoldenberg, so we got no further information. But pop culture blog Uproxx guessed by the timing it could be former beau Matthew Tyler Vorce who got the heave-ho. This we cannot confirm. Eilish recently revealed that she is attracted to women. The “bad guy” singer and her brother, who won a best-song Oscar in 2022 for “No Time To Die,” are nominated again for best original song, “What Was I Made For?” from “Barbie.” The two are scheduled to perform the song at the March 10 ceremony.

First, though, he exchanged some heated words with U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden. The judge admonished Brandon Fellows, a 29-year-old chimney repairman and tree cutter from Schenectady, reportedly saying he had never seen a defendant so contemptuous. “You have repeatedly made a mockery of these proceedings,” McFadden told Fellows on Thursday amid repeated interruptions, WUSA9 News reported. “There is no grand conspiracy here against you,” McFadden said, per The Washington Post. “It’s time for you to grow up!” Fellows reportedly displayed no remorse at his August trial, where he represented himself and claimed McFadden was running a “Nazi court.” His antics so alarmed the jury that they sent a note to the judge during deliberations to confirm Fellows did not have any of their personal identifying information. Fellows was convicted on one felony count and four misdemeanors relating to his participation in the riot. He continued to lash out at McFadden even after the trial, calling him a “modern day Nazi judge” in one court filing, which he signed as “your favorite Political prisoner.” Prosecutors displayed images for the jury of Fellows leaning back in a chair in the office of Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) to smoke marijuana, wearing sunglasses and a fake beard made of yarn as he propped his feet on a piece of furniture. He was caught on camera climbing into the Capitol building through a broken window shortly before 3 p.m. He went on to parade a “Trump 2020” flag through the doors to the Senate Wing. His path brought him to Merkley’s office, then to the Capitol crypt, before he exited the same way he came, harassing two U.S. Capitol Police officers on his way out, according to prosecutors. He then gave an interview to CNN right outside the building. Days after the incident, prosecutors said, Fellows made social media posts indicating he was proud to have taken part in the riot. “Brought my heart joy to see these members terrified for their lives,” he wrote in one post, according to prosecutors. “For what they have done and are doing to this country I hope they live in constant fear.” In an interview with Bloomberg the week after the riot, Fellows said he believed that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former President Donald Trump, and said he had “no regrets.” (No evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election has been found.) Fellows said he got most of his news from YouTube commentators like Ben Shapiro and right-wing outlets like Newsmax, which amplified the “stolen election” conspiracy theory. His stepfather told Bloomberg that Fellows’ mind was made up: “You can’t really change it with any kind of reality.” The next four years will change America forever.

Into Hard Truth About Trump,josephine harvey,3/1/2024,"Fox News’ Jessica Tarlov swiftly cleared things up for her co-hosts on “The Five” after they accused Democrats of subverting democracy. “I love days when you guys think that you’re describing Joe Biden, but you’re actually describing Donald Trump,” the liberal commentator said. She went on: “So the person who didn’t want the American people to be able to speak in 2020 was Donald Trump. And he had his team of crackpot lawyers fan out across the country to bring forward frivolous lawsuits, when there had been recount after recount, to make sure that the American public was disenfranchised.” Jessica: I love days when you guys think that you are describing Joe Biden but you are actually describing Donald Trump. So the person who didn't want the American people to be able to speak in 2020 was Donald Trump… pic.twitter.com/vghpl2EEiF She was responding to her conservative colleagues, who had spent minutes bashing Democrats and the media for criticizing the Supreme Court’s decision to review Trump’s presidential immunity claims, thereby delaying the former president’s federal election interference trial by at least several months. If the federal prosecutions against Trump are delayed beyond the November election, and Trump wins, he could order the Justice Department to drop the cases. Tarlov’s co-hosts had also slammed an Illinois judge for ruling that Trump is ineligible to appear on the state’s primary ballots under the U.S. Constitution’s so-called insurrection clause. “I mean, these people, I’m so sick of their saying he’s a threat to democracy, when everything they do is a threat to democracy,” Jeanine Pirro had said. Greg Gutfeld said the political left is trying to “compromise an election.” Jesse Watters claimed Democrats and the media were upset about the Supreme Court news because they’re “realizing that the judges of the Supreme Court aren’t on their schedule. And so they’re realizing that Joe Biden might have to win this himself.” “That’s what you saw last night, them realizing that this is going to be a free and fair election, to a certain extent,” he said. Trump is being prosecuted federally and in Georgia for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. He’s also been criminally indicted in two other cases. With his media and political allies dutifully in tow, he has cast the prosecutions as politically motivated and accused Democrats and President Joe Biden of weaponizing the justice system against him.

At the time, Preston’s recurring role as Elsbeth Tascioni on “The Good Wife” was a fan favorite, and it earned her that year’s Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. Her response to the question was, “Of course, of course. I mean, no one is asking, but of course, I would say yes if they were.” Now, more than a decade later, the show premiered on CBS Thursday night. You probably already know this because ads for CBS’ newest procedural “Elsbeth” are everywhere, and the trailer makes it clear that while Elsbeth is still her lovably quirky self, she is stepping into a new role (and bringing her many patterned tote bags with her.) Instead of being Chicago’s lawyer savant, Elsbeth has moved to New York City to serve as an outside observer of the NYPD, fulfilling the consent decree requirement in a wrongful arrest lawsuit. Basically, her job is to observe the NYPD as the NYPD investigates crimes. But anyone who watched her guest star in 14 episodes of “The Good Wife” or five episodes of “The Good Fight” knows that Elsbeth is incapable of being a silent observer because she talks a lot and sees too much. Elsbeth’s ability to appear easily distracted by what’s around her (jewelry, bookcases, dresses, wallpaper, pictures of penguins) and her unusual way of speaking and trailing off mid-thought often leads people to underestimate her, to think she’s scatter-brained or “easily confused” or “easily entertained.” She isn’t someone willing to settle for the easy answer or a convenient criminal. In Elsbeth’s second episode of “The Good Wife” in Season 1, a character asks her, “How are you ahead of the police on this?” Elsbeth replies, “They’re not looking.” Even if they were looking, they wouldn’t see the world Elsbeth does, but is that enough to carry a show? But can Elsbeth pull it off? Can she make the transition from beloved guest star to titular lead character? Elsbeth’s ability to interpret what no one else around her sees is what viewers should expect of her character in the spinoff. They should also prepare for her unique perspective to create problems, especially with Captain C.W. Wagner (Wendell Pierce) and Detective Smullen (Danny Mastrogiorgio), and for her quirkiness to obfuscate her genius, at least temporarily. At a crime scene, Elsbeth’s “weird, savant stuff” reminds me of Adrian Monk or Shawn Spencer, the lead characters in some of USA Network’s most beloved, character-driven procedurals. Like them, I expect for her brilliance and quirkiness to drive the show. Also, her legal background gives the show’s writers even more dimensions to explore, which is why “Elsbeth” has the potential to become an inspired mash-up of “Psych,” “Monk” and “Suits.” Perhaps the series might also fill the void for everyone who binged or rewatched “Suits” in 2023 and is looking for their new show (especially for those in Robert Zane withdrawal because Pierce makes an excellent NYPD captain). Elsbeth’s quirkiness — a uniqueness Preston has referred to as “cayenne pepper” — adds spice and levity to “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight.” Her character usually appears when the situation is dire — when the lawyers need a lawyer or “The Firm” needs a lawyer — and her creative problem-solving elevates the game the lawyers are always playing in such a delightful and surprising way that viewers want more. This dynamic is also incredibly successful because, in addition to Preston’s phenomenal acting, Elsbeth is the polar opposite of the lawyers around her. The seriousness of Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) and practicality of Will Gardner (Josh Charles) and graceful grit of Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) balance her in scenes and storylines. But, when Preston is leading the show, will viewers begin to want less — less moments spent obsessing about New York as if she’s never been there (long-time fans remember the antisemitic bear in Season 5 of “The Good Wife”), less scenes in which she’s obsessing over objects or violating social norms, less time spent pondering theories out loud in an incomprehensible way? Preston is an incredible actor, so I think the real question is if the material she’s working with gives Elsbeth room to be a whole person instead of a quirky cliché. This line is hard to balance, but shows such as “Monk” and “Psych” did pull it off. This gives me hope that the confines of the procedural as a genre will provide enough structure to balance Elsbeth’s zaniness. But, based on the pilot’s many moments in which Elsbeth’s idiosyncrasies feel unnatural, I think the writers have more work to do to ensure that the spinoff is not chipping away at the full character the “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight” worked so hard to develop. The secondary characters also need to be strong enough to hold this line, which, right now, it appears only Pierce is able to do. Elsbeth has to have cases interesting enough to showcase her intellectual thought processes, which I don’t think the pilot’s predictable first case gives her. The episode opens with the crime, which is a confusing choice for a pilot — at one point I paused the show to make sure I was actually watching “Elsbeth” (she doesn’t appear until six minutes into the episode) — but it is a style characteristic of procedurals. In this case, it’s not a question of “who did it.” The conflict is if Elsbeth — the only one who suspects foul play in a wealthy college student’s death — will be able to find the proof to prove it. There’s also the question of if she’s even allowed to assist in the investigation because she’s supposed to be an observer. But, as fans of Elsbeth know, she is capable of twisting definitions (and legalities) to justify her means. The difference in “Elsbeth” is the ends. “You’re not a defense lawyer anymore. The truth means putting people in jail,” Elsbeth is told at one point during the pilot. Earlier in the episode, she tells Captain Wagner that she took this job because after 30 years as a lawyer, she was tired of representing clients who she sometimes knew were guilty: “My work could be all about finding the truth and not just some better way of telling a lie for someone I was defending.” The consistently great part of Elsbeth’s appearances in both previous shows was her ability to tell better lies, to concoct better stories, to keep the people she’s representing out of legal trouble. What will her life look like when she does the opposite? How will she handle the nuances of knowing someone is guilty but finding that person likable? How will it feel when she’s responsible for putting someone in jail instead of keeping them out?

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jennifer-dulos-michelle-troconis-verdict_n_65de2542e4b005b85831e4b4,Michelle Troconis Found Guilty In Jennifer Dulos Murder Conspiracy,drusilla moorhouse,3/1/2024,"A jury Friday found a Connecticut woman guilty of conspiring with her boyfriend to kill his estranged wife, a mother of five who disappeared in 2019. Michelle Troconis, 49, was also found guilty on five other counts of tampering with physical evidence and hindering prosecution connected to Fotis Dulos’ presumed killing of Jennifer Dulos, who was last seen dropping off their five children at school on the morning of March 24, 2019. The Duloses had been in the middle of a contentious two-year divorce battle and custody dispute, which placed strict restrictions on when and how Fotis Dulos could see the couple’s children. The six-member jury deliberated for three days after hearing more than seven weeks of testimony before finding that Troconis helped Dulos create an alibi for the time of the killing, and later helped him clean up and dispose of evidence of the crime. Troconis faces up to 50 years in prison, according to the Stamford Advocate, citing Connecticut state statute. Jennifer Dulos’ body has never been found, but she was declared officially dead by a state judge in October. Fotis Dulos was facing capital murder and kidnapping charges when he died by suicide in January 2020. Troconis could be heard audibly crying as the verdicts were read, leaning against her attorney Jon Schoenhorn. After he whispered that she could sit, she put her head on the table and sobbed, with attorney Audrey Felsen rubbing her back as the jury was polled. Connecticut Superior Court Judge Kevin Randolph set a bond of $6 million, denying her defense’s request that she remain free on her original bond of $2.1 million. Troconis was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs. Jennifer Dulos’ family called the ruling a “crucial attribution of accountability” for “an unconscionable series of crimes” but emphasized that it is “not a victory” in a statement shared with HuffPost. “There can be no victory when five children are growing up without their mother,” said Carrie Luft, a close friend of Jennifer Dulos’ and the family’s spokesperson. Despite the “immense body of evidence” presented at trial, Luft pointed out that Jennifer Dulos’ body still hasn’t been found and expressed the family’s hope that the publicity from the trial will generate new leads. “In the meantime, Jennifer’s grace, goodness, and light live on through her children and through the honor of her memory,” Luft said. “This is not the trial of Fotis Dulos; this is the trial of Michelle Troconis,” Schoenhorn said in his closing argument Tuesday. But prosecutors first had to establish Fotis Dulos’ guilt to make the case that Troconis conspired with him in a murder — when the body of the victim has never been found. Randolph dealt an early blow to the prosecution when he excluded testimony of the chief medical examiner, who had previously said that Jennifer Dulos had suffered “non-survivable injuries.” Without a body to examine, Dr. James Gill based his conclusion on evidence provided by investigators, including blood in Jennifer Dulos’ garage and bloody clothes that matched her DNA. Ultimately, Randolph ruled, “the jury has heard more than Dr. Gill could testify to.” And Schoenhorn questioned whether prosecutors had proved that Dulos killed his wife. “It’s still unclear what happened,” he told jurors. “And unfortunately, this trial will not solve that puzzle. It will remain a mystery, an unfinished puzzle.” Prosecutors presented hundreds of puzzle pieces to jurors over the course of 25 days of testimony and more than 150 exhibits. On Tuesday, they had just one hour to assemble the pieces for the jury in closing arguments, which they did in two parts, before and after Schoenhorn argued for the defense. (There were no opening statements, in accordance with Connecticut state law.) Fotis Dulos’ alleged scheme required careful planning, multiple vehicles and hours of driving. Prosecutors said he drove 70 miles south from his Farmington home (where he also operated his luxury real estate development company) to Jennifer Dulos’ house in New Canaan, back up to Farmington (where he spent the afternoon at a property he was selling) and finally 10 miles to Hartford, this time driving his Ford Raptor with Troconis in the passenger seat. Based on a search warrant of Fotis’ phone, investigators were able to use location data to trace his movements that night and requested surveillance footage for the area, which was shown at trial. In the bed of the four-door pickup were numerous full black plastic garbage bags, whose numbers dwindled as he tossed them in various garbage bins along the way. Police said they were able to recover some of those bags and found inside a number of items linked to Jennifer Dulos and the crime, which were shown in court. The grim findings included a woman’s Vineyard Vines shirt and bra, both sliced down the middle and soaked in blood — later identified as Jennifer Dulos’ — a box cutter, two rain ponchos, a towel, four long zip ties, gloves and cleaning supplies that all appeared to be stained with blood. Troconis claimed that she rode with Dulos specifically to go to Starbucks and wasn’t paying attention because it was not unusual for him to dump trash from their construction projects. At one stop, surveillance footage showed both Fotis and Troconis opening their doors. While Dulos walks around the truck and places a garbage bag in the bin, Troconis is seen opening the passenger door and reaching down to the sidewalk. He then approaches her and slides what appears to be a large envelope into a sewer grate under her open door. Investigators later recovered the envelope and found inside two Connecticut license plates that had been altered with tape. The plates had been used on a car registered to Fotis. Cameras also captured him removing a “large, rigid object” consistent with a missing cargo liner from Jennifer’s Suburban and leaning it up against a building. It was never recovered. Authorities believe that Fotis Dulos was lying in wait and attacked Jennifer Dulos in her own garage in New Canaan when she returned from the school just after 8 a.m. on March 24. To get there, police believe he drove his employee Pawel Gumienny’s Toyota Tacoma pickup, with his own bicycle in the back, parked it near Waveny Park, and cycled to the New Canaan mansion. After killing her, he drove her body in her own Chevy Surburban back to the park, leaving her SUV for searchers to find later while he returned to Farmington in Gumienny’s pickup, investigators said. The murder conspiracy charge against Troconis relates to what she was doing that morning. According to prosecutors, she agreed to answer a prearranged call from Dulos’ friend in Greece to Dulos’ phone ― which he left in their home office ― but also to avoid having his movements tracked. Initially, Troconis and Dulos’ friend Kent Mawhinney (who is himself awaiting trial on a murder conspiracy charge in the case) said Dulos was with them in the office that morning. She also originally told police that she had woken up beside Dulos that morning, showered with him and had sex, but in a later interview admitted she had not seen him at all. Prosecutors said Troconis and Dulos were following what investigators referred to as “alibi scripts” — a term they were barred from using during the trial — to account for their movements that day. Schoenhorn said that Troconis’ inconsistent statements were a result of aggressive police tactics that affected her memory and confusion because English is not her native language. (She is originally from Venezuela.) Her police interviews were all conducted in English, but she used a Spanish interpreter throughout the trial. Jurors were shown video of her three police interviews in their entirety, hours of footage filmed at Jennifer Dulos’ house, and traffic and security video of the various vehicles driven by Dulos, Troconis and Gumienny on May 24. Troconis’ movements that afternoon were of particular interest to investigators and highlighted by prosecutors in their closing arguments. She made five trips back and forth from the home and office she shared with Dulos on Jefferson Crossing, to the empty property he was preparing to sell on Mountain Spring Road, two miles away. Dulos stayed there the entire time, close to 3 1/2 hours. During that time, prosecutors said, there were three different “fire events” at Jefferson Crossing. Based on a neighbor’s security video of smoke billowing from the chimney — and its absence — prosecutors alleged that Troconis was burning evidence. Although Schoenhorn countered that Troconis enjoyed having fires in the fireplace year-round, the prosecution emphasized that this was the Friday before Memorial Day weekend, a warm day and an odd time to light several different fires. Meanwhile, prosecutors said Dulos was cleaning Gumienny’s Tacoma, which he allegedly used to transport his wife’s body, and bagging up the evidence. When Gumienny showed up unannounced at the Mountain Spring Road property to pick up his truck, Troconis took his keys to dissuade him from taking it. He insisted, however, because he needed it to transport his dirt bike home. Gumienny was a key witness for the prosecution and was granted immunity to testify. When he returned to Farmington with his Tacoma after Memorial Day weekend, Gumienny testified that Dulos and Troconis took it without his knowledge or consent to a car wash to have it cleaned and fully detailed — twice. Then Gumienny said Dulos repeatedly urged him to replace the Tacoma’s seats, which he eventually did, but held on to the original ones. Ultimately he handed them over to investigators, who said they found evidence of Jennifer Dulos’ DNA on the passenger seat. Dulos might have had an additional sinister intent when he borrowed Gumienny’s truck. Just before Jennifer Dulos’ disappearance, Fotis Dulos shaved his head — a deliberate attempt, investigators believed, to mislead any witnesses into thinking he was Gumienny, who had a similar hairstyle. Gumienny said he even made a joke about it when he found Dulos and Troconis at a property they claimed to be cleaning the afternoon Jennifer Dulos disappeared. “You shaved your head. You’re wearing dirty old work clothes. You trying to be as handsome as me?” Gumienny testified he told Dulos. Troconis had a greater motive than just helping her boyfriend, prosecutors said. She hated Jennifer Dulos, Supervisory Assistant State’s Attorney Michelle Manning said Tuesday, and wanted to end the “two years of torture” she endured, including being barred from her home during Dulos’ visitations with his children. “The frustration turned to anger and hatred,” Manning said, quoting Troconis’ own interviews when she described Jennifer Dulos as “manipulating,” “angry” and “toxic.” In one of the most dramatic moments of the seven-week trial, Gumienny recounted what Troconis said when Jennifer Dulos refused to allow their children to say goodbye to the ill family dog before Fotis Dulos had him put to sleep in the spring of 2019. “That bitch should be buried next to the dog,” Gumienny testified. In the final closing argument, Assistant State’s Attorney Sean McGuinness repeated Troconis’ derogatory comment but said this case was about “a mother’s worst nightmare.” “It is about a mother being taken away from her children, in life or in death,” he said. It is about Dulos’ children, “who went to bed on May 24 not knowing where their mother was, and she has still not arrived.” In a statement shared with HuffPost, Schoenhorn said he is “extremely disappointed in the outcome” of the trial and reiterated his previous contention that Troconis’ inconsistent accounts were partly the result of her police interviews being conducted in English without a Spanish interpreter, saying that “played a major role in the verdict.” “I think it was unfortunate that the interrogations were conducted in a manner and in a language that led her to contradict herself, and I understand how that would be used against her,” he said, blaming “hindsight bias” for the jury’s finding that Troconis knew in advance that Fotis Dulos would kill his wife. Paul J. Ferencek, state’s attorney for the Stamford/Norwalk Judicial District, commended the jury and offered condolences to Dulos’ family in a press release after the verdict, promising that their work on the case isn’t over.

During the trial, a friend of Jennifer Dulos told prosecutors that a sealed report related to the Duloses’ custody battle had been displayed on Troconis’ laptop in a very large font that could be read by people in the courtroom. In response, Judge Randolph restricted the use of computers in the courtroom to attorneys. Troconis is scheduled to be sentenced on May 31. The court clerk originally proposed May 24, which Schoenhorn suggested would be “inappropriate” — it marks the fifth anniversary of Jennifer Dulos’ death.

Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary contest, said he would give local police officers immunity to carry out his plan. “They understand who these migrants are. They know them by their first name, their last name, they know where they come from,” Trump said. “It’s going to be the local police are going to turn them over and we’re going to have to move them back to their country.” Trump has made immigration a major focus of his 2024 presidential campaign, using tough rhetoric and pledging to bring “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history” if he returns to the White House. His allies, including Steve Bannon, have also been pushing the extreme measure. “Mass deportations are going to start, if you don’t like that, then don’t vote for President Trump,” Bannon said Thursday on his “War Room” podcast. Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge David Ezra on Thursday blocked a Texas law, originally set to take effect next week, which would allow police to arrest those who cross into the country illegally and would also enable local judges to order their deportation. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has appealed the ruling. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who joined Trump Thursday at his visit to the U.S. southern border, said he will continue fighting to protect his state from what he described as President Joe “Biden’s migrant crisis.” “Texas has the right to defend itself because of President Biden’s ongoing failure to fulfill his duty to protect our state from the invasion at our southern border,” Abbott said. “Even from the bench, this District Judge acknowledged that this case will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.” Texas has the constitutional right to defend itself because of President Biden's ongoing failure to fulfill his duty.We will not back down in our fight to protect Texas.This case will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. pic.twitter.com/o7ugwxViMU Abbott has endorsed Trump and the former president said he is considering the governor as a potential running mate. Biden visited the border Thursday as well hoping to score a win on the issue after Trump encouraged his party’s congressional lawmakers to block a bipartisan bill, which would have imposed the toughest border enforcement measures in decades, by, among other things, making it harder for people to claim asylum.

(AP) — A man who fatally shot a 20-year-old woman after the SUV she was riding in mistakenly drove into his rural driveway in upstate New York was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in prison. Kevin Monahan, 66, was convicted of second-degree murder in the death last April of Kaylin Gillis. She was riding in a caravan of two cars and a motorcycle that was trying to leave after pulling into Monahan’s long, winding driveway while looking for a party at another person’s house in the town of Hebron. “I think it’s important for people to know that it’s not OK to shoot people and have them killed for turning down your driveway,” Judge Adam Michelini said. Apart from the wider deterrent effect, Michelini said it’s important that Monahan remain behind bars rather than be free to harm more people. The judge added up to 4 more years for tampering with the murder weapon, and scolded Monahan for showing no remorse. “You murdered Kaylin Gillis. You shot at a car full of people and you didn’t care what would happen and you repeatedly lied about it. You deserve to spend the maximum time in prison allowable under the law,” the judge said. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum. The defense asked for leniency. Monahan declined an opportunity to speak. And then he was led away, to applause and a shout of “coward” from the gallery. Gillis’ death drew attention far beyond upstate New York. It came days after the shooting of 16-year-old Ralph Yarl in Kansas City. Yarl, who is Black, was wounded by an 84-year-old white man after he went to the wrong door while trying to pick up his younger brothers. On the night of Gillis’ death, the group of friends had realized their error and had turned around when Monahan fired a second shot, striking Gillis in the neck as she sat in the front passenger seat of an SUV driven by her boyfriend. Monahan maintained the fatal shot was an accident and that the shotgun was defective. He also said he believed the house about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Albany was “under siege” by intruders, and said he came out to fire a warning shot to try to scare the group away while his wife hid inside. Prosecutors argued that Monahan was motivated by an irrational rage toward trespassers. A jury deliberated for less then two hours before returning guilty verdicts in January against Monahan for murder, reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence. Gillis’ father, Andrew Gillis, has described his daughter as someone who loved animals and had dreams of becoming a marine biologist or a veterinarian.

We will never see her beautiful face, hear her laughter,” Gillis said in court Friday before Monahan’s sentence was announced.

Although Twitter has rebranded to X, the humor lives on. Every week, we round up the most hilarious quips from parents on the social media platform to spread the joy. Scroll down to read the latest batch, and follow @HuffPostParents for more! My 6yo is chanting all the words that rhyme with sucker and this is going to end badly in about 3 seconds When I was growing up, water was the only approved drink between meals. Yesterday my son asked for milk after playing outside at my parents' and my dad poured his grandson a giant cup of CHOCOLATE milk.🧐IT WAS NOT EVEN ANYONE'S BIRTHDAY OR ANYTHING. Apparently my 9yo daughter's imaginary friend is the ghost of an 8yo girl named Rose who died of the bubonic plague 200 years ago and I’m sure this is a completely normal developmental stage........ Sorry kids I missed your childhood, I was busy trying to catch up on emails from your school I was going through an old keepsakes box of mine and found a 4 colored pen. I asked my 6 year old if she’d like to have the cool pen I used when I was a kid. Her eyes lit up, then I gave it to her and she frowned. “Oh, I thought it was going to be one of those feathers,” she said “Do you think in heaven you can pee anywhere you want?” My daughter, asking the big questions Be warned that if you buy your 5 year old a watch, you are going to get minute by minute updates on what the current time is Forgot about the 12-20 months stage of having a baby where your house is just littered with random objects they picked up, carried around, and dropped for no reason like you live inside a claw machine. I forgot to tell my 4yo that today is Leap Day before she left for school and squandered an opportunity to make a big deal out of nothing Young children sneeze with the intent of destroying the world I called to my son from another room and he yelled “just text me” and that’s all you need to know about parenting teens. My daughter asked if babies come from Walmart and I was like pretty much. Me: “Come here” is spelled C-O-M-E not C-U-MMy kid: Does it really matter how I spell it?Me: Yes! 11yo: Do you know where my sunglasses are?Me: The car?11yo: No, I looked. Two days later, while driving my kid to school. 11yo: My sunglasses! My kids are playing doctor’s office and the receptionist just said, “the doctor will see you in five seconds” and this is the least realistic game I’ve ever seen. The aggressiveness of my teenager sitting down on the couch is equal to him being dropped on it from 4,000 feet in the air. Like why. just an update my kids are on their 99th cold this winter “I like mommy’s car better”-My daughter in the backseat of my truck having to use a Home Depot receipt to wipe her nose. Parents: If you ever need a reminder about the power of peer pressure, my 13 year-old son went from never eating vegetables to now eating literal dried seaweed because his friend told them all that seaweed will help grow a moustache.

Trump, who is the current Republican front-runner, also faces a federal indictment in Florida related to his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House. His attorneys said they want that trial pushed back until after the election. Haley said Trump has the right to defend himself, but that the cases should not be drawn out and must be addressed quickly. “I think voters are going to want to know what they’re walking into, and if they’re walking into a president who’s still going to have to be in court or if they’re walking into a presidency where he can get rid of a court case. Voters are going to want to know that,” Hayley said. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

While Hayley added that no president should be legally immune to anything, and they must “live under laws too,” she has previously said that it would be bad if Trump winds up “sitting in a jail cell.” “For me, the last thing we need is an 80-year-old president sitting in jail because that’s just going to further divide our country,” she told CNN back in January. “This is no longer about whether he’s innocent or guilty. This is about the fact: How do we bring the country back together?” She added that that does not mean she would preemptively pardon Trump, like President Gerald Ford did for Richard Nixon.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/irs-cracks-down-no-file-tax-returns_n_65e1e8fae4b005b8583414d7,"IRS Launches Crackdown On 125,000 Wealthy ‘Non-Filers’",fatima hussein,3/1/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The IRS plans to go after 125,000 high-income earners who did not file tax returns going back to 2017 — and the agency says hundreds of millions of dollars of unpaid taxes are involved in these cases. Beginning this week, the IRS will start sending out noncompliance letters to more than 25,000 people who earn more than $1 million per year and 100,000 people with incomes between $400,000 and $1 million who failed to pay their taxes between 2017 and 2021. The campaign announced Thursday is part of the agency’s ongoing effort to pursue high wealth tax cheats — mandated in part by funding provided through Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act passed into law in 2022 and a directive from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to IRS leadership not to increase audit rates on people making less than $400,000 a year annually. “When people don’t file a tax return they’re required to, it’s not fair to those hardworking taxpayers who responsibly do their civic duty under the laws of our nation,” IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel told reporters Thursday morning. “And when people don’t file their taxes, they need to know there’s a consequence.” The IRS in recent months has announced a slew of new campaigns aimed at targeting high-wealth individuals who misuse the tax system or fail to pay their obligations. For instance, last week IRS leadership said the agency will start up dozens of audits on businesses’ private jets and how they are used personally by executives and written off as a tax deduction. And earlier this year, the agency announced it had collected roughly half a billion dollars in overdue taxes from delinquent millionaires. The next four years will change America forever.

DeSantis, at a Feb. 15 news conference, supported a state House proposal designed to limit what he called “bad-faith objections” to various school library books and instructional materials. He said these objections were an abuse of the process, performed to “score cheap political points.” “We obviously have to give parents the ability to be able to ensure that this smut doesn’t get into their schools,” the Republican governor said. But he noted: “Although we like people wanting to be involved in what’s going on, to just show up and object to every single book under the sun, that is not an appropriate situation here, and we have seen that occasionally.” Florida reportedly logged 1,218 book objections during the 2022-2023 fiscal year, resulting in the removal of 386 books ― often titles that are very Black, hella gay, pro-trans, and/or anti-slavery and anti-segregation. Despite his call for the Florida Legislature to “fine-tune the process” to prevent what he described as activists saddling school districts with unnecessary work, he continued to argue that the mashup of bills and state education department policy that effectively allowed for the banning of books was not a book ban bill ― saying that was a “false narrative.” “A lot of the things that people say in the media that were, quote, ‘objected to’ were actually on the summer reading list of the Florida Department of Education, so this is all a big fraud,” DeSantis claimed at the news conference. He added, “No district in Florida has removed any dictionaries or thesauruses.” That’s not true, though. It is unsurprising that a man who launched a 2024 presidential campaign built on the theme that God directly called on him to run can’t admit fault, but nonetheless, these comments are an acknowledgment that his bill, HB 1069, in its original form is not working. This tacit admission from DeSantis is likely rooted in his ongoing delusions of one day becoming president. As reported by ABC News days before DeSantis spoke out, a source close to him confirmed that he had privately expressed interest in running for president again as early as 2028. And multiple other people close to him added that he plans to keep a small political team around him. How much money will DeSantis waste on consultants to lie to him that he still has a shot at becoming president of the United States someday before he ultimately accepts that the only DeSantis in his house with any shot at moving into the White House to launch their white Christian nationalist remix of the Kennedy dynasty is his wife? Who knows, but while I’m not often in the habit of saving boring bigots money, I have some free game for the failed presidential contender: You cannot run away from your own policies that easily. After all, it was only in 2022 when DeSantis, along with his political adviser Christopher Rufo, best known for launching a campaign against the teaching of “critical race theory” in public schools (spoiler: it never has been), were already exploiting LGBTQ biases when they decided to pivot and exploit racial animus for political gain next with legislation like the “Stop WOKE Act.” Much like the made-up beef about critical race theory to limit discussion of racial history and identity in schools and workplaces, DeSantis, Rufo and other conservative activists like them stoked fear about queer and trans people under the false pretense of parental control. As The New Yorker’s Benjamin Wallace-Wells wrote in “The Political Strategy of Ron DeSantis’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Bill” at the time: “In American politics, ideology is often a smoke screen for individual ambition.” DeSantis wanted to usurp former President Donald Trump as the leader of the Republican Party and used Black history and LGBTQ people as his answer to Trump’s racist ramblings about Mexicans coming across the border to be predators. With DeSantis, queer and trans people were the predators — purposely maligning them as “groomers” and repeatedly arguing that parents “should be protected from schools using classroom instruction to sexualize their kids as young as 5 years old.” In the small minds of men like Ron DeSantis, you can’t discuss a non-heterosexual person without immediately thinking of their sexual acts. But let him tell it, and anyone who didn’t support his homophobic and transphobic legislation based on that dumb, creepy premise were alleged to be complicit in pedophilia. It’s exactly how he maligned Disney over its objections to all of his anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and legislation before then punishing them from the Governor’s Mansion. His campaign was pretty homophobic in tone at times, too. None of these stunts resulted in the same level of success for DeSantis as Trump achieved in 2016, but while DeSantis may want to forget a lot about the last two years of his life ― chasing what proved to be a humiliating defeat in the GOP primary, dropping out on Jan. 21 ― the rest of us should not let him. Whereas DeSantis failed in the primary, he succeeded in inspiring the entire Republican Party to not only target minority authors but also teachers, librarians and others who promote literacy without biased restrictions. Take West Virginia, where the House of Delegates just voted on a bill to allow the prosecution of librarians. But now, as he apparently considers another presidential run, Ron DeSantis wants to act like the level-headed man behind the mess he’s responsible for making. It doesn’t work that way, Meatball. His book ban bill is not a “false narrative” but an accurate description of a despicable policy that should hang around his neck for the rest of his life.",NA,NA

In a lawsuit filed at San Francisco Superior Court, billionaire Musk said that when he bankrolled OpenAI’s creation, he secured an agreement with Altman and Greg Brockman, the president, to keep the AI company as a non-profit that would develop technology for the benefit of the public. Under its founding agreement, OpenAI would also make its code open to the public instead of walling it off for any private company’s gains, the lawsuit says. However, by embracing a close relationship with Microsoft, OpenAI and its top executives have set that pact “aflame” and are “perverting” the company’s mission, Musk alleges in the lawsuit. “OpenAI, Inc. has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world: Microsoft,” the lawsuit filed Thursday says. “Under its new Board, it is not just developing but is actually refining an AGI to maximize profits for Microsoft, rather than for the benefit of humanity.” AGI refers to artificial general intelligence, which are general purpose AI systems that can perform just as well as — or even better than — humans in a wide variety of tasks. Musk is suing over breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and unfair business practices. He also wants an injunction to prevent anyone, including Microsoft, from benefiting from OpenAI’s technology.

Instead, Dellinger — one of the few thousand people who showed up to a Donald Trump rally the day before the South Carolina primary — believes Democrats may swap Biden for Vice President Kamala Harris, who Dellinger says is “not even a little bit qualified” to be president. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they tried to remove him and put in Kamala Harris and have her run,” she said. Talk to almost any Republican at a grassroots event and you’ll hear some version of this theory: that Democrats will end up nominating someone besides Biden at their August national convention. Some believe there’s even a nominee-in-waiting to replace the 81-year-old president — who hasn’t suggested he intends to step aside, despite mounting concerns about his age and health. Their predictions for who this person might be range from the plausible — California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who many see as a likely candidate in 2028 — to the totally ridiculous, like former President Barack Obama. This conspiracy, though, has some grounding in the real concerns that Democrats whisper about in private, and the grim warnings beginning to surface in polls of the election eight months away. A Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll released Thursday found Trump beating Biden in seven key swing states that helped Biden defeat Trump in 2020. Respondents largely found Biden to be too old, while many considered Trump, the likely GOP nominee, to be dangerous. Trump has helped to legitimize the notion that he won’t be facing Biden in November, even as polls show the former president gaining on Biden, which should be enough of a reason for Trump to hope the election is a repeat of 2020. “I personally don’t think he makes it,” Trump told Sean Hannity during a Fox News town hall back in December. Since then, Biden’s possible replacement has become the subject of wild speculation on the right. Organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) surveyed attendees at its annual confab last weekend about who they think will be the eventual Democratic nominee. A majority named former first lady Michelle Obama, who famously hates politicking in all its forms. Others cited Harris, Newsom and ex-Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Michelle Obama’s name kept coming up in conversations at Trump’s rally in Rock Hill, South Carolina, last Friday. Trump supporters who spoke with HuffPost feared Democrats would tap Obama because she’d make a better candidate than Biden. (Despite her dislike of politics, Obama is one of America’s most popular political figures.) “I believe if she does it, she’ll win because society is just more about looks and no substance. We just look at popularity more than anything else,” said Doug Smith, a postal worker from Rock Hill. CPAC even dedicated a panel — with the deranged title “Cat Fight? Michelle vs. Kamala” — to dissecting the imaginary political rivalry between two of the party’s most prominent Black women. Radio host Monica Crowley warned Republicans to be ready for Obama to swoop in and clinch the nomination: “Michelle Obama is the worst-case scenario because she poses the most threatening challenge to Trump,” she said. Biden’s campaign, in an email to HuffPost, called this theory “bizarre” and said it was “happy to confirm that’s not the case.” Republicans, however, may be taking some of their cues from real election influencers who are slowly beginning to question the wisdom of another Biden run and suggesting a way that Democrats might coalesce behind someone else. This month, The New York Times’ Ezra Klein, one of the paper’s most prominent liberal columnists, argued it’s time for Biden’s inner circle to intervene and convince the president to allow delegates to get behind another nominee. Election analyst Nate Silver also wrote this month that Biden needs to campaign more aggressively or “stand down.” This week’s Michigan primary revealed warning signs for both Biden and Trump. Biden lost 13% of the Democratic primary vote to “uncommitted” voters protesting his Middle East policy and another almost 6% to Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson. Trump, meanwhile, lost 30% of the GOP primary vote to former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. The Trump supporters who spoke with HuffPost recently regarded the potential for another Democratic nominee with a mix of glee and also fear over whom Democrats might find to run, though some of their predictions would not be remotely possible. A South Carolina woman who would only identify herself as Debbie because she was afraid of online backlash from her remarks, believes that it’s really Barack Obama who’s eyeing a return to office for a third term, which is not allowed under the Constitution. In his speeches “he talks about a third term. He talks about controlling. He talks about all those things,” she said. Even though it’s illegal, she said she wouldn’t put such a scheme past Democrats, who are “sneaky little bastards.” She also touched on another theme that’s widespread on the right — that Biden isn’t even in charge at the White House. “Is he even running? I just think it’s all a sham. I think they’re trying to figure out what is going on and how people are going to react.” Joe Schaub, a 67-year-old from Columbia, South Carolina, said it’s clear that Biden is simply too old now to do the job. “He was a schmuck senator,” Schaub said. “Now he’s old and dumb. That’s a bad combination. You just can’t replace old.” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

After Al-Nassr defeated Riyadh rival Al-Shabab 3-2 on Sunday, video footage appeared to show Ronaldo cupping his ear and repeatedly thrusting his hand forward near his pelvis, in a gesture that seemed to be aimed at Al-Shabab fans. Background chants of “Messi,” referencing Ronaldo’s longstanding soccer rival Lionel Messi, could be heard. The Disciplinary and Ethics Committee of the Saudi Arabia Football Federation (SAFF) committee announced the ban on social media early Thursday morning local time. Al-Nassr’s next league game is at home to Al-Hazm on Thursday. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United star will also have to pay a fine of 20,000 Saudi Riyals ( $5,333) to Al-Shabab, to cover the costs of the club filing the complaint, and half of that amount to the federation. The committee said that the decision was not open to appeal. While the incident was not captured by television cameras, the actions of Ronaldo, who scored a first-half penalty in the game, were widely criticized in Saudi Arabia by former players and commentators.

It is not the first time that the Portuguese forward has been at the center of controversy since joining Al-Nassr. Last April, upon leaving the field after a game against Al-Hilal, Ronaldo appeared to grab his genitals as fans chanted Messi’s name. On that occasion, Al-Nassr said that the forward had sustained a groin injury in the match. Ronaldo, who moved to the Riyadh-based club in December 2022, has a league-leading 22 goals.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/texas-abortion-ban-domestic-violence_n_65dcd9a9e4b005b858312158,When Your Home State Also Becomes Your Abuser,alanna vagianos,3/1/2024,"Gabriela Gonzalez had been dating her abusive boyfriend, Harold Thompson, for four months in the spring of 2023 when she got pregnant. Police records show that Thompson had physically abused Gonzalez several times throughout their relationship, including when she was pregnant. Thompson strangled Gonzalez and “recklessly caused bodily injury” in a December 2022 incident, according to court records. She told her family she wanted to leave him, but she was terrified. “He was so angry that she wanted to get away from him,” Mileny Rubio, Gonzalez’s sister, told a local Dallas outlet. “She would always tell me that she wanted to leave, but that she couldn’t.” Gonzalez knew she couldn’t continue the pregnancy because she did not want to be tied to her abuser for the rest of her life. But she lived in Dallas, Texas, where by last spring, abortion had been banned for nearly a year. So she drove to Colorado ― at least an 18-hour journey there and back ― to get an abortion. The day after Gonzalez returned, Thompson found out about the abortion and confronted her in a gas station parking lot. Surveillance video, described in a police report, shows Thompson put Gonzalez in a chokehold before she was able to shrug him off. That’s when Thompson pulled out a gun and shot Gonzalez in the head. The video shows Thompson firing several more bullets into Gonzalez’s body before fleeing. He was charged with murder and is awaiting trial. Gonzalez, like so many other domestic violence victims in Texas, faced an increased risk of violence from her abusive partner and a higher likelihood he would kill her because of the state’s decision to loosen gun laws and completely restrict access to abortion. Her story reflects the three systemic crises converging in Texas that are creating a deadly new normal for women. Each has resulted from a deliberate policy created by right-wing state lawmakers. The leading cause of death among pregnant and postpartum women in the U.S. is homicide, most often by an abusive partner with a gun. Pregnant and postpartum women are more than twice as likely to be murdered than to die from sepsis, hypertensive disorders or hemorrhage. “Pregnant and postpartum women are more than twice as likely to be murdered than to die from sepsis, hypertensive disorders or hemorrhage.” Experts tell HuffPost other states with abortion bans are also seeing an increase in domestic violence, but Texas stands out for a few reasons. The state was the first to severely restrict abortion in 2021, forcing women to stay pregnant nearly a year before Roe fell and exposing domestic violence victims to more violence with fewer ways to escape. At the same time, the Lone Star state has the largest rate of gun sales in the country and continues to have lax firearm restrictions. The state is so firearm friendly that gun rights groups chose it as the testing ground for a Supreme Court case that will determine if domestic abusers get to keep their guns. In the last decade, the amount of women shot and killed by an abuser has nearly doubled in Texas. Even though Gonzalez was able to get an abortion, her abuser still had access to a firearm. Women who travel more than 150 miles to get an abortion are more likely to experience physical violence from an abuser than those traveling less than 50 miles. Gonzalez, who leaves behind three young children, traveled at least 500 miles on the last trip of her life. HuffPost spoke with a dozen people working in advocacy services in the state ― ranging from abortion funds and family attorneys, to shelter directors and hotline staff ― who believe that the state’s abortion bans coupled with its lax gun laws are fueling intimate partner violence. Survivors and advocacy workers are terrified that this new normal will lead to more dead women in Texas: The state has made it easier for a man to obtain a gun to kill his partner than it is for a woman to access abortion care. For Holly Bowles, a sexual assault victim advocate working in Texas, the hardest part of her job is telling someone they’re pregnant. Bowles and her colleagues at SAFE Alliance, which is based in Austin, normally see people in the immediate aftermath of an assault. They serve around 6,000 Texans every year who have experienced emotionally and physically devastating violence. The nonprofit works with survivors of child abuse, human trafficking, intimate partner violence and sexual assault. Their hotline, which hears from around 2,000 callers a month, connects people to housing assistance, legal services — or to advocates like Bowles, who can support a victim through a rape kit exam or legal trial. Around half of the survivors Bowles supports have experienced intimate partner violence, or are still in active situations. Most of the victims she sees can take emergency contraception after they finish the forensic exam, but for women in abusive relationships, some may already be pregnant from a prior assault by their partner. And they might not know it. Recently, a staff member on Bowles’ team was sitting with a woman during a rape kit exam when the advocate had to tell her she was pregnant. “This was actually the fifth time I believe that her partner had gotten her pregnant intentionally so that she would stay,” said Bowles, who works as the director of SAFE’s sexual assault victim advocacy program. Before Roe v. Wade fell in 2022, Bowles could connect victims with abortion clinics or even schedule an appointment for them. Now with a total abortion ban in effect in Texas, as well as a law criminalizing those who help people seeking care, Bowles has to tread extremely carefully. “It’s very difficult to think about, in that immediate moment, what we can and can’t talk about,” she said. “We’re very limited in the things that we can do if someone does find themselves in that situation because of the laws in Texas.” Since the Supreme Court repealed Roe, calls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline about reproductive coercion ― an umbrella term that includes when an abusive partner controls pregnancy outcomes, coerces someone into unprotected sex or tampers with birth control methods ― have doubled across the country. Pregnant women were already more likely to be murdered by an intimate partner in states where abortion was restricted before Dobbs, according to a new study published in the Journal of American College of Surgeons. With 21 states now severely restricting or banning abortion altogether, “This problem is only going to be exponentially worse,” said senior author of the study Dr. Justin Cirone, a trauma surgeon and assistant professor of surgery at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Millions of Texans are dealing with the repercussions of these bans, but victims of domestic violence are particularly vulnerable. An estimated 324,000 pregnant people are abused each year by an intimate partner, and research suggests that abortion access plays a critical role in reducing intimate partner violence. For some victims, pregnancy can mean an increase in the severity of violence. For others it can actually initiate abuse in a relationship that was not violent beforehand often because of the financial and emotional stress pregnancy can create. In Texas, specifically, calls citing firearms in situations of intimate partner violence have increased dramatically (47%) between 2022 and 2023. Adding a firearm into the mix increases the likelihood that the victim dies: Women are five times more likely to be killed in a situation of intimate partner violence if a gun is present. The Supreme Court could make it even easier for domestic abusers to access firearms legally sometime this year. Following SCOTUS’ unprecedented reinterpretation of the Second Amendment in 2022, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a conviction of a Texas man, Zackey Rahimi, who was found with several firearms despite a previous arrest for domestic violence. Under federal law, the protective order for domestic abuse against Rahimi stripped him of his right to possess the guns found in his home. The court of appeals overturned Rahimi’s conviction, ruling that the federal law violates people’s constitutional right to bear arms. The Supreme Court is set to make a decision in the case later this year. Gun reform advocates and anti-domestic violence groups have worked tirelessly to close what many refer to as the “boyfriend loophole” ― a statute in the Violence Against Women Act that has allowed unmarried partners who are convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence to buy or own firearms. The Biden administration narrowed the loophole but did not fully close it, though many states have their own laws banning convicted domestic abusers from owning guns. If SCOTUS sides with Rahimi, the consequences for victims of intimate partner violence will be deadly. “This [case] is essentially putting firearms into the hands of abusive partners and that equation means lethality for survivors,” Crystal Justice, the chief external affairs officer at the National Domestic Violence Hotline, told HuffPost. “Lives will be lost if the wrong decision is made in the Rahimi case.” Recently, Marta Peláez started noticing more and more pregnant women and mothers with newborns seeking services at her San Antonio organization, the Battered Women and Children’s Shelter. She kept hearing from staff that more women were coming in with babies, and they needed help getting necessities like diapers and formula. When Peláez looked at the intake data, there was a 12% increase in pregnant women or women with a baby under 12 months seeking services from 2022 to 2023. “To me, there is a big chance that this is because of their impossibility to get an abortion, plus the dynamics of how pregnancy plays a role in domestic violence,” she said. Peláez is witnessing firsthand what statisticians are finding in their research. Birth rates in states with abortion bans have increased since Roe fell, according to the Institute of Labor Economics. Texas had the largest birth rate increase in the country in 2023, in part because the state is so large and there are longer travel times to the nearest abortion clinics. The year before, Texas had nearly 10,000 more births than expected in the last nine months of 2022 ― correlating to the state enacting the six-week ban in 2021. When victims of intimate partner violence are forced to stay pregnant, they are likely to face more violence from their abusive partner and a heightened lethality of violence. Even if a survivor makes it through pregnancy and the postpartum period, and even if she’s able to escape at some later date, she’ll always be linked to her abuser through their child. Research suggests that abortion access helps reduce domestic violence. The Turnaway Study, landmark research published in 2020, followed 1,000 women over the course of 10 years and analyzed the long-term impact of abortion access. The study found that after 2 1/2 years, the women who were denied abortions were more likely to experience violence from the men involved in the pregnancies because they have ongoing contact with them, even if they are no longer in a romantic relationship. “You can’t trust your partner, you can’t ask someone for help, your neighbors are now hunting you ― it makes the entire world unsafe,” Lisa Pous, a survivor of intimate partner violence whose pronouns are she/they, told HuffPost. “How are we supposed to leave [our abusers]? What is the point of leaving?” “To me, these laws say that my government doesn’t care if I die, the same way my partner didn’t.” Pous was able to escape a 13-year abusive relationship in 2006 with the support of SAFE. Now, she’s the founder and director of the organization’s Survivor Peer Support program which offers emotional support and other resources to victims of intimate partner violence. The program works with 300 survivors every year, with a small but mighty staff of five, including Pous. Their time is spent speaking with people in active domestic violence situations as well as survivors who are trying to get back on their feet. When the state passed the six-week abortion ban in 2021, survivors were confused and scared. Pous and her staff organized several talking groups so that people could ask questions and discuss their feelings about the law. “We can’t tell the difference anymore between who’s harming us,” Pous said, referring to the Texas government and abusers. “To me, these laws say that my government doesn’t care if I die, the same way my partner didn’t.” Pregnant people who have the resources are traveling out of Texas to get abortion care. But victims of intimate partner violence don’t have the money or freedom to travel; financial abuse is present in 99% of domestic violence relationships. Those who try to find resources and travel support through abortion funds are taking tremendous safety risks if their abuser finds out. “The amount of times I’ve heard from clients who say, ‘He can’t know I had an abortion,’ or ‘I can’t have this child because I’ll be tied to this person forever,’ or ‘The last time I was pregnant, that’s when it was the worst.’ It was all the time,” said Anna Rupani, executive director at Fund Texas Choice, an abortion fund that offers travel support. It’s routine, Rupani said, to ask if it’s safe to call clients because so many are experiencing domestic violence. Cathy Torres told HuffPost sometimes her staff at the Frontera Fund will field calls where the client is whispering over the phone because her abuser is in the next room. The majority of Torres’ clients at Frontera Fund, an abortion fund based in the Rio Grande Valley, are undocumented, which brings its own set of barriers. “If someone is undocumented, abusers will say, ‘OK, I’ll call ICE on you or I’ll call customs,’” Torres said. “That has always been the case, always. But now they’re just emboldened.” Time and time again, interpretations of state law very rarely end up supporting the pregnant person. Last year, a Texas man used the state’s six-week abortion ban to bring a $1 million wrongful death suit against three women for allegedly helping his ex-wife self-manage an abortion. The husband was emotionally abusive, according to court documents, and routinely threatened the wife including promising to drop the lawsuit if she had sex with him. The three friends who helped the woman get abortion pills wrote in a countersuit that the ex-husband “did not file this lawsuit because he is interested in ‘protecting life’... Instead, he wanted to control a life.” Many victim advocates in Texas are now experiencing the same dreadful reality physicians are facing when it comes to abortion care: turn patients away, or give the standard of care and risk legal ramifications or the loss of funding. All of the people working in advocacy services that HuffPost spoke with were afraid of Texas law enforcement, and deeply concerned about confidentiality. “The biggest priority we have all the time is privacy and confidentiality,” one Texas advocacy worker, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid repercussions from the state, told HuffPost. “Now we’re being even more careful, we’re telling staff members: ‘Do you know about tracking devices on your phone?’ Because just the way we counsel people to be safe around their abusers, I feel like as an agency we have to do the same thing with our government now.” Dr. Leila Wood, a professor at the Center for Violence Prevention and School of Nursing at the University of Texas Medical Branch, said physicians and advocates are at risk of experiencing a concept called “moral injury.” “I see providers talking about the same thing in all of these pockets, which is the idea of: ‘I’m having to do something that is counter to my protective caring instincts with this vulnerable population’ or ‘I have to risk my own safety and security,’ and it’s a decision that people make differently,” said Wood, who has led statewide research on intimate partner violence in Texas. Bowles, the sexual assault advocate with SAFE, has a hard time getting victims to be forthcoming in those initial conversations after she tells them they’re pregnant from intimate partner rape. She’s always worried that the detailed medical records the forensic exam nurses take could be turned over to law enforcement for investigation if a pregnant rape victim contemplates abortion. Now, Bowles asks nurses to step out of the room before discussing next steps. “We’re not violating [Texas’ abortion ban] or S.B. 8 in those conversations, but we put so much more thought and caution into how we give information to survivors because of that risk,” Bowles said. Conversations with victims about reproductive health care could threaten an entire organization’s ability to help other victims. Many of the groups HuffPost spoke with don’t just provide anti-domestic violence services, they offer other critical community needs like housing and legal services for immigration or child custody disputes. “Our programs receive state and federal dollars. Drawing attention to these issues is not necessarily super safe for us,” said a former employee of a large anti-domestic violence nonprofit in Texas. Pous, the survivor of domestic violence who is now at SAFE, said many of the victims she works with feel trapped ― first by their abuser and now by their home state. She said it feels like a repetition of their entire life, working so hard to escape an abuser just to be met with more violence once they’re back on their feet. She’s proud of the work she’s doing, and she will continue to support survivors as best as she can, but she’s exhausted and worries for the future. “A lot of us really thought we were finding ways out of violence,” she said. “When the laws changed, we realized… we may never make it out.”",NA,NA

The goats roamed the streets of Arlington after escaping from the enclosure in the Crystal Canyon Natural Area, a park where the city brought them to “help clear underbrush and other invasive plants” to reduce fire danger in the area, according to the Arlington Police Department. Body camera footage shared by police shows officers helping to wrangle the herd as goats evade them and head down the street in one neighborhood. “Oh, it’s a mess,” said one officer in the video as the herd darts off the road and onto grass past a police vehicle. “Go, goats, go back to where you came from, please. Who knew we were goat wranglers, now?” The goats trot down another road before being led off the street. The herd was eventually guided back to their enclosure, police said. Officials believed that “a runner or a jogger” may have let the goats go, KTVT reported. The herd is in the park as part of a partnership between the city and Open Space Development, a Texas company that says the goats “work exceptionally well in eradicating invasive species” in herds “professionally and humanely managed by a dedicated team.” The next four years will change America forever.

Trump’s past written comments about his “hands-on” approach to running his businesses and his frugality will be among four dozen quotes introduced as evidence against him, ABC News reported on Thursday. Prosecutors will use them to show how Trump wasn’t a hands-off executive who didn’t really know the finer details of his companies, said Weissmann. The case centers on payoffs that were made to porn actor Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal before the 2016 election to keep quiet over alleged sexual encounters with the then-reality TV personality. “What they want to show is he is a hands-on boss, that he is frugal, he watches every dime, that’s going to be theory of their case. That’s why these statements are going to be relevant to them,” Weissmann continued. “Obviously, those are bricks that you use to build a wall […], and the defense will have to figure out how they’re going to attack that,” he added. “But that’s the reason for why those statements are going to be something that the prosecution wants to introduce to help build their case.” Watch the analysis here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

She Won't Talk To Me — What Can I Do?,judith sebesta,3/1/2024,"I have always been fascinated by forgiveness. For something so fundamentally crucial to us flawed humans, understanding it seems daunting — a concept both complicated and nebulous. I’m also fascinated by “Sex and the City” (like so many other 40- to 50-somethings, I suspect). The series sometimes foregrounded forgiveness, as did the 2008 “SATC” film, in which both Carrie and Miranda face betrayal by their respective partners. Later in the film, Carrie discovers that Miranda withheld information from her about Big’s betrayal, and she — in current terms — ghosts Miranda. Soon after, Miranda confronts Carrie and begs for forgiveness. Carrie responds, “You badger me to forgive you in three days — and you won’t even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago.” When Miranda protests that it is not the same thing, Carrie counters simply, “It’s forgiveness.” But is it that simple? I always assumed so. I’ve also (upon reflection, somewhat self-righteously) prided myself on how freely I forgive, believing that doing so helps the offended as much as the offender. But then, I haven’t been on the side of needing forgiveness until recently, when I became responsible for the death of my sister’s beloved dog. My sister and her husband live three hours north of me. When they needed to attend a funeral in a city two hours south of me, I offered to watch their dog, Peggy Sue. She was recovering from an injury and needed more care than my sister’s pet sitter could give. I did not know Peggy Sue well, as she was a relatively recent addition to their family; extremely shy and timid, she rarely interacted with me when I visited. But I have always considered myself a huge dog lover, as well as an experienced dog guardian/sitter. In fact, when my sister and I were teens, we ran an informal neighborhood business, J&J Pet Sitting. And I have been a “dog mom” to multiple dogs in my adulthood, including my current golden retriever, Hudson. My sister and brother-in-law arrived on a Monday to drop off Peggy Sue. This was the first time that they visited my present home, but I had described my small yard and “see-through” iron fence — the bars of which were strong but vertical, spaced about 4 inches apart. My sister expressed some concerns about the fence, suggesting that I would need to keep her dog on a leash, and I agreed. However, upon arriving at my home, she reversed this advice, as it seemed physically impossible for Peggy Sue to squeeze through the bars. I imagine you can guess what happened. About two hours after my sister and her husband departed, I took Peggy Sue, sans leash, into my yard, staying close by her. My neighbor Fernando, walking by, stopped to ask if I had gotten a new dog after the passing, at the ripe old age of 18, of my second dog, Dinah, in April last year. As I began to answer, Peggy Sue shot through the bars of the fence — and was gone. My neighbor and I looked at each other, equally astonished. I felt rooted to the spot, horrified, but quick-acting Fernando took off after my sister’s dog. To try to defend the seemingly indefensible, I should point out that Dinah, who had been exactly the same size as Peggy Sue, never escaped the yard herself; in fact, none of the dogs I have had or cared for was an “escape artist.” I was unaware at the time that Peggy Sue was, or how desperately she would want to escape and, I assume, find my sister. The next two hours are a blur to me. I joined Fernando in chasing after Peggy Sue, who was faster and more elusive than I ever could have imagined possible. We saw the little dog run as far as a commuter train station across from my neighborhood, and an expansive parking lot between, before disappearing into an apartment complex to the east. For a time, she kept coming into view, eventually running back into my community and even, multiple times, near my house. But each time she darted away again. As word — both verbally and through social media — quickly got around my close-knit, very dog-friendly community, kind neighbors helped search, occasionally reporting sightings of her in and around the area, but they were unable to catch her. Crying by that time, I called my brother and sister-in-law, who live a few miles away, to assist in the search. However, as the sun began to set, reports of sightings dissipated and soon ended altogether. My heart sinking, I knew it was time to call my sister, who by that time had arrived at her destination with her husband. After our difficult conversation, they decided to return to my house, arriving just before midnight. I apologized profusely for what happened, and the next 48 hours were a frantic whirlwind of searching, posting on social media, and contacting shelters and rescues. I made flyers and hand-delivered them to veterinarians in the area, in case someone found Peggy Sue and brought her in to check for her microchip. When my sister, her husband and I were back at my house, we barely interacted. I sensed that it was best to give them privacy in the guest room downstairs; I was unsure how my sister felt about me and the part I played in this. But as I sat, alone and despondent, in the living room upstairs, her heartbreaking, hysterical crying left no doubt in my mind how she felt about losing her dog. I hated causing her such pain. By Wednesday morning, with no signs of Peggy Sue, my sister and her husband returned home. I was unsure what the plan moving forward was; we did not speak before they left. I continued to search the area and check social media. Then, late that afternoon, a neighbor messaged me on Discord. He saw what he thought was Peggy Sue’s body on the service road of a nearby highway. He warned me that “it was a very difficult image to see” and that “I would maybe call professionals to identify/recover due to her condition.” Ignoring his advice, I rushed to the area. If you had told me before that week that I would soon be recovering the body of a dog from a busy road — and then driving it for three hours to deliver it to my grieving sister — I would have told you that I was incapable. But it’s amazing what we discover we can do when we have to. I will spare you the details of identifying Peggy Sue’s body, of getting it into the back of my SUV, of finding a way to store it until I could leave the next day to take it to my sister. I knew that my only path to possible redemption was returning the body to my sister and giving her closure. So much that week felt out of control, so I turned to controlling the few things I could, as difficult as they were. When I arrived at my sister’s house, my brother-in-law was outside alone to meet me. He thanked me for bringing the body home — and asked me not to contact them. So I have honored that request. I have disappeared from my sister’s life, and she from mine. As the weeks turn into months, my hopes of reconciliation — of forgiveness — diminish. But isn’t there a difference between committing an act intentionally and doing something accidentally, as I did? Isn’t the latter worthy of forgiveness? Or, since the tragic result is the same, do I not deserve it? As I contemplate this possibility, I find myself considering just what forgiveness is, and what we do when it eludes us. The Mayo Clinic defines “forgiveness” as “an intentional decision to let go of resentment and anger,” adding: “Forgiveness means different things to different people. ... The act that hurt or offended you might always be with you. But working on forgiveness can lessen that act’s grip on you.” But this is entirely from the perspective of the offended. What about the offender, the unforgiven — like me? Could I lessen my act’s grip on me? A quick search online suggests that a therapist or spiritual adviser would urge anyone seeking forgiveness to review the situation, admit responsibility, apologize, forgive themselves, and have patience. These are things that you can control, and I have done all of them. Would I have done anything differently? Not in the aftermath of Peggy Sue’s escape — I was careful to ensure that I would have no regrets about my actions then — but before, I sure wish I had erred on the side of caution and kept Peggy Sue on her leash in my yard. But I can no longer control that. Coincidentally, soon after these events, the Amazon Prime Video series “Expats” dropped. I watched the first episode unaware of the focus of the show. The opening depicts snapshots of a doctor, three pilots and a 12-year-old boy, who are all responsible for accidental but fatal tragedies. The narrator intones: “These stories always focus on the victim. The person responsible for the calamity is never mentioned. ... But I want to know about the perpetrators. I want to know about the people who caused the tragedies. People like me. Are they ever forgiven?” Now I was “people like me.” I cried through the episode. I worry about how this is affecting other family members, namely my brother, my sister-in-law and especially my elderly father (my mom passed away in 2022) — if they feel caught in the middle. Thankfully we do talk, if not about my sister and the death of her dog, and our relationships seem undamaged. I think what I have been feeling is akin to grief. I think I have been experiencing some of its classic stages, including denial, anger and depression. I know that due to my culpability, I will not be afforded the kind of sympathy reserved for those not responsible for the cause of their grief. Still, I grieve. I grieve the loss of that sweet little dog, never again to enjoy my sister’s love and the pleasures of this life. A few well-meaning family members and friends have tried to console me with “it was just a dog” or “dogs are lost/hit by cars all the time.” But that logic fails to work on this dog lover, who as an adult has grieved the deaths of four of her own canine companions, albeit all in relatively old age. I grieve the loss of my sister, which perhaps I feel all the more keenly with my mom’s recent passing. Not quite “Irish twins” but still only 19 months apart, my sister and I have always had a special bond; besides our parents, one of whom now is gone, no one has known me as long, and she always seemed there to protect me. And I grieve the loss of who I was: someone who felt secure in the knowledge that I had never knowingly caused anyone grief. One of my favorite phrases is “it is what it is.” And so, unwillingly, I guess I must face the final stage of grief: acceptance. But as the character Red in one of my favorite films, “The Shawshank Redemption,” argues: “Hope is a good thing, maybe even the best of things. And good things never die.” I admit that I hope my sister sees this essay and it convinces her to forgive me or, at the very least, reach out to try to begin to repair our broken relationship. If nothing else, this essay has helped me process what happened and move through the stages of grief. But I also hope that, if others out there reading this have been through something similar and are silently suffering, they might feel less alone because of it.

Greg Abbott As Potential VP Pick,marita vlachou,3/1/2024,"Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, said on Thursday that he is considering Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) as a potential running mate. In a joint interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump said the governor is “absolutely” included on his vice presidential shortlist. “Certainly, he would be somebody that I would very much consider,” Trump said in a joint appearance with Abbott. Trump praised Abbott as a “spectacular man,” adding that he was honored to receive his endorsement this past November. Abbott, though, told CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday that he remains focused on Texas and helping Trump win re-election in his current position as governor. “That means helping him find the right vice presidential candidate who will help President Trump get elected and then help him be successful when he does get elected,” Abbott said. “I think there’s so many people other than myself who are best situated for that.” Abbott also told CBS Wednesday he intends to run for re-election as his current term is set to expire in 2026. Asked who else is part of his VP shortlist, Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who withdrew from the GOP presidential race last year and has since campaigned with him, was another contender. “I mean, he was OK as a candidate, but he didn’t want to talk about himself. He’s a very good man,” Trump said, according to The Hill. “For me, he’s unbelievable. He’s a surrogate.” In a Fox News town hall earlier this month, Trump acknowledged Scott, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds (R), South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic presidential candidate who has since left the party, were all “solid” choices for him to consider. The next four years will change America forever.

Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) on Thursday dismissed House Republicans who have “tried and tried and tried and failed” to smear President Joe Biden ― especially when, Garcia said, the Trumps are “the real White House crime family.” Garcia criticized GOP lawmakers for their “political stunt” and “joke” impeachment inquiry against the president just one day after Hunter Biden’s closed-door deposition on his business dealings, which he said his father was not engaged in. Garcia –– who said Republicans have “zero evidence” tying Hunter Biden to any such dealings with his father –– delivered a message to GOP lawmakers as he spoke on the House floor next to a picture of Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, who both served as advisers in the Trump administration. “I want to remind everyone about the real White House crime family,” Garcia said of Kushner, former President Donald Trump’s son-in-law. He continued: “Why did Saudi Arabia give Jared Kushner $2 billion –– billion with a B –– just months after he left the Trump White House? And why did the Saudis spend hundreds of thousands of dollars at Trump properties while he was still the president?” Garcia has previously commented on the Saudi-backed private equity fund that gave $2 billion to Kushner’s investment firm six months after he left the White House. He continued: “We also know that Jared Kushner used his cushy White House job to secure a $100 billion arms deal for Saudi Arabia, and did other favors as well. Now some members of the majority actually agree that this was unethical. And in fact a few weeks ago, Jared Kushner was asked by a reporter about his grift. He responded, ‘Are we still really doing this?’ Yes, Jared, we are still really doing this.” The next four years will change America forever.

Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) should have charged a two-drink minimum for his roasting of Donald Trump while he questioned Hunter Biden in the impeachment inquiry this week. The congressman clearly wasn’t buying into House Republicans’ muddled efforts to prove that President Joe Biden illegally benefited from Hunter Biden’s business dealings when he was vice president. So Swalwell had some fun with it in the closed-door deposition. He skewered the previous White House occupant for nepotism, reported profiting off foreign governments while in office, and business deals that a court ruled were shady ― and worthy of hundreds of millions in fines. Here’s Swalwell’s exchange with Hunter Biden, according to the transcript released Thursday. SWALWELL: Any time your father was in government, prior to the Presidency or before, did he ever operate a hotel? BIDEN: No, he has never operated a hotel. SWALWELL: So he’s never operated a hotel where foreign nationals spent millions at that hotel while he was in office? BIDEN: No, he has not. SWALWELL: Did your father ever employ in the Oval Office any direct family member to also work in the Oval Office? BIDEN: My father has never employed any direct family members, to my knowledge. SWALWELL: While your father was President, did anyone in the family receive 41 trademarks from China? BIDEN: No. SWALWELL: As President and the leader of the party, has your father ever tried to install as the chairperson of the party a daughter-in-law or anyone else in the family?

Navalny was buried at a cemetery in the snowy southeastern outskirts of the capital after a short Russian Orthodox ceremony, with vast crowds waiting outside the church and then streaming to the fresh grave of President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest critic with flowers and anti-government chants. Although riot police set up barricades at both the church and cemetery, no detentions were reported. Navalny’s widow, Yulia, who was not seen at the funeral, thanked him for “26 years of absolute happiness.” “I don’t know how to live without you, but I will try to do it in a way that you up there are proud of me and happy for me,” she wrote on Instagram. The service followed a battle with authorities over the release of his body. His team said several Moscow churches refused to hold the funeral for the man who crusaded against official corruption and organized massive protests. Many Western leaders blamed the death on the Russian leader, an accusation the Kremlin angrily rejected. Navalny’s team eventually got permission from the Church of the Icon of the Mother of God Soothe My Sorrows, which was surrounded by crowd-control barriers. As his coffin was removed from the hearse and taken inside the church, the crowd waiting outside broke into respectful applause and then chanted: “Navalny! Navalny!” Some also shouted, “You weren’t afraid, neither are we!” and later “No to war!” “Russia without Putin!” and “Russia will be free!” Western diplomats, including U.S. Ambassador Lynne Tracy, were among those who attended, along with presidential hopefuls Boris Nadezhdin and Yekaterina Duntsova. Both wanted to run against Putin in the upcoming presidential elections and opposed his war in Ukraine; neither was allowed on the ballot. Images from inside the church showed an open casket with Navalny’s body covered with red and white flowers, and his parents, Lyudmila and Anatoly, sitting beside it. Navalny’s closest associates live outside Russia and made comments in a livestream of the funeral on his YouTube channel, their voices occasionally cracking with emotion. “Those people who follow what is happening, it is of course obvious to them that this man is a hero of our country, whom we will not forget,” said Nadezhda Ivanova of Kaliningrad, who was outside the church with other supporters. “What was done to him is incredibly difficult to accept and get through it.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov urged those gathering in Moscow and other places not to break the law, saying any “unauthorized (mass) gatherings” are violations. After the short church service, thousands marched to the nearby Borisovskoye Cemetery, where the police were also out in force. With the casket open, Navalny’s mother and father stroked and kissed his head. A large crowd gathered at the cemetery’s gates, chanting: “Let us in to say goodbye!” The coffin was then lowered into the ground. In keeping with his irreverent sense of humor, music from the “The Terminator 2” was played, a movie his allies said he considered “the best in the world.” Mourners streamed by his open grave, tossing handfuls of soil onto the coffin as a large crowd waited at the cemetery’s entrance. As dusk fell, workers shoveled dirt into the grave while Lyudmila Navalnaya watched. A mound of flowers, funeral wreaths, candles and a portrait of Navalny sat nearby. She had spent eight days trying to get authorities to release her son’s body following his Feb. 16 death at Penal Colony No. 3 in the town of Kharp, in the Yamalo-Nenets region about 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) northeast of Moscow. Even on Friday, the morgue where the body was being held delayed its release, according to Ivan Zhdanov, Navalny’s close ally and director of his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Authorities originally said they couldn’t turn over the body because they needed to conduct post-mortem tests. Navalnaya made a video appeal to Putin to release it so she could bury her son with dignity. Russian authorities still haven’t announced the cause of death for Navalny, who was 47. His team cited paperwork Lyudmila Navalnaya saw that listed “natural causes.” At least one funeral director said he had been “forbidden” to work with Navalny’s supporters, his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said on social media. They also struggled to find a hearse. “Unknown people are calling up people and threatening them not to take Alexei’s body anywhere,” Yarmysh said Thursday. Navalny had been jailed since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow to face certain arrest after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. His Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his regional offices were designated as “extremist organizations” by the Russian government that same year. Yulia Navalnaya accused Putin and Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin of trying to block a public funeral. “We don’t want any special treatment — just to give people the opportunity to say farewell to Alexei in a normal way,” she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Moscow authorities refused permission for a separate memorial event for Navalny and slain opposition leader Boris Nemtsov on Friday, citing COVID-19 restrictions, according to former presidential hopeful Duntsova. Nemtsov, a 55-year-old former deputy prime minister, was shot to death as he walked on a bridge adjacent to the Kremlin on the night of Feb. 27, 2015. Yarmysh also urged Navalny’s supporters around the world to lay flowers in his honor Friday. “Everyone who knew Alexei says what a cheerful, courageous and honest person he was,” Yarmysh said Thursday. “But the greater truth is that even if you never met Alexei, you knew what he was like, too. You shared his investigations, you went to rallies with him, you read his posts from prison. His example showed many people what to do when even when things were scary and difficult.” ___ More AP coverage of Alexei Navalny: https://apnews.com/hub/alexei-navalny By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/georgia-fani-willis-trump-case_n_65e1b213e4b013678e14da07,Legal Arguments To Begin Over Fani Willis' Future In Trump Case,kate brumback,3/1/2024,"ATLANTA (AP) — After several days of extraordinary testimony, the judge in the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump is set to hear arguments Friday over whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis should be removed from the prosecution over a romantic relationship. Lawyers for Trump and other defendants in the election case argue Willis’ romance with a special prosecutor she hired creates a conflict of interest. They say Willis paid outside lawyer Nathan Wade large sums for his work and then improperly benefited when he paid for vacations for the two of them. Willis and Wade have acknowledged the relationship, which they said ended last summer, but they have argued it does not create any sort of conflict and has no bearing on the case. The pair said they didn’t begin dating until the spring of 2022, after Wade was hired, and that they split travel expenses. Since the relationship was revealed in early January, the subject dominating the court’s time and the public’s attention has not been the crimes prosecutors allege Trump and his allies committed while trying to overturn the election, but rather the intimate details of Willis and Wade’s relationship. The hearings have at times wandered into surreal territory: Atlanta’s mayor watching from the gallery as a former Georgia governor testified, Willis’ father talking about keeping stashes of cash around the house and details of romantic getaways. Willis’ removal would throw the most sprawling of the four criminal cases against Trump into question as the former president seeks a return to the White House. But it wouldn’t necessarily mean the charges against him and 14 others would be dropped. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee heard details of Willis and Wade’s personal lives and conflicting accounts of when they started dating, but it remains unclear whether he will find the relationship caused a conflict of interest that merits removing the prosecutors from the case. At a hearing preceding testimony, McAfee noted that under the law, “disqualification can occur if evidence is produced demonstrating an actual conflict or the appearance of one.” He said he wanted testimony to explore “whether a relationship existed, whether that relationship was romantic or non-romantic in nature, when it formed and whether it continues.” Those questions were only relevant “in combination with the question of the existence and extent of any personal benefit conveyed as a result of the relationship,” McAfee said. Georgia State University law professor Anthony Michael Kreis, who has followed the case closely, said a lot will depend on which standard McAfee uses: an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict. “The standard I think that’s applicable is an actual conflict of interest where the evidence produced shows that Fani Willis profited off the investigation and the charging decisions that she brought against the 2020 election interference defendants,” he said. Because Willis and Wade said the relationship ended before they sought an indictment in the election interference case, it’s hard to argue the due process rights of Trump and his co-defendants were violated, Kreis said. But if McAfee applies an “appearance of conflict” standard, that could mean trouble for Willis and Wade “because the shadow has been cast over the whole thing,” he said. If Willis and her office are disqualified, a nonpartisan council supporting prosecuting attorneys in Georgia would be tasked with finding a new attorney to take over. That person could either proceed with some or all of the charges against Trump and others, or drop the case altogether. Even if a new lawyer moved forward on the path charted by Willis, the inevitable delay would seem likely to lessen the probability of the case getting to trial before November’s presidential election when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee. A Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 others in August on charges related to efforts to keep the Republican incumbent in power even though he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors, while Trump and 14 others have pleaded not guilty. Willis and Wade’s relationship was first exposed in a motion filed by an attorney for Trump co-defendant Michael Roman that sought to have the indictment dismissed and to bar Willis and Wade and their offices from continuing to prosecute the case.

Lawyers for Roman, Trump and some of the other defendants in the election case repeatedly tried during last month’s hearing to prove the prosecutors were not being truthful about when their relationship began. Robin Yeartie, Willis’ former friend and employee, testified she saw the pair hugging and kissing long before Willis hired Wade. But Wade’s former law partner and onetime divorce attorney, Terrence Bradley, expected to be a key witness for lawyers trying to disqualify Willis, was at times evasive during testimony, saying he had “no direct knowledge of when the relationship started.” Trump’s attorneys filed an analysis of location data from Wade’s cellphone that they say supports the assertion Willis and Wade began dating before he was hired. An investigator’s statement says Wade’s phone was in the neighborhood south of Atlanta where Willis was living at least 35 times in the first 11 months of 2021. Wade had testified he visited Willis’ condo fewer than 10 times before his hiring.

Brown shared the “crazy story” with Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” Thursday. The “Stranger Things” star announced her engagement to Bongiovi, the son of musician Jon Bon Jovi, in April last year. Brown said she and Bongiovi had bonded over diving and got their diving licenses together, prompting his decision to propose to her under the sea. “We were on vacation and he was like ‘Mill, you gotta be up at 8 a.m., we’re going on a dive,’” she said. “So we go under, and we’re like many meters down, and he ... gives me like a shell, and I like turn it over, and it’s a ring,” she went on. Unable to speak underwater, Brown said she struggled to communicate that she was saying yes. He put the ring on her finger, and she tried to show it to him on her hand. “As I go to show him, the ring falls off my finger. Plummets, like so fast. It was like a cinematic movie,” she continued. She said Bongiovi “threw himself” into the deep in pursuit. “The diver was like, ‘You can’t do that,’ like your ears ― you literally, your brain will explode,” she said. “He does a cinematic, like, grab, opens, and he saved the ring,” she added. She said she felt the moment was a reflection of who he is, “and I feel like we’re always gonna have each other’s back, and if anyone drops the ball, we got it.” When they surfaced, Brown said, her fiancé explained that he had asked for her mom’s ring, but Brown’s mom had said “absolutely not,” predicting he would drop it. He gave her that ring above the surface. Watch the interview below.

But one look at the staggering (and growing) list of banned books will give you a sense of what those messages are: 1982’s “The Color Purple” by Alice Walker, a sprawling novel about a queer Black girl who overcomes decades-long physical and sexual abuse through the love and support of Black women. 2019’s “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe, an illustrated story of a young protagonist exploring their identity outside the binary. 2009’s “Tricks” by Ellen Hopkins, the tale of a group of teenagers who fall prey to drug use and turn to sex work. 2017’s “Dear Martin” by Nic Stone, the story of a Black teenage boy who’s wrongfully arrested and grapples with racial injustice and Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy. 2006’s “Sold” by Patricia McCormack, a story about a young girl who is sold into slavery in India. These narratives are not completely unrelated to many young readers’ real-life experiences — and a quick glance at the news or reading the words of young people themselves could confirm that. In “The ABCs of Book Banning,” the Oscar-nominated short documentary from directors Sheila Nevins, Trish Adlesic and Nazenet Habtezghi, young people reveal their frustrations with the draconian concept of restricting their access to literature. The argument from the adult side has often been that book bans, or rulings like the British Board of Film Classification’s recent decision to increase the rating of the 1964 family film “Mary Poppins″ from “U” for Universal to PG due to “discriminatory language,” are necessary to protect kids. But are either of these tactics effective in a world where many adults, including some parents and politicians like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, want to restrict knowledge of some aspects of history entirely? As evident in “The ABCs of Book Banning,” children are more aware of — and, in many cases, more directly impacted by — the world around them than they’re given credit for. Racial profiling, gender identity and LGBTQ rights are all themes of which they are already painfully aware. The film makes it increasingly clear that many children and teens can actually handle conversations about these topics. Some adults, though, are unwilling to have them, whether a movie comes with a “parental guidance” suggestion or not. Opponents of the bans, like teachers and authors, have railed against them, fearing they serve to limit the facts from young people and “control the narrative.” In February, the Washington Post reported that managers of an Asheville, North Carolina, bookstore took in eight tons of picture books restricted by the laws in Florida, which has the highest number of banned books in the U.S. They also managed to send some books to people in the Sunshine State who requested them. In “The ABCs of Book Banning,” Ridley, a 9-year-old student in Jacksonville, struggles to understand the decision to ban “And Tango Makes Three,” Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell’s 2005 illustrated book about two male penguins who welcome a child through another penguin’s egg. “It’s about two penguins that are gay with each other and, even though they have their differences from the other penguins, they could still have a child, take care of it,” Ridley said. “They could do pretty much everything but lay an egg. They’re still human.” What’s especially critical here is that Ridley is able to note the universality and humanity of an illustrated story that centers animals. “Everyone deserves these beautiful books; to read, to learn, etcetera,” Ridley continues. “They teach them about culture, what they can be. They should be able to be what they want to be. But they can’t be without knowing what it means.” Kierran, 15, reckons with what it means to ban author Art Spiegelman’s 1986 graphic novel, “Maus,” detailing a character’s experience in the Holocaust. “I feel like if you’re trying to ban this book, you’re trying to ban Jewish history,” Kierran says plainly. “That’s like saying, ‘Well, this didn’t happen,’ which will probably just eventually lead to the same thing happening again because people don’t know it even happened in the first place.” Then the teen gets right to the meat of the issue: “Because you’re stealing knowledge. Why would you want to steal knowledge?” Kierran’s final question, to which there’s no response, lingers long after the film ends. If adolescents are able to properly discern queer themes, concentration camps and the potential of history repeating itself, they might be open to a dialogue around why, say, “hottentots” is a prejudicial term. That’s the word young “Mary Poppins” viewers encounter twice in the Disney film, and for a long time it was deemed entirely acceptable by a racist white Hollywood. It’s a racial slur historically targeting the Khoekhoe, an Indigenous people from South Africa. The word is uttered by Admiral Boom (Reginald Owen), a supporting character. To be fair, the movie’s increased rating is deserved. It also creates a vital opportunity for adults to talk to young people about why the term is so harmful. Leshu Torchin, a senior lecturer of film studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, recently told The New York Times that the new rating indicates that “children could watch a film, and if not with their parents to help contextualize things, could come away either thinking certain language is OK, or come away from it feeling harmed by what they’ve just seen.” That makes sense, in theory. But considering many adults’ efforts to outright restrict children and teens from learning history (or even present-day events) as depicted accurately in books, it’s hard to feel confident that those conversations will happen in many homes. Poet and author Nikki Giovanni, who appears in “The ABCs of Book Banning,” believes no book or hateful term should be restricted at all. That includes her own, 2005’s “Rosa,” a children’s picture book about activist Rosa Parks that has been subject to bans. “To ban it is to give it power over you,” she says. “There’s no word that should have power over you. If it’s a word, you can use it. Everyone may not like it. Everybody may not want to hear it. But you can’t give a word a power. Words have to be free.” Giovanni then puts the onus on the consumers: “We’re the ones that have to decide what to do with the words that we’re hearing and the words that we’re saying.” There’s woefully been no consensus around what that decision should be. It feels like every year now in our evolving social climate adults keep bumping into new ways to contend with or simply erase these issues, particularly when it comes to art for kids and teens. In 2021, Disney+ made the conscious choice to add a disclaimer to 18 episodes of “The Muppet Show” that contain culturally insensitive images. So the streamer maintains the episodes and its TV-G rating that suggests it’s suitable for all audiences, but encourages essential dialogue for educational purposes. Part of that warning reads as follows: “Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.” That seems more effective, assuming adults go on to have those conversations, than, say, revising inappropriate text and imagery, as the late Roald Dahl’s estate did with his children’s books just last year. As Kierran said, attempts to erase history are counterproductive. You can confront it, discuss it and try to prevent it from happening again. Because what’s to stop kids from learning and using offensive terms on their own if 1) they don’t know they’re offensive or 2) don’t understand their historical context? And what message does it send to kids when many books that are considered problematic — among a staggering 3,362 cases, according to PEN America last year — are usually ones that don’t center white, cisgender, and/or straight characters and storylines? Their themes might be uncomfortable for some. But that’s not the same as being harmful. And that lack of distinction could have a detrimental impact on young readers. “By putting restrictions on who gets to claim shelf space, school boards are telling marginalized kids — especially those who are LGBTQ+ and/or kids of color — that their very existence is invalid,” Pooja Makhijan reported in Parents magazine last year. “That’s exactly what these book bans are meant to imply.” At a time when media literacy is devastatingly low, we should be bolstered by the fact that many children and teens are hungry for information, historical narratives and stories from people who both share and don’t share their experiences. The more they learn, the more inquisitive and vocal they are. That should be encouraged and engaged with, not dismissed, which would only result in a new generation of ignorance. “If you were the person who helped ban this book, why?” Yeye, 9, asks about “Rosa” in “The ABCs of Book Banning.” “Do you feel like Rosa Parks is a bad person? Do you think that people should not know about her legacy? Why do you choose to do this?

Each family finds its own way to manage. Some parents are pushed out of the workforce. Others work jobs they wouldn’t take otherwise or hold down multiple jobs in order to meet their families’ needs. In order to show you how real families are navigating this child care challenge, HuffPost is profiling parents around the country. If you’d like to be featured in an installment, email us at parents@huffpost.com. Name: Crystal Maloney Location: Maryland Age: 33 Children’s ages: 7 years, 5 years, 3 years, and 10-month-old twins Occupations: Maloney works as an operational director at a largefinancial institution. Her husband, Michael, works at an IT firm. Annual household income: $230,000 Monthly household take-home pay: $9,700 Monthly child care costs: $4,000 for the nanny, plus $1,600 for two weeks of summer camp, and $160 per month for membership to an infant gym where kids can be dropped off. Work situation: Maloney works from home three days a week and from the office the other two. “I work a lot. Normally from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on most days. I’m checking my computer at least until 7:40 p.m. And that’s an improvement, whereas last year, I was working till 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. two to three times a week. “When people want you to go back into the office, it’s also, ‘Well, do you expect me to stay in the office those hours?’ The type of job that I work, people can be done trading, but my books or my risk assessment-type tasks are not done. The traders or the salespeople are gone, [but] we still need to clean and tidy and prepare for the next day. So it’s definitely a balance.” Her husband’s hours are shorter. “I’m required to work probably eight to nine hours a day. He only has to work seven, and then three days out of those five he only has to work six. He can also flex his time. In his industry, he’s not required [to do] overtime or stay late. Whereas for me, in my industry, it’s very common. It’s a give and take to just make sure it’s balanced for our kids or us, because it is a lot to manage.” Child care arrangements: “We have a full-time nanny right now, which is just amazing.” Maloney’s husband leaves early for work, and Maloney is with the kids from around 6 a.m. - 9 a.m., when the nanny arrives. The nanny stays with the children until 3 or 3:30 p.m., when their father returns from work. The family has only had the nanny since Maloney returned to work from her maternity leave after having the twins. When they had their first child, “My girlfriend was pregnant at the same time, and her abuela watched our son. We loved that.” He ended up at a nearby Montessori school, and his younger brother followed him there after a brief stint in a day care center. “When Josie [their eldest daughter] came home [from the hospital] and I was on maternity leave, I was like, ‘Look, let’s just bring [the boys] home. We can save money.’ And I was actually debating quitting and just becoming a stay-at-home mom. I think the reason I went back [was] because Josie was born in 2020 and she was a COVID baby. So when I went back [to work], there was no talk of me having to go into the office, and I was like, ‘This is amazing. We’ll just make that work.’ I worked from home with them, with some help here and there, but mostly it was me and them for a year to maybe two years.” Maloney described what this period of working from home looked like: “I baby-wear, I breastfeed, I have a standing desk, and we raised our children to be independent but not unattended. I would be baby-wearing while on a call, and I could make my kids breakfast. We would do home-school in the morning and then they would go out. I also had neighbors’ support, so like the neighbor [might] help and take them for a walk. Then my husband came home early, because he didn’t take his full paternity leave. He would be home at noon, so I was really only working for four or five hours by myself. That was the first year. Then from there, the kids and I and Josie, we all had just like a schedule and it actually worked really well for us.” Given the circumstances, her managers were supportive. “It’s not like people didn’t know that they were home. It was in the midst of COVID. Our baby was born with several heart problems. She would be more susceptible to have a severe reaction to COVID, so my managers were all aware. I was like, ‘Look, they’re home because it’s not safe. And that’s that.’” Eventually, Maloney sent her daughter to the same Montessori school her sons had attended. “She really liked it.” “When I had the twins, I did the same thing. I was like, ‘OK, I’m done. I’m staying home.’ It’s actually a running joke. Every time I have a kid, I’m like, ‘All right, I’m not going back to work, not doing it.’ At the end of my maternity leave, I was like, ‘Hey, let’s try just a little bit.’” Maloney had imagined she’d feel comfortable stepping away from her job once she had accumulated six figures in her retirement account, a goal she has now surpassed, but the family had just purchased a home that needed much more renovating than they initially anticipated, so going back to work seemed to make sense. While she pays the nanny more than she takes home with her paycheck, Maloney saves “aggressively” and uses FSA and HSA accounts. The family’s insurance also comes through her job. While the dollars don’t seem to add up, her financial contribution to the family remains substantial. For now, she said, “I’m just gonna keep working and just manage expectations on what our dream life would be.” Maloney’s husband had a stay-at-home mom, but “I didn’t grew up in a household like that. My mom, my dad — my grandmother worked until she was 70. The idea of not working, to me, is baffling.” Yet she can still imagine a point in the future where she cares for the children full time and runs “hobby businesses ― business that we’re not dependent on, but I’ll still have something to structure my mind.” Then again, when she imagines the future costs of her kids’ braces and their college education, it’s difficult to imagine making do with less income. “Sometimes like when I’m having a bad day or I’m like, ‘What am I doing?’ I just need to remember, I’m a mom that’s working. I’m not a working mom.” Her kids have always been the first priority. When she returned to work after having her first, she negotiated being able to leave the office at 3 p.m. in order to pick up her son, completing the rest of her work from home. “I was able to just go in, work till 3, get most of my structured reports done, and then pick my son up, or have my husband pick my son up, and still be a part of dinner and bedtime.” “I know that my priorities are always going to be my family. It’s just being able to say to someone, ‘This is not healthy or worth the struggle. The chokehold of this job is not worth my family’s dynamic of what we value and what we need.’” Maloney’s leave with the twins coincided with summer, so the family spent time last year vacationing and camping together. She decided not to pay her daughter’s preschool tuition again that fall, and all the children have been at home ever since. (The older two boys are home-schooled.) When her husband’s paternity leave ended in October of 2023, they hired the nanny. While the nanny enables her to work, Maloney said, “I’m still a mom while working. It’s not like when I’m home I’m not participating. I’m the default parent in a lot of aspects. I’m the rule setter, I’m the home-school planner. I am that parent. To some extent, I feel like mentally it’s about the same as if I was at home with three kids. And to some people, that’s probably crazy.” It was a bit easier during the lockdown, when others were understanding of small, child-related interruptions in the workday. Maloney says she has noticed that there is less patience for these now. It’s harder to pretend that she doesn’t hear the conversation happening right outside the door to her home office. “When people understood that I was processing two conversations it was much easier to be like, ‘OK, one minute. Let me just talk to this [person] and handle that, and I’ll be with you.’ It was a lot more grace and understanding, and just flexibility.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

People just say the most inappropriate things to us, it’s crazy.” Once, a stranger asked her husband if he was sure the children were all his. Others have insinuated that the family must rely on government assistance. “I feel like a lot of people don’t see when you have large families, the sacrifices you make at the beginning of your marriage before you even have those kids. Most of our friends still have student loans. There’s a lot of debt going on. They don’t rearrange their entire life to just be debt free. That’s a lot of freaking work.” Maloney and her husband did that work, and now, she says, “When our kid needs ear tubes put in or another kid who grows like a freaking weed [and] needs to buy new shoes, or cleats — all of that stuff. We’re not batting an eye because we already financially prepared for these things.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But if you have to shovel snow, walk your dog or make it to the train, you’ll likely have to brave the cold winter outdoors. We asked people who work outside in the winter for their warming wisdom. Before becoming the marketing director for Blue Knob Ski Resort, Donna Himes spent many winters working outdoors around ski mountains. She (and much of her staff) say the key to staying warm when it is cold outside is layering, layering and then layering some more. Further, whether you’re waiting in line or going on a walk, Himes recommends moving around enough to stay warm, but not so much that you’ll start to sweat, as your sweat in the cold can get chilly. We spoke to Himes and a variety of other people who work outside in the winter who recommended some products to stay toasty while enduring the outdoor cold.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. For those who have them, ingrown toenails need little introduction. They occur when the corner of the nail grows and curves into the skin, the result of too-tight shoes, incorrect trimming or injury to the nail. They cause inflammation that is notoriously uncomfortable: Ingrown nails can make it painful to simply wear shoes, and even cause pain when the affected nail so much as brushes against bedsheets. Discomfort from ingrowns can permeate even banal aspects of everyday life, and as a result, many folks with ingrown toenails learn to simply live with this inflammation and pain. I spent years hoping-slash-deluding myself into believing that my own ingrown big toenails, caused by years of too-tight cleats and heels, were not that disruptive to my life and would eventually improve on their own. Yet one day last year, I brushed one of my ingrowns against my carpeted floor and found myself doubled over in pain. I was forced to acknowledge that my ingrowns were not sustainable, and they were not going to get better by themselves. I combed the internet for the best home treatment for ingrowns, and found the CurveCorrect ingrown toenail treatment kit on Amazon. I’m protective over my money and was wary of spending $45 for the kit, but after reading through testimonials from reviewers who, too, were initially skeptical but were ultimately “gobsmacked” and “delighted” at its results, deeming it “worthy every penny,” I decided to take the plunge — and I’m so happy that I did. The kit is designed to treat and correct the root of the problem: a nail that is literally growing and curving incorrectly. It works by using thin tension braces, which act like springs, to slowly and gently straighten the nail. The brace also relieves pressure from the ingrown, helping ease discomfort within days, according to CurveCorrect and the experience of myself and many reviewers. The brace attaches to the affected nail using a high-bond adhesive. “For a simple, non-infected toenail that tends to become ingrown near where the nail grows out beyond the nail bed, this type of product could be helpful,” Dr. Howard E. Friedman, a podiatrist at Suffern Podiatry in New York State, told HuffPost. Of course, it’s always a good idea to visit a podiatrist if you’re experiencing pain from an ingrown toenail. If your ingrown is particularly severe, it will require surgery or an in-office procedure in order to correct it. You should not opt for home treatment if your ingrown shows signs of an infection, fungus or open wound, or if your nail has extreme curvature (greater than 180 degrees). In addition, folks with limited mobility may benefit from a second person’s help to apply the brace. The kit is not suitable for children under 8 years old. For more information, check out CurveCorrect’s website. For my purposes, I found the CurveCorrect brace to be a game-changer. Within a week of applying the brace, my ingrowns had noticeably improved and flattened. A year later, after having worn the braces for several months, I still can’t quite believe how much better my nails feel and look. Both my big toes are now even and flat, and they don’t hurt anymore, which feels like something of a miracle. Before applying the brace, I — and many reviewers — recommend that you read and re-read the instructions. The home treatment is simple enough, but should be done carefully. The main thing to keep in mind is not to push your nail to correct too quickly, so you should err on applying the brace toward the wider end of your toenail to start, where the brace will be longer and thus hold less tension. Very slight discomfort is normal when you first apply the brace, but pain is not normal. If pain does occur, take the brace off immediately. Then, if you want to continue, apply the brace with less tension — cut it longer — and apply it further down your nail, towards the wider end of the nail. As for preventing future ingrowns? “The best prevention is to allow the corners of the nails to extend beyond the nail fold and cut the nail straight across. Most ingrown nails that I see are due to people who cut the nail too short,” said Friedman over email. “Only ballerinas and sprinters need short toe nails.” Check out what reviewers have to say about the CurveCorrect kit, or grab your CurveCorrect kit now from Amazon. “I wish I’d taken a ‘before’ picture...these strips works exactly as I hoped (but doubted) they’d work! They take a little practice to get on just right. You need a steady hand, a bright light, and a gentle squeeze on the glue bottle so you don’t apply too much glue. If you get the strip applied properly, it’ll last a week or two before it comes off. They do stay a little “catchy” on the ends, even with filing, so I apply a bandaid over the strip to make sure my socks don’t catch and encourage the strip to come loose. My big toes had such a tight curl at the end that the corners were nearly meeting in the middle. After wearing for only a few days there was a noticeable change. After a week or week and a half, the nail has a very natural gentle curve at the end. I’ll wear the strip/brace until it reaches the end of the nail. I may reapply another strip closer to the nail bed to encourage correct growth until I feel certain that my nails won’t revert back to the curve. The strips don’t hurt to wear and have relieved any pain from the nails biting into my toes. I can’t be any happier with this product!!!” — Michelle  “I don’t gush about products, and am hesitant to believe gushy, exclamation point laden reviews. But this darned little system worked for mr, almost instantly. Advice - read the various reviews that go into detail re what to expect and best way to succeed. I am elderly, stiff of joint, too much belly, and can’t see worth beans. I read reviews, read through the instructions twice, and set up a sort of dry run to see where I might run into trouble. If you can possibly find one, get a helper. BUT, it can be done alone if you follow the directions. When placing the first glue laden end of the brace strip, I advise starting with the side of your toenail that is more difficult to see and reach. My ingrown nail on the big toe hurt a lot at each corner where the nail was digging in as well as on the bottom of the toe. In less than an hour after the brace was glued into place, nothing hurt. I kept poking and squeezing, not quite willing to believe. This was a toe that was so sore that even the sheet on it would increase the pain. Shoes were limited to thongs and clogs. Three days after I applied the little strip, I went for a pedicure, fully expecting the brace strip to fall off in the swirling foot bath. Nope. The tech filed down the blunt ends a bit then treated the nail like the other nine. 52 hours later and all is well.” — Stephanie L. “I highly recommend this product. I learned about it online and had only other reviews to convince me if it works or not. I took the chance and I am so glad I did. My guess is you will be, too, but they have a satisfaction guarantee so it’s really no risk. I always thought the shape of my toes was just one of those things that I couldn’t change about myself and that occasional pain & pressure from my toenails getting longer was inevitable. I put these braces on two days ago. Within 2 hours on the first day I could already feel tremendous relief on my left foot- like the edge of my toenail was being gently lifted away from my toe...not at all painfully the way it feels when something is beneath the nail pushing it up. I wore socks and shoes yesterday and the braces didn’t snag or feel uncomfortable. I didn’t know if I got the edges all the way glued down so I was worried, but they were fine. Today I can feel the differences on both feet, and my left foot already seems like I have a whole different toenail shape. It used to start wide at the base and then get narrower toward the tip but now it’s the same width all the way up and I am 100% PAIN FREE for the first time in probably 10 years.The difference is so noticeable that I’ve come to realize my former version of “normal” was actually barely tolerable and I’d simply grown accustomed to it. I hate that it took me this long to find a product that could help. But I also LOVE that this product exists.” — Julie H. “I was very dubious about this product initially. I’ve had ingrown toenails on both big toes for around 15 years and I’ve tried everything in the past including removing both nails, seeing podiatrists etc, all whom have said the only way to fix permanently was to have the ingrown part surgically removed to stop that area of the nail growing back. Whilst this may seem like a good option for some, I just didn’t want to have narrow big toenails, so I declined each time and carried on with my severely curved nails. As the ingrown part did not hurt I guess I just put up with it! Last year my nails also started to grow ridged and very thick, which was awful for me and I needed to come up with another plan. After researching loads of products/tools/creams/remedies etc I came across this product and thought I’d give it a go. I was not disappointed. In fact I was shocked at how good it has worked. I’ve needed to use 3 times (on both toes), but after just the first time i could see huge improvements in just a couple of weeks. The strips stayed on for around 4-5 weeks each time, and now I can say for the first time in years and years, I finally have semi-flat big toe nails and I’m DELIGHTED with this product. I had to pay for shipping to the UK as the product is not available here, but it was worth every penny. I just wish I had found it years ago. Be patient with the process, follow the instructions VERY CAREFULLY, in fact read them over and over before you start and it will make sure the application works and fits first time. Don’t hesitate, this product has changed everything for me, I can now wear pretty open toed shoes and sandals without embarasment for the first time in over a decade. Very Happy.” — Mrs P By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Exercise is good for many different reasons. It directly affects all of the factors that go into a long, healthy life — mobility, heart health, brain health, muscle strength and more, said Jonathan Zins, a physical therapist at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. Exercise also contributes to the cycle of healthy aging. And, according to experts, there are a few types you should do if you are hoping to boost your longevity. Here’s what they are: Cardiovascular exercise — like running, biking, dancing, boxing and more — is full of benefits that can help you age well. Cardiovascular activity focuses on strengthening your heart. “Nothing else really can strengthen it better than a cardio workout,” said Sandra Corcione, a personal trainer at FITloft Gym in New Jersey. Specifically, aerobic exercise can lower your risk for heart disease (which is the No. 1 killer of American adults). It also helps lower blood pressure and your risk of diabetes, which are two heart disease risk factors. Beyond this, cardiovascular exercise also is good for brain health, Zins said. “The brain responds very quickly to exercise. Just three hours of aerobic exercise a week can greatly increase brain perfusion — so, getting more blood supply up to the brain and reducing inflammation.” Working out may even help prevent some cases of dementia, Zins noted. In fact, according to the U.K.-based Alzheimer’s Society, you can reduce your risk of dementia by roughly 28% by doing regular exercise. When doing aerobic exercise, you want to be out of breath, Zins added. Your heart rate should be at 60% to 80% of your heart rate max, which can be calculated online or through a fitness tracker. For example, if your max heart rate is 185 beats per minute, a heart rate of 111 to 148 would put you in that 60% to 80% target. Or you can do the “talk test” to determine where your heart rate is. “If you’re having difficulty having a conversation because you have to take lots of breaths to get your oxygen supply up, that’s a good sign that you’re working at a moderate to vigorous intensity. But if you’re able to have a conversation... you know the intensity is really not high enough,” Zins said. “Weightlifting helps you maintain bone mass, bone density and muscle mass,” according to Corcione, which are three areas known to deteriorate as you age. What’s more, strength training can help with falls, which are an unfortunate reality for many older people. “The reason why falls are so bad is because we can get broken bones,” Zins explained. “An 80-year-old is estimated to have about 40% of the muscle strength as a 20-year-old, but that’s not just because our muscles magically disappear when we get older. A lot of that is because we stop moving when we get older, and we stop using our muscles.” “There’s a very well-established body of evidence saying that progressive resistance training is safe and effective in older adults,” he continued. If you’ve never lifted weights before, he suggests working with a health care professional to get started safely. Additionally, you can look into strength training classes in your community. Experts can help you determine the right weight for you to lift. Something too light won’t challenge you, while something too heavy could lead to injury. “Falls are the greatest cause of [injury-related] death in folks over 65 and 1 in 3 older adults are going to fall every single year,” Zins said. Falls can also lead to impaired mobility in older folks, “and when we’re not mobile, we’re not able to live our lives how we want to,” he added. “Mobility is essential for living a good life.” Exercise helps keep you mobile and, specifically, balance training can be an effective way to avoid falls. Balance training is varied but can include activities like tennis, standing on one leg and tai chi, Zins said. However, it’s important that you don’t dive into balance training if you are older or feel like your balance is already off. “I would say go to a physical therapist, where they can give you an individualized plan, and then follow that up with just a community exercise class that works specifically on balance,” Zins explained. “Because nobody wants to be fearful of losing their balance when they’re in the comfort of their own home.” Social connection is a major part of aging well and living a long life, Zins stressed. When compared to people who live with family or in a community, people who live alone live shorter lives. If you can join an exercise class in your community, you’ll benefit not only from the exercise, but from social connection, too. In reality, many folks don’t like certain workouts — whether it’s strength training or balance work or aerobic exercise — and don’t do exercise at all as a result.

Whatever activity keeps you moving regularly and consistently is the workout you should prioritize. Don’t let a distaste for strength training keep you from exercising altogether. If you like dancing, do that. Or if you are a fan of running, do that. No matter what you decide to do, it’s important to commit to enough exercise each week. “Our catchphrase is 150 plus two, so 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise, plus two days of strength training is going to be the recommendation,” Zins said. “The key here is to stay consistent with that activity ... the gains happen when you consistently do something for years and throughout your life, even as you get older,” Corcione noted.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/beauty-influencers-transparent-costs-of-procedures_l_65dcdcebe4b0e4346d53575b,These Beauty Influencers Are Getting Real About The Costs Of All Their Procedures,brittany wong,3/1/2024,"Last month, a video went viral showing aesthetician nurse Miranda Wilson pointing out every cosmetic procedure she had done in 2023. In the clip, the 30-year-old beauty influencer says she had Botox twice last year ($1,000 total), masseter Botox once to achieve a more defined jawline ($1,200), two lip flips ($100 each) and traptox ― or Barbie Botox, as it’s been called ― once ($1,600), for shoulder slimming and tension relief. Wilson then moves on to injectables: She gets Volbella lip injections once a year to maintain her lip shape ($650) and two vials of Sculptra injected to restore volume in her face ($1,600 total). Lastly, to rejuvenate her skin, three or four times a year she gets vampire facials, which involve taking a sample of your own blood, extracting the plasma and then injecting it back in your face with microneedling. (The treatment, less frighteningly called microneedling with PRP, runs anywhere from $500 to $1,300 per session.) The video received more than 1 million views ― and a wide range of reactions. Though some applauded Wilson for her transparency, others said they found the endless upkeep inherent in such a beauty regimen to be “incredibly sad.” “This woman (absolutely gorgeous) is the perfect example of when men say a woman is ‘naturally beautiful’ but really they’ve had all of these procedures,” one person wrote of the clip on X (formerly Twitter). This woman (absolutely gorgeous), is the perfect example of when men say a woman is “naturally beautiful” but really they’ve had all of these procedures. pic.twitter.com/c2nB5UjaGr Wilson isn’t the only one lifting the veil on costly med-spa procedures. Along with influencers, celebrities including Kylie Jenner and Ariana Grande all fessed up to lip fillers and Botox in the last year. (Jenner doing so after years of vehemently denying she’d ever touched her face.) Though the admissions are relatively small ― no one is admitting to a Brazilian butt lift (BBL), a BBL reversal (yes, they have those now) or a face-lift ― it’s a welcome relief after years of celebrities either denying having work done or chalking their youthful appearances up to a skin care product they’re promoting or upping their water consumption. (Or, in Olivia Munn’s case, lots of water and Japanese potatoes.) Dawn Montieth is among the influencers getting frank about her noninvasive cosmetic procedures. An aesthetic injector in Southern California with more than 78,000 followers on TikTok, Montieth said she created her “What I’ve Had Done” video because she didn’t want to gatekeep procedures. Being honest with her followers also felt more ethical than pretending her perfect skin and taut jawline were simply the results of miracle beauty products you could find at Sephora. “When you’re on social media, it’s easy to get caught up in the allure of flawless influencers, but it’s crucial to remember that what we see is often just the highlights and not the full picture,” she said. Many influencers who undergo treatments stay quiet about them to preserve the lucrative deals they have with beauty brands; if you mention that you just got $600 worth of Restylane lip filler and then hawk a $30 “plumping” lip gloss the next day, you might as well kiss any future brand deals or sponsorships goodbye. But Montieth thinks most influencers ― and celebrities ― who are tight-lipped are just self-conscious and worry about the judgment they’ll receive if they’re frank about cosmetic work. “That’s why I wanted to create a safe and honest space to openly share my experiences,” she said. “By shedding light on these topics, I want to empower others to make informed choices about their own beauty journeys.” (Of course, given her line of work, it’s also good for business to promote such procedures.) Sabryna Salmon, a 30-year-old content creator from Los Angeles, created a two-part series pointing out the procedures she had done before turning 30: Kybella under her chin and knees cost $500 or $600, but it was worth it, she says in one clip. Sculptra to get a rounder butt was definitely not worth it, since it requires around 10 sessions at $900 a pop. Salmon sees her videos as part of the de-influencing trend on TikTok: Since last year, many influencers have started creating videos in which they dissuade their followers from buying certain cult-favorite products they personally find subpar. “Some of these procedures can be expensive!” Salmon told HuffPost. “I’d hate to see anyone waste their hard-earned money.” She added, “I’m certainly not promoting anything, just lifting the veil on the reality of beauty procedures; at my heart I’m just a girl’s girl and happy to share.” #cosmeticprocedures #ipllaser #fillersinjection #botox Penny Gsell, a 27-year-old from Philadelphia, spends around $600 a year on procedures. In her “What I’ve Had Done” video, she rated the treatments on a scale of 1 to 10. At 9/10, lip filler is “a must.” “They’ve completely changed my confidence,” she says in her clip. Septorhinoplasty to straighten her nose and improve nasal breathing got a mere 5/10. Gsell said her goal is to remind young girls that what they see on their Instagram feeds can be just as deceptive as what she’d see in Teen Vogue and Cosmo when she was growing up and impressionable: Size 1 or 2 models whose photos were edited to the nth degree, even though they didn’t need it. “When I grew up and learned about cosmetic procedures, I knew that if I was to ever get anything done that I would never want a little girl to look at me and think, ‘I’ll never look like her’ or compare herself to me without knowing that I’ve had work done,” she told HuffPost. “I always like to add the disclaimer that what I speak about only pertains to me and work I’ve had done. Everyone is beautiful, and no one needs to have work done.” Gsell also wants to dispel the idea that people who get work done are “fake” or insecure. “You live one life in one body,” she said. “I believe if you want to get something done to your one body to make yourself feel the best you can in your one life, then you should absolutely be able to do so without judgment.” We are all about transparency so let me know what questions you have! #cosmeticprocedures #honestreviews #greenscreen Briana Merriweather, a 30-year-old from Alabama, made a video on her procedures for the same reasons as Gsell. (She told HuffPost she spent about $8,000 on various procedures last year.) “I used to compare myself to women on Instagram and feel so inadequate,” she said. “I’m committed to making sure my presence doesn’t make others feel inferior.” Her hope is that her honesty will inspire more influencers to be candid about their own cosmetic procedures. “Even those who may not appear to have had any work done are likely utilizing treatments like Botox,” she said. #greenscreen #fyp #beauty #beautytok #2023 #beautyprocedures #cosmeticprocedure #cosmetic #aestheticprocedures #girls #filler #veeners #teethehitening #viral #beforeandafter #tiktokshop An argument could be made that these videos are largely positive, helping to reset people’s ideas of reality so they’re not fooled by every Instagram model they see: These influencers are naturally beautiful, yes, but thousands of dollars worth of treatment certainly helps, too. There’s a reason those collages featuring pics of celebrities before and after plastic surgery are so popular: “You’re not ugly, you’re just poor,” the caption dependably reads ― this generation’s “maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s Maybelline.” People want reassurance that the 10s they see online are genetically gifted, just not that genetically gifted. But a case could also be made that influencers are normalizing these kinds of intensive treatments, setting already sky-high beauty standards even higher with each new viral procedure: fox eye lifts, buccal fat removal, Barbie Botox, lip flips ― the list of Instagram Face micro-adjustments you can get, with a Groupon discount, no less, grows by the day. In light of the “growing social acceptance” of such noninvasive procedures, plastic surgeons say demand for such treatments are at an all-time high; there was an increase of 26.2 million nonsurgical procedures, like lip fillers and Botox, performed in the United States last year alone. “There are definitely two sides to this trend,” said Charlotte H. Markey, the director of the Health Sciences Center at Rutgers University, Camden, and the author of “The Body Image Book for Girls.” “On the one hand, it can be helpful for people to see that the beauty they see online is not natural, that it’s a result of procedures,” she told HuffPost. “On the other hand, it can easily lead people, especially vulnerable people, to feel like their bodies are projects and that there’s a never-ending list of things they need to ‘fix.’” Because these procedures are priced more reasonably than, say, breast enhancements or liposuction, the allure of getting one (or five) is even stronger. In some ways, it levels the playing field, said Jess Sprengle, a licensed professional therapist who specializes in treating eating disorders. The mysteries of poreless skin, perfect facial balance and perfect teeth aren’t such mysteries when one influencer has unpacked the procedures she’s had done to achieve the look: Fraxel laser treatment, rhinoplasty, dermal fillers, veneers and the rest of it. “You might see a perfect-looking photo of someone and think, ‘Oh, I remember that X said they get procedures done, and it seems like this is common. I’m not going to look that way because I’m not getting those procedures,’” Sprengle said. “Of course, in the photo, they could also be using a filter.” Still, Sprengle wishes that as a culture, we could explore our obsession with youth and aesthetic perfection rather than skipping ahead to normalizing these procedures, especially for young people. “It’s not so dissimilar to the recent discourse around Ozempic and other weight loss drugs,” she said. “We’re seeing people talk at length about the negative side effects of the meds, and there’s increased normalization of very adverse symptoms because, well, the person got to be thin at the end of it, so it must be worth it!” Transferred to this topic, Sprengle said, there’s a strong message that the influencer “looks like this now and they’re beautiful and thriving!” None of the negatives, such as body image issues or obsession with youth, seem to matter as much.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-drinks-for-sleep_l_65d6485be4b007e3eb73f7ca,Do You Have Issues Sleeping? These Foods And Drinks Could Be To Blame.,emily laurence,3/1/2024,"If you’re one of the millions of Americans who struggle with sleep, you’ve likely tried all the most-talked-about remedies. Maybe there’s chamomile tea in your pantry and melatonin supplements in your bathroom cabinet. You already know it’s not a good idea to consume caffeine in the late afternoon and that even though that glass of wine may help you initially drift off to sleep, you’re going to wake up in the middle of the night regretting it. Still struggling? You could be unknowingly consuming something that’s to blame. According to sleep doctors, there are more foods and drinks that can mess with sleep than people realize. Rounded up here are seven foods and drinks that sleep doctors recommend steering clear of if you struggle with sleep. Plus, they offer guidance on which foods will work for you, not against you. Digging into some hot chicken wings or curry at dinner could cause sleep problems when you head to bed. Dr. Abhinav Singh, a board-certified sleep medicine and internal medicine doctor, is medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center and a medical reviewer for Sleep Foundation. He told HuffPost that eating food that’s spicer than you’re used to can increase acidity in the stomach, which can cause acid reflux that can make sleeping difficult. Singh explained that gastric acid is already naturally higher at night, and if it continues to rise, it can disrupt sleep. Dr. Ruchir P. Patel, a sleep medicine doctor and medical director of The Insomnia and Sleep Institute of Arizona, agreed. “Eating spicy food close to going to bed can cause acid reflux, which can trigger the brain to wake up excessively.” In addition to triggering acid reflux, Singh said, spicy food can make people feel hotter, which can also disrupt sleep. Patel said many people don’t realize that tomato sauce can be an acid reflux trigger, which can disrupt sleep similarly to the effect of spicy food. That means having pizza or spaghetti for dinner could keep you up. In general, Patel said, it’s best to avoid eating food that’s high in sodium and saturated fat (like pizza, especially if it has pepperoni) three hours before bed because it takes longer to digest, which can then cause sleep problems. Like greasy pizza, burgers are another food that takes the body longer to digest. For this reason, Singh said, eating a big, juicy burger too close to bedtime could keep you up, especially if it has ketchup on it, which, again, can trigger sleep-disrupting acid reflux. If you want a burger that will help with sleep rather than disrupt it, choose a plant-based burger made with lentils, which Singh said are easier to digest, or, if you are going to have beef, go for as lean a cut as possible. You might want to resist having a bowl of ice cream for dessert if you’re dealing with sleep issues. Dr. Raj Dasgupta, the chief medical adviser for Sleep Advisor, told HuffPost that foods high in sugar, such as ice cream, can keep you up. “The high sugar content can cause fluctuations in your blood sugar, cause stomach issues and keep you alert at bedtime, preventing you from relaxing and falling asleep,” he said. Singh also said that chocolate ice cream in particular can keep you up. “Many people don’t know that chocolate has caffeine,” Singh said, adding that dark chocolate has more caffeine than milk chocolate. Singh explained that the high fat, high sugar and high caffeine in chocolate ice cream is a triple whammy in terms of disrupting sleep. In movies, TV shows and children’s books, kids are often given a glass of milk before bedtime. But in real life, Patel said, this can make falling asleep harder. “Milk can trigger acid reflux,” he said, adding that this can happen to both children and adults. Patel explained that the lactose in milk can be problematic. If you are prone to acid reflux but want to have milk in the evening, his advice is to choose a plant-based milk, which is lactose-free and shouldn’t cause symptoms. Though most people know that caffeine can disrupt sleep, Patel revealed that not everyone realizes they’re consuming something with caffeine in it. “Some fancy water brands, like vitaminwater, can have up to 50 milligrams of caffeine,” he said. Singh added that some electrolyte drinks or powders can also contain caffeine. Sucking on a peppermint after dinner or sipping peppermint tea seems pretty innocuous. But Singh said that this can cause sleep problems for some people. Why? Like many other foods on this list, he said that peppermint can trigger acid reflux, a link most people aren’t aware of. Now that we know greasy foods, spicy foods and ice cream are off the menu, what can you eat that will work in your favor? All three sleep doctors recommend eating a dinner that includes complex carbs, fiber and lean protein. Examples of complex carbs high in fiber are most vegetables, brown rice, lentils, beans, whole wheat bread and quinoa. Examples of lean protein are poultry and fish.

Scientific research backs this up, showing that a diet high in fiber, complex carbs, protein and unsaturated fats is connected with good sleep. Singh says that meal timing matters, too. If you are going to eat close to bedtime or want a nighttime snack, he recommends keeping the portion small, under 300 calories. “A handful of nuts is a good nighttime snack because it has fiber and unsaturated fats,” he said. What we eat and drink has a powerful effect on the body, including how well (or not) we sleep.

And if you’re someone who considers dining and drinking an experience more than a necessity, then you may want to plan your entire vacation around destinations with unbelievable fare. But while viral TikTok videos and skewed restaurant reviews can sometimes lead you astray, there’s one group of people who certainly know where to go: chefs. These experts aren’t just pros at their craft, but they know their way around a menu, whether it’s a fine dining meal, huge food market or a street food cart. We asked chefs from across the country for their favorite places to travel to for good food (aside from the town where their restaurants are located) that they feel are attainable and affordable. Here’s what they said: Amanda Shulman, the chef and owner of Philadelphia’s Her Place Supper Club and co-owner of Philadelphia’s My Loup, recently returned from her honeymoon in Thailand where she said the food was incredible. She recommended “any single street food cart that serves plump Thai pork sausages stuffed with vermicelli noodles — a sour fermented pork sausage, grilled over charcoal until it is swollen and glistening, nearly popping out of its casing.” “Fatty and tangy and incredible, I grabbed them whenever I could,” Shulman said. “In Chiang Mai, there’s a roadside restaurant called Neng’s Earthen Jar Roast Pork filled with clay barrels rendering fat pork bellies until the skins are shatteringly crisp,” Shulman continued. In Northern Thailand, laarb, which is “finely minced pork dressed in fish sauce, chilis, herbs and rice powder,” and khao soi, a rich curry noodle soup, are mainstays on many menus. Shulman recommended Aroon Rai, a small restaurant in Chiang Mai for these items. In Bangkok, Shulman said “Sorn was one of the best fine dining experiences I’ve ever had. Every bite was unabashedly delicious, the technique was evident and tight, and I’ll be dreaming of swiping warm roti into beef curry maybe forever.” “The modern London dining scene is, I think, the most exciting dining scene anywhere in the world,” said Ed Szymanski, the chef and owner of Dame and Lord’s in New York City. London has restaurants that feature high-quality produce coming from France, Spain and Italy, as well as seafood from the northern parts of the U.K. “All of these things come together to create this very diverse dining scene,” Szymanski said. Many restaurants serve modern British cuisine, including Planque, St. JOHN and Noble Rot, but the city’s food options don’t stop at British food. You can find great Pakistani, Indian, Spanish, Italian food, and more. Or, for an all-in-one spot for local food and drinks, visit Borough Market where “you walk around and get some snacks, and you can have oysters shucked right in front of you, have a glass of champagne, and then go and have a sausage roll after that,” he said. An oft-overlooked cuisine is Guatemalan food, which is known for its stews, and all things corn and beans, like corn tortillas, tostadas, tamales, empanadas, and pupusas loaded with cheese and beans, said Sofia Deleon, the owner of El Merkury in Philadelphia and the Guatemalan rum brand Tenango Rum. She added that the cuisine naturally has lots of gluten-free and vegetarian options, too. “One of my favorite places to go when I visit is Mercado Central, the central market, because it’s a one-stop shop for everything [in Guatemala City],” Deleon said. Here you can find produce stands, meat purveyors and vendors selling handwoven items, in addition to food stands selling fresh tostadas loaded with avocado, parsley and cheese, and traditional Guatemalan desserts like a condensed milk treat known as canillita de leche. Ceviche used to be a popular food throughout Guatemala but has since decreased in popularity. In Antigua, though, (which is about 1.5 hours from Guatemala City), she recommends you order ceviche at Hugo’s Ceviches. The restaurant “has been around forever, and it’s the one place that still maintains their standard and is really good,” she noted, adding Hugo’s Ceviches is also known for their micheladas made with Gallo, Guatemala’s local beer, along with the regular fixings like chilis and Worcestershire sauce. Also in Antigua is La Cuevita de Los Urquizú, which comes highly recommended by Deleon as well. “What’s nice about this place is ... it’s almost like a buffet where you can buy things by the pound, and they have 50 to 75 varieties of very traditional foods that you would otherwise not get to try if you went anywhere else,” she said. For traditional sweets, visit Doña María Gordillo in Antigua, which has been around since the 1800s. “Originally, based on Spanish-style sweets, but then it was adapted to Guatemalan flavors, so they have everything from the tamarind balls to chilacayote en dulce, which is like a type of Guatemalan pumpkin” in addition to tasty egg tarts. New Orleans has some of “the most diverse and delicious food experiences — there’s not enough stomach space to devour all the good the city has to offer,” Shulman said. The city is beloved for its food culture, which comprises Southern, Creole, Cajun and French cooking — think jambalaya, gumbo, beignets, and more. One affordable item on menus across the city are po’boys, a sandwich that’s traditionally made with fried shrimp, roast beef or fried oysters, and served on crusty bread. For a good po’boy, followed by lemon Hubig’s Pies (a sweet New Orleans hand pie), Shulman recommends Frady’s One Stop. For the New Orleans’ classic muffuletta (an Italian sandwich made with an olive salad, cured meat, cheese on a round roll) visit Central Grocery, according to Shulman. Additionally, she suggests Cane & Table, a seasonally-focused restaurant that specializes in Caribbean and Cuban food, and Dakar, which serves Senegalese food. Or for something more special, try Mosquito Supper Club, which is Shulman’s “crush of a restaurant — sitting at the bar and eating pickled shrimp and other small bites was a magical experience.” Cape Town, South Africa, is a destination that’s full of complex local flavors along with fresh produce, and lots and lots of great wine, said Deleon. Plus, it’s relatively inexpensive and totally beautiful, she noted. Specifically, the region is known for its Chenin Blanc wines, a type of white wine that is light and crisp. One of Deleon’s favorite places to drink South African wine is Babylonstoren Wine Estate, a winery where everything is grown in-house, from the olives for the olive oil to the grapes for the wines. In addition to wine, Deleon said Cape Town is known for its Cape Malay food, “which is a mix of Malaysian and Indian and South African flavors.” You’ll find curry on many menus throughout the city, she said, and you’d be remiss not to try it. One spot for curry she recommends is Curry Club, where you can choose from a menu of chicken curries, lamb curries and veggie curries, ranging from mild to spicy. Mexico City is another great place to eat, according to Szymanski. “There’s an unending list of places to go in Mexico City.” “Mexico City is one of the largest and most eclectic cities in the world, and the rich tapestry of street vendors, markets, high-end restaurants and mezcal bars means there’s always a fun discovery around the corner,” said Szymanski. Mexico City is known for a range of food, including its fresh tacos, making taquerias a must, according to Szymanski. Among his taqueria recommendations is El Torito, where they serve two kinds: suadero (which is like a beef brisket) and tripa (tripe) or a mix of both. The area is also known for its barbacoa (slow-cooked lamb). And mezcal, a Mexican liquor made from agave, is worth being sought out, too. Additionally, you should just “follow your nose and eat the street tacos that look good, eat the quesadilla, go to a market in Mexico and eat the thing that looks good. You have to trust your instincts and wait in line if there is a line because there’s a good chance someone else knows something that you don’t.” “Mexican cuisine is such a huge part of American cuisine that I am always drawn to Mexico,” Gregory Gourdet, chef and founder of Kann and Sousòl in Portland, Oregon, told HuffPost via email. “I was blown away by my first trip to Oaxaca in 2021. The history and culture is so rich.” In Oaxaca, you’ll find foods such as moles, which is a traditional Mexican sauce, barbacoa, tlayudas (a traditional Oaxacan dish made of a crunchy tortilla topped with things like beans, meat, veggies and cheese), and tamales, in addition to the local fruits and vegetables that are grown there, said Gourdet. As far as where specifically to go in the city, Gourdet said, “Criollo and Alfonsina are both incredible restaurants.” You can also visit the Zapotec village of Teotitlan del Valle to take part in traditional cooking classes at El Sabor Zapoteco, he noted. Additionally, the city is home to sprawling food markets that are must-visits during any trip. And beyond this, it’s a good destination for those with certain allergies, too. “My dietary distinctions include being gluten and dairy-free, and corn-based Oaxacan cuisine is extremely accommodating. I was often told I was missing out by not indulging in the legendary local cheese, however,” Gourdet said. “I can almost guarantee you that nobody will have chosen the place that I was going to propose speaking about which is Corsica. Specifically, the northern half of Corsica, which is referred to as Haute Corse,” said Tyler Akin, the chef-partner of Le Cavalier in Wilmington, Delaware, and Bastia, a coming soon coastal Mediterranean restaurant in Philadelphia. Corsica is an island, so it’s natural to think that seafood is the focal point. And while you can find great options (Akin suggests stopping in the town of Centuri for spiny lobster and sea urchin), the food here centers on cooking traditions from the mountainous region. “Unlike Sardinia to the south, you see these alpine cheese traditions and more land-animal-driven cuisine than seafood-driven cuisine,” Akin said. This includes high-quality charcuterie products, chestnuts and mushrooms. Akin said it’s best to go to Corsica during the offseason. “It’s really cool to be one of very few people there anytime but [specifically] May through October because you have an opportunity to really connect with the people.” “One of the highlights there for me was the charcuterie that was produced,” said Akin, who added that a favorite producer of his was Les Delices de Castellu, which has “these incredibly natural products, wild boar salamis, and the signature sausage of Corsica which is figatellu.” Additionally, he said you should try migliacciu, which are pancakes stuffed with a ricotta-like cheese known as brocciu. Another must-visit? Patrimonio, which is Corsica’s wine region where natural, organic wines are the focal point. In the university town of Corte, seek out baked goods from Casanova Patisserie, which makes a little cheesecake called falculelle and fresh fruit ice cream, and Fritelle Curtinese for the best beignets on the island and a herb pie made with lard, maquis herbs and maquis herbs. When you think of Austin, you likely think of tacos and barbecue — and that’s for good reason. These foods are woven into the history of the area and can be found all throughout the neighborhoods of the city. Andrew Taylor, the chef/owner of Big Tree Hospitality in Portland, Maine, which operates Eventide Oyster Co., the Honey Paw and Hugo’s, along with some artisan food markets, said Austin is the place that’s stood out to him most when it comes to food destinations. ”[I’m] just really impressed with the food ... it actually reminded me a little bit of Portland in that it’s not a huge town but it felt like the quality of restaurants, the breadth of the restaurant scene was exceptional and punched way above its weight,” Taylor stated. There are barbecue institutions like Franklin Barbecue and la Barbecue in Austin itself, in addition to options outside of town, too. He added that it’s hard to find a bad meal in Austin, but if you are looking for places to dine, he has a few tips. “We took a little trip out like 45 minutes from Austin [to] Lockhart, Texas ... and the barbecue there was just the best I’ve ever had in my life. We went to Kreuz Market, which was just outrageous, Smitty’s and Terry Blacks, were just all incredible,” he said. For tacos, he recommends Nixta where everything, from the tortillas to the braises, are handmade, and Veracruz, which is a food truck vibe. And there is much more than tacos and barbecue in Austin. Taylor noted that he tried great Japanese food, Mexican food, Caribbean fare, and more.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-diplomat-spying-cuba_n_65e1ae38e4b005b85833f304,Career U.S. Diplomat Abruptly Admits To Spying For Communist Cuba For Decades,"joshua goodman, jim mustian",3/1/2024,"MIAMI (AP) — A former career U.S. diplomat told a federal judge Thursday he will plead guilty to charges of working for decades as a secret agent for communist Cuba, an unexpectedly swift resolution to a case prosecutors called one of the most brazen betrayals in the history of the U.S. foreign service. Manuel Rocha’s stunning fall from grace could culminate in a lengthy prison term after the 73-year-old said he would admit to federal counts of conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government. Prosecutors and Rocha’s attorney indicated the plea deal includes an agreed-upon sentence but they did not disclose details at a hearing Thursday. He is due back in court April 12, when he is scheduled to formalize his guilty plea and be sentenced. “I am in agreement,” said Rocha, shackled at the hands and ankles, when asked by U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom if he wished to change his plea to guilty. Prosecutors, in exchange, agreed to drop 13 counts including wire fraud and making false statements. The brief hearing shed no new light on the question that has proved elusive since Rocha’s arrest in December: What exactly did he do to help Cuba while working at the State Department for two decades? That included stints as ambassador to Bolivia and top posts in Argentina, Mexico, the White House and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. “Ambassador Rocha,” as he preferred to be called, was well known among Miami’s elite for his aristocratic, almost regal, bearing befitting his Ivy League background. His post-government career included time as a special adviser to the commander of the U.S. Southern Command and more recently as a tough-talking Donald Trump supporter and Cuba hardliner, a persona friends and prosecutors say Rocha adopted to hide his true allegiances. Peter Lapp, who oversaw FBI counterintelligence against Cuba between 1998 and 2005, said the fast resolution of the case benefits not only the elderly Rocha but also the government, which stands to learn a lot about Cuba’s penetration of U.S. foreign policy circles. Typically in counterintelligence cases, the defendant is charged with espionage. But Rocha was accused of the lesser crimes of acting as a foreign agent, which carry maximum terms of between five and 10 years in prison, making it easier for prosecutors and Rocha to reach an agreement. “It’s a win-win for both sides,” said Lapp, who led the investigation into Ana Montes, the highest-level U.S. official ever convicted of spying for Cuba. “He gets a significant payoff and the chance to see his family again, and the U.S. will be able to conduct a full damage assessment that it wouldn’t be able to do without his cooperation.” “There are details that can really only come from the defendant,” he added. But the abrupt deal drew criticism in the Cuban exile community, with some legal observers worrying it amounted to a slap on the wrist. “Any sentence that allows him to see the light of day again would not be justice,” said Carlos Trujillo, a Miami attorney who served as U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States during the Trump administration. “He’s a spy for a foreign adversary who put American lives at risk.” A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Rocha was arrested by the FBI at his Miami home on allegations he had engaged in “clandestine activity” on Cuba’s behalf since at least 1981 — the year he joined the U.S. foreign service — including by meeting with Cuban intelligence operatives and providing false information to U.S. government officials about his contacts. Rocha made a series of recorded admissions to an undercover FBI agent who posed as a Cuban intelligence operative who reached out to Rocha on WhatsApp, calling himself “Miguel” and saying he had a message “from your friends in Havana.” Rocha praised the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro as “Comandante,” branded the U.S. the “enemy” and bragged about his service for more than 40 years as a Cuban mole in the heart of U.S. foreign policy circles, prosecutors said in court records. “What we have done … it’s enormous … more than a Grand Slam,” he was quoted as saying. Federal authorities have said little about what Rocha actually did to aid Cuba, and FBI and State Department investigators have been conducting a confidential intelligence damage assessment that could take years. But a recent Associated Press investigation found there were plenty of missed red flags over the years. Those included a tip that a longtime CIA operative received warning in 2006 that Rocha was working as a double agent. It was never pursued. And separate intelligence revealed that the CIA had been aware as early as 1987 that Castro had a “super mole” burrowed deep inside the U.S. government, and some officials suspected it could have been Rocha. Lawrence Gumbiner, a retired career diplomat, said the fact that Rocha went undetected for so many years underscores the sophistication of Cuba’s intelligence services. “It’s a day for reflection for all of us who knew and worked with him,” said Gumbiner, who served as acting U.S. ambassador to Cuba in 2017 and 2018. “Although the full extent of the damage he caused isn’t yet revealed, it’s hard to believe he didn’t pass along some very serious information that compromised our intelligence services and our own efforts against the Castro regime.” ___ Mustian reported from New York. ___ Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/ By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Trump is accused of illegally retaining classified documents after leaving the White House. He denies the allegations, claiming they are politically motivated. Trump’s attorneys noted in a filing that the trial would be taking place during the RNC, which is being held July 15-18 in Milwaukee. Despite his legal woes, Trump remains the clear favorite to win the GOP nomination and take on President Joe Biden in November. The next four years will change America forever.

Collins asked Yoshino if Cannon should consider Trump’s campaigning when making a decision. “I think in an ideal world, she should not,” Yoshino replied. “I mean, no one is above the law.

The late-night host noted how Republican 2024 front-runner Trump needs to “come up with the full $454 million penalty or a bond to cover it” if he wants to appeal his civil fraud ruling in New York. “In other words, a man who became famous for never paying anyone back has to convince a bonding company he will definitely pay them back, and it’s not happening,” said Kimmel. “He owes like a whole Powerball Lottery jackpot,” he continued. “He may very well have to sell off his properties to cover it. But that’s a worst-case scenario.” So, Trump’s “first move is to see how much he can get for Eric on Craigslist,” joked Kimmel. “He has him listed in the ‘Tools’ section.” Kimmel later proposed another way forward for the four-times-indicted Trump. “Wouldn’t it be great if Trump has to sell Mar-a-Lago to some billionaire liberal?” he asked. “Maybe Oprah-Lago would be a solution?” Watch the video here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Republican 2024 front-runner repeated his usual fear-mongering rhetoric when he claimed, without offering any evidence to back up his assertion, “They’re coming from jails, and they’re coming from prisons, and they’re coming from mental institutions, and they’re coming from insane asylums, and they’re terrorists. They’re being let into our country, and it’s horrible.” Trump then focused on what he considered a highly important issue: The languages talked by those who go to the U.S. Trump, confused: We have people who don’t speak languages. We have nobody that even speaks those languages. Nobody speaks them pic.twitter.com/5OfQU9xIAb “Nobody can explain to me how allowing millions of people from places unknown, from countries unknown, who don’t speak languages,” he confusingly railed. “We have languages coming into our country. We have nobody that even speaks those languages. They’re truly foreign languages. Nobody speaks them, and they’re pouring into our country, and they’re bringing with them tremendous problems, including medical problems, as you know.” CNN’s fact-checking reporter Daniel Dale told anchor Kaitlan Collins that Trump has made a similar claim “about people arriving speaking languages that no one‘s ever heard.” Dale recalled, “He said in a previous, recent speech, ‘We didn‘t even have one translator who could understand this language. I‘ve looked into this, seems to be just conjured out of thin air. It‘s nonsense.” “Conjured out of thin air.” CNN cuts out of Trump’s speech after he tells “several lies”. They have their fact-checker, Daniel Dale, standing by, who immediately goes to work. CNN has finally wised up. Every single network must do this when Trump is speaking. (Video: CNN) pic.twitter.com/9GAOnygmMe Critics on X (formerly Twitter) scratched their heads over Trump’s “don’t speak languages” logic. If no one speaks these languages, how does he know about them? Wait what? Languages that no one speaks? Are they speaking in tongues? Maybe he got confused between the border and his meeting with the Christian Nationalists right beforehand.That must be it! The next four years will change America forever.

The “Late Show” host noted that special counsel Jack Smith “begged” the Supreme Court to rule on the issue “in a timely manner” back in December. He added that SCOTUS “didn’t say jack” for over two weeks, as well, after a federal appeals court rejected Trump’s claim that he’s immune from prosecution for alleged criminal acts he committed while in office. “That makes it a total of 19 weeks of delays,” Colbert said of the trial. “These proceedings have been frozen for so long, they legally count as children in Alabama.” He later questioned if justices realize “just how damaging” they are to the court’s legacy for stalling “over this urgent threat to our democracy.” Colbert pointed to a 2022 survey that found “just 18%” of Americans who said they “have a great deal of confidence in the court,” The Associated Press reported.

We did much better in 2020 than we ever even thought about doing in 2016,” Trump said during an address on immigration from Eagle Pass, Texas. “And very bad things happened and from that moment, it was a whole different ballgame in Texas and all over,” he added, appearing to nod to his baseless stolen election claims. Cavuto interrupted the feed. “We’re continuing to monitor this,” said Cavuto, who in the past has not shied away from criticizing Trump or Republicans, unlike other personalities on the conservative network.

He still lost that election. pic.twitter.com/vEuK8lImb1 “Just one slight thing I wanted to add because when you hear it, and you heard from Donald Trump about the 2020 election, and he got millions more votes. In fact, he did get millions more votes,” acknowledged Cavuto. “He still lost that election. That is not in doubt anymore. That’s not being debated anymore.” Indeed, Trump received 74.2 million votes in 2020 compared to his 62.9 million tally in 2016 when he lost the popular vote to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

The former president argued that he’s immune from federal prosecution for alleged criminal acts he carried out while in office. The high court agreed Wednesday to hear arguments in the case on the week of April 22, further delaying a trial once set for March. Guest host Michael Kosta noted that Election Day “isn’t that far off” before asking Lydic if she thinks the high court will rule on the matter soon. “Well, Michael, that depends. When is Election Day?” Lydic said. “Nov. 5,” Kosta replied. “They’ll rule on Nov. 6,” Lydic said. Lydic added that the issue is “complicated,” and justices have a “very difficult legal question” ahead of them. “Can the president break the law any time he wants? Hard to say, hard to say,” she said. “Constitutionally speaking, can he burn down the White House for insurance money?

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hunter-biden-deposition-transcript_n_65e1589fe4b013678e14ac6a,Hunter Biden Told Republicans He Has A Better Resume Than They Do,arthur delaney,2/29/2024,"WASHINGTON ― For years, Republican members of Congress have described the president’s son as a corrupt wastrel with no business on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. On Wednesday, Hunter Biden came to Capitol Hill and told Republicans that not only was he qualified for his job with Burisma, but he had a more impressive business background than any of them. “You guys have gone out and said I had no credibility, no ― that there’s no way that I should’ve been serving on the board of Burisma,” Biden said, according to a transcript released Thursday. “I just read you my resume,” he said. “I’d put my resume up against any of you, in terms of my responsibility.” It was one of several combative moments from a seven-hour deposition Republicans held Wednesday as part of their impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden. Republicans have not uncovered any official wrongdoing by the president despite months of searching for bribes and improper participation in his son’s business deals. During questioning, Republicans sought to undercut Hunter Biden’s insistence that he was qualified for the job, and they repeatedly asked him to detail the timeline of his addictions to alcohol and crack cocaine ― something he detailed in a 2021 book that Republicans have apparently never consulted. In response to their questions, Biden suggested Republicans were being hypocritical about their own problems with drugs and alcohol. Biden created an instant controversy when he took a high-paying position on Burisma’s board in 2014, while his father, then the vice president, served as the face of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine. State Department officials privately complained that the job created the appearance of a conflict of interest, and Donald Trump pressured Ukraine to announce an investigation, withholding military aid in an extortion scheme that triggered his first impeachment. Those same officials said, however, that Hunter Biden’s Burisma job had no effect on U.S. policy. Republicans have resurrected Trump’s corruption allegations and made them Exhibit A in their impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden, claiming his son was useless to Burisma except as a conduit for bribes to his father. The younger Biden has had it both ways with Burisma. On the one hand, he admitted his last name helped him get the board position, saying high-profile Western board members allowed Burisma to send a defiant message to Vladimir Putin, who had launched an invasion of Ukraine. But he’s also insisted that he was qualified ― and he seemed to relish the chance to say so to Republicans directly, citing his Ivy League degrees and previous positions on corporate and nonprofit boards. “I don’t know anybody that was, at that time, that was teaching the No. 1 rated course at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service in the master’s program in terms of foreign policy and advocacy,” Hunter Biden said. “I literally was on 17 ― like, 12 different boards. I only listed like, you know, 10 of them. And so I had an enormous amount of reasons to be on it.” He repeatedly asked his own questions during the deposition. In response to queries about his father meeting his business associates for dinner, he asked Republicans if they had a problem with Donald Trump’s son-in-law landing a $2 billion deal with the Saudi government shortly after serving as an advisor to the president. “When Jared Kushner flies over to Saudi Arabia, picks up $2 billion, comes back, and puts it in his pocket, OK, and he is running for president of the United States, you guys have any problem with that?” (Democrats claimed that several Republicans nodded in agreement in response to the Kushner remark.) When Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) asked if Biden was on drugs when he was on the Burisma board, Biden asked a loaded question of his own. “Mr. Gaetz, look me in the eye. You really think that’s appropriate to ask me?” “Absolutely,” Gaetz said. “Of all the people sitting around this table, do you think that’s appropriate to ask me?” Biden said, seemingly alluding to allegations of drug use that have swirled around Gaetz. Biden wrote a month-by-month account of his addiction to crack cocaine in his 2021 memoir, “Beautiful Things,” which included a chapter specifically about Burisma ― but it seemed as though Republicans had no familiarity with the material. “Yes, I was an addict,” Biden said. “What does that have to do with whether or not you’re going to go forward with an impeachment of my father other than to simply try to embarrass me?” Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-Wyo.) followed Gaetz with more questions about the timeline of his addiction and his work for Burisma, asking if Biden should have disclosed his problems to the company. Biden said that’s not how addiction works. “I can guarantee you, at least 30% of the people that you serve with suffer from alcoholism,” Biden said. “Do you think it’s incumbent upon them, if they suffer from alcoholism, that they immediately resign?” Biden said he had good days and bad days struggling with his addiction, and that his close associates knew about his efforts to recover ― as they themselves have testified in their own interviews with lawmakers. As for his actual board work, Biden said he brought expertise on corporate governance to a company that wanted to elevate its financial standards. “My responsibilities were like any other board member, to attend board meetings, to be aware of what the management was doing to try to strive for, you know, accountability, transparency, openness in terms of the reporting, to go through the financials and make certain that the financials were certified by a [certified public accountant],” Biden said. Republicans have repeatedly held up an anecdote from Devon Archer, a business associate of Biden’s who recruited him to Burisma’s board, as evidence that Biden got his father to help the company. Archer told lawmakers in a transcribed interview last year that he witnessed Burisma executives ask Biden to “call D.C.” in December 2015 and that he thought he might have called his father, though Archer admitted he did not witness such a call. House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) has suggested the call resulted in Joe Biden pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was supposedly investigating Burisma. But Hunter Biden said there was no such call. “I know there was never a phone call to my father. I can say that under oath,” he said. (Separately, Hunter Biden testified that he did help Burisma connect with a Democratic consulting firm that helped the company’s executives with visa and other issues.) Biden initially refused to sit for a closed-door deposition when Republicans sent him a subpoena last year, insisting instead on public testimony, before changing his mind and sitting for Wednesday’s interview. House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) said this week that he still wants to have a public hearing, but it’s not clear if Biden remains willing. His attorney, Abbe Lowell, noted in a statement after the deposition that the source of a key bribery allegation has been charged with fabricating the claim and lying to the FBI. Bribes had supposedly been paid by the head of Burisma to both Hunter and Joe Biden, and Republicans had touted the informant’s dubious claim as their very best piece of evidence.

Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who both sit on the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the White House must demand accountability after the mass deaths and ensure aid can reach those starving in Gaza as soon as possible. “People are starving in Gaza. And civilians are dying every day — including in this horrific incident in Gaza City today,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “This has gone on for far too long without sufficient action.” Gaza officials and Israel have traded blame for the death toll. The Gaza Health Ministry said Israeli forces opened fire on a crowd gathered near a convoy of aid trucks on Thursday. Officials described the gunfire as a “massacre,” saying more than 100 had died and more than 760 were injured as desperate Palestinians struggled to get food. It was the first major aid delivery to the area in a month. My statement on the path forward after today’s horrific events in Gaza. I want a negotiated longer term cessation of hostilities to get the hostages out, but right now Israel needs to pause military operations in order to get this humanitarian nightmare under control. pic.twitter.com/iQxY9wc4Di Israel admitted that its troops had fired warning shots but claimed troops fired only on people who approached the trucks in a threatening way. Israel instead attributed many of the deaths to a stampede. “We didn’t open fire on those seeking aid,” the chief military spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told The Associated Press. “Contrary to the accusations, we didn’t open fire on a humanitarian aid convoy, not from the air and not from land. We secured it so it could reach northern Gaza.” The episode quickly prompted international condemnation. Biden said Thursday that any negotiations for a cease-fire will be further complicated, expanding his timeline for any eventual deal. And State Department officials said they were looking into “exactly what took place” in Gaza. But the senators on Thursday urged the White House to act with haste after the mass deaths. Murphy added that the deaths Thursday were the result of “the complete breakdown in social order in Gaza,” saying the situation was “spiraling out of control” without humanitarian aid and a negotiated cease-fire. “To be clear, Hamas started this war and could end it tomorrow by releasing the hostages and surrendering those responsible for the October 7th attacks,” Murphy said. “However, the appalling scenes from Gaza City today and the staggering civilian death toll that has already occurred in Gaza are not in Israel’s nor the United States’ interest.” Murphy said Biden should use “all available leverage” to see Israel and Hamas reach a longer-term cease-fire. Van Hollen added Thursday that “enough is enough.” “America cannot be complicit in this ongoing humanitarian catastrophe,” he wrote. “We know what must be done, now we must do it.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

In a letter penned to the state’s legislature on Wednesday, more than 300 advocacy and LGBTQ organizations, including Freedom Oklahoma, GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, alleged that Ryan Walters, the state’s superintendent of public instruction, is “responsible for fostering a culture of violence and hate against the 2SLGBTQI+ community in Oklahoma schools.” They argued that Walters created a hostile environment at Oklahoma schools which contributed to the death of 16-year-old Nex Benedict, who was assaulted in a school bathroom earlier this month. Benedict had been bullied since last year, the Independent reported, shortly after Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) signed a law requiring students to use bathrooms that match the sex listed on their birth certificate. “Superintendent Walters’ reprehensible conduct shows a willful rejection of his duty to protect the health and welfare of the children in Oklahoma’s public schools and instead has created an environment that allows for hostility and harm for youth like Nex,” the letter stated. “We are outraged that a climate of hate and bigotry has been not only allowed to thrive, but encouraged by the person who is responsible for education in the state of Oklahoma. State officials must be held accountable for bringing the politics of hate into Oklahoma’s schools and making our most vulnerable youth pay the price.” Walters has faced calls for his ouster before. Last month, he faced backlash for passing an emergency rule to bar students from changing the gender marker listed on their school files. He also appointed Chaya Raichik, the creator of the far-right social media account Libs of TikTok, to a seat on Oklahoma’s library review committee earlier this year. Last year, Libs of TiKTok made a post targeting a librarian at an Oklahoma school, NBC News reported. The school district received bomb threats a day after Walters retweeted the Libs of TikTok post, prompting Oklahoma Democrats to push for an impeachment probe of the superintendent. Walters has also been scrutinized for his campaign’s affiliation with Ron “The Real Ron Ron” Causby, a far-right podcaster who has called for violence against transgender people. Walters reportedly participated in a fundraiser event at the influencer’s residence in 2022, according to Media Matters. In a statement sent to HuffPost, Walters dismissed the organizations’ recent call for his removal as a “standard tactic of the radical left” that will “stop at nothing to destroy the country and our state.” “Their woke desperate political game has led them to exploit the death of a young Oklahoman,” Walters said. “I will never stop fighting, I will not play woke gender games, and I will not back down to a woke mob.” Since Benedict’s death, other young people have come forward about the harassment faced by LGBTQ students in Oklahoma, the letter claims. LGBTQ youth mental health organizations have also reported a major increase in crisis calls since the incident, with many callers citing instances of bullying and harassment, the Advocate reported. So far this year, Oklahoma has introduced 54 anti-LGBTQ bills, according to the ACLU, including bans on gender-affirming care and restrictions on what pronouns teachers can use for their students.

Authorities arrested four men and three women in connection to the murder of Mahogany Jaquise Jackson, Birmingham police announced on Wednesday. According to a local Alabama outlet, Jackson was reported missing on Sunday after her mother and sister received a message from her on Facebook messenger. “She sent me a text message that said she was being held hostage and sent her location,’’ Gail Maddox, Jackson’s mother, said. The location Jackson sent was at Serenity Apartments in Birmingham’s Powderly community, but she was nowhere to be found when police arrived, according to the outlet. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Birmingham Police Chief Scott Thurmon said investigators were able to locate Jackson’s body on the side of a road with help from the public. Police located her body around 2:19 a.m. Monday and “determined she had been shot.” Police believe Jackson and all seven suspects knew each other. “I would say all these individuals were acquaintances, they were not strangers to one another,” Thurmon said. Giovonnie Clapp, 23; Blair Green, 25; and Si’nya McCall, 23; were charged with felony murder, kidnapping in the first degree, and sodomy in the first degree. Jeremiah McDowell, 18; Brandon Pope, 24; and Francis Harris, 25; were charged with capital murder/sodomy in the first degree and capital murder/kidnapping in the first degree. Teja Lewis, 25, was also charged with felony murder and assault in the second degree with injury/weapon. Clapp also faces assault charges. All suspects are being held without bond. Thurmon declined to release specific details about Jackson’s kidnapping but mentioned she was taken to several different locations, and the suspects recorded the sexual assault. “It was absolutely disgusting,” Thurmond told reporters.

In a new interview with CNN Thursday, Zendaya shared that meeting Butler — who dons transparent skin, black teeth and an eyebrow-less face for his role as the merciless villain Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen — during her first day on set in Budapest was “quite jarring.” “I was like, ‘Well, this is one way to get to know someone!’” she said of being introduced to Butler in-costume. Feyd-Rautha was previously played by musician Sting in David Lynch’s 1985 adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel. “It was also funny because once you get to know Austin, you see that he’s obviously very warm and very kind. From just five seconds ago, being this terrifying creature, and then being like, ‘Hey, how are you? Good to see you!’” she told CNN. Leading man Chalamet echoed having a similarly “crazy” reaction to seeing Butler’s drastic transformation. The “Bones and All” star recalled being nervous when he met Butler in a stunt warehouse to rehearse one of their fight scenes, considering the two had to be “pretty aggressive” with each other “right off the bat.” “(It was) a lot of rehearsal. A lot of practice in LA, before even getting over to Hungary,” Chalamet said. “But it was a dream.” Earlier this week, Butler spoke about how he approached playing the “demonic” character. “The thing with a villainous character — I’d never played a character quite like it, and I didn’t want to judge him,” he said on “The Tonight Show.” He added: “It was a lot of imagining what his childhood was like, and thankfully seeing the first film, Stellan Skarsgard’s character, the Baron, he’s amazing...

U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon is set to hold a hearing on the timing of the trial on Friday. If she agrees to Smith’s timeline, the former president would be forced to defend himself just before the Republican National Convention begins and the party officially selects its presidential nominee. The RNC will be held from July 15 to 18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. BREAKING: Jack Smith proposes a new Florida trial date of *July 8* pic.twitter.com/LTKwprj0T5 Trump’s attorneys rejected Smith’s timeline in a filing of their own Thursday, saying the former president would not receive a fair trial while he was simultaneously campaigning for the presidency. He pushed for the trial, to be held in Florida, to begin after the 2024 presidential election, but also offered up Aug. 12 as an alternative start date. “As the leading candidate in the 2024 election, President Trump strongly asserts that a fair trial cannot be conducted this year in a manner consistent with the Constitution, which affords President Trump a Sixth Amendment right to be present and to participate in these proceeding,” his lawyers wrote. “Consistent with the Introduction and reiterating the position that a fair trial cannot be held until after the 2024 Presidential election is concluded.” Trump was indicted last June over his handling of classified documents after he left the White House. Smith’s team has accused the former president of hoarding the files at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida and resisting government efforts to see them returned. The charges include counts of willful retention of documents, making false statements and obstruction of justice, among others. Trump has been charged with 40 counts in total.

Smith’s team this week rebuffed Trump’s claims that he had been unfairly targeted, saying there has “never been a case in American history in which a former official has engaged in conduct remotely similar to Trump’s.” But the former president has regularly lambasted the indictment — and the three others now pending against him — as political witch hunts. His attorneys have pushed claims that he is protected from prosecution, leaning on unprecedentedly broad interpretations of presidential immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court said it would hear arguments on some of those immunity claims in relation to the federal charges he faces related to the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.

In a statement on WeightWatchers’ website, Winfrey said she planned to donate her shares in the company to the National Museum of African American History and Culture while remaining “a vocal advocate in advancing [the] conversation” around weight management. “I look forward to continuing to advise and collaborate with WeightWatchers and CEO Sima Sistani in elevating the conversation around recognizing obesity as a chronic condition, working to reduce stigma, and advocating for health equity,” she said. Thilo Semmelbauer, who is WeightWatchers’ chairman of the board, called Winfrey “an inspiring presence and passionate advocate” for all of the company’s members, adding: “What I know for sure, we will dearly miss her presence on the Board.” Winfrey bought a 10% stake in WeightWatchers and joined its board in 2015. Since then, she’s been one of the company’s most prominent celebrity spokespeople and appeared in a number of ad campaigns. By 2017, she’d reportedly lost 42 pounds while on the program. In December, however, Winfrey confirmed that she’d begun taking weight loss medication as a “maintenance tool” after consulting with her doctor. “The fact that there’s a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, and not something to hide behind and once again be ridiculed for,” she told People. “I’m absolutely done with the shaming from other people and particularly myself.” Winfrey notably did not specify which weight loss drug she’d taken, and WeightWatchers has recently begun evolving its program to account for those taking prescription medications as a method to shed weight.

Still, the entertainment mogul’s announcement drew a mixed response that reflected the ongoing discourse around Hollywood’s embrace of Ozempic, a diabetes treatment that manages blood sugar levels, for weight loss. In recent years, stars like Chelsea Handler and Sharon Osborne have gone public about using Ozempic. But the drug’s skyrocketing popularity has reportedly led to a global shortage, meaning that many patients with Type 2 diabetes have been unable to access it.

The Bronx, New York, native showed off one of the shoes in an Instagram Live video that was later posted to his account Monday. The “Lean Back” rapper defended his decision to obtain the shoes, saying that he only did so because he is a sneaker collector. “Me, as a sneaker collector, I had to get my hand on the Trumps,” he said in the video, comparing sneaker collectors to art collectors who may not support or be aware of an artist’s politics. “Listen, I have thousands and thousands and thousands of sneakers,” he said, before someone off camera held a Trump-branded shoe box in front of Fat Joe’s face. The rapper, born Joseph Antonio Cartagena, said in the Instagram Live video that despite having the shoes, he’s a “die-hard Democrat” and not a fan of Trump. “I’m not a Trumper, I dislike Trump, I’m not voting for him — not now, not never,” said Fat Joe, who then held one of the sneakers up to the camera. “But I’m a sneaker collector into the art, so I had to find these.” The rapper later insisted that he didn’t pay for the shoes, saying that he was given a pair because he’s “the biggest in the game.” Fat Joe has previously voiced his support for Democrats Joe Biden and Barack Obama. Prior to Trump’s election in 2016, he told MSNBC that the country “can’t have that guy in office.” A representative for Fat Joe did not immediately return a request for comment. Fat Joe explains why he bought Donald Trump’s new sneakers. pic.twitter.com/L3kUDGUCzw People on X, formerly Twitter, criticized the Bronx rapper this week, with some accusing him of “promoting” the shoes linked to Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential ticket. “We know he a sneaker head but he didn’t have to promote them,” one X user wrote, adding that “he could have put them away in silence.” Meanwhile, an Instagram user suggested under Fat Joe’s post that the Bronx native was essentially supporting Trump’s campaign as it seeks to attract voters of color. “Don’t support his campaign!!! So you can collect a freakin sneaker???” the Instagram user wrote. “So dumb. It literally the dumb shit they think about us. And you proved it true. #disappointed.” Trump launched the golden sneakers, named “The Never Surrender High-Tops,” for $399 — a day after a judge in New York found that he lied about his wealth for years. He was ordered to pay $355 million in penalties in the civil fraud verdict. The former president publicly unveiled the shoes at Sneaker Con in Philadelphia earlier this month. Despite Trump promoting the shoes, a website selling the sneakers says in small print that they “are not designed, manufactured, distributed or sold by Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.” Trump’s shiny shoes were mocked on “Saturday Night Live” last weekend. Host Shane Gillis acted as a man who gains the ability to make people believe his shameless lies after he is gifted the Trump-branded sneakers. (Check out the full “SNL” sketch below.)

The actor, who made his return to the World Wrestling Entertainment ring last month, shared a touching tribute to his father on Instagram on Friday, writing that he was “delivering flowers to heaven to my old man.” “My regret in this life is that I never had a chance to say goodbye to him, because he died suddenly,” he wrote in the caption of the post. “I regret not reconciling our complicated father/son s**t before I lost him. Raised me with tough fatherly love and an even tougher hand. The more I live life, the more grateful I am for it.” Johnson’s post featured an old video clip of his father in the wrestling ring, with a little Rock seated in the audience, watching. Rocky “Soul Man” Johnson and fellow wrestler Tony Atlas became the first Black World Tag Team champions in 1983, back when the WWE was called the World Wrestling Federation. In his tribute on Instagram, Dwayne Johnson, who made his own debut in the wrestling ring in the 1990s, celebrated his dad as a trailblazer. “He came up the hard way, and trail-blazed for all of us men of color — in any sport & level of entertainment,” he wrote. “But it was also very important to him to pave the way for all men, any color - it didn’t matter.” In 2020, the “Jumanji” actor shared a video on Instagram of the eulogy he delivered at his father’s funeral. He said his father broke into pro-wrestling in the mid-1960s and into the ’70s, when the country’s “racial tension and divide was very strong.” The Instagram post also featured a letter he dedicated to his father, in which he wrote that the late wrestling Hall of Famer was “taken too fast.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/andy-reid-britt-reid-sentence-drunk-driving_n_65e3a2e1e4b013678e157d52,Son Of Chiefs Coach Gets Shorter DWI Sentence From Missouri Governor,david lieb,3/2/2024,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Friday shortened the prison sentence of former Kansas City Chiefs assistant coach Britt Reid for a drunken driving crash that seriously injured a 5-year-old girl. Parson’s commutation converted the remainder of Reid’s three-year prison sentence to house arrest, subject to several conditions. Reid had been sentenced in November 2022 after pleading guilty to driving while intoxicated causing serious bodily injury. He is the son of Chiefs coach Andy Reid. Parson is a longtime Chiefs season ticket-holder holder who celebrated with the team at its recent Super Bowl victory parade in Kansas City. A Parson spokesman said the governor considered several factors when making his commutation decision. “Reid had completed his alcohol abuse treatment program and has served more prison time than most individuals convicted of similar offenses,” Parson spokesman Johnathan Shiflett said. Reid’s house arrest will continue until Oct. 31, 2025, with requirements for weekly meetings with a parole officer and peer support sponsor and attendance at behavioral counseling. He also will be required to work at least 30 hours a week and complete 10 hours a month of community service, among other things. The Chiefs declined to comment about Parson’s commutation of Reid. Prosecutors said Reid was intoxicated and driving about 84 mph (135 kph) in a 65 mph zone when his Dodge truck hit the cars on an entrance ramp to Interstate 435 near Arrowhead Stadium on Feb. 4, 2021. A girl inside one of the cars, Ariel Young, suffered a traumatic brain injury. A total of six people, including Reid, were injured. One of the vehicles he hit had stalled because of a dead battery, and the second was owned by Ariel’s mother, who had arrived to help. Reid had a blood-alcohol level of 0.113% two hours after the crash, police said. The legal limit is 0.08%. The Chiefs reached a confidential agreement with Ariel’s family to pay for her ongoing medical treatment and other expenses. An attorney who represented Ariel’s family did not immediately respond to messages Friday. Reid’s sentencing reprieve was one of three commutations and 36 pardons announced Friday by Parson, who also denied 63 clemency requests. Parson, a former sheriff, has now granted clemency to more than 760 people since 2020 — more than any Missouri governor since the 1940s. Parson has been been working to clear a backlog of nearly 3,700 clemency applications he inherited when taking over as governor in 2018, but he also has considered some new requests. Many of those granted clemency by Parson were convicted decades ago of drug crimes, theft or burglary and had completed their prison sentences long ago. But two notable exceptions were Mark and Patricia McCloskey. The St. Louis couple who gained national attention for waving guns at racial injustice protesters were pardoned by Parson on July 30, 2021, just six weeks after Mark McCloskey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and Patricia McCloskey pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment.

The Feb. 22 judgment came after the Justice Department reportedly sued the “Empire” star in 2022 for failing to pay $578,000 in income taxes between 2010 and 2019. According to court documents cited by multiple news outlets, Howard told a Justice Department attorney that it’s “immoral for the United States government to charge taxes to the descendants of slaves.” “Four hundred years of forced labor and never receiving any compensation for it,” Howard was quoted as saying in a November voicemail. “Now you have the gall to try and prosecute and charge taxes to the descendants of a broken people that you are responsible for causing the breakage.” The recording cut off at this point, but Howard called back to continue his message. “In truth, the entire United States should, by default, become the property of the descendants of slaves,” he reportedly said. “But since you do not have the ability [or] the courage to do it, let’s try this in court. … We’re gonna bring you down.” Representatives for Howard did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Howard had allegedly attempted to avoid being served with the Justice Department lawsuit. Prosecutors said that the government first tried to find him at a motel in Jackson, Mississippi, before further attempts were made at properties in Philadelphia, Chicago and La Habra, California.

But the actor allegedly failed to cooperate with the Justice Department or appear at hearings, resulting in last week’s default judgment against him. Howard has been in legal trouble before. In 2015, he acknowledged in a Rolling Stone interview that he had “slapped” his wife in 2001, an incident that led to a guilty plea for disorderly conduct. Howard was also once accused of assaulting a flight attendant, though the charge against him was later dropped. The Oscar-nominated actor notably appeared in the 2008 film “Iron Man” but was replaced for “Iron Man 2,” with Howard suggesting that salary issues were to blame. He ultimately missed out on more than a decade of box-office blockbusters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Lauren Boebert, whose three-year tenure representing Coloradans has been marred by allegations of hypocrisy. Writing on his website Truth Social, the former president called Boebert “a Proven Conservative and Effective Leader” and a “trusted America First Fighter” who has his “Complete and Total Endorsement.” Boebert was first elected in 2020 to represent Colorado’s 3rd congressional district, encompassing the western half of the state. She rose to right-wing fame by touting her love for guns and Trump’s MAGA movement while capitalizing on conservative anger over COVID-19 health restrictions as the owner of a restaurant that has since shuttered. After a narrow re-election win in 2022, Boebert decided to run to represent the state’s 4th congressional district in 2024 instead — a large swath of eastern Colorado that draws more consistently Republican votes. She also has sought to position herself in a softer light in recent months. Last summer, set on her mission to impeach President Joe Biden, Boebert’s tense relationship with fellow Trump Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) sparked an ugly scene on the House floor in which Greene called Boebert a “little bitch.” Then in September, Boebert suffered a spectacular fall from grace when she was forcibly removed from a stage production of “Beetlejuice” at a Denver performing arts theater. The congresswoman and her date were caught on video kissing, groping and vaping during what was billed as a family-friendly show. The next four years will change America forever.

For an elected official who has championed “family values” and baselessly accused members of the LGBTQ+ community of sexually inappropriate behavior around children, the incident was embarrassing, and Boebert later apologized. Her personal life inspired headlines again in January, when her ex-husband, Jayson Boebert, allegedly started drunken fights twice in a span of days — once with the congresswoman and once with one of the pair’s sons. Earlier this week, her eldest son, 18-year-old Tyler Boebert, was arrested on felony charges; he allegedly robbed a woman with a brain tumor of her last $75, police said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-agrees-to-gaza-ceasefire-framework-now-awaiting-hamas_n_65e3809ce4b0d2a247598af7,"US: Israel Has Agreed To The Framework For A Gaza Cease-fire, Now Awaiting Hamas' Decision","wafaa shurafa, samy magdy",3/2/2024,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel has essentially endorsed a framework of a proposed Gaza cease-fire and hostage release deal, and it is now up to Hamas to agree to it, a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday, a day before talks to reach an agreement were to resume in Egypt. International mediators have been working for weeks to broker a deal to pause the fighting before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins around March 10. A deal likely would allow aid to reach hundreds of thousands of desperate Palestinians in northern Gaza who aid officials worry are under threat of famine. The Israelis “have more or less accepted” the proposal, which includes the six-week cease-fire as well as the release by Hamas of hostages considered vulnerable, which includes the sick, the wounded, the elderly and women, said the official. “Right now, the ball is in the court of Hamas and we are continuing to push this as hard as we possibly can,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House to brief reporters. Officials from Israel and from Hamas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A senior Egyptian official said mediators Egypt and Qatar are expected to receive a response from Hamas during the Cairo talks scheduled to start Sunday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not publicly authorized to discuss the talks. There is increasing criticism over the hundreds of thousands struggling to survive in northern Gaza, which has borne the brunt of the conflict that began when the Hamas militant group attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seizing around 250 hostages. U.S. military planes began the first airdrops of thousands of meals into Gaza, and the militaries of Jordan and Egypt said they also conducted airdrops. The European Union’s diplomatic service said many of the dozens of Palestinians killed or wounded in the chaos surrounding an aid convoy on Thursday were hit by Israeli army fire and urged an international investigation. It said responsibility for the crisis lay with “restrictions imposed by the Israeli army and obstructions by violent extremist(s) to the supply of humanitarian aid.” Israel’s chief military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Israel organized Thursday’s humanitarian convoy, “and claims that we attacked the convoy intentionally and that we harmed people intentionally are baseless.” Residents in northern Gaza say they are searching rubble and garbage for anything to feed their children, who barely eat one meal a day. Many families have begun mixing animal and bird food with grain to bake bread. International aid officials say they have encountered catastrophic hunger. “We’re dying from starvation,” said Soad Abu Hussein, a widow and mother of five who shelters in a school in the Jabaliya refugee camp. At least 10 children have starved to death, according to hospital records in Gaza, the World Health Organization said. Gaza’s Health Ministry said the Palestinian death toll from the war has climbed to 30,320. The ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures, but says women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed. In Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah, where more than half of the territory’s people now seek refuge, an Israeli airstrike on Saturday struck tents outside the Emirati hospital, killing 11 people and wounding about 50, including health workers, the Health Ministry said. Israel’s air, sea and ground offensive has reduced much of densely populated northern Gaza to rubble. The military told Palestinians to move south, but as many as 300,000 people are believed to have remained. Roughly one in six children under 2 in the north suffer from acute malnutrition and wasting, “the worst level of child malnutrition anywhere in the world,” Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the World Food Program, said this week. “If nothing changes, a famine is imminent in northern Gaza.” People have overwhelmed trucks delivering food aid and grabbed what they can, Skau said, forcing the WFP to suspend deliveries to the north. In the violence Thursday, hundreds of people rushed about 30 trucks bringing a predawn delivery to the north. Palestinians said nearby Israeli troops shot into the crowds. Israel said they fired warning shots toward the crowd and insisted many of the dead were trampled. Doctors at hospitals in Gaza and a U.N. team that visited a hospital said large numbers of the wounded had been shot. The Health Ministry said two more bodies were recovered Saturday from the scene, raising the death toll to 118. It said the wounded remained at 760. Ahmed Abdel Karim, being treated for gunshot wounds in his feet, said he had spent two days waiting for aid trucks to arrive. “Everyone attacked and advanced on these trucks. Because of the large number, I could not get flour,” he said. He was shot by Israeli troops, he said. Radwan Abdel-Hai, a father of four young children, heard a rumor late Wednesday that an aid convoy was on its way. He and five others took a donkey cart and found a “sea of people” waiting. “Tanks started firing at us,” he said. “As I ran back, I heard tank shells and gunfire. I heard people screaming. I saw people falling to the ground, some motionless.” Abdel-Hai took shelter in a nearby building. When the shooting stopped, many dead were on the ground, he said. “Many were shot in their back,” he said. Abu Hussein, the widow, said more than 5,000 people — mostly women and children — living with her in the Jabaliya school have not received aid for more than four weeks. A group of people went to the shore to try to fish, but three were killed and two were wounded by gunfire from Israeli ships, she said. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mansour Hamed, a 32-year-old former aid worker living with more than 50 relatives in a Gaza City house, said some are eating tree leaves and animal food. It has become normal to find a child emerging from the rubble with a rotten piece of bread, he said. Acknowledging the extreme need for food, U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. would look for other ways of delivery “including possibly a marine corridor.” Also Saturday, Israel said three soldiers were killed and 14 injured Friday when they inadvertently triggered explosives in a booby-trapped building outside Khan Younis in southern Gaza. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

(AP) — Former President Donald Trump continued his march toward the GOP nomination on Saturday, winning caucuses in Idaho and Missouri and sweeping the delegate haul at a party convention in Michigan. Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador who is his last major rival, was still searching for her first election-year win. The next event on the Republican calendar is Sunday in the District of Columbia. Two days later is Super Tuesday, when 16 states will hold primaries on what will be the largest day of voting of the year outside of the November election. Trump is on track to lock up the nomination days later. The steep odds facing Haley were on display in Columbia, Missouri, where Republicans gathered at a church to caucus. Seth Christensen stood on stage and called on them to vote for Haley. He wasn’t well received. Another caucusgoer shouted out from the audience: “Are you a Republican?” An organizer quieted the crowd and Christensen finished his speech. Haley went on to win just 37 of the 263 Republicans in attendance in Boone County. Michigan Republicans at their convention in Grand Rapids began allocating 39 of the state’s 55 GOP presidential delegates. Trump won all 39 delegates allocated. But a significant portion of the party’s grassroots force was skipping the gathering because of the lingering effects of a monthslong dispute over the party’s leadership. Trump handily won Michigan’s primary this past Tuesday with 68% of the vote compared with Haley’s 27%. Michigan Republicans were forced to split their delegate allocation into two parts after Democrats, who control the state government, moved Michigan into the early primary states, violating the national Republican Party’s rules. Voters lined up outside a church in Columbia, home to the University of Missouri, before the doors opened for the caucuses. Once they got inside, they heard appeals from supporters of the candidates. “Every 100 days, we’re spending $1 trillion, with money going all over the world. Illegals are running across the border,” Tom Mendenall, an elector for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said to the crowd. He later added: “You know where Donald Trump stands on a lot of these issues.” Christensen, a 31-year-old from Columbia who came to the caucus with his wife and three children age 7, 5, and 2, then urged Republicans to go in a new direction. “I don’t need to hear about Mr. Trump’s dalliances with people of unsavory character, nor do my children,” Christensen said to the room. “And if we put that man in the office, that’s what we’re going to hear about all the time. And I’m through with it.” Supporters quickly moved to one side of the room or the other, depending on whether they favored Trump or Haley. There was little discussion between caucusgoers after they chose a side. This year was the first test of the new system, which is almost entirely run by volunteers on the Republican side. The caucuses were organized after GOP Gov. Mike Parson signed a 2022 law that, among other things, canceled the planned March 12 presidential primary. Lawmakers failed to reinstate the primary despite calls to do so by both state Republican and Democratic party leaders. Democrats will hold a party-run primary on March 23. Trump prevailed twice under Missouri’s old presidential primary system. Last year, Idaho lawmakers passed cost-cutting legislation that was intended to move all the state’s primaries to the same date in May. But the bill inadvertently eliminated the presidential primaries entirely. The Republican-led Legislature considered holding a special session to reinstate the presidential primaries but failed to agree on a proposal in time, leaving both parties with presidential caucuses as the only option. “I think there’s been a lot of confusion because most people don’t realize that our Legislature actually voted in a flawed bill,” said Jessie Bryant, who volunteered at a caucus site near downtown Boise. “So the caucus is really just the best-case scenario to actually get an opportunity to vote for a presidential candidate and nominate them for the GOP.” One of those voters was John Graves, a fire protection engineer from Boise. He said the caucus was fast and easy, not much different from Idaho’s usual Republican primary. He anticipated the win would go to Trump. “It’s a very conservative state, so I would think that Trump will probably carry it quite easily,” Graves said. “And I like that.” The Democratic caucuses aren’t until May 23. The last GOP caucuses in Idaho were in 2012, when about 40,000 of the state’s nearly 200,000 registered Republican voters showed up to select their preferred candidate. ___ Cooper reported from Phoenix.

Jackie, a female, and Shadow, a male, are bald eagle mates who share a nest in Southern California’s San Bernardino Mountains. The nest is about 145 feet up in a pine tree with a view of Big Bear Lake. Since 2015, the nonprofit Friends of Big Bear Valley has had a webcam providing a livestream of the goings-on inside the nest ― and lately, things have gotten especially interesting. Jackie laid three eggs in January, and The Associated Press reported Thursday that the chicks could hatch soon. On early Saturday afternoon, nearly 20,000 viewers were tuned in to a YouTube livestream, participating in what multiple news outlets are calling “hatch watch.” The Saturday stream showed one of the eagles dutifully incubating the eggs as rain and wind buffeted the nest, but the parents-to-be are no strangers to inclement weather. Last month, the two were seen protecting the eggs in shifts amid a fierce snowstorm. At one point, Jackie stayed atop the eggs without a break for just under 62 hours.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) isn’t biting his tongue concerning U.S. policy toward Israel. The progressive senator has continued to support President Joe Biden on his campaign for re-election, but made an impassioned appearance Friday on “Alex Wagner Tonight” — and slammed the “absurd” policy of funding what Sanders called “an unprecedented disaster.” The ongoing conflict erupted when Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis and abducted around 200 others on Oct. 7. Conditions in Gaza have worsened into a humanitarian catastrophe since: Gaza’s health ministry says over 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of them women and children. Sanders said Friday that the hunger and death in the region “makes my stomach turn.” “We are talking about hundreds of thousands of children facing starvation,” he told Wagner. “We’re talking about Israeli bombs making it impossible for humanitarian aid to get to places that it is needed, that the borders are being blockaded and aid is unable to get through.” Biden approved airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza Friday, after more than 100 Palestinians were killed and 750 others were injured when Israeli troops fired at civilians scrambling for goods from an aid convoy. The first 38,000 airdropped meals arrived Saturday. “So I think what the president is doing is an important step forward, but we need to do more,” Sanders told Wagner of the aid. “We need to tell Netanyahu and his right-wing government that they’re gonna have to open those borders.” Israel has barred the entry of food, water and medicine into Gaza since the latest hostilities began, save for scarce aid pallets entering from Egypt at the Rafah crossing in the south. The United Nations says a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people are now facing starvation. The next four years will change America forever.

In survey results released Saturday by The New York Times and Siena College, 47% of 980 registered voters said that they “strongly disapprove” of Biden’s handling of his job, the highest figure for this rate in any Times/Siena poll during his presidency. The national poll, conducted in February, also shows Biden’s 43% of support trailing behind Trump’s 48%, a potential warning sign for the Democratic president. At 81, Biden has faced criticism for being the oldest sitting president in U.S. history. He has also received pushback for his handling of the current conflict in Gaza, where health officials say that more than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s assault since October. Meanwhile, 77-year-old Trump has more successfully unified support within his party as he seeks to retake the White House, despite his recent legal losses and upcoming trials. According to the Times/Siena poll, Trump has the support of 97% of people who say they voted for him in the 2020 election, while Biden is winning just 83% of his voters from four years ago. Ten percent of the 2020 Biden voters said they would now vote for Trump, the poll found. See the full results of the poll at The New York Times.

The ruling came just one day after PFLAG National went to court to try to stop Paxton’s office from getting the information. Travis County District Court Judge Maria Cantú Hexsel said in an order that providing the information would harm PFLAG and its members in several ways, including violating their rights of free speech, association and protection from unreasonable searches. Additionally, the judge said, it would be a “gross invasion” of privacy. A hearing was scheduled for March 25 to give the attorney general’s office a chance to make the case for why Friday’s order shouldn’t continue. This round of litigation stems from a request Paxton’s office made in February for “documents and communications” about PFLAG CEO Brian Bond’s statement to court last year that members were setting up contingency plans after the state imposed a sweeping ban on gender-affirming care for minors. In a statement Thursday, Paxton’s office said the information is highly relevant to investigations into whether medical providers are committing insurance fraud to circumvent the ban. The ACLU, which is representing FPLAG in court, said it will seek a permanent block on Paxton’s demand “so that PFLAG can continue supporting its Texas members with transgender youth in doing what all loving parents do: supporting and caring for their children.” The next four years will change America forever.

Michael Sparks, 46, of Kentucky, jumped through a shattered window moments after another rioter smashed it with a stolen riot shield. Sparks then joined other rioters in chasing a police officer up flights of stairs, one of the most harrowing images from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. A federal jury in Washington, D.C., convicted Sparks of all six charges that he faced, including two felonies. Sparks didn’t testify at his weeklong trial. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly is scheduled to sentence him on July 9. Sparks was the “tip of the spear” and breached the Capitol building less than a minute before senators recessed to evacuate the chamber and escape from the mob, Justice Department prosecutor Emily Allen said during the trial’s closing arguments. “The defendant was ready for a civil war. Not just ready for a civil war. He wanted it,” Allen told jurors. Defense attorney Scott Wendelsdorf conceded that Sparks is guilty of the four misdemeanor counts, including trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. But he urged the jury to acquit him of the felony charges — civil disorder and obstruction of an official proceeding. Wendelsdorf accused prosecutors of trying to unfairly blame Sparks for the violence and destruction perpetrated by other rioters around him. The lawyer said Sparks immediately left the Capitol when he realized that Vice President Mike Pence wouldn’t succumb to pressure from then-President Donald Trump to overturn Biden’s victory. “Michael Sparks may have started the game, according to the government, but he was out of the game on the sidelines before the first quarter was over,” the defense attorney told jurors. Sparks traveled to Washington with a group of co-workers from an electronics and components plant in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. They attended Trump’s “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House on Jan. 6. After the rally, Sparks and a co-worker, Joseph Howe, joined a crowd in marching to the Capitol. A cameraman’s video captured Howe saying, “We’re getting in that building,” before Sparks added that if Pence “does his job today, he does the right thing by the Constitution, Trump’s our president four more years.” Sparks and Howe, both wearing tactical vests, made their way to the front of the mob as outnumbered police officers retreated. “Michael Sparks was more prepared for battle than some of the police officers he encountered that day,” Allen said. Sparks was the first rioter to enter the building after Dominic Pezzola, a member of the Proud Boys extremist group, used a police shield to break the window next to the Senate Wing Door. Other rioters yelled at Sparks not to enter the building. “He jumped in anyway,” Allen said. A police officer pepper sprayed Sparks in the face as he leaped through the broken window. Undeterred, Sparks joined other rioters in chasing Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman as he retreated up the stairs and found backup from other officers near the Senate chamber. Sparks ignored commands to leave and yelled, “This is our America! This is our America!” Sparks believed that he was defending the Constitution on Trump’s behalf and that Pence had a duty to invalidate the election results, according to his attorney. “His belief was wrong, but it was sincere,” Wendelsdorf said. Allen said Sparks knew that he broke the law but wasn’t remorseful. “I’ll go again given the opportunity,” Sparks texted his mother a day after the riot. Sparks and his co-workers returned to Kentucky on Jan. 7, 2021. By then, images of him storming the Capitol had spread online. On his way home, Sparks called the Metropolitan Police Department and offered to turn himself in, according to prosecutors. He was arrested a few days later. Sparks and Howe were charged together in a November 2022 indictment. Howe pleaded guilty to assault and obstruction charges and was sentenced in October to four years and two months in prison.

Kanchha Sherpa, 91, was among the 35 members in the team that put New Zealander Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay atop the 8,849-meter (29,032-foot) peak on May 29, 1953. “It would be better for the mountain to reduce the number of climbers,” Kanchha said in an interview in Kathmandu on Saturday, “Right now there is always a big crowd of people at the summit.” Since the first conquest, the peak has been climbed thousands of times, and it gets more crowded every year. During the spring climbing season in 2023, 667 climbers scaled the peak, but that brought in thousands of support staff to the base camp between the months of March and May. There have been concerns about the number of people living on the mountain for months on end, generating trash and waste, but authorities have no plans to cut down on the number of permits they issue to climbers. There are rules that require climbers to bring down their own trash, equipment and everything they carry to the mountain or risk losing their deposit, but monitoring has not been very effective. “It is very dirty now. People throw tins and wrappings after eating food. Who is going to pick them up now?” Kanchha said. “Some climbers just dump their trash in the crevasse, which would be hidden at that time but eventually it will flow down to base camp as the snow melts and carries them downward.” For the Sherpas, Everest is Qomolangma or goddess mother of the world, and is revered by their community. They generally perform religious rituals before climbing the peak. “They should not be dirtying the mountain. It is our biggest god and they should not be dirtying the gods,” he said “Qomolangma is the biggest god for the Sherpas but people smoke and eat meat and throw them on the mountain.” Kanchha was just a young man when he joined the Hillary-Tenzing expedition. He was among the three Sherpas to go to the last camp on Everest along with Hillary and Tenzing. They could not go any further because they did not have a permit. They first heard of the successful ascent on the radio, and then were reunited with the summit duo at Camp 2. The next four years will change America forever.

Only the section from the base camp to Camp 1 over the unstable Khumbu Icefall changes every year. Kanchha has four children, eight grandchildren and a 20-month-old great-granddaughter.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-california-blizzard_n_65e34895e4b005b858348578,"Major California Blizzard Dumps Snow, Creates 'Impossible' Travel Conditions",scott sonner,3/2/2024,"RENO, Nev. (AP) — A powerful blizzard raged overnight into Saturday in the Sierra Nevada as the biggest storm of the season shut down a long stretch of Interstate-80 in California and gusty winds and heavy rain hit lower elevations, leaving tens of thousands of customers without power. Up to 10 feet (3 meters) of snow is expected in some areas. The National Weather Service said early Saturday that widespread blowing snow was creating “extremely dangerous to impossible travel conditions.” The combination of snow and high winds was most intense in the Sierra Nevada, with more than 3 inches (7 centimeters) of snow falling per hour and wind gusts over 100 mph (161 kph). “High to extreme avalanche danger” is expected in the backcountry through Sunday evening throughout the central Sierra, including the greater Lake Tahoe area, the weather service said. California authorities on Friday shut down 100 miles (160 kilometers) of I-80 due to “spin outs, high winds, and low visibility.” They had no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border just west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California. Pacific Gas & Electric reported around 7 a.m. Saturday that 27,000 households and businesses were without power. A tornado touched down Friday afternoon in Madera County and caused some damage to an elementary school, said Andy Bollenbacher, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Hanford. Some of the ski resorts that shut down Friday said they planned to remain closed on Saturday to dig out with an eye on reopening Sunday, but most said they would wait to provide updates Saturday morning. Palisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of Tahoe and site of the 1960 Winter Olympics, closed all chairlifts Saturday due to snow, wind and low visibility. The storm began barreling into the region on Thursday. A blizzard warning through Sunday morning covers a 300-mile (482-kilometer) stretch of the mountains. Some ski lovers raced up to the mountains ahead of the storm. Daniel Lavely, an avid skier who works at a Reno-area home/construction supply store, was not one of them. He said Friday that he wouldn’t have considered making the hour-drive to ski on his season pass at a Tahoe resort because of the gale-force winds. But most of his customers Friday seemed to think the storm wouldn’t be as bad as predicted, he said. “I had one person ask me for a shovel,” Lavely said. “Nobody asked me about a snowblower, which we sold out the last storm about two weeks ago.” Meteorologists predict as much as 10 feet (3 meters) of snow is possible in the mountains around Lake Tahoe by the weekend, with 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 meters) in the communities on the lake’s shores and more than a foot (30 centimeters) possible in the valleys on the Sierra’s eastern front, including Reno.

Ayesha Curry, a cookbook author and restaurateur, announced that she’s pregnant Friday in the latest issue of a magazine published by her lifestyle brand, Sweet July. She said in the cover story that she and the Golden State Warriors star had not previously planned to expand their family, but that they changed their minds about wanting more children last year. “For me, the decision came from always finding myself looking around and feeling like somebody was missing,” she said. “It started to turn my brain a little bit. Maybe somebody was missing. So we set out on this journey, knowing that this would complete our family.” She later shared how she’s approaching pregnancy differently this time around, saying that she’s “protecting my peace.” “This is such a sacred time in life that I know I’m never going to get back so I’m being a little selfish,” she said. “I’m keeping some things to myself.” Ayesha and Stephen Curry already have three children: daughters Riley, 11, and Ryan, 8; and son Canon, 5. The couple, who wed in 2011, have talked about their parenting journey on several occasions. In 2016, Stephen Curry told Parents magazine in a video interview that he’d learned to be prepared for “anything” as a dad. “You’re going to be thrown a lot of curveballs,” he said at the time. In 2022, Ayesha Curry told Access Hollywood how she and her husband keep their marriage “spicy.” “For us it’s just not forgetting to date each other, make the time to get dressed up and go out and do all the things,” she said.

Three planes from Air Forces Central dropped 66 bundles containing about 38,000 meals into Gaza at 8:30 a.m. EST, according to two of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity before a public announcement. The airdrop is expected to be the first of many announced by President Joe Biden on Friday. The aid will be coordinated with Jordan, which has also conducted airdrops to deliver food to Gaza. At least 115 Palestinians were killed and hundreds more wounded in the Thursday attack as they scrambled for aid, the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said. Israel says many of the dead were trampled in a chaotic crush for the food aid, and its troops fired warning shots after the crowd moved toward them in a threatening way. In the coming days, the United States will carry out airdrops of aid to Gaza, redouble our efforts to open a maritime corridor, and expand deliveries by land.The aid flowing into Gaza is nowhere near enough.We all need to do more. And the United States will do more. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Friday that the airdrops were being planned to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance in a safe way to people on the ground. The C-130 cargo plane is a widely used military aircraft to deliver aid to remote places due to its ability to land in austere environments and cargo capacity. A C-130 can airlift as much as 42,000 pounds of cargo and its crews know how to rig the cargo, which sometimes can include even vehicles, onto massive pallets can be safely dropped out of the back of the aircraft. Air Force loadmasters secure the bundles onto pallets with netting that is rigged for release in the back of a C-130, and then crews release it with a parachute when the aircraft reaches the intended delivery zone. The Air Force’s C-130 has been used in years past to air drop humanitarian into Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti and other locations and the airframe is used in an annual multi-national “Operation Christmas Drop” that air drops pallets of toys, supplies, nonperishable food and fishing supplies to remote locations in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau. Since the war began on Oct. 7, Israel has barred entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies, except for a trickle of aid entering the south from Egypt at the Rafah crossing and Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing. The United Nations says a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people face starvation. Aid officials have said that airdrops are not an efficient means of distributing aid and are a measure of last resort.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ship-hit-by-yemens-houthi-rebels-sinks-in-red-sea-first-vessel-lost-in-conflict_n_65e32edfe4b013678e1564fa,"Ship Hit By Yemen's Houthi Rebels Sinks In Red Sea, First Vessel Lost In Conflict",jon gambrell,3/2/2024,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A ship attacked by Yemen’s Houthi rebels has sunk in the Red Sea after days of taking on water, officials said Saturday, the first vessel to be fully destroyed as part of their campaign over Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The sinking of the Rubymar comes as shipping through the crucial waterway for cargo and energy shipments moving from Asia and the Middle East to Europe has been affected by the Houthi attacks. Already, many ships have turned away from the route. The sinking could see further detours and higher insurance rates put on vessels plying the waterway — potentially driving up global inflation and affecting aid shipments to the region. The Belize-flagged Rubymar had been drifting northward after being struck by a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile on Feb. 18 in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, a crucial waterway linking the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. Yemen’s internationally recognized government, as well as a regional military official, confirmed the ship sank. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as no authorization was given to speak to journalists about the incident. The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, which watches over Mideast waterways, separately acknowledged the Rubymar’s sinking Saturday afternoon. The Rubymar’s Beirut-based manager could not be immediately reached for comment. Yemen’s exiled government, which has been backed by a Saudi-led coalition since 2015, said the Rubymar sank late Friday as stormy weather took hold over the Red Sea. The vessel had been abandoned for 12 days after the attack, though plans had been made to try and tow the ship to a safe port. The Iran-backed Houthis, who had falsely claimed the ship sank almost instantly after the attack, did not immediately acknowledge the ship’s sinking. The U.S. military’s Central Command previously warned the vessel’s cargo of fertilizer, as well as fuel leaking from the ship, could cause ecological damage to the Red Sea. Ahmed Awad Bin Mubarak, the prime minister of Yemen’s internationally recognized government, called the ship’s sinking “an unprecedented environmental disaster.” “It’s a new disaster for our country and our people,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Every day, we pay for the Houthi militia’s adventures, which were not stopped at plunging Yemen into the coup disaster and war.” The Houthis have held Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, since 2014, expelling the government. It’s fought a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 in a stalemated war. Satellite pictures analyzed by The Associated Press from Planet Labs PBC showed smaller boats alongside the Rubymar on Wednesday. It wasn’t immediately clear whose vessels those were. The images showed the Rubymar’s stern sinking into the Red Sea but still afloat, mirroring earlier video taken of the vessel. The private security firm Ambrey separately reported Friday about a mysterious incident involving the Rubymar. “A number of Yemenis were reportedly harmed during a security incident which took place” on Friday, Ambrey said. It did not elaborate on what that incident involved and no party involved in Yemen’s yearslong war claimed any new attack on the vessel. A satellite image taken Friday from Maxar Technologies showed new blast damage on the Rubymar not previously seen, with no other vessels around it. Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters over the Israel-Hamas war. Those vessels have included at least one with cargo bound for Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, and an aid ship later bound for Houthi-controlled territory. Despite over a month of U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi rebels remain capable of launching significant attacks. That includes the attack on the Rubymar and the downing of an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars. The Houthis insist their attacks will continue until Israel stops its combat operations in the Gaza Strip, which have enraged the wider Arab world and seen the Houthis gain international recognition.

(AP) — A movie director who was shot by Alec Baldwin during a movie rehearsal — and survived — testified Friday at trial that he was approaching the cinematographer when he heard a loud bang and felt the bullet’s impact. “It felt like someone had taken a baseball bat to my shoulder,” said Joel Souza, who was wounded by the same bullet that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the New Mexico set for the upcoming Western movie “Rust” on Oct. 21, 2021. Souza never filed a complaint but was called to testify as prosecutors pursue charges of involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence against movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who maintains her innocence. Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer on “Rust,” was separately indicted by a grand jury last month. He has pleaded not guilty, and a trial is scheduled for July. Prosecutors are reconstructing a complex chain of events that culminated in gunfire on a film set where live ammunition is expressly prohibited. Souza said his workday began before dawn with the realization that six camera-crew members had walked off set. Hutchins put out urgent calls for replacements, and filming was back underway by late-morning in an outdoor scene involving horses and wagons. Work after lunch started with positioning a camera in preparation for an extreme close-up take of Baldwin drawing a gun from a holster inside a makeshift church. Souza said he moved in behind Hutchins for a closer look at the camera angle but never saw the gun that shot him. “I got up behind her just to try to see on the monitor, and there was an incredibly loud bang,” Souza said. “This was deafening.” Baldwin and his handling of firearms on set are coming under special scrutiny in questioning by prosecutor and defense attorneys. On Thursday, prosecutors played video footage of Baldwin pressuring the movie armorer to hurry up as she reloads guns between scenes. “One more, let’s reload right away,” Baldwin says at the close of a scene. “Here we go, come on. We should have had two guns and both were reloading.” Gutierrez-Reed can be seen quickly loading a revolver. Expert witness Bryan Carpenter, a Mississippi-based specialist in firearms safety on film sets, said Baldwin’s commands infringed on basic industry safety protocols and responsibilities of the armorer. “He’s basically instructing the armorer on how to do their job ... ‘Hurry up, give it to me fast,’” Carpenter said. “Rushing with firearms and telling someone to rush with firearms is not — not normal or accepted.” On Friday, defense attorney Jason Bowles pressed Souza to remember whether the script explicitly called for Baldwin to point the gun toward the camera, where he and Hutchins were standing. “And do you know whether, from the script, whether that firearm was supposed to be pointed towards the camera?” Bowles inquired. “It’s not a matter of the script, really. For that specific shot, it was literally supposed to be the gun being pulled out sideways,” Souza said. Prosecutors say Gutierrez-Reed is to blame for unwittingly bringing live ammunition on set and that she flouted basic safety protocols for weapons — partly by leaving the church rehearsal while a gun still was in use. Defense attorneys say it wasn’t Gutierrez-Reed’s decision to leave. Souza said he only recalled seeing Gutierrez-Reed inside the church after he was shot. “I remember at one point looking up and her standing there ... distraught,” Souza said. “I remember her saying, ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry, Joel.’ And I remember somebody just screaming at her, and they just ushered her out.’” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dad-daughter-letters-writer-addiction_n_65d53b67e4b007e3eb7373e0,"My Dad Disappeared When I Was A Kid. Years Later, I Got A Letter That Changed Both Our Lives.",geralyn broder murray,3/2/2024,"During the summer I turned 14, I came home to a typewritten letter waiting for me on my bedspread. My dad had entered a drug treatment program — part of his rehabilitation was writing to his family about what he’d been through, and to apologize if necessary. Apologies were necessary. My father had disappeared five or six years before, after a custody battle and then a failure to pay child support. Since then, we’d moved away, and my mother remarried and had a second child. The few memories I had of my father were mostly of a swimming pool that made my eyes bloodshot, animals that I loved and an awful skin rash I picked up when he’d taken me to Hawaii without telling my mother. In that first letter, he explained his addiction and the consequences it had on his life, and how when trouble descended, he’d been incapable of dealing with it, so he’d stayed loaded. Now finished with an 28-day rehab program, he planned to remain in Monterey, California — a city with a historically calming effect on him since his stint at Fort Ord when he was 18. He closed the letter: “There will be a new twist to what I do, how I do it and who I choose to do it with. I am feeling stronger every day, but I didn’t get sick in one day and I don’t think I’ll get well in one month either. Would like to hear from you. Hope you understand.” I was 14. I didn’t understand. But I had a father that wanted to hear from me, so I wrote back. And then he did. And then I did. For 17 years. His letters gave me what I’d been missing during the first 14 years of my life. Every typewritten page, every piece of personal stationery with his left-handed scrawl, managed to fill another gaping hole in my heart with something like love. When I began writing for my high school newspaper and sent him my clippings, my dad, an aspiring writer with a deep wish for a published work of his own, was over the moon with praise. When I was 16, he wrote: “I enjoyed your articles and I think you show great promise.” At 17, a note from him arrived that read, “Another excellent piece! You have found your calling. I am impressed.” When I was not quite 18, he wrote to me and shared that the fun of writing had left him. He explained he was trying to remember the simple joy of getting words down on the page. “I consider you a writer,” his typewritten words on thin vellum paper proclaimed, “and any suggestions you might care to share on this or other subjects would be most welcome.” He considered me a writer. More than anything, he considered me. When my graduation from high school coincided with my mother’s second divorce, there was no money to spare for college tuition. My father — who’d finally begun paying my mother that back child support — offered to send it straight to me. This made going to college possible, eventually making me the first in my family to graduate with a degree from higher education. At 19, he bought me my first car, a used 1981 Honda Prelude. He laid out the agreement in another letter: “If you are going to drink, you may not drive under any circumstances. Wearing the Dad hat is still awkward and I am falling all over myself, please try and understand. I love you and respect you, all I want to know is how we can continue to improve our relationship.” Every letter ended the same: Much love, Dad. I used the car to get to school and work and to fulfill the requirements for my major in journalism, the choice of which was greatly influenced by my father. Once, when I mentioned changing my major to psychology, citing my love of people and desire to help them, he countered that my gift for writing was something that would help many people — and that it was a gift not everyone had to give. Plus, he was paying, so journalism it was. When I got caught up with my social life in college, ending up with average (or below average) grades, a letter arrived promptly, reminding me what I was in school to do. “If being average is OK with you at this point, you might as well french fry your hair and get over to Burger King! No one ever set out to be average!” he wrote. “The world has become an average planet and has just about sealed its fate with average people doing average work. We need excellence and we need it from you. It will take people like you — young people with original ideas — to take charge.” Reader, my grades improved, if only slightly. During college and after, I drove the Prelude from my apartment in Los Angeles to his house in Monterey so often, the car could almost find its way there without me. Dad, his wife Karen and I stayed up too late watching movies and, after Karen went to bed, Dad and I sat by the fireplace for hours and talked about the world, about writing, about life. What he didn’t share fireside arrived by mail. “It’s 2 a.m. and I feel like running. I don’t mean jogging either,” one letter read. “Sometimes, I just want to cut and run. That was my pattern. It didn’t matter if things were going well or poorly, the feeling would come over me and splitting was the only thing I could think of. I’ve simply run out of places to run so now I’m running in place.” In another letter he wrote, “I’m wrapped in the summer fog. It’s wet and heavy and is holding me inside and away from the beach and pool. Possibly, I’ll be able to write today. This is the way it always begins.” After college, I worked as an advertising copywriter. I was 26 and making $26,000 a year writing jingles. Yet, from my father’s letters, you’d think I’d won a Pulitzer. “I want you to know that I am proud of you and pleased that you are becoming what I’ve only dreamed of becoming, a writer,” he wrote. “At least one of us is going to make it.” I knew writing commercials for Subway sandwiches and Lee jeans didn’t make me special, but the words he’d sent me from his Smith-Corona did. Like every other twenty-something, I questioned the government and policy and the world. He had thoughts on all of it. Once he fished me out of a terrible relationship in person; for almost everything else, he counseled me by snail mail and eventually, email. “I know you are afraid,” he wrote, “which is not entirely a bad thing. A little reservation, concern, awareness and appreciation of the subtleties can add to your grace of movement and decision-making abilities. Go with your strength — writing, observing, making sense of disorder and assisting others by this very talent.” He added, “In your search for something positive, look in the corners. The true leaders are often anonymous. You have inherited a mixed bag of blessings and bombs. Pick your spot, dig in and make your mark.” By the time he met my now-husband, my father was already in a dark depression, yet he emerged long enough to be elated at my choice of mate. He was 57, struggling financially and trying to reinvent himself professionally. The last Christmas we spent together, December 2000, he hand-delivered what I didn’t know would be his last letter. He wrote about a new musician he’d recently discovered — Eva Cassidy — and how she’d reminded him that some moments capture our attention in a way we never forget, like the first time you hear the crack of a bat or taste fresh crab or see a shooting star. He hoped Eva would inspire me, that she would remind me how the arts hold the power to do this for us. Six months later, my father took his life.  After he died, everyone asked whether he had left a note. None had been found, but then I remembered: Yes, he had left a note. He’d left 48 of them.  Twenty-two years later, thanks to those letters, my father is still very much alive in my heart my life and the lives of my two children. If there comes a day I forget about his love for the Dodgers, Hunter S. Thompson or Miles Davis, if his passion for swimming in the ocean or remaining curious slips my mind, all I have to do is get out the yellow file with the 48 priceless pages on which his words remain, and I know they will bring him back to me, again and again.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-timing-trump-jan-6-trial-october_n_65e25845e4b005b858346cbf,Supreme Court Schedule Could Put Trump On Trial All Through Campaign’s Final Month,s.v. date,3/2/2024,"WASHINGTON ― With the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to take up Donald Trump’s claim that he is immune from prosecution for his coup attempt, the former president ― and near certain Republican presidential nominee ― could be spending every weekday of the campaign’s final month sitting in a Washington, D.C., courtroom. Instead of visiting key states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, where his efforts to regain the White House will likely be decided, Trump might instead be sitting before U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, listening to his former aides testify about his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss. Instead of long speeches at rallies, Trump’s campaigning could primarily consist of his signature rants about “election interference” and a “witch hunt” as he stands outside the E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Court House ― just blocks from the U.S. Capitol, which a mob of his followers attacked on Jan. 6, 2021, as part of his last-ditch attempt to retain power. “You’re going to have the spectacle of his former officials, one after the other, day after day, testifying about what he did,” said George Conway, a conservative lawyer who worked on the civil lawsuit that led to former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment and, more recently, helped writer E. Jean Carroll sue Trump for sexually abusing and defaming her. Whether such a scenario would help Trump or hurt him is unclear. Trump’s campaign aides did not respond to HuffPost queries, but much of his 2024 campaign has already been based on his supposed victimhood at the hands of the “deep state,” and it has let him glide toward winning the nomination over a field of rivals. And whether the October trial scenario comes to pass depends entirely on how quickly the Supreme Court justices issue their ruling after the scheduled oral arguments on April 22. The high court historically has moved quickly on questions about the presidency. In 1974, just 16 days after hearing oral arguments, justices ruled unanimously that President Richard Nixon had to turn over recordings he had made in the White House. Those tapes revealed he was aware of the cover-up in the Watergate scandal, and Nixon wound up resigning days after the tapes were made public. In December 2000, the Supreme Court ruled just one day after oral arguments that Florida could not conduct a statewide hand recount of presidential ballots, thereby giving the presidency to Texas Gov. George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore. If the Supreme Court rules in a similar fashion in Trump’s appeal, the case could be back in Chutkan’s hands by early May. She has previously said she would not penalize Trump’s legal team for appealing the immunity question and would give them the three months they had remaining in early December before the trial was to have started. The resulting early August trial date potentially means it would be wrapped up and a verdict issued by Election Day on Nov. 5. “This case can still go to trial if the Supreme Court moves quickly, and they should,” said Norm Eisen, a former White House lawyer in the Obama administration who worked with House Democrats in the first Trump impeachment in 2020. If, however, the court does not rule until the very end of its term in late June or early July, Chutkan’s three-month clock would push a trial start date to late September or early October. At that point, Trump’s lawyers would be out of legal arguments to delay the case any further but are almost certain to continue their political argument: claiming that it would be unfair to proceed so close to the election. Some legal experts worry that in a presidential contest, those arguments would be difficult for Chutkan to resist. “No judge is going to start a trial four weeks before the election, especially with the possibility trial might extend beyond Election Day,” said Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. To date, however, Chutkan has indicated that she will not treat Trump differently than any other criminal defendant coming before her. “The fact that he’s running a political campaign currently has to yield to the orderly administration of justice,” Chutkan said at a hearing last August. “Regardless of what is going on with his, I hate to say, his day job, this is a criminal case…. I cannot and I will not factor into my decisions the influence it will have on a political campaign on either side.” That a federal trial on the election conspiracy charges will happen at all is based on the assumption ― shared by many if not most legal experts ― that the high court will uphold a February appellate court ruling that Trump does not have immunity from prosecution over his actions while president. That it could start before the election is largely based on the presumption that justices will not send the case back to Chutkan with a demand that she hold a fact-finding hearing. Eisen said the wording of the Supreme Court’s order Wednesday accepting the case suggests that its decision will be based on the assumption that the accusations in the Jan. 6 indictment are true. “They talk about making the determination based on allegations,” he said. “That’s a reference to making the determination based on the indictment.” Conway, though, said that even if the court does send the case back to Chutkan to determine, for example, whether his attempts to overturn the election were “official” presidential duties or not, she could hold a hearing on that specific question relatively quickly over the summer, bringing in the same witnesses who will later appear at the trial. “It would be a mini-trial,” Conway said, which would have the same effect of bringing forward incriminating testimony just as the campaign season heats up. “That’s probably not going to be good for him.” The next four years will change America forever.

So I became curious and asked the BuzzFeed Community: “Teachers, what are the automatic tell-tale signs that a parent or kid’s behavior exhibits ‘red flags’ parenting styles?” Hundreds of teachers provided their expertise and experience on the matter. Here’s what they had to say below: ""'We don't believe in bedtimes.' That's great, but your kid is massively sleep-deprived. 'We don't believe in limiting junk food.' That's great, but your kid is constipated from a steady diet of Goldfish crackers and nothing else. 'We believe in only using natural products.' That's great, but your kid's diaper rash isn't responding to your all-natural organic cream, and you need to see a doctor. It's great to have parenting ideals, but your child's needs have to come first."" —lobsterlemonlime —Natalie, 2nd grade teacher, Oklahoma ""Watching his interactions with his mom and siblings during our conference, it finally dawned on me that he was just not getting any positive attention or affection at home. And I suddenly felt so sad for him. He was really into video games, and I noticed he always wanted to talk to me about them at school. So, I started making it a point to be interested in this any time he wanted to talk. We also continued with his behavior chart, and soon, the tantrums stopped completely. I was able to develop a close and trusting relationship with him just by observing that his parents couldn’t give him the attention he needed."" —Julie, Elementary Teacher, Arizona —Sarah —savithri1189 —lameshurbay By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The sound is great for price paid. Way better than raw tv alone. The base is just enough to feel like a small personal theater placed under the bed. It’s perfect.” — Ozark “My LG Surround finally gave up at the beginning of a movie yesterday. So I went out and bought this Vizio 5.1 Surround system and All I can say is Wow. I am pleasantly surprised at the sound I get at this price point. I love that the surround speakers don’t have to be connected to the Bar under the TV. I have them behind the couch along with the Sub. The surround sound fills the room quite nicely and the sub allows us to “feel” the movie on the couch. The dialog feature is great too. It allows you to boost the voice without it being drowned by the rest of the sound. It’s plenty loud in our lil 500sq ft living room. My daughter says it’s clearly loud enough as she heard it even outside. It took about 15 minutes to get going and hooked it to the optical digital audio on the TV and adjusted the a offset and we were good to go. It has a true theater experience in our living room. We are completely satisfied with the purchase.” — Wolfy “I like the sound of this speaker system. The bass is deep enough to rattle the room when we’re watching movies or listening to music. I don’t like the fact that tha surround speakers are wired. When I purchased this system, I thought it was all wireless.” — DEEKEEBEE “I should have gotten this surround sound much sooner. Good things does come in small packages. Clear audio and this small subwoofer hits hard. It does make one feel like they are in a theater. If you’re looking to purchase one, I recommend this. Don’t waste your money on much expensive surround sound, this little facka will suffice. Great sound for the price, thank you.” — Rene By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

(AP) — A bill recriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs was passed by the Oregon Legislature on Friday, undoing a key part of the state’s first-in-the-nation drug decriminalization law as governments struggle to respond to the deadliest overdose crisis in U.S. history. The state Senate approved House Bill 4002 in a 21-8 vote after the House passed it 51-7 on Thursday. The bill now heads to the desk of Gov. Tina Kotek, who said in January that she is open to signing a bill that would roll back decriminalization, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. “With this bill, we are doubling down on our commitment to make sure Oregonians have access to the treatment and care that they need,” said Democratic Senate Majority Leader Kate Lieber, of Portland, one of the bill’s authors, adding that its passage will “be the start of real and transformative change for our justice system.” The measure makes the possession of small amounts of drugs such as heroin or methamphetamine a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail. It enables police to confiscate the drugs and crack down on their use on sidewalks and in parks. Drug treatment is to be offered as an alternative to criminal penalties. The bill also aims to make it easier to prosecute people who sell drugs. It increases access to addiction medication, and to obtain and keep housing without facing discrimination for using that medication. Decriminalization of personal-use amounts of drugs, OK’d by voters in 2020 under Ballot Measure 110, was supposed to move hundreds of millions of dollars of marijuana tax revenues into drug treatment and harm reduction programs. That didn’t translate into an improved care network for a state with the second-highest rate of substance use disorder in the nation and ranked 50th for access to treatment, according to an audit report released in 2023. And with Oregon experiencing one of the nation’s largest spikes in overdose deaths, Republican pressure intensified, and a well-funded campaign group called for a ballot measure that would further weaken Measure 110. Researchers have said it was too soon to determine whether the law contributed to the overdose surge, and supporters of the decriminalization measure say the decadeslong approach of arresting people for possessing and using drugs didn’t work. Lawmakers who opposed the bill voiced those concerns. Some called it a return to the war on drugs that disproportionally impacted and imprisoned millions of Black men. Democratic Sen. Lew Frederick, of Portland, one of four Black senators, said the bill had too many flaws and that testimony on the bill heard again and again was that substance use disorder requires primarily a medical response.

She was 102. Her death was confirmed by her commercial agent, Lori Sale, who called Apfel “extraordinary.” No cause of death was given. It was also announced on her her verified Instagram page on Friday, which a day earlier had celebrated that Leap Day represented her 102nd-and-a-half birthday. Born Aug. 29, 1921, Apfel was famous for her irreverent, eye-catching outfits, mixing haute couture and oversized costume jewelry. A classic Apfel look would, for instance, pair a feather boa with strands of chunky beads, bangles and a jacket decorated with Native American beadwork. With her big, round, black-rimmed glasses, bright red lipstick and short white hair, she stood out at every fashion show she attended. Her style was the subject of museum exhibits and a documentary film, “Iris,” directed by Albert Maysles. “I’m not pretty, and I’ll never be pretty, but it doesn’t matter,” she once said. “I have something much better. I have style.” Apfel enjoyed late-in-life fame on social media, amassing nearly 3 million followers on Instagram, where her profile declares: “More is more & Less is a Bore.” On TikTok, she drew 215,000 followers as she waxed wise on things fashion and style and promoted recent collaborations. “Being stylish and being fashionable are two entirely different things,” she said in one TikTok video. “You can easily buy your way into being fashionable. Style, I think is in your DNA. It implies originality and courage.” She never retired, telling “Today”: “I think retiring at any age is a fate worse than death. Just because a number comes up doesn’t mean you have to stop.” “Working alongside her was the honor of a lifetime. I will miss her daily calls, always greeted with the familiar question: “What have you got for me today?,” Sale said in a statement. “Testament to her insatiable desire to work. She was a visionary in every sense of the word. She saw the world through a unique lens – one adorned with giant, distinctive spectacles that sat atop her nose.” Apfel was an expert on textiles and antique fabrics. She and her husband Carl owned a textile manufacturing company, Old World Weavers, and specialized in restoration work, including projects at the White House under six different U.S. presidents. Apfel’s celebrity clients included Estee Lauder and Greta Garbo. Apfel’s own fame blew up in 2005 when the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute in New York City hosted a show about her called “Rara Avis,” Latin for “rare bird.” The museum described her style as “both witty and exuberantly idiosyncratic. Her originality is typically revealed in her mixing of high and low fashions — Dior haute couture with flea market finds, 19th-century ecclesiastical vestments with Dolce & Gabbana lizard trousers.” The museum said her “layered combinations” defied “aesthetic conventions” and “even at their most extreme and baroque” represented a “boldly graphic modernity.” The Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, was one of several museums around the country that hosted a traveling version of the show. Apfel later decided to donate hundreds of pieces to the Peabody — including couture gowns — to help them build what she termed “a fabulous fashion collection.” The Museum of Fashion & Lifestyle near Apfel’s winter home in Palm Beach, Florida, also plans a gallery dedicated to displaying items from Apfel’s collection. Apfel was born in New York City to Samuel and Sadye Barrel. Her mother owned a boutique. Apfel’s fame in her later years included appearances in ads for brands like M.A.C. cosmetics and Kate Spade. She also designed a line of accessories and jewelry for Home Shopping Network, collaborated with H&M on a sold-out-in-minutes collection of brightly-colored apparel, jewelry and shoes, put out a makeup line with Ciaté London, an eyeglass collection with Zenni and partnered with Ruggable on floor coverings.

In a 2017 interview with AP at age 95, she said her favorite contemporary designers included Ralph Rucci, Isabel Toledo and Naeem Khan, but added: “I have so much, I don’t go looking.” Asked for her fashion advice, she said: “Everybody should find her own way. I’m a great one for individuality. I don’t like trends. If you get to learn who you are and what you look like and what you can handle, you’ll know what to do.” She called herself the “accidental icon,” which became the title of a book she published in 2018 filled with her mementos and style musings.

Under the proposed regulation, breaking, damaging or losing wheelchairs or other mobility devices would qualify as a violation of the Air Carrier Access Act, a law that bars airlines from discriminating on the basis of disability. In 2023, airlines mishandled more than 11,000 wheelchairs and scooters, according to the department. The proposed changes would also require airlines to provide annual training for employees who physically assist disabled passengers. “There are millions of Americans with disabilities who do not travel by plane because of inadequate airline practices and inadequate government regulation, but now we are setting out to change that,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement on Thursday. “This new rule would change the way airlines operate to ensure that travelers using wheelchairs can travel safely and with dignity.” The new regulation is among several that the DOT has brought forward in recent years to bolster protections for disabled passengers and make air travel more accessible. In 2022, the DOT published a “bill of rights” for disabled passengers. Last year, the department issued a regulation requiring, among other things, that new single-aisle aircrafts with a minimum of 125 seats have larger, wheelchair-accessible bathrooms with accessibility features. While disability rights advocates are excited to see efforts made to improve air travel, many are worried the new regulations will run up against a deadline that could prevent them from moving forward. Under the Congressional Review Act, executive branch agencies are required to report their rulemaking activities to Congress to give lawmakers a chance to strike down new rules. A provision within the also allows for a new Congress to review and act on rules from the previous session during a specific time period. Mia Ives-Rublee, the director of the Disability Justice Initiative at the Center for American Progress, told HuffPost she and others in the disability community are worried that the proposed rules for airlines, as well as pending regulations that have been proposed by the Department of Justice and other agencies to support disabled Americans, could be wiped away if Donald Trump retakes the presidency. “If there is a change in administration for the following year, that administration could just strip all those changes with sort of a stroke of a pen,” Ives-Rublee explained. “So we want to try and get these things done as soon as possible, and that means that we need the… agencies to act as soon as possible so that we aren’t running into that deadline.” In an emailed statement to HuffPost, a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation said that the proposed changes will be published in the Federal Register and will be open to public comment for 60 days. “The Department views this issue as a priority and will work expeditiously to review the public comments and determine how to proceed consistent with federal requirements,” the spokesperson said. Ives-Rublee adds that while she’s happy that the regulations have been proposed, she wants to see the department branch out and address other, more immediate transportation-related concerns of the disability community, such as the shortcomings of paratransit and public transportation systems.

Similarly, paratransit services are specialized, door-to-door transportation for disabled people, but data shows that people experience long wait times, unreliable service and lack of compliance with standards set by federal disability law when using paratransit. “It is important that the airlines fix what they’re doing, and these regulations are important,” Ives-Rublee said. “I’m just saying there are also other regulations that need to be completed, or even just reviewed, to address the concerns of folks who utilize public transportation and paratransit that have significant needs.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC), one of the country’s largest LGBTQ+ rights groups, filed complaints with the Department of Education and the Department of Justice following Benedict’s death on Feb. 8. Benedict died one day after a fight with three other Owasso High School students, putting a spotlight on the culture of fear and harassment facing LGBTQ+ students in Oklahoma and beyond. “This letter is to notify you that the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), is opening for investigation the above-referenced complaint that you filed against the Owasso Public Schools (the District),” wrote Karen Mines, the Education Department’s regional director, in a letter to HRC. “Your complaint alleges that the District discriminated against students by failing to respond appropriately to sex-based harassment, of which it had notice, at Owasso High School during the 2023-2024 school year.” The letter also notes that the Office for Civil Rights will investigate whether the district failed to follow Title IX guidelines when responding to sex-based harassment. Current Title IX law includes language that protects transgender students in any school or educational program that receives federal funding. Brock Crawford, a spokesperson for the Owasso Public School District, confirmed by email that the district received a notice of the investigation from the Office for Civil Rights. “The district is committed to cooperating with federal officials and believes the complaint submitted by HRC is not supported by the facts and is without merit,” Crawford said in the email. In the days since news broke about Benedict’s death, dozens of organizations have accused Oklahoma’s state superintendent, Ryan Walters, of creating a hostile environment for LGBTQ+ and two-spirit students. The conservative superintendent has faced backlash for appointing Chaya Raichik, the woman behind the far-right social media account Libs of TikTok, to a voluntary seat on the state’s library review committee. In 2022, Libs of TikTok targeted one of Benedict’s eighth-grade teachers, Tyler Wrynn, prompting them to resign because of the harassment. On Wednesday more than 300 advocacy and LGBTQ+ organizations called for Walters’ immediate removal, stating that his choice to appoint Raichik, as well as his emergency rule to block a trans Oklahoma teen from changing his gender on his school records, have created a “culture where rampant harassment of 2SLGBTQ+ students has been allowed to go unchecked.” The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-republicans-seek-political-cover-behind-useless-ivf-resolutions_n_65e267fae4b0d2a247596cba,House Republicans Seek Political Cover Behind Useless IVF Resolutions,alanna vagianos,3/1/2024,"House Republicans are all talk and no action on protecting Americans’ access to in vitro fertilization, after the Alabama Supreme Court granted embryos the same legal status as children last month. Several House Republicans introduced two measures this week following the sweeping court ruling as a way to express strong support for IVF protections. Both resolutions list critical facts about IVF, note the importance of patient access and applaud fertility specialists for the work they do. One of the two even goes on to condemn the judicial ruling out of Alabama. But neither have any legislative power. Resolutions are non-binding statements that primarily serve as tools for political posturing. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) announced her resolution on Thursday, which expresses “support for continued access to fertility care and assisted reproductive technology, such as in vitro fertilization.” The resolution was co-sponsored by five other House Republicans: Reps. David Schweikert (Ariz.), Anthony D’Esposito (N.Y.), Jeff Van Drew (N.J.), Jen Kiggans (Va.) and Don Bacon (Neb.). Four out of the five co-sponsors represent districts that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, and are likely vulnerable to losing their seat in November. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-Ore.) published her resolution, with Republican co-sponsors Reps. Michelle Steel (Calif.) and Juan Ciscomani (Ariz.), on Friday morning. The resolution states that the House “remains committed to commonsense policies that enable families to grow” as well as “recognizes the fundamental truth that life is precious.” “As someone who struggled with infertility and personally witnessed the miracle of IVF, I strongly believe that IVF should remain protected and accessible,” Steel tweeted along with Chavez-DeRemer’s announcement of the non-binding resolution. D’Esposito responded to HuffPost’s request for comment in an emailed statement. “Democrats’ misleading smear campaign cannot distort the fact that I’ve been fighting on Capitol Hill since day one to ensure women are empowered to make their own individual healthcare decisions by opposing any attempt to institute a nationwide abortion ban and advancing legislation that supports women’s access to important fertility resources like IVF treatments,” D’Esposito said. The House Republican took office in January 2023 and voted to pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, legislation based on a misleading premise that sought to “interfere with evidence-based medicine,” as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists described it. None of the other eight representatives responded to HuffPost’s request for comment. Republicans have found themselves scrambling to distance themselves from the Alabama ruling in the wake of national public outrage over its sweeping effect. Access to IVF is an issue over 80% of Americans support, including a majority of Republican voters. Campaigning on far-right policies that galvanize a strong but extreme subsection of the GOP base may prove risky for Republicans. Without the guardrails of Roe v. Wade, reproductive health care restrictions that are broadly unpopular can be enacted by GOP-led states. The next four years will change America forever.

Mace, Steel, Schweikert and Bacon were co-sponsors of the 2021 Life at Conception Act, an anti-abortion bill that aimed to grant full legal rights to embryos from “the moment of fertilization.” The Senate version of the bill had a carve-out to protect IVF, but the House version did not. The House bill had 166 Republican co-sponsors when it was first introduced in 2021, and 124 co-sponsors when it was re-introduced in 2023. “House Republicans are flagrant hypocrites who have spent their entire tenure in the majority attacking reproductive rights at every turn,” Courtney Rice, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told HuffPost. “Now, they are hiding behind toothless resolutions and empty public statements because they know their relentless attacks on reproductive freedoms will cost them at the ballot box.” Similar to House Republicans’ approach, Senate Republicans have been reluctant to discuss their support of IVF, particularly after Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) blocked a bill this week that would have protected access to IVF on the federal level. Democrats have a companion measure they are still pushing in the House.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elijah-mcclain-paramedic-sentenced_n_65e26cdee4b005b858346ec5,Paramedic Gets 5 Years In Prison For Elijah McClain’s Death In Rare Case Against Medical Responders,"colleen slevin, matthew brown",3/1/2024,"DENVER (AP) — A Colorado paramedic was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for the death of Elijah McClain in a rare prosecution of medical responders that has left officials rethinking how they treat people in police custody. The convictions of Peter Cichuniec and a fellow paramedic sent shock waves through the ranks of paramedics across the U.S. and thrust their profession into the acrimonious fight over social justice sparked by the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Cichuniec and Jeremy Cooper were both convicted in December of criminally negligent homicide for administering the sedative ultimately blamed for killing McClain, a 23-year-old Black massage therapist, in 2019. Cichuniec was also convicted the more serious charge of second-degree assault for giving a drug without consent or a legitimate medical purpose. McClain’s mother, Sheneen, raised her fist in the air as she left the courtroom following Friday’s sentencing, as she’s done after previous hearings. Cichuniec had faced up to 16 years in prison on the assault charge, and the five-year sentence was the minimum the judge could have given Cichuniec under sentencing guidelines. Someone from Cichuniec’s family called out, “Love you Pete” as he looked back and waved at them before leaving court in handcuffs. In testimony before the sentence was handed down by Judge Mark Warner, Sheneen McClain said she once dreamed of being a firefighter and considered them heroes “until the day they took my son’s life.” “You are a local hero no more,” she said as Cichuniec sat with his attorneys at a nearby table. “Next time, think for yourself and do not follow the direction of a crowd of cowards.” She added that the other paramedics could have intervened “simply by just saying, ‘Stop hurting my patient.’” Cichuniec — who has been in custody since his conviction and was handcuffed and shackled for the hearing — asked the judge for mercy. He wiped away tears as family members and friends testified as character witnesses on his behalf, and later told the judge he had spent his 18-year career as a firefighter and paramedic putting his own life on the line and putting other lives before his own. “I have never backed down from a call and I’ve had more things happen to me than you can imagine,” he said. “It sickened me when the prosecution said during their closing argument that I showed no remorse for Elijah. ... There was absolutely no intent to cause any harm to Elijah McClain.” Cichuniec’s wife said after the hearing she was “relatively relieved” by the outcome since it was the most lenient sentence her husband could have received. “It’s almost better knowing,” Katy Cichuniec said. Firefighters and officials from their union have criticized the state’s prosecution of Cichuniec and said it was discouraging firefighters from becoming paramedics, decreasing the number of qualified personnel in emergencies and thereby putting lives at risk. “Convicting Pete for the death is not justice. It’s the very definition of a scapegoat,” said former Aurora Fire Lieutenant John Lauder, who recently retired after working with Cichuniec over two decades. “But for the grace of God, it could be us in jail. The result of this decision will have a negative impact on patient care throughout the nation. Will paramedics now be held be held responsible for outcomes beyond their control?” McClain’s death received little attention initially but gained renewed interest as mass protests swept the nation in 2020, with his name becoming a rallying cry for critics of racial injustice in policing. McClain was stopped by police after a 911 caller reported he looked suspicious walking down the street waving his arms and wearing a face mask on Aug. 24, 2019, in the Denver suburb of Aurora. McClain, who had been listening to music with earbuds, seemed caught off guard when an officer put his hands on him within seconds of approaching him. That began a struggle including a neck hold and a restraint that lasted about 20 minutes before McClain was injected with 500 milligrams of ketamine. He suffered cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital and was taken off life support three days later. Experts testified that the sedative ultimately killed McClain, who was already weakened from struggling to breathe while being pinned down after inhaling vomit into his lungs during the struggle with police. Prosecutors said the paramedics did not conduct basic medical checks of McClain, such as taking his pulse, before giving him the ketamine. The dose was too much for someone of his size — 140 pounds (64 kilograms), experts testified. Prosecutors say they also did not monitor McClain immediately after giving him the sedative but instead left him lying on the ground, making it harder to breathe. The case highlighted gaps in medical procedures for sedations of people in police custody that experts said must be addressed so more deaths can be prevented.

Trump is challenging a groundbreaking decision by the Colorado Supreme Court that said he is disqualified from being president again and ineligible for the state’s primary, which is Tuesday. The resolution of the case on Monday, a day before Super Tuesday contests in 16 states, would remove uncertainty about whether votes for Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, will ultimately count. Both sides had requested fast work by the court, which heard arguments less than a month ago, on Feb. 8, The Colorado court was the first to invoke a post-Civil War constitutional provision aimed at preventing those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. Trump also has since been barred from primary ballot in Illinois and Maine, though both decisions, along with Colorado’s, are on hold pending the outcome of the Supreme Court case. The Supreme Court has until now never ruled on the provision, Section 3 of the 14th amendment. The court indicated Sunday there will be at least one case decided Monday, adhering to its custom of not saying which one. But it also departed from its usual practice in some respects, heightening the expectation that it’s the Trump ballot case that will be handed down. Except for when the end of the term nears in late June, the court almost always issues decisions on days when the justices are scheduled to take the bench. But the next scheduled court day isn’t until March 15. And apart from during the coronavirus pandemic when the court was closed, the justices almost always read summaries of their opinions in the courtroom. They won’t be there Monday.

Separately, the justices last week agreed to hear arguments in late April over whether Trump can be criminally prosecuted on election interference charges, including his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The court’s decision to step into the politically charged case, also with little in the way of precedent to guide it, calls into question whether Trump will stand trial before the November election. The former president faces 91 criminal charges in four prosecutions. Of those, the only one with a trial date that seems poised to hold is his state case in New York, where he’s charged with falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments to a porn actor. That case is set for trial on March 25, and the judge has signaled his determination to press ahead.

I’m just scrolling, minding my own business, and just saw a headline that had to do with my own family,” she began her video message on Instagram. “The headline basically says there is no more joy in my husband. Now, I can just tell you, that is far from the truth.” She continued, “Stop scaring people to think that once they get a diagnosis of some kind of neurocognitive disease that ‘That’s it. It’s over. Let’s pack it up. Nothing else to see here, we’re done.’ No. It is the complete opposite of that, okay?” Heming Willis said despite experiencing “grief and sadness,” her family’s “new chapter” is filled with love, connection, joy and happiness. She added: “That’s where we are. So stop with these stupid headlines. These stupid clickbaity things that freak people out. Stop doing that. There’s nothing to see here, okay?”. The British model got married to the “Pulp Fiction” actor in 2009 after two years of dating. The pair share two daughters: Mabel Ray Willis, 11, and Evelyn Penn Willis, 9. He’s also a dad to daughters Rumer Glenn Willis, 35; Scout LaRue Willis, 32; and Tallulah Belle Willis, 30; whom he welcomed with ex-wife Demi Moore. Heming Willis’ more than 925k followers showed support for her in the comments section of her post. “Completely unfair. There is so much joy ❤,” one person wrote. Another said, “THIS!! I often told people that my mom and I lived such a full life with her dementia. It is not the end, it’s a NEW CHAPTER so well said.” “There is JOY!!! Thank you for talking about this. I actively try to push against the tragedy narrative every day,” someone else added. Heming Willis doubled down on her request for the media to be “mindful” of how they report about dementia in the caption of her post. “To whom it may concern, please be mindful how you frame your story’s [sic] to the public about dementia and dig deeper.

And given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate cease-fire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table” Harris said Sunday in Selma, Alabama. Harris made her appearance at the Edmund Pettus Bridge for a speech on the anniversary of “Bloody Sunday.” “This will get the hostages out and a significant amount of aid in. This would allow us to build something more enduring to ensure Israel is secure and to respect the right of the Palestinian people to dignity, freedom and self-determination,” she added. Harris’ remarks followed President Joe Biden’s recently watered-down optimism for the 6-week cease-fire, as well as his Friday approval of sending humanitarian aid into Gaza. Earlier this week, a White House official said that the Israelis “have more or less accepted” the cease-fire proposal, which both Israel and Hamas militants would need to agree to. Harris’ push for the cease-fire also comes days after Israel Defense Forces killed more than 100 people and injured more than 750 others who gathered outside of food aid trucks for food. “The Israeli government must do more to significantly increase the flow of aid. No excuses,” said Harris. “As President Joe Biden said on Friday, the United States is committed to urgently get more lifesaving assistance, to innocent Palestinians in need. Yesterday, the Department of Defense carried out its first airdrop of humanitarian assistance. And the United States will continue these airdrops. And we will work on a new route, by sea, to deliver aid,” she added. The current conflict most recently stems from Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in Israel where the Palestinian militant group killed 1,200 people and took approximately 250 others hostage ― but tensions between Israel and Gaza, as well as Israel’s atrocities against the people in the region, began further back. Since Oct. 7, Israel has killed more than 30,200 people and injured more than 71,000 others in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Many more are facing starvation. “Vice President Harris’s push for a temporary cease-fire, or what the administration used to call a humanitarian pause, is half a step forward,” IfNotNow national spokesperson Eva Borgwardt said in a statement emailed to HuffPost.

A veteran of the football world, Mortensen was a two-time Pulitzer Prize nominee and recipient of the Pro Football Writers of America’s Dick McCann Award. ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro reacted to Mortensen’s passing in a statement on Sunday, saying, “Mort was widely respected as an industry pioneer and universally beloved as a supportive, hardworking teammate.” “He covered the NFL with extraordinary skill and passion, and was at the top of his field for decades,” Pitaro continued. “He will truly be missed by colleagues and fans, and our hearts and thoughts are with his loved ones.” Mortensen got his start as a newspaper reporter and made his first appearance on ESPN in 1991. He sparked the NFL’s 2015 “Deflategate” scandal after reporting that the New England Patriots had surreptitiously used underinflated balls during the AFC championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. In 2016, the Torrance, California, native shared that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer. He announced his retirement from ESPN in a post on X, formerly Twitter, in September last year, writing that he wanted to “focus on my health, family and faith.” He is survived by his wife, Micki Mortensen, and their son, Alex Mortensen.

In a letter sent Friday to Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger, Susan DeCarava, president of NewsGuild of New York, said that union-backed journalists who raised concerns about the paper’s approach to covering Gaza were being “targeted for their national origin, ethnicity and race, creating an ominous chilling-effect across the newsroom and effectively silencing necessary and critical internal discussion.” The Times launched an internal leak probe, which was first reported on by Vanity Fair, after The Intercept published an exposé in January revealing that the newspaper’s flagship podcast, “The Daily,” had canceled a planned episode of a Times investigative report alleging Hamas militants “weaponized sexual violence” when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7. According to the exposé, the episode was shelved after the December report could not pass a fact check and had faced questions of credibility from staff and the public. A Times spokesperson denied the allegation to The Intercept after the exposé’s publication and defended the original reporting in statements to other outlets. In response to the exposé, the Times’ leadership launched a weekslong investigation to find the alleged whistleblower who leaked information to The Intercept. In her letter, DeCarava said that guild members “asserted their protected right to union representation” when they were called into meetings with management’s investigators. “What we have learned about these meetings is shocking,” she wrote. “Rather than simple information-gathering, the meetings became a vehicle for the harassment and intimidation of our members.” NewsGuild president Susan DeCarava sent a letter to NYT publisher A.G. Sulzberger today accusing Times management of targeting journalists “for their national origin, ethnicity and race” in the leak investigation pic.twitter.com/BPb7DlW4xZ According to DeCarava, staff who are part of the company’s Middle Eastern and North African employee resource group experienced “particularly hostile questioning” from Times management, including queries related to their involvement in the group as well as their opinions on the paper’s coverage. Management’s investigators reportedly also ordered those employees to provide the names of all active members in the group and demanded copies of personal communications between colleagues about their concerns related to the paper’s Gaza coverage, according to a separate statement sent Friday to guild members. Some of the employees who were called in for questioning “had no connection to the production of The Daily episode, except for the fact that they raised concerns” to standards editors about the original reporting, according to DeCarava’s letter. “These members went above and beyond to follow company policies in bringing feedback internally to Standards, as The Times encourages its journalists to do,” she wrote. Last week, The Intercept published a follow-up story questioning the credibility of the Times’ sexual violence investigation. The story revealed that the Times hired Anat Schwartz to co-author the December report, despite being an Israeli filmmaker with no journalism experience who was found to have engaged with genocidal anti-Palestinian rhetoric on social media. A Times spokesperson told The Daily Beast that Schwartz’s social media activity was “unacceptable” and being reviewed by the company. The Intercept’s follow-up said that while the Times’ editorial process specifically in the sexual violence report has drawn scrutiny, staffers at the legacy paper have long been concerned over the direction of the Times’ Israel-Hamas coverage. “As a union, we do not tolerate harassment and racial targeting of our members,” DeCarava wrote in her letter. “We demand that The Times cease what has become a destructive and racially targeted witch hunt.” The next four years will change America forever.

The “Dune” actor talked about getting cast in the ABBA-centric Broadway adaptation during an interview with Vanity Fair Thursday, telling the magazine he had fun playing a “bimbo” for once. “It was absurd to ask me to be in a musical,” Skarsgard said of the 2008 movie musical. “I can’t sing, I can’t dance,” he went on. “And then I saw it was also Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth, and they can’t sing and dance either, so I felt a little safer there.” “I understood that we were just supposed to be — like in a film that is produced by men and directed by men and men in the leads, you have the bimbo — and we were the bimbos in this female production,” the Swedish actor went on. (Ahem... The word you were looking for was “himbo,” Mr. Skarsgard.) “We didn’t have to be anything but look cute and be silly,” he added. “There’s only one thing that was asked of us and that was, ‘Have fun because if we don’t have fun, it won’t be a film.’” In the film, Skarsgard played one of three men who might be the father of lead character Sophie, played by Amanda Seyfried.

On Thursday, the country singer showed off her new hairdo on Instagram. “Color my hair, do what I dare! 💅,” Twain captioned the photo of herself sporting wavy rose gold strands. While Twain, 58, has never shied away from switching up her hairstyles — including donning neon red hair at last year’s Grammy ceremony — her fans couldn’t help but react to the star’s most recent change, with some claiming they “don’t even recognize” her. One fan wrote, “This look gives me kardashian vibes,” while another added, “I don’t even recognize you.” Someone else said, “Lovely…but…it doesn’t look like you anymore.” Other fans accused the “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” crooner of secretly going under the knife. “I think ya might have done more than color your hair sis😂. Your looking good!!!” someone commented. Another added, “I wish she would [stop] doing work on her face. So unnecessary!” Many of Twain’s more than 2 million followers stepped in to defend her against the negative comments. “Waiting for all the boomers in the comments “I MISS THE OLD SHAINIA” 🙄 mama looks 🔥🔥🔥,” one person wrote. Another said, “SERIOUS QUESTION!! DOES THIS WOMAN AGE?? 🔥.” Reps for Twain didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Though the Canadian singer-songwriter has not publicly addressed the surgery rumors, she previously ruled out the idea of undergoing cosmetic procedures.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/caitlin-clark-breaks-ncaa-scoring-record-basketball_n_65e4cb6ce4b013678e15b5cd,Iowa Basketball Star Caitlin Clark Breaks NCAA Division I Scoring Record,eric olson,3/3/2024,"Caitlin Clark stood alone at the free throw line on Sunday and made the foul shots that left her standing alone atop the all-time NCAA Division I scoring chart. The flash and pizzazz of her game have made her the biggest name in all of college basketball. Yet it was two free throws after a technical foul that pushed Clark past the late Pete Maravich’s 54-year-old record in No. 6 Iowa’s 93-83 win over No. 2 Ohio State. Clark entered the game in Iowa City needing 18 points to pass Maravich’s total of 3,667, amassed in just 83 games over three seasons at LSU (1967-70). She finished with 35 to run her total to 3,685 in 130 games. Maravich’s mark fell four days after Clark broke Lynette Woodard’s major college women’s record with 33 points against Minnesota on Wednesday. Best known for her long 3-pointers, Clark was called on to go to the foul line after Cotie McMahon was assessed a technical for giving her a little push during a dead ball with less than a second to go in the first half. Clark had no immediate reaction after the second shot went through, as if it hadn’t sunk in yet. Asked in a television interview at halftime if she was aware of the record when she stepped to the line, Clark said: “Not really. When they announced it and everybody screamed, that’s when I knew.” Then the celebration was on, with Clark jumping around and pumping her fists in the air. She had gotten off to a slow start Sunday. Her first shot was a 3-pointer that bounced off the rim. She missed a layup and from deep on the right wing before making a 3 from the left side for her first basket. After starting 2 for 7, she made 3 of her next 4 shots — including three straight 3s, each deeper than the previous. Woodard was among the attendees at Carver-Hawkeye Arena to help Clark celebrate senior day. Also on hand were basketball great Maya Moore, who was Clark’s favorite player, and Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan. “It’s a great time for women’s basketball,” Woodard said in a television interview. “Caitlin is leading the way. As she was chipping away, I said records are made to be broken. Also, they’re made to be honored. Because of her, my records are being honored. She’s gone beyond that now, she’s gone beyond Pete ... I passed her the baton to go ahead and burst through that ceiling, and I’m so happy for her.” On Thursday, Clark announced she would enter the 2024 WNBA draft and skip the fifth year of eligibility available to athletes who competed during the COVID-19 pandemic. She is projected to be the No. 1 overall pick by the Indiana Fever, and the WNBA already is seeing a rise in ticket sales. Logitix, which researches prices on ticket resale platforms, reported an average sale price of $598 for a ticket to Sunday’s game purchased since Feb. 1. Kiran Nanjappa, who was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and now lives in Denver, said he paid more than $200 for his ticket. “She’s a truly once-in-a-lifetime player,” he said. “I’ve been watching Iowa basketball for 40 years, and I’ve never seen a player like her, men’s or women’s. I’ll just say this — I paid more to see her today than I paid to see Michael Jordan three times at the end of his career. And I never thought I’d say that.” Clark is all but assured of one or two more appearances at the arena in Iowa City. Iowa is projected to be a No. 2 seed for the NCAA Tournament, meaning it would be at home for the first two rounds. Pearl Moore of Francis Marion owns the overall women’s record with 4,061 points from 1975-79 at the small-college level in the AIAW. Moore had 177 points at Anderson Junior College before enrolling at Francis Marion. Clark is 376 points behind Moore, and she has only two to nine more games left in an Iowa uniform depending on how far the Hawkeyes advance in the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments. The fall of Maravich’s record is subject to scrutiny. Maravich’s all-time scoring mark is one of the more remarkable in sports history. There was no shot clock or 3-point line in his era. The 3-point line was adopted in 1986. Maravich averaged 44.2 points per game. He scored more than 60 in a game four times, topping out at 69 against Alabama on Feb. 7, 1970. Clark averages 28.3 points for her career. Her career-best output was 49 points against Michigan on Feb. 15, when she passed Kelsey Plum as the NCAA women’s Division I career scoring leader. Clark has 55 games with at least 30 points, the most of any player in men’s or women’s college basketball over the last 25 years. She has six triple-doubles this season and 17 in her career. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

In an interview with People published Saturday, Asghari insisted that he’s not down to “talk badly about each other” post-divorce, despite being the one who ended his and Spears’ relationship. “I’ve always hated people leaving a certain relationship — and at some point they told each other they love each other and they sat at the same table and ate food [together] — so I never understood when people part ways [and] they talk badly about each other,” he said. “That’s something I’m never going to do because I had nothing but an amazing experience and a great life, and that’s always going to be part of my life, a chapter of my life,” he continued. The actor went on to call his former ties to the pop star a “blessing.” “It was a blessing to be able to share life with someone for a long time. And people grow apart and people move on,” Asghari said. Reps for Spears didn’t immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Asghari and Spears first started dating in 2016 after he appeared in the music video for her song, “Slumber Party.” The model tied the knot with the “Toxic” singer in June 2022. They ended their marriage 14 months later, after Asghari filed for divorce from Spears in August last year, citing “irreconcilable differences.” In Spears’ bombshell memoir, “The Woman in Me,” which she finished writing before Asghari filed for divorce, she called him a “gift from God.” After news broke of the pair’s divorce, the Grammy-winning artist revealed she was “shocked” by the split on social media.

During a Sunday appearance on “Meet the Press,” the former governor of South Carolina told NBC’s Kristen Welker she wasn’t entertaining the idea of endorsing Donald Trump while her race is still going. Asked if she was “in a different place” on Trump since vowing to vote for him during the first Republican primary debate last August, Haley said, “If you’re talking about an endorsement, you’re talking about a loss. I don’t think like that.” “The RNC now is not the same RNC. I’ll make what decision I want to make,” she continued. Haley is Trump’s last standing rival for the Republican presidential ticket. Though Haley has yet to win a single Republican primary, she told Welker she was staying focused on this coming Super Tuesday when 15 states and the territory of American Samoa will go to the polls. “While you all think about that, I’m looking at the fact that we had thousands of people in Virginia,” Haley told Welker. “We’re headed to North Carolina, we’re going to continue to go to Vermont and Maine, and all these states to go and show people that there is a path forward.” “I don’t look at what if,” she went on. “I look at, ‘How do we continue the conversation?’” Watch Haley’s full comments from “Meet the Press” here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

An Israeli Strike Killed Them Both.,"wafaa shurafa, samy magdy",3/3/2024,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — It took 10 years and three rounds of in vitro fertilization for Rania Abu Anza to become pregnant, and only seconds for her to lose her five-month-old twins, a boy and a girl. An Israeli strike hit the home of her extended family in the southern Gaza city of Rafah late Saturday, killing her children, her husband and 11 other relatives and leaving another nine missing under the rubble, according to survivors and local health officials. She had woken up at around 10 p.m. to breastfeed Naeim, the boy, and went back to sleep with him in one arm and Wissam, the girl, in the other. Her husband was sleeping beside them. The explosion came an hour and a half later. The house collapsed. “I screamed for my children and my husband,” she said Sunday, as she sobbed and cradled a baby’s blanket to her chest. “They were all dead. Their father took them and left me behind.” She closed her eyes, leaned her head against the wall and patted the bundle in a calming gesture that, finally, she’d had the chance to give. (GRAPHIC PHOTO BELOW: Image depicts death) Israeli airstrikes have regularly hit crowded family homes since the start of the war in Gaza, even in Rafah, which Israel declared a safe zone in October but is now the next target of its devastating ground offensive. The strikes often come without warning, usually in the middle of the night. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames their deaths on the Hamas militant group because it positions fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers in dense residential areas. But the military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The military did not immediately comment on this strike. Of the 14 people killed in the Abu Anza house, six were children and four were women, according to Dr. Marwan al-Hams, director of the hospital where the bodies were taken. In addition to her husband and children, Rania also lost a sister, a nephew, a pregnant cousin and other relatives. Farouq Abu Anza, a relative, said about 35 people were staying at the house, some of whom had been displaced from other areas. He said they were all civilians, mostly children, and that there were no militants among them. Rania and her husband, Wissam, both 29, spent a decade trying to get pregnant. Two rounds of IVF had failed, but after a third, she learned she was pregnant early last year. The twins were born on Oct. 13. Her husband, a day laborer, was so proud he insisted on naming the girl after himself, she said. “I didn’t get enough of them,” she said. “I swear I didn’t get enough of them.” Less than a week earlier, Hamas-led militants had stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack, rampaging through communities, killing some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and taking around 250 hostages, including children and a newborn. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. The war has killed over 30,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Around 80% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million have fled their homes, and a quarter of the population faces starvation. The ministry said last month that more than 12,300 Palestinian children and young teens had been killed in the war, about 43% of the overall toll. Women and children together make up three quarters of those killed. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its tallies. Israel claims to have killed over 10,000 Hamas fighters but has not provided evidence. For the children who survive, the war has made life hellish, humanitarian workers say, with some in northern Gaza beyond the reach of care. “The sense of helplessness and despair among parents and doctors in realizing that lifesaving aid, just a few kilometers away, is being kept out of reach, must be unbearable, but worse still are the anguished cries of those babies slowly perishing under the world’s gaze,” UNICEF regional director Adele Khodr said in a statement Sunday. Until Saturday, the Abu Anza family had been relatively fortunate. Rafah has been spared the immense destruction of northern Gaza and the southern city of Khan Younis, where Israeli tanks and ground troops have fought militants block by block after waves of airstrikes. Rafah is also in the shrinking area of Gaza where humanitarian aid can still be delivered. But Israel has said Rafah will be next, and the roughly 1.5 million people who have sought refuge there will be relocated, without saying where. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-bloody-sunday-march_n_65e49b66e4b0d2a24759c0f9,Kamala Harris To Join In Marking 59th Anniversary Of Bloody Sunday,associated press,3/3/2024,"SELMA, Ala. (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to be among those marking the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the day Alabama law officers attacked Civil Rights demonstrators on the iconic Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The demonstrators were beaten by officers as they tried to march across Alabama on March 7, 1965, in support of voting rights. A march across the bridge, which is a highlight of the commemoration in Selma every year, is planned for Sunday afternoon. Sunday’s march is among dozens of events during the annual Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee, which began Thursday and culminates Sunday. The events commemorate Bloody Sunday and the signing of the Voting Rights Act. “During her speech, the Vice President will honor the legacy of the civil rights movement, address the ongoing work to achieve justice for all, and encourage Americans to continue the fight for fundamental freedoms that are under attack throughout the country,” the White House said in announcing her visit. Harris joined the march in 2022, calling the site hallowed ground and giving a speech calling on Congress to defend democracy by protecting people’s right to vote. On that anniversary, Harris spoke of marchers whose “peaceful protest was met with crushing violence.” “They were kneeling when the state troopers charged,” she said then. “They were praying when the billy clubs struck.” U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland was also expected to participate in Sunday’s events, the Department of Justice announced. Images of the violence at the bridge stunned Americans, which helped galvanize support for passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The law struck down barriers prohibiting Black people from voting. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, a Democrat of South Carolina who is leading a pilgrimage to Selma, said he is seeking to “remind people that we are celebrating an event that started this country on a better road toward a more perfect union,” but the right to vote is still not guaranteed. Clyburn sees Selma as the nexus of the 1960s movement for voting rights, at a time when there currently are efforts to scale back those rights. “The Voting Rights Act of 1965 became a reality in August of 1965 because of what happened on March 7th of 1965,” Clyburn said. “We are at an inflection point in this country,” he added. “And hopefully this year’s march will allow people to take stock of where we are.” Clyburn said he hopes the weekend in Alabama would bring energy and unity to the civil rights movement, as well as benefit the city of Selma. “We need to do something to develop the waterfront, we need to do something that bring the industry back to Selma,” Clyburn said. “We got to do something to make up for them having lost that military installation down there that provided all the jobs. All that goes away, there’s nothing to keep young people engaged in developing their communities.” ___ Associated Press reporters Stephen Groves in Washington, D.C., and Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/couple-proposal-engagement-puerto-rico_n_65e3336ce4b005b8583480be,I Photographed This Couple Mid-Proposal. Can You Help Me Find Them Using These Clues?,kathryn sheldon,3/3/2024,"If there’s one thing a cold, gray, post-holiday January in New York City demands, it’s an escape to a warmer climate (should you be lucky enough to be able to afford it and make it work). After close to 20 years in the city, I’d never been to Puerto Rico — even though it’s just a few hours away by plane — and neither had my boyfriend, Alex, so we decided on San Juan for our first vacation together. On January 8, we took a walk along the Paseo del Morro. It’s a scenic and historic path along the walls of Old San Juan, offering incredible views of the seaside and encounters with the many cats that hide from the sun among the rocks along the water. The path eventually leads up to the Castillo San Felipe del Morro, a large fortress constructed between 1539 and 1790. Desperate to find some relief from the near 90-degree heat, we stopped at the top of a grassy hill overlooking the Atlantic Ocean to let the breeze cool us off. I’m a photographer by trade, and when I travel, I like to use film, so on this particular trip I had only brought my grandmother’s old Pentax K1000. Using film instead of digital is a way for me to slow down, pay attention to what I’m seeing and take the pressure off the need to shoot a high volume of images. I had just brought my camera up to my face to shoot a large ship that was passing by when Alex noticed two people standing at the end of the pier far below us. “Are those people getting engaged? They’re getting engaged!” he said, pointing. I snapped maybe six or eight images in a row as he recorded the moment on his phone. We looked around to see if anyone else was witnessing this serendipitous occasion, but we were the only ones. We let the couple take their time, not wanting to impose on such an intimate moment. When the proposal appeared to be done, we made our way over to them, introduced ourselves, and I told them I had captured their engagement with my camera. They were delighted, so I asked for one of their emails and told them I would send the photos after they’d been developed. I wasn’t entirely sure if the images would even come out, as we had been a fair distance away and my light meter had stopped working, but I assured them if I had gotten anything good, I’d be in touch. We chatted a bit longer and then we congratulated the couple again and parted ways. As Alex and I continued walking, we remarked how thrilling it was to have just witnessed this random couple’s proposal. It made me wonder exactly what it was about seeing two strangers get engaged that felt so exciting. We didn’t have any investment in their lives — knew hardly anything about them, and likely never would. Regardless, it was an incredibly significant moment for them, and to see something that rare and meaningful and unexpected happen right in front of us felt a bit like seeing a shooting star. Extraordinary moments like these feel like a gift, especially in a world where so much is currently going wrong. Seeing two people making a commitment to each other — whatever that looks like for them and however they choose to honor it going forward — is a beautiful thing. It felt like I had been given a little reminder from the universe that despite how bad things can seem, love is real and we should do whatever we can to encourage and respect and celebrate it. Alex and I returned back to New York City and last week, almost two months after our trip, I finally got my film back. Not only did the images of the engagement turn out, but I had one of every part of the proposal: getting down on one knee, their embrace after, all of it. Although the couple was far from where I was shooting, their beautiful experience was perfectly documented in my photos. I couldn’t wait to share what I’d shot with the couple. I opened up my Notes app on my phone to retrieve the email they had given me but it wasn’t there. Somehow their contact info had gotten deleted. I was devastated. “What do we do now?” I asked Alex. We weren’t sure. How could we find two strangers with only a scant amount of information? We didn’t know, but we wanted to try. So... this is us trying. Maybe someone reading this essay might know this couple and can help me get in touch with them so I can share my photos of their special day. Here’s what we know: The couple (we believe they were two women but we didn’t ask about their gender identities, so we can’t be sure) got engaged on the afternoon of January 8, 2024 at the Castillo San Felipe del Morro in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. I think they were from Baltimore, or, if not, somewhere else in the Maryland or D.C. area. One of them was named Melissa. I feel lucky to have been in the right place at the right time to witness this couple’s proposal and I’m hoping a little more luck — and a bit of help from one of you — might finally get my photos to them. If you know these individuals (or you’re the couple featured in the photos), email Noah.Michelson@HuffPost.com and we’ll get you in touch with Kathryn.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pakistan-new-prime-minister-shehbaz-sharif_n_65e4771be4b013678e15a6b7,Shehbaz Sharif Becomes Pakistan's New Prime Minister,munir ahmed,3/3/2024,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Lawmakers in Pakistan’s National Assembly on Sunday elected Shehbaz Sharif as the country’s new prime minister for the second time as allies of imprisoned former premier Imran Khan in parliament shouted in protest, alleging rigging in last month’s election. Khan is currently serving prison terms in multiple cases and has been barred from seeking or holding office. Sharif replaced him as prime minister after his ouster in a no-confidence vote in parliament in April 2022. Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said Sharif secured 201 votes, defeating Omar Ayub of the Sunni Ittehad Council who got 92 votes. The winner only needs 169 votes to get a majority. Ayub was backed by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI, whose candidates could not get enough seats to form a government on their own. The PTI refused to hold talks with its rivals to form a coalition. Following days of negotiations, Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party and his supporters formed an alliance after the Feb. 8 election, which was overshadowed by militant violence, a nationwide mobile phone shutdown, Khan’s exclusion from the vote, and an unusual delay in announcing the result. Authorities said cutting communications was necessary to avoid attacks on candidates and security forces. However, the delay drew criticism from Khan’s party, which insists the vote was rigged to stop it from getting a majority. The party claims it has evidence that its victory “was stolen during the vote count,” a charge the Election Commission denies. Sharif, in his acceptance speech in parliament Sunday, said: “We were subjected to political victimization in the past but never took any revenge.” Without naming Khan, he said the previous ruler jailed many political rivals, including himself and his ally Asif Ali Zardari. He also accused Khan’s supporters of attacking military installations while protesting his ouster in 2022, adding that now parliament and the courts would decide whether those involved in attacking the military installations deserved a pardon. Holding portraits of Khan, some lawmakers stood in front of Sharif when he began his speech, shouting “vote thief” and “shame.” Sharif denounced their actions, saying they were causing chaos in parliament. He also said they should present their evidence of vote rigging to the relevant authorities. Sharif then addressed the opposition saying, “I am offering you reconciliation. Let us sit together to work for the betterment of Pakistan.” But he was greeted with more protests and shouts. The premier also spoke of repairing ties with the United States. Relations between the two countries have been strained after Khan accused the U.S., Sharif and the Pakistani military of conspiring to keep him out of office, following his ouster. Sharif also said his biggest challenge was the economic situation as Pakistan has been relying on foreign loans to run the economy. His government faces multiple issues, including how to respond to a surge in militant attacks, improve relations with the neighboring, Taliban-run Afghanistan, repair crumbling infrastructure, and resolve year-round power outages. It must also maintain political stability as Khan’s party has vowed to continue protests against the alleged vote-rigging. After losing to Sharif, Ayub addressed the parliament, commending “my leader” Khan for his “bravery” while facing the cases against him. He denounced the arrest of “thousands of Khan’s supporters” last year after they took to the streets following his ouster. Ayub repeated the allegations of vote rigging and demanded a probe into last month’s poll. He said PTI votes were tampered with and “votes were stolen” to stop Khan’s party from forming a government. He said Sharif can rule the country but “he cannot win hearts and minds because he came to power through a rigged vote.” Last week, Khan wrote a letter to the International Monetary Fund, urging it to link any talks with Islamabad to an audit of February’s election. Khan’s move, which Sharif criticized in his speech, comes days before the IMF releases a key installment of a bailout loan to Pakistan. Pakistan has been relying on bailouts to prop up its foreign exchange reserves and avoid default, with the IMF and wealthy allies like China and Saudi Arabia financing the country to the tune of billions of dollars. Under his previous term as prime minister, Sharif had to struggle for months to get a $3 billion bailout from the IMF. The new prime minister has said he will seek a new IMF bailout after the end of March when the current one expires. The next four years will change America forever.

Her name is Carbon Monoxide. “But you can call me C. Mo,” she introduces herself in a Bravo-style title card. “As in see mo’ life-threatening health problems.” She’s just one of the noxious cast members on “Hot and Toxic,” a fictional parody invented as part of a new environmental campaign against using natural gas for cooking and heating. The setup is darkly funny. An unsuspecting homeowner moves into the house of her dreams, only to discover the place comes with an intolerable group of unexpected roommates whose astrological signs match the pathological outcome of being around them for too long. “I don’t know, bro,” laments the guitar-strumming jock named after the chemical Benzene. “I guess it’s because I’m a Cancer and I… also cause it.” Another cast member interjects. “Shut up!” she says. “My sign is Cancer.” Amid a collective epiphany, the group says in unison: “We’re all Cancer!” It’s the latest advertisement from the advocacy group Gas Leaks, which makes creative videos aimed at promoting the shift away from fossil fuels. Gas Leaks first shared the new video with HuffPost. The organization ― which is a sponsored project of the Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, through which the billionaire family funnels millions from its 19th century oil fortune into nonprofits calling for the phase out of fossil fuels ― made a splash in October with an ad depicting gas appliances as Halloween horror movie monsters. Now Gas Leaks says it will spend $1 million to promote the video in markets like California, Illinois, New Jersey and New York, where more than half of households use gas for cooking. ″$1 million is a lot for the climate movement, but it’s pennies for the fossil fuel industry,” said James Hadgis, a filmmaker and Gas Leaks’ executive director. “Right now people are overwhelmed by information, there’s so much misinformation and disinformation,” he added. “We thought leaning into comedy is a way to both make people laugh and reveal truth, and send people the message that there’s nothing ‘natural’ about natural gas.” The natural gas that burns blue on stovetops emits tiny particles of nitrogen dioxide, which irritates the respiratory system, and contributes to asthma and cancer-causing pollutants such as benzene. While Consumer Reports found that ventilation helps, reviewers concluded the best way to minimize exposure to dangerous pollutants was to switch to an electric stove. Nearly 70% of American homes already use electric appliances for cooking, federal statistics show. But less than 5% of electric ranges sold in the U.S. use the induction technology touted by chefs as preferable to gas. Cooking with gas generates roughly 0.1% of total U.S. emissions each year, according to an analysis of federal data by the University of California, Davis. But gas stoves leak roughly 1% of the gas they use as unburned methane, a powerful heat-trapping gas. At this rate, yearly leaks from all natural gas stoves in the U.S. take an equivalent toll on the climate as the annual carbon dioxide emissions from 500,000 passenger vehicles, according to a recent peer-reviewed study from researchers at Stanford University and the laboratory PSE Healthy Energy. Gas used for heating, meanwhile, generates between six and 16 times as much planet-heating pollution, and the same pipeline network that feeds furnaces supplies stovetops. Advocates looking for ways to make slashing planet-heating emissions a more visceral concern have played up gas appliances’ toxic air pollutants as a way to increase public support for regulations restricting fossil fuel use.

It can be hard to convince my 4- and 2.5-year-old kids to engage with the tub, so I often resort to gimmicks to make it seem like more of a treat. (Sometimes, these ploys backfire. See: the gorgeous Japanese bath crayons that work a little too well for everyday use and had me scrubbing the sides of my tub with a little more elbow grease than usual.) So naturally, when I was at a local pharmacy with my kids a few weeks ago and the girls spotted a large display of colorful oversized bath bombs, I didn’t think twice about getting them. They were cute and inexpensive, and I appreciated that the jumbo, individually-packaged bombs contained a small treasure (which turned out to be things like necklace charms) — something that I suspected would entice the kids into sitting down and letting me wash their hair or scrub food off their faces without screaming. Turns out I was right. After we did one bomb-accompanied bath time, it was obvious that I’d need to be keeping more on hand for emergencies, tantrums and special occasions, so I hit the internet in search of the ones I’d purchased locally and happily found a treasure trove of them at Target. The bath bombs in question were from Da Bomb, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company that was founded in 2011 by two preteen sisters, ages 10 and 11 at the time, who loved using bath bombs but were disappointed when the bombs had dissolved, so they made sure to include a surprise in each one. Now, the sisters are in college and their wares can be found a host of major retailers. Target offers the affordable tchochkes in a variety of sizes and themes, including ones aimed towards fans of franchises like Spiderman, Barbie and Hot Wheels. There are also some tropically-influenced options and small variety packs that are perfect for moms like myself who are interested in having a bulk stash on hand. Reviews vary, but most of the ones I scoped out on Target had at least 4 stars and glowing reviews numbering in the hundreds. Take a look at what some reviewers had to say about these magical little orbs, or just scroll down to add several to your cart to keep in your bath time arsenal. “I got this for Christmas and the fragrance was amazing. I could smell it in the hallway when I was running my bath. It made the bath yellow which looked like pee. But I loved it, the surprise is great, just wanting to figure out where to enter the code on the surprise inside.” — DT76 “This was in my daughter’s stocking and she loved it. I liked the smell, but not sure what the scent was. I did think that it would change color as it fizzed, but it was really just yellow. It has a colorful plastic heart in the middle which my daughter loved, and she was asking for more bath bombs the next day.” — Katie “My kids love these & they smell good” — JessicaK By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. We love a good coffee shop drink, and enjoy the sweet flavors, latte art and silky foam of a barista-made espresso drink. If you’re looking to level up your at-home coffee game, the good news is you don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars on fancy coffee equipment. If you want to froth up milk for a cappuccino or a latte at home, all you need is an electric whisk — and Walmart has one for less than $13. The Zulay Kitchen milk frother turns milk and cream into foam for coffee and tea drinks. It can also be used to prepare matcha tea (by whisking matcha powder into water), make egg white foam for cocktails and so much more. It’s available in a rainbow of colors, and pricing varies by color; the cheapest option at the moment is a hot pink iteration for $10.99; the most expensive is an all-black version for $24.99. It comes with a simple stand to prop it up on your counter when you’re not using it, but it’s also compact enough to go in a drawer for storage. To clean it, simply dip the stainless steel whisk head into hot, soapy water and rise. With more than 500 5-star reviews, it’s safe to say this milk frother has some fans. Reviewer PioneerWomanfan commented that they use it every day to make their coffee feel special. Reviewer Blackbarbie04 wrote it’s comfortable to hold, lightweight and has a lot of power. And reviewer Lola, who bought the milk frother because it was on sale and wasn’t sure what to expect, was pleasantly surprised. “This milk frother has a lot of power for a little gadget and worked great the first time I used it.” The manufacturer claims that the frother achieves a speed of 12,500 rotations per minute and can make foam in seconds. “It made the foamiest foam I have ever seen,” wrote reviewer aritipbia. “Within like 15-20 seconds.” Pick up the Zulay Kitchen milk frother at Walmart. It requires two AA batteries to work (which aren’t included), so you’ll also want to pick some up if you don’t have any.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lebron-james-40000-career-points_n_65e428e2e4b013678e1599f6,LeBron James Makes NBA History By Extending Career Scoring Record,dan greenspan,3/3/2024,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James reached 40,000 points Saturday night, still going strong in his 21st NBA season as he tries to put the career scoring record out of reach. James drove past Michael Porter Jr. and hit a layup with 10:39 left in the second quarter of the Los Angeles Lakers’ 124-114 loss to the Denver Nuggets for the historic basket. “Being the first player to do something, it’s pretty cool in this league, just knowing the history, the greats that’s come through the league, and then you see some of the greats on the floor tonight, it was great to compete,” James said. “But for me, the main thing, as always, is to win, and I hated that it had to happen in a defeat.” LeBron James scores the bucket to become the first player in league history to score 40,000 career points 👑DEN-LAL Live on ABC pic.twitter.com/I84Xd5hiWf James did it in 1,475 regular-season games, reaching double-digit points in each of the last 1,205 of them. He has largely avoided major injuries in that time, while also playing another 3 1/2 seasons worth of games in the playoffs en route to four titles in 10 NBA Finals appearances, all with unfathomable pressure placed on him to be the next transcendent player before ever stepping on the court as a professional. “For the first time in a long time, I’ve seen the commercial that was played before my first game,” James said. “I think they mentioned all the greats to ever play the game of basketball, like Big O and Michael and Kareem and Kobe, and forgot who all else was in that commercial. And then it was like, ‘the next one, LeBron James.’ “I didn’t see that commercial when it happened, but when I was watching it today, I was like what the hell? That expectation on an 18-year-old kid like that, that was insane to think about.” Even with those expectations, James put in the work and has now accomplished something that seemed impossible. James’ relentless march saw him pass the previous record of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 38,387 points on Feb. 7, 2023 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. All that scoring happened without James’ necessarily wanting that to be his trademark. He is fourth in career assists with 10,847, picking up another nine against Denver, and his average of 7.35 per game ranks in the top 25. Nuggets coach Michael Malone, who spent five seasons with James as an assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2005-2010, saw an early dedication from James in all areas. It was already a priority for James to keep himself in peak physical condition, even if the run to the scoring title was an unforeseen outcome back them. “I remember being in Cleveland, him being in the weight room with our weight and strength coaches, and there’s no way he’s doing what he’s doing at this stage of his career if he is not putting a ton of time into his body, his diet, his sleep, all those things that really matter,” Malone said before the game. James’ combination of longevity and sustained excellence is what makes it entirely likely he could be the only player to ever reach 40,000 points. To put the feat in perspective, Nuggets center Nikola Jokic will need to average 25 points over his next 1,057 appearances to join James at 40,000 points. That would be nearly 13 full seasons without injuries or any other unforeseen circumstance, all the way past age 41 without a drop in production for the two-time MVP. Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Doncic seems like the most reasonable candidate to make a serious push, as his career average of 28.51 points per game is third in league history behind Michael Jordan (30.12) and Wilt Chamberlain (30.07). But Doncic will need to keep it up for 1,022 more games to match James, a timeline pushing into the 2036-37 season barring interruption. “There’s just certain things that you just don’t think that’s going to happen,” James said. “I guess for years people said Kareem’s record wouldn’t be broken. I was able to eclipse it. But like I said, you have to have some really good luck, you have to play the game at a high level for a long time, and then we see.” As to whether James might ever take up residence in the 50,000-point club, a conservative estimate of 25 points per game from here on out — essentially matching what he has been producing in his 21st professional campaign at 39-years-old — while playing 55 outings each coming season would put him at the doorstep in 2031-32. Malone wouldn’t rule it out. “Really, when you take a step back, you just have to marvel at the longevity. But he’s just not playing at this. He is playing effectively,” Malone said. “I’m sure for him, that’ll be his decision down the road probably in five, six years. ‘Am I still playing effectively?’ And he is.” If anyone would even dare to make a charge at the impossible, it could only be King James. “I come to work and prepare and prep, mentally, physically, spiritually every single night when it’s time to play, and I just try to go out and contribute,” he said. “Been able to do it for 20-plus years, including this year. When I come on the floor and feel pretty good, I feel I can make plays. The next four years will change America forever.

Jost remarked that Trump looks “good behind bars” as another picture flashed onscreen of him behind fencing during his border stop in Eagle Pass, Texas. The “SNL” star went on to mock Trump over what Jost called a “pretty harsh” message for migrants before playing a video of the GOP presidential front-runner waving and pumping his fist at people on the Mexico side of the border. “They like Trump, can you believe it?” Trump said as he waved to the group. “No, I can’t believe it,” Jost said in response to the clip. “The migrants don’t like you, they just walked a thousand miles to get to the edge of this river, and they’re probably thinking, ‘Is that weirdo in a Trump costume waving us into the country?’” You can check out more of “Weekend Update” in the clips below.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-immigration-comments-biden_n_65e3bcc7e4b0d2a24759a980,"Trump Escalates Immigration Rhetoric, Claims Biden Is Trying To 'Overthrow' The U.S.","bill barrow, jill colvin",3/2/2024,"GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) — Former President Donald Trump on Saturday further escalated his immigration rhetoric and baselessly accused President Joe Biden of waging a “conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America” as he campaigned ahead of Super Tuesday’s primaries. Trump has a long history of trying to turn attack lines back on his rivals in an attempt to diminish their impact. Biden has cast Trump as a threat to democracy, pointing to the former president’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Those efforts culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as his supporters tried to halt the peaceful transition of power. Trump, who has responded by calling Biden “the real threat to democracy” and alleged without proof that Biden is responsible for the indictments he faces, turned to Biden’s border policies on Saturday, charging that “every day Joe Biden is giving aid and comfort to foreign enemies of the United States.” “Biden’s conduct on our border is by any definition a conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America,” he went on to say in Greensboro, North Carolina. “Biden and his accomplices want to collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters and establish a new base of power that gives them control for generations.” Similar arguments have long been made by people who allege Democrats are promoting illegal immigration to weaken the power of white voters — part of a racist conspiracy, once confined to the far right, claiming there is an intentional push by the U.S. liberal establishment to systematically diminish the influence of white people. Trump leaned into the theory again at his rally later in Virginia, saying of the migrants: “They’re trying to sign them up to get them to vote in the next election.” “Once again Trump is projecting in an attempt to distract the American people from the fact he killed the fairest and toughest border security bill in decades because he believed it would help his campaign. Sad,” Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement. Trump’s campaign stops came three days before Super Tuesday, with elections in 16 states, including North Carolina and Virginia, where thousands of enthusiastic supporters gathered for an evening rally in downtown Richmond. The primaries will be the largest day of voting of the year ahead of November’s general election, which is shaping up as a likely rematch of 2020 between Trump and Biden. Nikki Haley, Trump’s last major rival, also campaigned in North Carolina. Speaking to reporters after her event in Raleigh, about 80 miles away, the former U.N. ambassador demurred on her plans after Super Tuesday. “We’re going to keep going and we’re going to keep pushing,” she said, arguing a majority of Americans don’t want either Biden or Trump as the nation’s leader. Much of Trump’s speech in North Carolina focused on the slew of criminal charges he faces. While the former president has successfully harnessed his legal woes into a powerful rallying cry in the primaries, it is unclear how his message of grievance will resonate with the more moderate voters who will likely decide the general election. “I stand before you today not only as your past and hopefully future president, but as a proud political dissident and a public enemy of a rogue regime,” Trump said, railing against what he called an “anti-Democratic machine.” At both rallies, Trump played a recording of “Justice for All,” the version of the Star-Spangled Banner that he collaborated on with a group of defendants jailed over their alleged roles in the January 2021 insurrection, whom he refers to as “hostages.” As he focuses on the general election, Trump has painted an apocalyptic vision of the country under Biden, particularly on the topic of immigration, which was the animating issue of his 2016 campaign and which he has once again seized on as the U.S. has experienced a record influx of migrants at the border. Trump and Biden both visited the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday to highlight their contrasting approaches to the issue. On Saturday, Trump conjured images of Biden turning “public schools into migrant camps” and “the USA into a crime-ridden, disease-ridden dumping ground, which is what they’re doing.” He also spoke at length about the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student whose alleged killer is a Venezuelan man who entered the U.S. illegally and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case. Studies have found native-born U.S. residents are more likely to have been arrested for violent crimes than people in the country illegally, but Trump has seized on several high-profile incidents, including a recent video of a group of migrants brawling with police in Times Square. “Not one more innocent American life should be lost to migrant crime,” Trump said. Trump, who repeatedly attacks Biden’s intelligence and mental acuity, has been sensitive to questions of his own sharpness after he’s mixed up Haley with Nancy Pelosi and Biden with former President Barack Obama at past rallies. Trump has lately sought to inoculate any questions by insisting he interchanges the names intentionally. “I do that because you know that makes a point. Do we understand that, right? Because a lot of people say he’s running the country. I don’t personally think so,” Trump said early into his appearance in Virginia. But more than an hour in to his free-flowing remarks, he seemed to mix up Obama and Biden again, when he said “Putin, you know, has so little respect for Obama that he’s starting to throw around the ‘nuclear’ word.” Beyond their importance on Super Tuesday, North Carolina and Virginia are both states the Trump campaign is focused on for November. Trump won North Carolina twice but watched his margin of victory shrink. Biden’s reelection campaign already has staff on the ground hoping to flip the state for the first time since 2008. Virginia, meanwhile, had once been a swing state but for years has trended blue and Trump lost there twice. But a Trump campaign senior adviser told reporters Saturday that he believes “we could make Virginia competitive.” In North Carolina, a festive atmosphere surrounded the Greensboro Coliseum Complex ahead of Trump’s rally. Supporters stood in a line that snaked through a web of metal barricades and extended hundreds of yards from the arena. License plates from North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee filled the parking lot, where Trump flags flew alongside U.S. and Confederate flags on many vehicles. “We just love Trump,” said, Mary Welborn, who lives in nearby Thomasville and expressed that she was frustrated by the criminal prosecutions and civil judgments against the former president. “The way he’s being treated is insane. No other president has been treated this way,” she said. In Richmond, supporters started lining up Saturday morning for an evening rally at a downtown convention center. The entry lines stretched several blocks by mid-afternoon. Ken Ballos, a retired police officer from nearby Hanover County who said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said he was eager at the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch.

The high court on Monday blocked Texas’ immigration law from going into effect until March 13 and asked the state to respond by March 11. The law was set to take effect Saturday, and the court’s decision came just hours after the Justice Department asked it to intervene. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the law in December and for months has unveiled a series of escalating measures on the border that have tested the boundaries of how far a state can go keep migrants from entering the country. The law would allow state officers to arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally. People who are arrested could then agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the country or face a misdemeanor charge for entering the U.S. illegally. Migrants who don’t leave after being ordered to do so could be arrested again and charged with a more serious felony. The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that the law would profoundly alter “the status quo that has existed between the United States and the States in the context of immigration for almost 150 years.” It went on to argue that the law would have “significant and immediate adverse effects” on the country’s relationship with Mexico and “create chaos” in enforcing federal immigration laws in Texas. The federal government cited a 2012 Supreme Court ruling on an Arizona law that would have allowed police to arrest people for federal immigration violations, often referred to by opponents as the “show me your papers” bill. The divided high court found that the impasse in Washington over immigration reform did not justify state intrusion. In a statement Monday, the Texas Attorney General’s Office said the state’s law mirrored federal law and “was adopted to address the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which hurts Texans more than anyone else.” The federal government’s emergency request to the Supreme Court came after a federal appeals court over the weekend stayed U.S. District Judge David Ezra’s sweeping rejection of the law. In a 114-page ruling Thursday, Ezra rebuked Texas’ immigration enforcement and brushed off claims by Republicans about an ongoing “invasion” along the southern border due to record-high illegal crossings. Ezra added that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, conflicts with federal immigration law and could get in the way of U.S. foreign relations and treaty obligations. According to Ezra’s ruling, allowing Texas to supersede federal law due to an “invasion” would “amount to nullification of federal law and authority — a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War.” Republicans who back the law have said it would not target immigrants already living in the U.S. because the two-year statute of limitations on the illegal entry charge would be enforced only along the state’s border with Mexico. Texas has been arresting migrants for years under a different program that is based on criminal trespass arrests. Though Ezra said some might sympathize with Texas officials’ concerns about immigration enforcement by the federal government, he said that was not enough to excuse a violation of the U.S. Constitution. The battle over the Texas immigration law, known as Senate Bill 4, is one of multiple legal disputes between Texas officials and the Biden administration over how far the state can go to patrol the Texas-Mexico border and prevent illegal border crossings. Several Republican governors have backed Abbott’s efforts, saying the federal government is not doing enough to enforce existing immigration laws. The next four years will change America forever.

The six-week investigation, which began after a Boeing 737 Max 9 lost a door panel during a flight in January, found issues with Boeing’s “manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control,” the FAA said in a news release, which didn’t offer more detail. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker addressed the audit’s findings with Boeing’s CEO and other senior leaders in a meeting last week and gave the company 90 days to outline a plan of action, the FAA said. Boeing also must review and address a report released last week by a panel of outside experts that examined safety culture within the company dating back to two 737 Max 8 crashes in 2018 and 2019. To hold Boeing accountable, the FAA said, it has halted the expanded production of the Boeing 737 Max, whose fuselage is built by Spirit AeroSystems. It is also exploring the use of an independent third party to review Boeing’s quality systems. It will also continue to physically monitor Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems’ work with FAA representatives at Boeing facilities in Washington state and Spirit AeroSystems in Kansas. A spokesperson for Boeing told HuffPost on Monday that its president and chief executive officer, Dave Calhoun, had expressed optimism about the road ahead following his meeting with the FAA. “We have a clear picture of what needs to be done,” Calhoun was quoted as saying. “Boeing will develop the comprehensive action plan with measurable criteria that demonstrates the profound change that Administrator Whitaker and the FAA demand. Our Boeing leadership team is totally committed to meeting this challenge.” The next four years will change America forever.

A preliminary report released last month by the National Transportation Safety Board found that several bolts had likely been taken off the panel during repair work but not replaced.

On Sunday, the “Frozen” actor shared a short video of herself singing “Happy Birthday” to “Adele Dazeem” on TikTok. “I just wanted to say happy birthday. I’m sending you so much love and positive energy,” Menzel said in the clip. “I hope you have the best, best day.” Happy 10th birthday, Adele Dazeem! Adele Dazeem first entered the cultural lexicon during the 2014 Academy Awards ceremony, when John Travolta mispronounced Menzel’s name while introducing her performance of “Let It Go” from Disney’s “Frozen.” “Please welcome the wickedly talented, one and only, Adele Dazeem,” said Travolta at the time, alluding to Menzel’s Tony-winning stint as Elphaba in Broadway’s “Wicked.” “Let It Go” went on to win the Oscar for Best Original Song later that night, and Travolta’s flub quickly became a viral moment. Appearing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” a year later, Travolta blamed the mishap on Menzel’s name being spelled phonetically on the Oscars’ teleprompters. “I didn’t rehearse it that way,” he said. Menzel, for her part, poked fun at the incident during the 2015 Academy Awards ceremony by intentionally messing up Travolta’s name when they presented together. Since then, she’s repeatedly made it clear that she holds no ill will toward the “Pulp Fiction” actor.

My husband just referred to the Wonka Experience as ""Fyre Festival for children."" Please don't write happily married in your social media bio. Be realistic. ""I have a spouse and they like me well enough."" It's early in the year but I'm already anxious about my husband getting his Spotify Wrapped and asking me who has been getting high and listening to ""If We Hold On Together"" from ""The Land Before Time"" sung by Diana Ross so many times. My wife has close friends whose husbands are notably worse than me and I highly recommend this arrangement the smug way my wife walks into the kitchen, casually opens a drawer, and pulls out the exact item she needs on the first try Wife: Can you turn on the oven?Me: [starts dancing seductively in front of oven]Wife: why for everything Wife: We need to talkMe, absolutely panicking: WhatWife: We need to start buying the big jars of peanut butter husband: how was your dayme showing him the Twitter research I’ve done on Kate Middleton’s whereabouts since December of last year pic.twitter.com/WXphrsc96x Husband: Why are your hands bleeding?*flashback to me struggling to open a pistachio for 20 minutes*Me: I’m learning how to play guitar.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/emaciated-palestinian-boy-dies-gaza-famine_n_65e5f01ae4b013678e162d03,Palestinian Boy In Photos That Showed Reality Of Gaza Famine Dies Of Malnourishment,sanjana karanth,3/4/2024,"Yazan al-Kafarneh, a Palestinian boy whose emaciated appearance offered the world a stark illustration of Gaza’s accelerating starvation crisis, has become one of the latest children in the territory to die of severe malnourishment. Yazan was receiving medical treatment with the few resources available at Abu Yusuf al-Najjar Hospital in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are trying to survive without adequate shelter or food. Graphic photos taken on Feb. 28 and March 2, which appear below, show Yazan emaciated and bedridden while covered in blankets and receiving fluids intravenously. The photos were reposted online by activists, journalists and pro-Palestinian accounts, showing the reality of a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza born out of Israel’s ongoing offensive and monthslong blockade of aid deliveries. Yazan died of malnourishment on Monday, Al Jazeera reported. He was 10. “This child had turned into a skeleton in this war before he died,” Muhammed al-Kafarneh, a relative of Yazan, told Al Jazeera in a video interview on Monday, as Yazan’s body was being cleaned and prepared for burial in the background. “Hunger ravaged his body. This child was suffering from several diseases,” al-Kafarneh said. “The war came and took away all the basic components that could give him life.” Yazan’s family was originally living in north Gaza ― which is facing its own starvation crisis ― before Israeli strikes displaced them several times. In a video on Instagram, Yazan’s father, sitting beside his emaciated son, shared a photo, taken a week before Israel began its offensive, of Yazan smiling and not visibly malnourished. Hoping to find better health care for Yazan, who had cerebral palsy, the family arrived in Rafah. But despite his efforts, Yazan’s father could not locate the food, water or medicine his son needed to survive. “We found nothing, so he was met with a slow and painful death,” Muhammed al-Kafarneh told Al Jazeera. “The barbaric war and the oppressive actions of the Israeli occupation against the children of Gaza and its civilians must be stopped.” North Gaza itself is experiencing even less access to aid, with public order falling apart as Palestinians become desperate for food, water and other basic necessities. UNICEF said Sunday that at least 10 children have died due to dehydration and malnutrition in the north’s Kamal Adwan Hospital in recent days. “These tragic and horrific deaths are man-made, predictable and entirely preventable,” Adele Khodr, UNICEF’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. Malnutrition screenings conducted in the north by UNICEF and the World Food Program in January found that nearly 16% of children under 2 years of age were acutely malnourished, while similar screenings in Rafah found 5% of children in the same age range experiencing malnutrition. “The sense of helplessness and despair among parents and doctors in realizing that lifesaving aid, just a few kilometres away, is being kept out of reach, must be as unbearable, but worse still are the anguished cries of those babies slowly perishing under the world’s gaze,” Khodr said. “The lives of thousands more babies and children depend on urgent action being taken now.” Following an Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants, in which some 1,200 people were killed and roughly another 250 were taken hostage, Israel has barred entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies into Gaza, aside from a small amount of aid entering from the south. Some aid groups have said their deliveries are also being delayed due to Israeli forces firing at their trucks. The U.S. airdropped dozens of food bundles over Gaza on Saturday, even as it continues to assist the country blocking the aid in the first place. The airdrop occurred two days after Israeli forces killed more than 100 Palestinians trying to access aid on the first major delivery to north Gaza in a month, resulting in widespread anger at the Israeli military and its biggest ally, the U.S. government. Janti Soeripto, CEO of aid organization Save the Children, said Monday that “the conditions to provide humanitarian assistance to children in Gaza are not only not being met but are getting worse.” “We have been calling for more crossings, more opening hours, more capacity to check trucks and pass them through, not have trucks be off and unloaded again four or five times,” Soeripto told NPR. “These are all fairly straightforward ways to make the logistics of this operation much easier, less painful and more effective. And none of these have been taken up so far.” A US official familiar w/ top Biden aides' thinking tells me they expected scenarios like the flour massacre but know POTUS is ""not budging"" on pushing Israel in a real way despite Gaza's needs.The result: ""hard-to-do + low-yield PR stunts like air drops + portable port idea."" In addition to the airdrops, U.S. President Joe Biden said he wants to open a maritime corridor for aid “and expand deliveries by land.” A U.S. official told HuffPost’s Akbar Shahid Ahmed on Sunday that aides anticipated incidents like the aid convoy shooting ― now widely being described as the “flour massacre” ― but that they still don’t expect Biden to pressure Israel in a way that actually helps Gazans. “Pushing Israel to allow food in is totally off the table,” the official said, resulting in Biden’s pursuit of “low-yield PR stunts” like airdrops of aid and the idea of a maritime corridor. “We direct our message to the international community and the free people of the world: What are you waiting for? At least guarantee the right to life for children,” Muhammed al-Kafarneh told Al Jazeera. “You claim to be just and righteous. What are you waiting for? We have reached famine. Not only that, but a complete catastrophe.” GRAPHIC PHOTOS WARNING: The following highly distressing images depict death and severe malnourishment.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-trump-colorado-ruling-liberals-disagreement_n_65e63b5ee4b0d2a2475a625c,The Key Disagreement In The Liberal Justices’ Concurrence On The Trump Ballot Ruling,paul blumenthal,3/4/2024,"The U.S. Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision on Monday overturning a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court that found former President Donald Trump could be disqualified from appearing on the state’s ballot for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. But while all nine justices put their names to that decision, a bitter 5-4 divide lurked underneath. The majority opinion allowed Trump to stay on the ballot in Colorado (and Maine and Illinois, where he had also been found ineligible) by arguing that states may only enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment ― the constitutional provision barring oath-breaking insurrectionists from future office ― for state offices but not federal ones. All of the justices agreed on this main point. But three justices ― liberals Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson ― disagreed vehemently with the assertion by the five conservative justices ― John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh ― that Section 3 could only be enforced for federal offices by specific congressional legislation. Fellow conservative Amy Coney Barrett issued a separate concurrence that refrained from elaborating on her disagreement with the majority opinion, concluding “our differences are far less important than our unanimity.” Invoking the court’s controversial decision in Bush v. Gore, which decided the razor-thin outcome of the 2000 election in favor of Republican George W. Bush, the liberal justices declared that the majority’s decision had gone too far by potentially closing off other avenues for federal courts and Congress to prevent insurrectionist candidates from gaining office. “Even though ‘[a]ll nine Members of the Court’ agree that this independent and sufficient rationale resolves this case, five Justices go on,” the three liberals write in a concurrence that reads like a bitter dissent. “They decide novel constitutional questions to insulate this Court and petitioner from future controversy.” The liberal concurrence took issue with the fact that the majority had not only ruled on whether the state of Colorado could enforce Section 3 against federal candidates but also on who could instead: namely, Congress, and only Congress, via legislation. In short, they argued, the decision removes power from the courts to rule on if someone was, in fact, an insurrectionist. The decision “forecloses judicial enforcement of that provision,” according to the liberals’ concurrence. Such enforcement could arise “when a party is prosecuted by an insurrectionist and raises a defense on that score,” they contended. Such a situation could arise if someone brings a legal challenge to an action by a future President Trump, like, say, a declaration of emergency in order to federalize police officers to round up undocumented immigrants for deportation. Similarly, it could negate any federal court review if Trump appointed anyone who engaged in the Jan. 6 plot to a federal office, such as former Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark. In doing this, the liberals argued, “the majority attempts to insulate all alleged insurrectionists from future challenges to their holding federal office.” As the liberals noted, “nothing in Section 3’s text supports the majority’s view of how federal disqualification efforts must operate.” Instead, they argued, the majority relied on flimsy precedent and cherry-picked historical quotes to create a new precedent, making Section 3 all but unenforceable in the courts. The majority cited an 1869 decision, issued by Chief Justice Salmon Chase while riding circuit, that argued that Section 3 required congressional authorizing legislation. But Chase’s decision in what was known as Griffin’s Case has been shown to be poorly reasoned and the result of his own personal political ambitions. The liberals also countered the majority’s assertion that Congress passed the Enforcement Act in 1870 in order to give a path to enforce Section 3, noting that the majority cherry-picked quotes from Sen. Lyman Trumbell in his support for the bill. “The majority also cites Senator Trumbull’s statements that Section 3 “‘provide[d] no means for enforcing’” itself,” the opinion said. “The majority, however, neglects to mention the Senator’s view that ‘[i]t is the [F]ourteenth [A]mendment that prevents a person from holding office,’ with the proposed legislation simply ‘affor[ding] a more efficient and speedy remedy’ for effecting the disqualification.” The majority opinion’s requirement that “congressional legislation enforcing Section 3” on federal officeholders must “reflect ‘congruence and proportionality’” and be tailored “‘to remedying or preventing’ the specific conduct” prohibited by Section 3, the liberals noted, also keeps Congress from passing “general federal statutes requiring the government to comply with the law.” What the court is asking of Congress is by no means clear. Does this mean that Congress cannot declare under the Electoral Count Reform Act that Trump’s electors are “not regularly given” due to his ineligibility under Section 3? “If the majority in Trump v. Anderson wanted to foreclose the possibility of a post-election Section Three challenge to Donald Trump’s eligibility, then they did a poor job,” Gerard Magliocca, a law professor at Indiana University School of Law and one of the few Section 3 legal experts, wrote of the decision. Barrett, the lone conservative to disagree with this part of the ruling, simply noted that she “would decide no more than that” states cannot enforce Section 3 for federal offices, but she added that she did not want to further inflame public passions around the court by loudly disagreeing with the majority.

The Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up.” The court could have simply chosen to speak in a unified voice, but instead five justices chose to further narrow any enforcement of Section 3 while muddying the waters about how exactly Congress could act to protect the country from oath-breaking insurrectionists.

Last week, a new episode of the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast was released, in which Dornan made fun of Beatty for falling for an email scam involving fellow actor Eddie Redmayne. Dornan is a longtime friend of Redmayne; it’s unknown how Redmayne and Beatty know each other. Dornan began his anecdote nearly 13 minutes into the episode, as he told host Josh Horowitz about how scammers had hacked into Redmayne’s email account. “Eddie got scammed, and we all got emails [from his account] saying, like, ‘Guys, I’m up against it here. I need some cash,’” the “Fifty Shades” actor said. When Horowitz asked if anyone responded to the phishing email, Dornan did not hesitate to give a name. “Yeah, Warren Beatty was like, ‘What can I do?’” he said. Revealing that Beatty took the bait, Dornan paused and said, “I think I’m OK to tell this [story]?” After a moment of hesitation, Dornan then launched into how he felt about the 86-year-old responding to the scam. “I was like, ‘Yeah, Warren, you go. You go first, I’ll follow,’” Dornan said while cracking up. “No, but like, we all just got individual emails saying, ‘Guys, I need you to wire me some cash,’” he continued. “And fair credit, Warren Beatty was like, ‘Whatever you need,’ you know? What a legend.” Despite crediting Beatty for wanting to help out Redmayne, Dornan continued to tease the fellow actor, joking that the email scam happened “just before [Beatty] read the wrong name at the Academy Awards.” “So it all sort of makes sense,” he said. In 2017, Beatty presented the award for Best Picture at the Academy Awards alongside his “Bonnie and Clyde” co-star, Faye Dunaway. In one of the biggest hiccups in Oscar history, the pair had been given the wrong envelope and announced “La La Land” as the winner, when it was supposed to be “Moonlight.” HuffPost has reached out to Beatty and Redmayne for confirmation on whether this actually happened and for clarification as to how Dornan even knows about this if all of Redmayne’s contacts were emailed individually.

In the accompanying caption, the actor hinted at differences between Swayze’s “Road House” and his performance in the remake, but noted that he was hopeful that his former co-star would still have enjoyed the new film. “I’ve been thinking back about my time working with Patrick on Donnie Darko, and rewatching this great man in the original Road House plus so many other films. I’ve never stopped being a fan,” Gyllenhaal wrote. “He was such a talent and I continue to have so much respect and admiration for what he put out and into the world.” He went on to note: “I’ll never forget his kindness to me when I was starting out— he didn’t have to take the time, but he always did. We’ve made a different RH this time around, but hoping it’s one he would’ve had fun watching!” Swayze died of pancreatic cancer in 2009 at age 57. The three-time Golden Globe nominee was hot off his “Dirty Dancing” success when he appeared in 1989’s “Road House,” which also starred Sam Elliott and Kelly Lynch. The movie followed James Dalton (played by Swayze), a New York bar bouncer who relocates to Missouri to run security at a local bar and ends up saving a small town from a corrupt businessman. The 2024 remake stars Gyllenhaal as Elwood Dalton, a reimagined version of Swayze’s character. This time around, the protagonist is a former UFC middleweight fighter, while the film itself takes place in the Florida Keys. The original “Road House” received middling reviews and was a box office disappointment. Perhaps buoyed by Swayze’s better-regarded performances in “Dirty Dancing” and other films, however, the movie was a surprise hit on home video. Only time will tell if Gyllenhaal’s performance in the new “Road House” will fare better. The film’s rollout, however, has gotten off to bit of a bumpy start.

In January, director Doug Liman announced plans to skip the movie’s South by Southwest (SXSW) premiere after its distributor, Amazon, opted for a direct-to-streaming release on Prime Video instead of a theatrical run. “That hurts the filmmakers and stars of ‘Road House’ who don’t share in the upside of a hit movie on a streaming platform,” Liman, whose credits include “The Bourne Identity” and “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” wrote in an essay for Deadline. “And they deprive Jake Gyllenhaal — who gives a career-best performance — the opportunity to be recognized come award season.” R. Lance Hill, who wrote the screenplay for the original “Road House,” filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Amazon Studios last week. In it, Hill alleged that work on the new movie wasn’t completed until January, months after the copyright deadline had passed and he’d reclaimed the film rights.

Also my kid: If you raise my allowance by 52.7% for the next 7 weeks, then I'll be able to afford that pair of Air Jordan 4s I want. My 11 y/o daughter wanted an allowance so we started negotiating a chores list but she put up her hand after a couple minutes and said, “Okay, this is great, but like when do we work in some self-care here?” Kids always know who to put first. My toddler calls allowance “aplowance” and if you correct her, you’re dead to me 14yo made 4.6 GPA for 1st semester of HS, so I gave him $40 for his savings to build a gamer PC, countering all my training that kids earn good grades for food+shelter. Boy said I was ""indulging in capitalist excess,"" but also asked if he was still gon get his regular allowance👀 My daughter telling me not to worry because she got her own allowance from my purse did not have the effect she intended My 10yo just asked me for his allowance and sang “I like big bucks and I cannot lie” and I know I’m not supposed to like this as his parent but I do, I really do My son asked if I got an allowance as a kid. I said yeah…my mom allowed me to stay in the house rent free and eat every night. Teen: mom when can I have some allowance Me: things are kinda tight Teen: but I still get one tho rightMe: PAYMENT STATUS NOT AVAILABLE Give your kids an allowance so they can stop selling their teeth to a fairy You should let your kids stay up however long they want but force them to go to school in the morning or they lose their allowance. That’s closer to preparing them to adulthood than making them go to sleep. My 8yo folding laundry: Hey Mom! Is this huge underwear yours?So, my husband will be pleased we'll be saving a lot of money on allowance. We settled on a $10/week allowance for the kid. “It’s almost Friday, and your allowance!” Kid: “Don’t forget last week’s. And for the last 5 years I’ve been in school.”😵💫😵💫 My 8yo outlined all the chores she had done this week, demanded her allowance, then marched over and handed me my wallet.She's available if you need a pep talk before your next salary negotiation. I give my kids an allowance to teach them about money, and I secretly steal portions of it to teach them about hidden fees When I told my kids they could start doing chores to earn an allowance, my youngest grabbed some socks and started performing a puppet show. Had to tell her that puppeteering is not a chore but a PASSION. Me: “Out of all of the billions of kids in the world, you are my very favourite. I love you the most.”Wilder: “Can I have my allowance?” I taught my kids about inflation and now I’m embroiled in an acrimonious allowance negotiation. My husband forgot his phone in the house so my son ran in and got it and changed his wallpaper to barf emojis so I bumped up his allowance. professor dad who makes his kids submit funding proposals to increase their allowance I offered my oldest additional allowance money to vacuum rugs, which the kid jumped at.Why haven't I been doing this already?WHY. My kid just told me that if Lego people live in houses made of Lego they’re technically living inside their own flesh so I raised his allowance Thoughts and prayers for my kids who are upset that they didn't get their allowance this week, even though they didn't do anything to earn their allowance this week. My 11yo had the nerve to ask for his allowance even though his room looks like a crime scene and I mean, imagine what he could accomplish if he used this level of audacity for good.

Lawmakers unveiled a bipartisan budget bill on Sunday that would fund certain federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year ― with a rider blocking the Department of Transportation from requiring freight carriers to point cameras at apprentice truck drivers. Federal law requires long-haul truckers to be at least 21 years old, but Congress told the department to let truck companies try out drivers ages 18 to 20 as part of a pilot program. The Safe Driver Apprenticeship Program was supposed to help the trucking industry with its hiring woes, bringing in thousands of eager young drivers, but only a few dozen apprentices have signed up, according to the latest data. The bipartisan infrastructure law required participating freighters to have modern safety technology on their trucks, such as collision mitigation systems, and the Transportation Department added an extra requirement for inward-facing cameras. The American Trucking Associations, an industry trade group, blamed the cameras for the low participation in the apprenticeship program. “These additional mandates have stifled program participation, limiting the utility of data that Congress ordered be collected on drivers in this age cohort,” ATA’s Nathan Mehrens said in an emailed statement. Mehrens said Congress intended the pilot program to be “a pathway for younger drivers to enter the industry as a first career choice.” Another possible explanation for the low enrollment is that younger workers aren’t interested in becoming long-haul truckers, which involves spending weeks away from home, when unemployment is low and easier jobs are readily available. Though few lawmakers are familiar with the teen trucking initiative, there does seem to be bipartisan agreement about doing the industry a favor by relaxing the extra safety rule. Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) added the anti-camera language to a Senate spending bill last year, and the provision was tucked into bipartisan House-and-Senate legislation over the weekend without any press statements or public disagreement. Congress has to pass that bill in order to avoid a partial government shutdown by the end of the week. (The trucking provision also strikes a requirement that truck companies register their apprenticeships with the U.S. Department of Labor.) Younger drivers are known to present higher risks on the road, so the pilot program requires extensive mentoring, in addition to high-tech safety equipment, with the goal of studying whether the requirements can mitigate the danger. Skeptics of the apprenticeship initiative view it as a straightforward giveaway to the industry, a step toward lowering the interstate driving age, and a threat to all drivers.

Envoy Says 'Reasonable Grounds' To Believe Hamas Committed Sexual Violence On Oct. 7,edith m. lederer,3/4/2024,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. envoy focusing on sexual violence in conflict said in a new report Monday that there are “reasonable grounds” to believe Hamas committed rape, “sexualized torture,” and other cruel and inhumane treatment of women during its surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. There are also “reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may be ongoing,” said Pramila Patten, who visited Israel and the West Bank from Jan. 29 to Feb. 14 with a nine-member team. In the report, she said the team “found clear and convincing information” that some hostages have been subjected to the same forms of conflict-related sexual violence including rape and “sexualized torture.” The report comes nearly five months after the Oct. 7 attacks, which left about 1,200 people dead and some 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s war against Hamas has since laid waste to the Gaza Strip, killing more than 30,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The U.N. says a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people face starvation. Patten’s report said the team’s visit “was neither intended nor mandated to be investigative in nature.” She said the team was not able to meet with any victims of sexual violence “despite concerted efforts to encourage them to come forward.” However, team members held 33 meetings with Israeli institutions and conducted interview with 34 people including survivors and witnesses of the Oct. 7 attacks, released hostages, health providers and others. Based on the information it gathered, Patten said, “there are reasonable grounds to believe that conflict-related sexual violence occurred during the 7 October attacks in multiple locations across Gaza periphery, including rape and gang rape, in at least three locations.” Across various locations, she said, the team found “that several fully naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down were recovered – mostly women – with hands tied and shot multiple times, often in the head.” While this is circumstantial, she said the pattern of undressing and restraining victims “may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence.” At the Nova music festival and its surroundings, Patten said, “there are reasonable grounds to believe that multiple incidents of sexual violence took place with victims being subjected to rape and/or gang rape and then killed or killed while being raped.” She said credible sources described finding murdered victims, mostly women, naked from the waist down, many shot in the head. On Road 232 — the road to leave the festival — “credible information based on witness accounts describe an incident of the rape of two women by armed elements,” Patten said. Other reported rapes couldn’t be verified during their time in Israel. But she said “the mission team also found a pattern of bound naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down, in some cases tied to structures including trees and poles, along Road 232.” Patten said that in kibbutz Reim, the mission team verified the rape of a woman outside a bomb shelter and heard of other allegations of rape that could not yet be verified. At Kibbutz Be’eri, Patten said, her team “was able to determine that at least two allegations of sexual violence widely repeated in the media, were unfounded due to either new superseding information or inconsistency in the facts gathered.” These included a highly publicized allegation that a pregnant woman’s womb was reportedly ripped open before being killed with her fetus stabbed inside her, Patten said. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Princess of Wales, who underwent a planned abdominal surgery in January, was photographed Monday riding in a car with her mother, Carole Middleton. The picture arrives just days after Kensington Palace shut down rumors about the princesses’ whereabouts, following increased speculation on the internet. “Kensington Palace made it clear in January the timelines of the princess’ recovery and we’d only be providing significant updates,” a spokesperson told HuffPost on Friday. “That guidance stands.” The spokesman reiterated that the princess is “doing well.” The palace previously announced the timeline for Kate’s recovery in a statement announcing the royal’s operation on Jan. 16. “The surgery was successful, and it is expected that she will remain in hospital for 10 to 14 days, before returning home to continue her recovery,” the palace shared with HuffPost at the time. “Based on the current medical advice, she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.” Kate’s health concerns come at a difficult time for the royal family. Buckingham Palace revealed early last month that King Charles had been diagnosed with cancer, which was discovered during a “recent hospital procedure for benign prostate enlargement.” “Subsequent diagnostic tests have identified a form of cancer,” the palace said at the time. “His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties.” The palace specified that Charles “will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

(Watch the video below.) Appearing on “The View” Monday, the 92-year-old EGOT winner was asked by co-host Ana Navarro what she thought of criticism that Biden, 81, was too old to run again. “Let me say this and it’s very succinct and to the point: I am not about to vote for someone who has 91 indictments against them for criminal activities,” Moreno said, referring to the charges against Donald Trump spread over four indictments. “I mean, enough said already. That’s so stupid. Look at all the stuff Biden has accomplished.” “I’ll take 81 years over 91 counts any day,” Navarro chimed in. “Ya damn right,” Moreno countered. After just turning 92, the fabulous Rita Moreno shares how spreading joy keeps her thriving: ""What I bring with me is a lot of joy and I love to laugh, and I love to make people laugh."" https://t.co/cVclFZQmjA pic.twitter.com/1L2sL6hyDx A New York Times poll of 980 registered voters published Sunday doesn’t exactly reinforce Moreno’s confidence. More than 60% of the voters who backed Biden in 2020 now say he’s “just too old” to govern effectively. A whopping 73% of all registered voters said he was too long in the tooth as well, according to the survey. But if voters aren’t going to heed the word of a show business legend who has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony, they can at least enjoy the joke she cracked at Trump’s expense on the talk show. “I saw a sign in a deli wall in LA, where I was visiting,” Moreno said, per The Wrap. “And it said: Trump Sandwich.

The famous momager and mother of Miley Cyrus explained her reasoning on the latest episode of her podcast, “Sorry We’re Stoned,” which she co-hosts with her daughter, Brandi Cyrus. The episode, which was released last week, included a guest appearance from Wiz Khalifa. “I didn’t smoke pot when I had kids. I didn’t start smoking until I was, like, 46,” Tish Cyrus told Khalifa. “But I think I would’ve been a better parent if I would’ve smoked then,” she continued. “I think I would’ve been, like, I don’t know ― school projects, I would’ve felt more fun.” Brandi Cyrus interjected that her mother could’ve been “much more tolerant” during that time period of her life. “I was just like, ‘Ahhh!’” Tish Cyrus said of her attitude at the time, reiterating, “I really do wish I had smoked then.” Tish Cyrus has five children: Miley, Braison and Noah with her ex-husband, musician Billy Ray Cyrus, and Brandi and Trace from a previous relationship.

But, f**k, it took a lot of hard work and determination getting here.” Kelce, who started crying as soon as he sat down at Monday’s news conference, explained how much football has meant to him. “Stepping on the field was the most alive and free I had ever felt,” the 36-year-old said. “There was a visceral feeling with football unlike any other sport,” he said. “The hairs on my arms would stand up. I could hit somebody, run around like a crazed lunatic and then get told, ‘Good job.’ I loved football.” The Philadelphia Eagles center, who has played for the franchise for his entire tenure, thanked an array of people during his announcement, including his high school and college coaches, his teammates and his family. When he got drafted to the NFL and picked to play for the Eagles, his agent told him he would fit in great in Philadelphia. “Thirteen seasons in Philadelphia and I look back on a career filled with ups and downs,” he said. Kelce, a seven-time Pro Bowl player, helped the Eagles win the Super Bowl in 2018, but the team fell short in 2023 against the Kansas City Chiefs. Kelce said it was always a goal of his to play for just one team his entire career. “I couldn’t have dreamt of a better one and a better fit if I tried,” he said. Kelce became extra tearful when he spoke about losing to the Kansas City Chiefs and his brother, Travis Kelce, in the 2023 Super Bowl. “I won’t forget falling short to the Chiefs and the conflicted feelings of immense heartbreak I had selfishly for myself and my teammates,” he said. “And at the same time, the amount of pride I had that my brother had climbed the mountaintop once again.” Travis Kelce was also seen wiping away tears while watching his brother announce his retirement. He said he doesn’t know what’s next for his career, but he looks forward to the next step. “Thank you, Philadelphia,” Jason Kelce said. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you for letting me represent this city and allowing me into your homes every Sunday.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/french-parliament-enshrines-constitutional-right-to-abortion_n_65e60e6be4b0f890593386e4,French Parliament Enshrines Right To Abortion In Constitution After Historic Vote,"barbara surk, nicolas garriga",3/4/2024,"PARIS (AP) — French lawmakers on Monday overwhelmingly approved a bill that will enshrine a woman’s right to an abortion in France’s constitution, a historic move designed to prevent the kind of rollback of abortion rights seen in the United States in recent years. In an exceptional joint session of parliament convened at the Palace of Versailles, the bill was approved in a 780-72 vote. Abortion enjoys wide support in France across most of the political spectrum, and has been legal since 1975. The vote makes France the first country to have a constitutional right to abortion since the former Yugoslavia inscribed it in its 1974 constitution. Serbia’s 2006 constitution carries on that spirit, stating that “everyone has the right to decide on childbirth.” Nearly the entire hall in France stood in a long standing ovation, and many female legislators in the hall smiled broadly as they cheered. There were jubilant scenes of celebrations all over France as women’s rights activists hailed the measure promised by President Emmanuel Macron immediately following the Dobbs ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022. Both houses of parliament, the National Assembly and the Senate, had already adopted a bill to amend Article 34 of the French Constitution to specify that “the law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.” In the lead up to the historic vote, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal addressed the 925 lawmakers gathered for the joint session in Versailles, and called on them to make France a leader in women’s rights and set an example in defense of women’s rights for countries around the world. “We have a moral debt to women,” Attal said. He paid tribute to Simone Veil, a prominent legislator, former health minister and key feminist who in 1975 championed the bill that decriminalized abortion in France. “We have a chance to change history,” Attal said in a moving and determined speech. “Make Simone Veil proud,” he said to a standing ovation. The lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, overwhelmingly approved the proposal in January. The Senate adopted the bill on Wednesday, clearing a key hurdle for legislation promised by Macron’s government, intended to make “a woman’s right to have an abortion irreversible.” A three-fifths majority in the joint session was required for the measure to be approved None of France’s major political parties represented in parliament have questioned the right to abortion, including Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party and the conservative Republicans. However, some lawmakers have voted against inscribing abortion right into the constitution in previous votes in both houses. Le Pen, who won a record number of seats in the National Assembly two years ago, said on Monday that her party will vote in favor of the bill but added that “there is no need to make this a historic day.” The right to an abortion has broad support among the French public. A recent poll showed support at more than 80%, consistent with previous surveys. The same poll also showed that a solid majority of people are in favor of enshrining it in the constitution. There were scenes of celebrations around France even before the joint parliamentary session began. Sarah Durocher, a leader in the Family Planning movement, said Monday’s vote is “a victory for feminists and a defeat for the anti-choice activists.” With the right to an abortion added to the constitution, it will be much harder to prevent women from voluntarily terminating a pregnancy in France, women’s rights and equality activists said. “We increased the level of protection to this fundamental right,” said Anne-Cécile Mailfert of the Women’s Foundation. “It’s a guarantee for women today and in the future to have the right to abort in France.” The government argued in its introduction to the bill that the right to abortion is threatened in the United States, where the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned a 50-year-old ruling that used to guarantee it. “Unfortunately, this event is not isolated: in many countries, even in Europe, there are currents of opinion that seek to hinder at any cost the freedom of women to terminate their pregnancy if they wish,” the introduction to the French legislation says. The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to strip women of the right to abortion has reverberated across Europe’s political landscape, forcing the issue back into public debate in France at a time of political upheaval. Mathilde Philip-Gay, a law professor and a specialist in French and American constitutional law, warned against easing the pressure on legislators for women’s rights as far-right parties — determined to curtail women’s rights — gain political influence and are elected to form governments around Europe and elsewhere. “It may not be an issue in France, where a majority of people support abortion,” Philip-Gay said. “But those same people may one day vote for a far-right government, and what happened in the U.S. can happen elsewhere in Europe, including in France.” The next four years will change America forever.

Inscribing abortion into the French Constitution “will make it harder for abortion opponents of the future to challenge these rights, but it won’t prevent them from doing it in the long run, with the right political strategy,” Philip-Gay added. “It only takes a moment for everything we thought that we have achieved to fade away,” said Yael Braun-Pivet, the first female president of the French parliament, in her address to the joint session. Amending the constitution is a laborious process and a rare event in France. Since it was enacted in 1958, the French Constitution has been amended 17 times. The last time was in 2008, when parliament was awarded more powers and French citizens were granted the right to bring their grievances to the Constitutional Court.

Edwards, who starred for the Cleveland Browns and New York Jets after a record-setting college career at Michigan, told WDIV TV that he overheard an argument on Friday about music being played too loud. “The noise escalates, and you can start to hear some pushing and shoving ― I mean, you know what fighting sounds like. Start to hear some tussling, start to hear some fists,” Edwards said. “But then once I heard a thud... that’s what got me up. That’s what got me to turn around.” Edwards said he saw a young man about to slam the older man’s head on the counter, so he jumped into action. “I grabbed him, subdued him,” he said. According to Farmington Hills police, who described the suspect as a 20-year-old man, the victim was already unconscious and bleeding when Edwards intervened. Edwards “pulled the suspect off the injured man, at which time the suspect attacked [Edwards], who was able to fight the suspect off,” a police release said. The suspect fled the scene on foot but was captured without incident, according to police. “I’d like to thank the good Samaritan for taking action to stop the suspect in the midst of a vicious assault,” Farmington Hills police Chief Jeff King said in the release, which did not identify Edwards by name.

The unanimous 9-0 decision avoided answering whether or not Trump engaged in insurrection, finding instead that states do not have the right to disqualify candidates for federal office under the 14th Amendment. To no one’s surprise, Trump greeted the news with glee. “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” he wrote on Truth Social, the right-wing social media company he’s accused of trying to filch from its co-founders. Trump doubled down on that sentiment in remarks at Mar-a-Lago, applauding the justices for their decision. “They worked long, they worked hard, and frankly, they worked very quickly on something that will be spoken about 100 years from now and 200 years from now,” he said. Trump also reiterated his belief that the decision about his eligibility ultimately lies with the voters. “The voters can take someone out of the race, but a court shouldn’t be doing that,” he said. The twice-impeached former president faces 91 criminal charges spanning four criminal cases for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, illegally retaining hundreds of highly classified documents after he left office, and falsifying business records during the 2016 presidential election to conceal hush-money payments he made to two women with whom he allegedly had extramarital affairs.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/baleaf-hiking-pants-sale_l_65e5ffa6e4b0d2a2475a43c2,The Quick-Dry Hiking Pants Reviewers Say They Basically Live In Are On Sale,haley zovickian,3/4/2024,"HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. I hunt for and write about exceptional products for a living, and have read thousands of reviews for innumerable goods. That’s all to say that I have read many a gushing review. Yet I have to admit, the volume of exceptional reviews for these quick-dry hiking pants from Baleaf impressed even me — and the women’s version is on sale for 19% off for a limited time. These popular men’s and women’s pants are comfy, lightweight and so water-repellant that reviewers recount spilling bottles of water on them and simply watching the water roll off. The women’s are surprisingly stylish, thanks to their adjustable ankle straps that give the option of a more tapered look. In my opinion, most impressive of all is the material’s UPF 50+ sun protection factor, which reviewers swear by for guarding their legs from UV rays. Reviewers not only love these comfy pants for hiking, but also say they basically live in them. And they mean it. In addition to being vouched for by hikers and lovers of comfy clothing, folks with tons of different professions and hobbies have added these pants to their daily rotation of staples, including dental hygienists and nurses who use them as scrubs, fly fishers, climbers who zip-line and rappel, office and retail workers, camera operators, people who rehabilitate and groom animals, and construction workers. Some reviewers even dress them up to wear out to dinner. The women’s pants are available in 18 colors in sizes XS–3XL, and the men’s version is available in three colors in sizes S–3XL. (Note: For the women’s pants, a number of reviewers suggest sizing up.) Each has deep zippered pockets so you can stash your phone and other hefty items comfortably, then zip them right up to ensure they’re extra secure. (The women’s version has two pockets at the side and one at the back, and the men’s version has two at the side and back.) As someone who has been unwillingly subjected to women’s pants with either no pockets or insultingly small, shallow pockets, this is nothing short of awesome. They’re also highly durable, with one reviewer mentioning their pair got caught on an aluminum decking during a construction job, and their pants not only did not rip, but did not even snag. Okay, I’m listening. According to reviewers, they’re perfect pants to pack for travel since you can roll them up super tight, using up almost no room in your luggage. The adjustable drawstring waist will help these fit even if you’re feeling bloated or have some fluctuations in weight. And strikingly, folks of all body types love them, including tall, petite and plus size reviewers. One reviewer’s adult son was so impressed by her pair that he asked if they made them in men’s. Luckily for him, they do. And finally, reviewers say they also do a great job protecting against mosquitoes, welcome news given that mosquitoes are more plentiful this year than ever in many parts of the country. Grab your own pair while they’re on sale, or read on for what Amazon reviewers have to say. Promising reviews: “I wore these pants daily on an 8-day backcountry canoe trip for which I wanted good sun coverage. They held up great! They dried quickly (important on a canoe trip) and breathed well. I’m as happy with them as I would have been with a pair of pants from REI, which were all $50+ more expensive. Zipper pockets were nice ― particularly enjoyed the thigh pocket which fit a standard iPhone + small map and fun-size candy and was accessible while seated in the boat. For sizing reference, I’m 5′3″ and 125ish lbs, and a small worked well and still had room for me to slip a pair of long underwear under on our coldest day.” — Ana “Love this pants! They can be dressed up or dressed down. They are wrinkle free, light weight, contain 4 different zippered pockets and the drawstrings at the ankles can be pulled or not pulled, depending on if you want a jogger/hiker pant look or a causal pants look. These are super comfortable - I ordered two pairs and loved them so much I immediately got on online and ordered 2 more pairs in different colors. They fit true to size - I’m 5 ft., 1″ and approximately 113 pounds - an XS fit me perfectly with a nice loose fit. Highly recommend these - I think they’d also be great for travel - they are so lightweight they would not take up much room at all in a carry on bag.” — Lucy Van Der Laan “I am 67 years and love to garden. I wear these pants for the sun protection along with a white long sleeve crew neck. They have worked great and I do not overheat in them. The fabric is light weight and breathable.” — Smartlady By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Bissell’s Little Green portable carpet cleaner is a big-time fan favorite, so there’s a rush whenever it gets marked down. It has a reputation for selling out during big sales events like Amazon Prime Days, so if you’ve always wanted to get one for yourself at a discount, you’re in luck. Both Amazon and Walmart are offering this famed cleaning machine for less than $100 right now. The classic green version that you’ve probably come to recognize is $98 at Amazon, and there’s a cool black color that’s exclusive to Walmart also on sale for an impressive $89. That model works just like the green version, comes with the same 3-inch tough stain tool to spray, scrub and suction away dirt and stains, and the same handy 48-ounce tank capacity and the same free 8-ounce bottle of Bissell’s Spot & Stain with Febreze Freshness cleaner. I own one of these Little Green cleaners, and they are indeed supremely portable and carpet-saving (pet owners love them). Every time I spill food on my rug — this happens way too often — I just run for the Little Green, flip it on, spend a scant minute scrubbing, suction up the dirty water and then breath a sigh of relief. It’s saved me from soy sauce, ketchup, salad dressing, dollops of of curry and more than one dropped cheeseburger. Reviewers say they also use this on upholstery, car seats and even mattresses. It may just be one of the most beloved cleaning tools we share her at HuffPost, and this is the lowest price I remember seeing for it. Grab one now for up to $34 off. Promising reviews from Walmart.com: “Honestly amazing, my roommate’s cat knocked over a plant I’d just repotted and this made the carpet look good as new. We’re about to move, so I didn’t want to be charged for replacing all the carpets if it came to that which could be hundreds. Walmart had it for the cheapest price I’d seen anywhere, so I grabbed it. It took all the solution it came with and around an hour to do but it looks 1000% better. Prior to this I had rented one from Lowe’s which helped a little, but the stain was still noticeable. This made it look like there never was a stain. 10/10...” — Emily, verified purchase “Love this cleaner, I cleaned my kitchen stool seats, my sofas and my hallway carpets boy did it leave it so clean and very easy to use highly recommend.” —Arlene, verified purchase “Bought this because we needed a portable, smaller carpet cleaner to take back and forth to our cabin for smaller messes. Also for our boat and vehicles as well. It’s so easy to transport and functions really well. We were actually very impressed, it worked better then we expected.” — NW, verified purchase “I’m so glad that I bought the little green machine. Everyday messes are not as upsetting as they used to be. This machine has cleaned everything spotless, including black coffee and doggie accidents. And you can’t even tell where these stains occurred. I’ve also used it to clean our dining room chairs, really perked them up. So handy to have the green machine at hand.” — Rebekah By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

During an appearance on CNN Monday morning, Griffin was asked about a string of verbal slip-ups the GOP presidential front-runner made in speeches over the weekend. “You saw Donald Trump firsthand when he was, albeit four years or several years younger, at least. How much does he miss or mix up facts and the like?” CNN’s John Berman asked. “I have said this before, he is not as sharp as he was in 2016 and not even as sharp as he was in 2020,” Griffin said. She went on to say that Trump “is not the strongest fighter that Republicans could have right now,” adding that it’s “remarkable how much voters don’t see [his] age as also an issue because he is only 3 1/2 years younger than President Joe Biden.” Griffin was Trump’s White House communications director for eight months in 2020. She also served as a press secretary for former Vice President Mike Pence and the Department of Defense. Griffin said Trump has “never been a super articulate or eloquent person,” but he’s been consistently mixing up the names of people like Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley recently.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. No matter what time of year it is, it’s always important to slather sunscreen on ourselves and our loved ones. Sunscreen is proven to reduce the risk of skin cancer and protect skin against premature aging, but unfortunately, that knowledge is not always enough to actually inspire us to apply sunscreen. Greasy, heavy sun lotions can make you dread application so much that logic goes out the window (I know that’s true for me). That’s why this bestselling EltaMD Clear broad-spectrum SPF 46 —currently 20% off with discount code REFRESH as part of Dermstore’s beauty refresh sale — is here to save the day and probably answer more than a few of your prayers. Beloved by dermatologists and thousands of 5-star reviewers, it provides strong UVA and UVB protection in a lightweight, oil- and fragrance-free formula that promises to leave no sticky residue on your face and no white cast. Those with sensitive skin or rosacea may benefit from its calming niacinamide and antibacterial zinc, both skincare favorites for soothing inflamed skin. This cult-favorite SPF also moisturizes with popular hyaluronic acid while helping even out hyperpigmentation, reducing shine and lightly exfoliating pores thanks to the inclusion of lactic acid. You just can’t go wrong with this gentle powerhouse sunscreen, and its 20% discount is the cherry on top. Apply under or over makeup, and be sure to reapply every two hours while you’re in the sun. Check out these glowing reviews from Dermstore — and while you’re grabbing a bottle for yourself, do your teen or your partner a favor and let them in on this sun protection must-have, too. “This is my go–to sunscreen. I’ve used it for about four years now and it’s perfect. It applies very smoothly and dries down quick. It feels more like a serum than a sunscreen. For years I dreaded applying sunscreen, but this one is amazing. I have from time to time wandered away from this product, but I always come back. No other sunscreen compares.” — Jessica “It’s honestly as good as sunscreen gets. I used it on my boyfriend and he thought I was putting regular lotion on his face since it’s so soothing and goes on totally transparent. Plus it’s non-irritating and great for skin conditions like acne.” — Delaney “This is by far my favorite sunscreen. I use it daily and it always protects my face from getting sunburnt. This is the one sunscreen that I used when I had severe acne and it helped my acne and inflammation greatly! I recommend it to everyone I meet.” — Stacy “This sunscreen is my favorite. As a brown-skinned girl, this doesn’t leave a white cast after being blended in! It also is incredibly hydrating.” — Savi “Holy grail sunscreen. As if this product NEEDS another five-star review — but it’s too good not to sing its praises! It blends like a dream and it doesn’t bother my oily, acne-prone skin. I don’t find that there’s any white cast, and my skin appears hydrated and glowy. Five million stars!” — Amy “As someone who has had numerous basal skin cancers removed from my face, I am always on the lookout for the best sun protection.

The 76-year-old surrendered to the Manhattan district attorney’s office early Monday following weeks of negotiations with prosecutors. He will be sentenced to five months in jail, according to The Associated Press. “Allen Weisselberg looks forward to putting this situation behind him,” Seth L. Rosenberg, one of Weisselberg’s lawyers, said in an emailed statement to HuffPost. Weisselberg, who was also sentenced last year to five months in prison after being found guilty of multiple tax fraud charges in 2022, had been suspected of lying about his former boss’ finances during a sworn deposition in May and while on the stand during Trump’s trial in October. Weisselberg, under oath, had said that he was not involved in an evaluation of Trump’s Manhattan penthouse, which was listed for years as much larger in size on his annual financial statements than it actually was. Shortly after Weisselberg’s testimony, Forbes published an article citing past emails and notes between the outlet and him that contradicted his claims. Forbes reported that he was not only involved in an evaluation of the penthouse, but he tried to inflate the property’s value over several years. New York state Judge Arthur Engoron later questioned the veracity of Weisselberg’s testimony prior to delivering his judgment in Trump’s trial last month. In an email to the defense and prosecution on Feb. 5, Engoron said he was considering whether he should throw out all of Weisselberg’s testimony after The New York Times first reported about Weisselberg negotiating with prosecutors on a perjury plea. “As the presiding magistrate, the trier of fact, and the judge of credibility, I of course want to know whether Mr. Weisselberg is now changing his tune, and whether he is admitting he lied under oath in my courtroom at trial,” Engoron wrote. Shortly after, Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355 million in penalties for lying about his wealth. Weisselberg was also permanently banned from having financial control over any New York corporation or similar business entity in New York. In his ruling, Engoron said “the evidence is overwhelming” that Weisselberg, as well as Trump’s former corporate controller, Jeffrey McConney, “cannot be entrusted with controlling the finances of any business.” McConney received the same business ban in New York.

A great many artists or their estates have condemned Trump’s use of their music over the years, including the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, the Smiths, Black Sabbath, Rihanna and others. O’Connor released her cover of “Nothing Compares 2 U,” originally written by Prince, in 1990. The smash hit garnered O’Connor global success and a No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-trump-colorado-ballot-ruling_n_65984f08e4b0f9f6621ca0ee,Supreme Court Says Donald Trump Can Appear On 2024 Ballot,lydia o'connor,3/4/2024,"The U.S. Supreme Court overruled a Colorado court’s decision barring Donald Trump from appearing on the 2024 presidential ballot in an unsigned and unanimous decision on Monday. The case revolved around a clause in the 14th Amendment stating that anyone who took an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution but then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against it is ineligible to hold state or federal office. The Colorado Supreme Court had ruled Dec. 19 that Trump’s actions in support of the Jan. 6 insurrection disqualified him from the ballot. The Supreme Court disagreed, arguing that states do not have the ability under the 14th Amendment to disqualify candidates for federal office. “We conclude that States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office,” the decision states. “But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency.” The court’s decision ensures that Trump will remain on the ballot in Colorado, and Maine and Illinois, where judges and election officials similarly ruled him ineligible under the 14th Amendment. The decision came the day before Colorado’s Republican presidential primary election, which the state’s top court had ordered Trump disqualified from. “While the Supreme Court allowed Donald Trump back on the ballot on technical legal grounds, this was in no way a win for Trump,” Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the liberal legal group that led the Colorado lawsuit, said in a statement. “The Supreme Court had the opportunity in this case to exonerate Trump, and they chose not to do so.” Trump, on the other hand, called the decision a “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” The case came before the court after a group of Colorado voters challenged Trump’s eligibility under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment in state court. This challenge followed a series of lawsuits brought by CREW and Free Speech for People, another liberal legal group, seeking to disqualify other candidates from office for their participation or alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection. At first a Colorado court ruled against the challenge to Trump’s ballot eligibility by claiming that the presidency was not an “office ... under the United States” to which Section 3 applied. On appeal, the Colorado Supreme Court overruled the lower state court in a 4-3 decision to find that Section 3 applied to the presidency and that Trump engaged in insurrection that warranted disqualification from future political office. In its decision, the U.S. Supreme Court remained silent on whether Trump engaged in insurrection or not, but instead solely determined that states did not have the authority under Section 3 to disqualify federal candidates. “Because federal officers “‘owe their existence and functions to the united voice of the whole, not of a portion, of the people,’” powers over their election and qualifications must be specifically “delegated to, rather than reserved by, the States,” the decision says, quoting from its 1995 precedent in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton where it struck down state-imposed term limits on congressional candidates. While the court spoke in a united voice in its decision that states did not have the authority to disqualify federal candidates under Section 3, four justices dissented from the decision’s assertion that Section 3 could only be enforced by congressional legislation. “Today, the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oathbreaking insurrectionist from becoming President,” a concurrence from liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson states. “Although we agree that Colorado cannot enforce Section 3, we protest the majority’s effort to use this case to define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision.” In addition, conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett issued her own concurrence stating that the case “does not require us to address the complicated question whether federal legislation is the exclusive vehicle through which Section 3 can be enforced.” The court’s decision to allow Trump to remain on the ballot was not a surprise. When it heard oral arguments in early February, the court appeared unanimous in its skepticism of the Colorado Supreme Court ruling that Trump was disqualified from office because of his role inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. At that hearing, the court’s six conservative justices and three liberal ones appeared united in the argument that that clause does not empower individual states to remove candidates for federal office from the ballot without legislative authorization from Congress. “The whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power,” Chief Justice John Roberts, historically a swing vote on the court, said at the hearing. “Wouldn’t that be the last place you’d look for authorization for the states, including the Confederate states, to enforce … the presidential election process?” he added. “That seems to be a position at war with the whole thrust of the 14th Amendment and very ahistorical.” Kagan raised similar concerns. “To put it most baldly, the question that you have to confront is why a single state should get to decide who gets to be president of the United States,” she said at the time. When it issued its ruling in December, the Colorado Supreme Court acknowledged the enormity of such a decision. “We do not reach these conclusions lightly,” the court wrote. “We are mindful of the magnitude and weight of the questions now before us. We are likewise mindful of our solemn duty to apply the law, without fear or favor, and without being swayed by public reaction to the decisions that the law mandates we reach.” The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case at the request of Trump’s lawyers. The former president’s spokesperson Steven Cheung called Colorado’s decision an “unAmerican, unconstitutional act of election interference which cannot stand.” Efforts to remove Trump from the ballot have advanced in 36 states, though courts have since dismissed or rejected more than half of them. Trump’s legal woes are far from over. He was initially scheduled to face trial in March on four felony charges related to his role in the Capitol insurrection, but a judge delayed the start of that trial. A new date has not been set. Across the four criminal cases in which he’s been indicted, he’s been charged with 91 felonies. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.

Greg Abbott (R-Texas) “couldn’t be more wrong” in claiming there is no need for Congress to approve legislation on immigration, and accused Abbott of “trying to wreak havoc” in cities across the U.S. Abbott had previously called on President Joe Biden to use his executive authority to improve the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border. “The president does not need new laws,” Abbott told CNN’s “State of the Union” last month. “The president needs the backbone to make sure that he enforces the immigration laws that are already on the books.” Mayorkas on Sunday took issue with Abbott’s comments, telling CNN’s Dana Bash that the governor “couldn’t be more wrong” and that Abbott’s suggested approach failed during former President Donald Trump’s time in office. “As a matter of fact, former President Trump tried to close the border, and it was enjoined in the courts and never saw the light of day,” Mayorkas said. Mayorkas also blasted Abbott for failing to work with other U.S. officials, and for engaging in political stunts by busing migrants from Texas to Democrat-led states and cities like New York and Chicago. “This coming from an individual who is purposefully refusing to coordinate, communicate, collaborate with other officials, and trying to wreak havoc in other cities and states across the country,” Mayorkas said. “That is not a model of governance, and he couldn’t be more wrong.” Republicans, at Trump’s urging, ended up rejecting a bipartisan bill that would have established some of the toughest border enforcement measures in decades, to avoid potentially handing Biden a win in an election year. Abbott joined Trump at his campaign stop at the border last week, where the former president said he is “absolutely” considering the governor as a potential running mate.

Most recently, the administration sued Texas over a bill that would enable local police to arrest migrants who cross into the country illegally. A federal court struck down the legislation, but the state’s attorney general, Ken Paxton (R), has already appealed the decision. Bash also asked Mayorkas whether he wants the Senate to hold an impeachment trial against him, after the House voted to impeach him last month in what was widely considered a politically motivated effort by Republicans to make Trump look tough on immigration ahead of November’s presidential election. “I’m going to let the Senate, of course, execute its responsibilities as it thinks best in the service of our country,” Mayorkas told Bash. “I am going to focus on work.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bob-melvin-national-anthem_n_65e5c0f8e4b0d2a2475a2747,San Francisco Giants Manager Mandates Surprising National Anthem Policy,ron dicker,3/4/2024,"New San Francisco Giants manager Bob Melvin is requiring everyone in the dugout to stand on the field for the national anthem. The policy has taken effect during spring training and the expectation is for it to continue in the regular season, outlets reported. The move may strike some as surprising given the city’s liberal bent and former San Francisco 49er Colin Kaepernick’s historic protests several years ago. But Melvin insisted there’s no politics behind the mandate. “Look, we’re a new team here, we got some good players here,’’ Melvin told USA Today in Scottsdale, Arizona, on Friday. “It’s more about letting the other side know that we’re ready to play. I want guys out here ready to go. There’s a personality to that.” He continued, “It has nothing to do with whatever happened in the past or whatever, it’s just something I embrace. You want your team ready to play and I want the other team to notice it, too. It’s as simple as that. They’re embracing it.” Melvin said he had the same rule as manager of the Oakland A’s and San Diego Padres and had to crack down from time to time. The Athletic previously reported that Melvin wants to enforce the policy during the regular season although getting full participation will be “trickier” because of different pregame routines. “But the expectation is that everyone who can be out there standing at attention will be out there standing at attention,” The Athletic wrote. The man he replaced to lead the Giants, Gabe Kapler, embraced activism when it came to the anthem. Kapler stopped appearing on the field in 2022 for “The Star-Spangled Banner” after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Sports Illustrated reported. He also took a knee in protest following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. Kaepernick’s demonstrations to raise awareness of racism and police brutality began in 2016, putting him in the cross-hairs of backlash that included the rage of Donald Trump.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-benny-gantz-meeting-dc_n_65e5da5be4b0f89059336d99,Kamala Harris Meets Israeli Cabinet Official Despite Netanyahu's Rebuke,"aamer madhani, seung min kim",3/4/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris met on Monday with a member of Israel’s wartime Cabinet who came to Washington in defiance of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the Biden administration intensifies its efforts to push more humanitarian aid into war-battered Gaza. White House officials said Benny Gantz, a centrist political rival of Netanyahu, requested the meeting and that the Democratic administration believed it was important that Harris sit down with the prominent Israeli official despite Netanyahu’s objections. President Joe Biden, Harris and other senior administration officials have become increasingly blunt about their dissatisfaction with the mounting death toll in Gaza and the suffering of innocent Palestinians as the war nears the five-month mark. “The president and I have been aligned and consistent from the very beginning,” Harris said in an exchange with reporters shortly before meeting with Gantz. “Israel has a right to defend itself. Far too many Palestinian civilians, innocent civilians have been killed. We need to get more aid in, we need to get hostages out. and that remains our position.” The White House, in a statement following the meeting, said Harris and Gantz discussed the urgency of completing a hostage deal to free more than 100 people believed still to be in captivity in Gaza following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. She also reiterated the administration’s support for a temporary extended cease-fire that would facilitate the release of hostages and allow for a surge of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza. Although Gantz holds many of the same hardline views as Netanyahu, he has been seen as more open to compromise on critical issues, including the increased delivery of humanitarian assistance. The meeting comes after the U.S. on Saturday carried out the first of what are expected to be ongoing airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The moment is reflective of the increasingly awkward dynamics in the U.S.-Israel relationship, with the U.S. forced to fly badly needed aid past its close ally as it looks to ramp up assistance for desperate civilians in Gaza. The first airdrop occurred just days after more than 100 Palestinians were killed as they were trying to get food from an Israel-organized convoy. The White House agreed to the meeting with Gantz even as an official from Netanyahu’s nationalist Likud party said Gantz did not have approval from the prime minister for his meetings in Washington. Netanyahu gave Gantz a “tough talk” about the visit — underscoring a widening crack within Israel’s wartime leadership. “We have been dealing with all members of the war Cabinet, including Mr. Gantz,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. “We see this as a natural outgrowth of those discussions. We’re not going to turn away that sort of opportunity.” In addition to his talks with Harris, Gantz met with White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and National Security Council Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk. Gantz also met with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and on Tuesday will sit down with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Gantz ,just before the start of his White House meetings, told a reporter with Israel’s public broadcaster Kan: “There will be an open and honest conversation between two friendly and important countries and partners.” Biden is at Camp David, the presidential retreat just outside Washington, until Tuesday as he prepares to deliver the annual State of the Union address later this week. Over the weekend, Harris issued a forceful call for a temporary cease-fire deal in Gaza, which administration officials say would halt fighting for at least six weeks. She also increased pressure on Israel not to impede the aid that workers are trying to get into the region. The White House has been advocating for that framework deal for weeks. Israel has essentially agreed to the deal, according to a senior Biden administration official, and the White House has emphasized that the onus is on Hamas to come on board. Biden faces mounting political pressure at home over his administration’s handling of the Israeli-Hamas war, which was triggered when militants in Gaza launched an attack, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 people hostage. In last week’s Michigan presidential primary, more than 100,000 Democratic primary voters cast ballots for “uncommitted.” Biden still easily won the state’s primary, but the “uncommitted” vote reflected a coordinated push by voters on the left to register their dissatisfaction with the president’s unwavering support for Israel as its military operations in Gaza have left more than 30,000 Palestinians dead. The vote totals raise concerns for Democrats in a state Biden won by only 154,000 votes in 2020. Gantz, who polls show could be a formidable candidate for prime minister if a vote were held today, is viewed as a political moderate. But he has remained vague about his view of Palestinian statehood — something that Biden sees as essential to forging a lasting peace once the conflict ends but that Netanyahu adamantly opposes. It is also assumed that when the heavy fighting subsides, Gantz will leave the government, which would increase pressure for early elections. Since Gantz joined Netanyahu’s three-minister war Cabinet in October, U.S. officials have found him to be easier to deal with than either Netanyahu or Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Until now, calls for elections have been muted due to the war, but analysts think that when Gantz leaves the government, it will send a signal to the Israeli public that the need for national unity has passed and efforts to oust Netanyahu’s government can begin in earnest. For his part, Gantz was aiming to strengthen ties with the U.S., bolster support for Israel’s war and push for the release of Israeli hostages, according to a second Israeli official. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t allowed to publicly discuss the disputes within the Israeli government. Gantz is scheduled to head to London for meetings after his U.S. visit. It was unclear if Gantz during his White House talks diverged from Netanyahu’s stances on Palestinian statehood or carrying out an expanded operation in the southernmost Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden administration has repeatedly warned Israel against a Rafah operation without a plan to protect civilians, and the White House said Harris reiterated that position in her meeting with Gantz. “I don’t doubt there are some administration officials who believe just by meeting with Gantz they are undermining Netanyahu,” said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a conservative Washington think tank. “But if Gantz carries the government’s line on key issues of disagreement, these meetings are net-negative for the White House while helpful back home for Gantz.” ___ Associated Press writers Tia Goldenberg in Tel Aviv, Israel; Wafaa Shurafa in Rafah, Gaza Strip; Samy Magdy in Cairo and Matthew Lee and Zeke Miller contributed to this report.

The premise is that young children — ages 4, 3 and even 2 — are sent to run errands by themselves. Cleverly disguised camera crews trail them on their journeys while their parents wait for them at home or some other predetermined meeting point. The kids walk though neighborhoods, cross the street, navigate public transit and manage interactions with shopkeepers. One little girl carries her mother’s work pants to be mended. Another child purchases dumplings from a vendor. The children’s focus and determination is captivating, and it’s impossible not to become invested in their success at the task. The kids are also adorable. Their reactions and facial expressions regularly crack my son up. But that isn’t the show’s only allure. The sheer implausibility of the whole endeavor draws him in. “You would’ve never let me do something like this,” he observed. “You would’ve been freaking out.” He’s not wrong. When he was 3, I likely would’ve sent him hang gliding before allowing him to cross the street alone. But my parenting instincts aren’t just a product of my own neuroses. They’re part of a culture, and here in the U.S. we’ve developed a culture of overprotectiveness and fear when it comes to kids acting independently. By keeping them safely within arms’ reach, what are our kids missing out on? And what are some ways we could give them the opportunity to practice these vital life skills? Japan isn’t the only nation where you can find kids navigating a town’s streets and public transportation without adult supervision. Mei-Ling Hopgood lived in Argentina as a new mother, writing about the experience in her book “How Eskimos Keep Their Babies Warm,” in which she explores parenting practices around the globe. She noted that it was common in Argentina and in other countries to see children commuting to and from school without adults. In some places, the reasons behind this particular independence are structural. Not all families have cars, so the only options may be walking, biking or taking public transit. Another factor is parents’ level of trust in their community. When they send their kids out of the house, do they assume they will be safe and that the adults they interact with will be helpful and trustworthy? In Argentina, Hopgood saw signs of trust in the community of surrounding adults. “If a child is crossing the street, not with a parent, or if an older person is crossing the street and needs help, they will take your hands. For example, when I would take the girls back to Argentina when they were little, the drivers that would pick us up, a man they did not know, would take their hands and walk them to the car,” she said, much to the surprise of her daughters, who by then were living in the U.S. “The thinking [is] that adults are there to help you,” Hopgood told HuffPost. This includes men and even men you don’t know, and was a real shift from the “stranger danger” panic that permeated her American childhood. It was “notable to me because of the bias against men being nurturing people, or they are the strangers you should be afraid of.” Journalist Michaeleen Doucleff observed a similar kind of autonomy among the Maya, Inuit and Hadzabe children that she observed when researching her book “Hunt, Gather, Parent.” Children in these cultures, she told HuffPost, “have enormous freedom to decide where they go, what they do and who they’re with. Parents and older kids are around them, observing and ensuring they are safe. But generally their movements and actions are their own.” Again, there is a shared assumption that children are safe moving throughout the community. This autonomy extends to kids setting their own schedules — deciding when do go to bed, for example (an often fraught topic for American parents that has generated the profession of sleep consultant). In general, kids were entrusted with a multitude of what an American would likely consider “adult” responsibilities: “They use knives and the stove. They help take care of younger siblings (playing with them, changing diapers, feeding them). They take care of animals or a family garden. They learn to hunt, slaughter/butcher animals, make clothes. They work at local stores. They climb trees, gather firewood or forage for food,” Doucleff said. This trust in children’s ability to handle things includes managing their emotions and speaking for themselves. “They are allowed to get upset, have tantrums, without being scolded or forced to control their emotions very early,” Doucleff said. In addition, she said, “parents allow children to talk for themselves” rather than answering questions directed at them on their behalf or prompting them with what to say. Other cultures also have a higher tolerance for risk when it comes to kids’ behavior. Helen Russell, author of the forthcoming “The Danish Secret to Happy Kids” (released already in Britain as “How to Raise a Viking”), observed in Denmark that children often take risks in their extensive outdoor play and are expected to resolve conflicts among themselves when they arise. Likewise, children speak for themselves and are expected to dress themselves (including the all-important snowsuit!) and feed themselves, rather than being told by adults what to say, what to wear and when and what to eat. Danish children, Russell told HuffPost, are allowed to pretty much “roam free,” and the same is true in other Nordic countries. “Icelandic children are all allowed to roam free until a state-sanctioned ‘curfew’ in the summer holidays, when Iceland enjoys 24-hour sun. So, come July, 13- to 16-year-olds are allowed to run wild until midnight, while children up to the age of 12 get to hang out until 10 p.m.,” she said. Letting children travel about, do chores and play without interference from adults can allow the adults more time to get their own work done and might seem to require less effort. Doucleff, however, noted that it’s not that parents are letting their children go unattended. “Adults keep a close eye to ensure kids are safe. So it’s not about simply doing less.” The key difference, she explained, is that “parents don’t interfere with children’s actions and movements, especially during play.” Kids, not adults, are the ones who truly reap the rewards of this dynamic. “Lack of autonomy is strongly associated with anxiety and depression,” Doucleff said, while “high levels of autonomy are linked to confidence, drive and all-around better mental health. In the communities I visited in ‘Hunt, Gather, Parent,’ children had these in spades.” Autonomy, she explained, “enables children to learn adult skills ... . So they can be active contributors to their families and not simply attended to by their parents.” We know that being able to contribute meaningfully can help kids feel a sense of mattering, which is protective of their mental health. Knowing that adults trust them to get from one place to another or use the kitchen knives helps them believe in their own abilities and gives them opportunities to “learn on their own, make mistakes on their own,” Hopgood said. Experience teaches them that they can figure things out for themselves and overcome challenges. Russell explained that all the outdoor play kids engage in in Denmark, in spite of frigid weather, also has a positive effect on their well-being. “Studies show that spending time outdoors improves well-being and cooperation, reduces stress, helps with concentration and evens out differences between low-achieving and high-achieving children,” she said. Hopgood, a journalism professor at Northwestern University, noted that here in the U.S. we are beginning to see the effect of a lack of independence once these children head off to college. “Students coming to university, [their] maturity and responsibility level is years below what they were some years ago. Because of many reasons, but parents have done so much for them.” Without practice, kids lack problem-solving skills and confidence in their ability to tackle challenges without their parents’ help. There’s no need to move all the way to Latin America or Scandinavia to help your kids learn independence. Some communities, by their design, are more conducive to kids’ autonomy than others, and some places are also simply safer. But even within the confines of your own home, there are steps you can take to encourage this growth. “It’s about having confidence in children’s ability to learn and grow at a young age without the need for constant interference from adults,” Doucleff said. Doucleff measured her own interference in her children’s lives by counting how many times per hour she gave them commands. (“Eat two more bites, please.” “Give me the ball.”) She initially found that this number was 120 — which is in line with what most kids experience in Western cultures. “In cultures with autonomous children, parents give only two to three commands per hour. So a hundred times fewer! It’s radically different than the approach that’s common in the U.S.,” she said. She encourages parents to use their cellphones to record their own interactions with their children and count the number of commands they are giving now and make a goal of getting that number down to three per hour. You can start slow, by having a low-command hour just once a day, perhaps at the playground. She also recommends that parents take some time to observe their children. “See what their interests are but also their skill level. Then you know when to back off and be confident that they’ve got the situation handled or when to jump in to help if they need it.” Focus on building up their independence in a specific domain by “teaching them skills they need to handle any dangers or problems that may arise in these environments,” such as using knives and electrical plugs, crossing streets or watching for cars. “Then schedule time in their week to simply be autonomous in these environments (without devices),” she said. You don’t have to start by letting them roam free all afternoon. Instead, you might begin by letting them walk home from school with a sibling or group of friends. If they’re interested in cooking, you could plan to let them make breakfast for themselves on Saturday mornings. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jetblue-spirit-airlines-end-proposed-merger-deal_n_65e5d1f9e4b0d2a2475a2f31,"JetBlue, Spirit Ending $3.8 Billion Merger Plan After Federal Judge Blocked Deal","david koenig, michelle chapman",3/4/2024,"JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines are ending their proposed $3.8 billion merger weeks after a federal judge blocked the deal, saying it would hurt consumers who depend on Spirit’s lower fares. JetBlue said Monday that even though both companies still believe in the deal, they were unlikely to meet the closing conditions required in the agreement before a July 24 deadline. JetBlue’s new CEO, Joanna Geraghty, called the merger “a bold and courageous plan intended to shake up the industry status quo” and speed JetBlue’s growth. “However, with the ruling from the federal court and the Department of Justice’s continued opposition, the probability of getting the green light to move forward with the merger anytime soon is extremely low,” Geraghty said in a memo to employees of New York airline. She said uncertainty over the merger’s fate was distracting the airline from its effort to return to profitability. Spirit CEO Ted Christie said he was disappointed that the airlines could not combine and create a new challenger to the nation’s four biggest airlines but said he is confident that Spirit — which has been losing money since the pandemic started — can succeed on its own. JetBlue will pay Spirit a $69 million termination fee. The Justice Department sued to block the merger last year, saying it would reduce competition and drive up fares, especially for travelers who depend on low-fare Spirit. In January, a federal district judge in Boston sided with the government and blocked the deal, saying it violated antitrust law. On Monday, the Justice Department took a victory lap. “Today’s decision by JetBlue is yet another victory for the Justice Department’s work on behalf of American consumers,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. “The Justice Department proved in court that a merger between JetBlue and Spirit would have caused tens of millions of travelers to face higher fares and fewer choices. We will continue to vigorously enforce the nation’s antitrust laws.” The airlines had appealed the ruling, and a hearing had been set for June in the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. The Biden administration’s Justice Department, which has fought against consolidation in several industries, previously killed a partnership between JetBlue and American Airlines on flights in New York and Boston. Spirit and Frontier Airlines announced a $2.2 billion merger in early 2022 — a deal that would have combined two similar carriers that charge lower fares than the big airlines but add on fees that generate a large chunk of their revenue. JetBlue jumped into the fray against the wishes of Spirit’s management, which warned that it would be difficult to win regulatory approval for a Spirit-JetBlue combination. JetBlue went over the heads of Spirit’s board, directly to Spirit’s shareholders, and won a bidding war against rival Frontier a few month later. While the deal was taking shape and wound up in court, there were continuing losses and other problems at Spirit, which is based in Miramar, Florida. In late January, JetBlue warned that it might terminate the agreement. The next four years will change America forever.

Activist investor Carl Icahn bought nearly 10% of JetBlue stock last month and won two seats on JetBlue’s board. The end of the JetBlue-Spirit deal raises questions about whether Alaska Airlines can pull off its proposed purchase of Hawaiian Airlines for $1 billion plus the assumption of about $900 million in debt. The Justice Department has not indicated whether it will sue to block that agreement. Shares of Spirit Airlines Inc. sank 16%, while shares of JetBlue Airways Corp. rose slightly.",NA,NA

The withering montage prompted conservative pundit Charlie Sykes, the former editor-in-chief of The Bulwark, to advise “bedwetting” Democrats on how to defeat the former president if, as is increasingly likely, he becomes the GOP nominee to take on President Joe Biden in November. “Well, what fresh hell?” Sykes responded to footage of Trump slurring, mispronouncing words, confusing Biden with former President Barack Obama and claiming a Taliban leader addressed him as “Your Highness.” Sykes acknowledged he’s “not a psychiatrist” but drew a sharp distinction between Biden who “is old” and Trump who is “deranged, demented and pathetic […] not to mention dangerous.” But Biden could use that to his advantage, the commentator suggested. Biden “will be able to say, ‘Yeah, I’m old, I’m very stiff when I walk, but this guy is also old and he’s crazy and he’s dangerous and he’s incoherent.’” Trump’s likely nomination will “focus the mind” among Democrats, he added, who he urged to “stop the bedwetting” and maybe “freak out a little bit.” “This could actually happen” he warned. “Maybe we ought to treat that threat the way it ought to be treated. If it’s an existential threat, let’s act like it is an existential threat. So, stop the bedwetting, but maybe a little freakout wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.” The next four years will change America forever.

There's Something You Should Know — And We Hope You're Prepared For This,am i doing it wrong?,3/4/2024,"Some things go perfectly together: Peanut butter and jelly. He-Man and She-Ra. Netflix and chill. And... dogs and petting, right? Not necessarily. Believe it or not, that’s what we — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, the co-hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — learned when we recently chatted with Dr. Emily Levine, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist and the owner of Animal Behavior Clinic of New Jersey. “Many dogs really don’t find being pet and hugged and kissed particularly nice — they just don’t enjoy it very much,” she told us. “There are some dogs — don’t get me wrong — that love a good butt scratch or when you first come home or they haven’t seen you in a while, because they’re so excited to see you, that may mask how they really feel about it... but when you really watch a dog’s body language when they’re hanging out and doing their own thing, most of them are just tolerating [being petted] at best. There are lots of dogs where, quite frankly, they get so frustrated and annoyed that they start to growl and say ‘Hey, please, back off! I’m really not enjoying this.’” Of course lots of furry friends do seem to enjoy physical affection, but if we’re dealing with a dog who doesn’t seem particularly enthused about it, should we refrain from doing it? “This is where we have a little bit of a culture clash — human culture and dog culture. We have dogs... we love them... and I would say if they’re tolerating it, and as long as they’re not aggressing or it’s [not] making them very anxious — tail tucked, ears back — if they’re tolerating it, it’s a little bit like hugging your kid, especially as they become more a teenager, you know? Sometimes it’s like, you’re just going to hug them and kiss them and they just have to put up with it. So I don’t think it’s a terrible thing to pet and hug and kiss your pet if they tolerate it.” So when shouldn’t we be doing it? “If it clearly makes them anxious or it they’re using aggression as a strategy to say, ‘STOP,’ Dr. Levine said. “If we ignore the early signs — the growl, let’s say — then the dogs sometimes feel they have to escalate their message. Fair enough, because we aren’t getting it.” Dr. Levine noted that hugging in particular can make dogs feel suffocated, so she suggested some alternative physical expressions of affection that might be better appreciated by your pet. ″[You can pet] the cheek and the chin... probably avoiding going along down the back... and you can keep it brief, too,” she said. Prioritizing the quality of your interactions over quantity might be the approach to take. “It’s a relationship we have with our dogs — there’s always give and take — so as long as [petting] is not the only thing you ever do with your dog, let’s make sure they’re getting time to play, or getting time to do things they find enjoyable.” So how do we determine what our dogs want — or don’t want? Dr. Levine advised that our best bet is to look at their body language. “They’re constantly telling us how they feel. We just have to learn how to read it. We’re not born knowing that — no dog owner should feel guilty about not knowing how to read their dog. But there are lots of resources — body language videos and other resources — where you can learn how they are communicating ... It’s the best thing really that a dog owner can do, to really get to know their dog, learn how they speak, because they’re speaking all the time.” We also chatted about the one thing every pet owner should do while walking their dog, whether or not it’s safe for a dog to sleep with us in our bed and much more.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/barbara-lee-katie-porter-california-senate-primary_n_65e50f3fe4b013678e15bf92,Progressives Trade Blame Ahead Of Likely Defeat In California Senate Primary,daniel marans,3/4/2024,"Barring a significant upset, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey, a former Major League Baseball star, are set to emerge from California’s top two “jungle” primaries on Tuesday as the finalists for the open U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein. The situation has left progressives nationally and in California frustrated, wondering how they will end up on the outside looking in at a Senate race in one of the nation’s bluest states. And the answer, to many, comes down to a long-standing failure of the left to consolidate around a single candidate in contested primaries. “In race after race after race, the left is penalized for lack of consolidation while more moderate Democrats end up having a lane all to themselves,” said Morris Katz, a progressive Democratic ad maker who is neutral in the California primary. The die is not cast yet: Some polling has Rep. Katie Porter, one of the two progressive candidates, within striking distance of Garvey. Rep. Barbara Lee, the other candidate, trails Porter by a wide margin. Schiff, an antagonist to former President Donald Trump and frequent presence on MSNBC, has taken advantage of the division to his left. He’s spent millions of dollars on advertisements elevating Garvey with attack ads aiming to improve Garvey’s standing among GOP voters. (Porter responded with a much smaller ad blitz of her own bolstering Eric Early, another Republican contender.) In heavily Democratic California, Schiff wanted to face a Republican in the general election over either of his more progressive rivals. Schiff’s placement as one of the top two vote getters in the Golden State’s unusual nonpartisan primary system virtually assures him Feinstein’s old seat. But the ideological implications of Schiff’s impending triumph ― a defeat for the progressive wing of the party ― have gotten less attention than Schiff’s tactics themselves. Although Schiff is a hardened partisan gladiator whose credentials with the Democratic faithful only got stronger when House Republicans censured him, he is not one of California’s many progressive champions. While Porter, a consumer attorney and protégée of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), has developed a national following for her white-board presentations exposing corporate malfeasance, Schiff is a member of the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition for whom economic policy has always been less of a concern than national security. And while Lee, a former Black Panther famous for casting the sole vote against the blanket authorization of war shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks, has campaigned loudly for a cease-fire to end Israel’s war in Gaza, Schiff is a staunch defender of Israel’s policies. Both the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC have endorsed him; DMFI PAC has also spent a modest sum promoting his bid in Jewish news outlets in California. “It would be a shame to not have two progressive senators represent us in the U.S. Senate ― someone that is very clear eyed about corporate greed, someone that also understands the housing crisis,” said state Assembly member Alex Lee, who is backing Porter. “That’s what’s at stake here.” After Schiff’s massive fundraising edge and decision to bolster Garvey, a familiar culprit emerges: Progressives’ failure to consolidate behind a single candidate, even as Schiff had the moderate Democratic lane all to himself. A similar dynamic played out in the crowded Democratic primaries in New York’s 10th Congressional District in August 2022, New York City’s mayoral race in June 2021, and Massachusetts’ 4th Congressional District in September 2020. But if progressives agree that they would be better off parrying Schiff’s Machiavellian maneuvers with one strong candidate, they disagree deeply on which of the two candidates deserves the support of a unified left. “It has been true since the very beginning that Porter is the most viable progressive against both Schiff and Garvey.” To some of Porter’s backers, the three-term Orange County Democrat would have been the obvious beneficiary of consolidation. These progressives argue that Porter simply had a better chance of making it to a runoff with Schiff. Porter has led Lee in polls from the start of the race, though not always by her current nine-point margin. And she has also far outpaced Lee in fundraising, bringing in more than $28 million to Lee’s $5 million (though still far short of the nearly $39 million that Schiff has spent). In California, a 39 million-person state with some of the most expensive media markets in the country, flush campaign coffers are a prerequisite for competing. The fundraising gap was predictable: Porter had built a dedicated online fan base with 1.2 million followers on her official side account on X and 635,000 followers on her campaign account, compared with Lee’s 322,000 followers on her official side account on X and 72,000 followers on her campaign account. Having always run in a safe Democratic seat over decades in Congress, Lee was a relatively weak fundraiser, bringing in $2.2 million in the 2022 election cycle, compared to the $26 million Porter raised in her swing seat. “Porter is one of the best chances we have to get a Warren/Sanders-caliber figure into the Senate for decades to come,” said a national progressive strategist, who requested anonymity to protect professional relationships. “Lee deserves great credit for much of her work, and took that extraordinarily courageous vote in 2001, but it is clear that she isn’t going to make the top two.” “The left is now broad enough that it can win elections, but as it has grown, it hasn’t shrugged off its tendency to self-cannibalize,” the national progressive strategist added. What’s more, Porter’s allies believe that the combination of her brand of pro-consumer populism, and Schiff’s status as a hardened Democratic partisan, could make her appealing to enough independents and even Republicans to defeat Schiff in November. “It has been true since the very beginning that Porter is the most viable progressive against both Schiff and Garvey,” Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Porter. But Assembly member Lee, a Porter ally, declined to call for Rep. Lee to withdraw from the race and endorse Porter. Among other reasons, he is not sure that Lee’s supporters are natural pickups for Porter. The idea of Porter and Lee splitting the progressive vote is “a very convenient and reductive narrative that I don’t see bearing out in the data,” Assembly member Lee said. Indeed, polling data do not definitively demonstrate that Rep. Lee’s voters would break for Porter enough to propel Porter into the top two. A late January poll conducted by the University of Southern California found that Schiff was the second choice candidate of 51% of Lee’s voters, compared with 23% for Porter. Meanwhile, 66% of Porter’s voters cited Schiff as their second choice, compared with 12% who would vote for Lee. In addition, many Black voters are supporting Lee, a Black woman, out of affinity for her as a person, rather than because of their progressive ideology. Lee was getting the support of 28% of Black voters, compared to 19% for Schiff and 12% for Porter, according to a Morning Consult/Politico poll in December. At the same time, Porter and Lee do have stronger appeal than Schiff among progressives, according to a Berkeley/LA Times poll out on Friday. Two-thirds of Lee supporters and 58% of Porter supporters said it was “very important” to vote for a candidate who is “progressive in politics,” compared to 44% of Schiff voters who felt the same, the survey found. And California’s progressive attorney general, Rob Bonta, issued a dual endorsement of Lee and Porter. “Do I think Katie Porter has a better chance to make the runoff if Barbara Lee drops out? Yes,” Katz said. “Do I think Barbara Lee, who’s been a loyal advocate for the left for decades, should be pressured to drop out? No.” “She is the proven progressive candidate – the first one to call for a cease-fire, the first one to call for Donald Trump’s impeachment, and the only woman of color in the race.” Katz’s response exemplifies a challenge for Porter proponents: Lee’s status as a progressive icon makes many Democrats reluctant to cast doubts on her viability. To make matters more complicated, Lee’s supporters believe that she has had a harder time fundraising because of her identity as a Black woman and her representation of a lower-earning constituency in the East Bay Area. “It’s hard as an African-American woman representing Oakland to fundraise,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, a Silicon Valley Democrat backing Lee. “This is why we have so few African-American senators and so few African-American women in statewide office.” “There was hope that more progressives would rally around her,” he added. Asked to respond to the idea that she might drop out and endorse Porter, Lee’s campaign pointed to the support she has received from every constitutional statewide official in California to weigh in the race, the mayors of Los Angeles and San Francisco, Democratic clubs and grassroots activists across California, and a diverse array of outside groups that includes the Congressional Black Caucus and the progressive organization, Our Revolution. “She is the proven progressive candidate ― the first one to call for a cease-fire, the first one to call for Donald Trump’s impeachment, and the only woman of color in the race,” Isabel Naturman, a spokesperson for the Lee campaign, said in a statement. “Her lived experience is shared by multi-ethnic, cross-cultural coalition of Californians, including young voters, the LGBTQ+ community, and Latino and Black communities, who back her unparalleled record of advocating for and delivering on behalf of their needs.” Karen Bernal, a Lee supporter and former chair of the California Democratic Party’s progressive caucus, argued that, if anything, Porter should have dropped out of the race and endorsed Lee. Porter’s decision to vacate California’s 47th Congressional District, which Porter carried by three percentage points in 2022, also puts a key House swing seat at risk, Bernal maintained. “We’re going to lose that seat on top of it all,” she predicted. Porter’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the demand that she drop out and endorse Lee. Progressive outrage over Israel’s war in Gaza has fueled the passion of Lee supporters like Bernal. She supported Lee from the moment she entered the race, but now more than anything, she is inspired by Lee’s support for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza. “Currently, it is the primary issue,” she said. Lee came out for a permanent cease-fire in mid-October and has since made it a central focus of her campaign. For his part, Schiff has echoed the Israeli government’s insistence that calls for a cease-fire undermine its right to defend itself against Hamas, following the group’s massacre of nearly 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7. “I don’t see how people can call on Israel to permanently cease-fire while a terrorist organization is controlling Gaza and threatening to attack them in the manner of Oct. 7 over and over and over again,” he told the Jewish News Syndicate in late February. Porter has landed somewhere in between Lee and Schiff on Israel-Palestine policy. She came out in favor of a “lasting bilateral cease-fire” in December that included the Palestinian militant group Hamas’s release of all Israeli hostages. J Street PAC, a liberal pro-Israel group that has had its own difficulty balancing concerns about Israel’s security with the Jewish state’s failure to protect Palestinian civilians, has endorsed all three Democratic Senate candidates. But tellingly, only Porter advertises the group’s endorsement on her campaign website. “Not voting for Porter in the first round means that the general election in the biggest state won’t include anybody who’s remotely concerned about the suffering of Gazans,” said the national progressive strategist. Of course, progressives might have been more apt to unify behind either Porter or Lee, if a deep-pocketed and influential outside group had stepped in for one of the two contenders. “If this ends up being a Schiff-Garvey general election, it will both be true that progressives should have consolidated and women’s groups should have done more to prevent that outcome,” Green said. The absence of EMILY’s List, which provides critical funding and campaign infrastructure for pro-choice Democratic women candidates, from the race is especially notable.

The actor, who plays Riddler in the Matt Reeves-directed movie, weighed in on the concept after recent films such as “Madame Web,” “The Marvels” and “The Flash” had less-than-super outings at the box office. “There are enough comic book movies where you just know what you’re gonna get,” Dano told The Independent. “Reading the script for The Batman, you knew it was a real film. Every sentence… that’s just [writer/director] Matt Reeves.” Dano, whose “Love & Mercy” performance helped inspire Reeves to write Riddler with the actor in mind, added that the fatigue has led to what he called an “interesting moment” where people ask, “OK — what now?” “Hopefully from that, somebody either breathes new life into [comic book movies], or something else blossoms which is not superheroes. I’m sure there will still be some good ones yet to come, but I think it’s kind of a welcome moment,” he said. The actor continued, “It’s a larger thing, too. As soon as the word ‘content’ came into what we do — meaning-making movies or TV — it meant quantity over quality, which I think was a big misstep. And I certainly don’t need that as a viewer or as an artist.” Reeves — in an interview with The Guardian last year — revealed that Dano “loves doing a lot of takes,” including in the final scene of “The Batman,” which he said took two days where he had “easily done 70 to 80 takes” between him and co-star Robert Pattinson. “There were all these moments as the Riddler where he’d be tickled by something and then fly into a rage, and you never knew from take to take where that switch would come,” Reeves explained.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/apple-fine-european-union_n_65e5c3bbe4b0f890593363f9,Apple Fined Nearly $2 Billion By EU For Hindering Music Streaming Competition,kelvin chan,3/4/2024,"LONDON (AP) — The European Union leveled its first antitrust penalty against Apple on Monday, fining the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion for unfairly favoring its own music streaming service by forbidding rivals like Spotify from telling users how they could pay for cheaper subscriptions outside of iPhone apps. Apple muzzled streaming services from telling users about payment options available through their websites, which would avoid the 30% fee charged when people pay through apps downloaded with the iOS App Store, said the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer. “This is illegal. And it has impacted millions of European consumers who were not able to make a free choice as to where, how and at what price to buy music streaming subscriptions,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said at a news conference in Brussels. Apple — which contests the decision — behaved this way for a decade, resulting in “millions of people who have paid two, three euros more per month for their music streaming service than they would otherwise have had to pay,” she said. It’s the culmination of a bitter, yearslong feud between Apple and Spotify over music streaming supremacy. A complaint from the Swedish streaming service five years ago triggered the investigation that led to the 1.8 billion-euro ($1.95 billion) fine. The decision comes the same week new rules take effect to prevent tech giants from cornering digital markets. The EU has led global efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies, including three fines for Google totaling more than 8 billion euros, charging Meta with distorting the online classified ad market and forcing Amazon to change its business practices. Apple’s fine is so high because it includes an extra lump sum to deter it from offending again or other tech companies from carrying out similar offenses, the commission said. It’s not the only penalty that the tech giant could face: Apple is still trying to resolve a separate EU antitrust investigation into its mobile payments service by promising to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment system to rivals. Apple hit back at the commission and Spotify, saying it would appeal Monday’s fine. “The decision was reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,” the company said in a statement. It said Spotify stood to benefit from the EU’s move, asserting that the Swedish streaming giant met over 65 times with the commission during the investigation, holds a 56% share of Europe’s music streaming market and doesn’t pay Apple for using its App Store. “Ironically, in the name of competition, today’s decision just cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is the digital music market’s runaway leader,” Apple said. Spotify said it welcomed the EU fine, without addressing Apple’s accusations. “This decision sends a powerful message — no company, not even a monopoly like Apple, can wield power abusively to control how other companies interact with their customers,” Spotify said in a blog post. The commission’s investigation initially centered on two concerns. One was the iPhone maker’s practice of forcing app developers selling digital content to use its in-house payment system, which charges a 30% commission on all subscriptions. Those fees have turned into a significant part of Apple’s service’s division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company’s last fiscal year ending in September. Various legal and regulatory developments threatening to undercut the Apple’s commissions from the App Store have been weighing on the company’s stock, which has fallen by about 10% so far this year amid a broader market rally in the tech sector. Apple’s shares dropped 3% in Monday afternoon in the U.S. But the EU later pivoted its focus to concentrate on how Apple prevents app makers from telling their users about cheaper ways to pay for subscriptions that don’t involve going through an app. The investigation found that Apple banned streaming services from telling users about how much subscription offers cost outside of their apps, putting links in their apps to pay for alternative subscriptions or even emailing users to tell them about different pricing options. “As a result, millions of European music streaming users were left in the dark about all available options,” Vestager said, adding that the commission’s investigation found that just over 20% of consumers who would have signed up to Spotify’s premium service didn’t do so because of the restrictions. The fine comes just before new EU rules are set to kick in that are aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital markets. The Digital Markets Act, due to take effect Thursday, imposes a set of do’s and don’ts on “gatekeeper” companies including Apple, Meta, Google parent Alphabet, and TikTok parent ByteDance — under threat of hefty fines.

Apple has already revealed how it will comply, including allowing iPhone users in Europe to use app stores other than its own and enabling developers to offer alternative payment systems. Vestager warned that the commission would be carefully scrutinizing how Apple follows the new rules. “Apple will have to open its gates to its ecosystem to allow users to easily find the apps they want, pay for them in any way they want and use them on any device that they want,” she said.

In a new video shared on social media Sunday, Stiefler challenged a “Trump 2024 Or Before”-banner carrying North Carolina woman over her false claim that Trump is still the president. “I believe he is,” she told Stiefler. When Stiefler noted that President Joe Biden is in the White House, the woman attacked former President Barack Obama as “calling the shots on all this mess” in the world. The pair went back and forth. Stiefler sought clarifications, and the woman insisted Obama was actually pulling the strings. Biden is “a bumbling fool right now,” she added. Then came Stiefler’s damning question: “But why would it matter if Obama was telling Biden what to do if Biden is not president?” The woman paused, then asked him to “say that again.” Stiefler repeated the question. The woman couldn’t answer, and the clip ended. Yesterday in North Carolina we heard that Trump is still president but that Obama is in charge. pic.twitter.com/jnmJCOBXdm The video has garnered more than 700,000 views alone on X, formerly Twitter.

Eric Swalwell Spots Sign GOP’s Biden Impeachment Inquiry Is Truly A Fail,josephine harvey,3/4/2024,"Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) spotted a sign that Republicans’ impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden might be dead in the water. “That’s all she wrote, folks. Even crazy Tomi Lahren thinks this thing is over,” he tweeted, sharing a clip of the right-wing commentator on Fox News. “As somebody who does believe there’s plenty of evidence here, I think that this has failed optically for Republicans,” Lahren, a contributor to the network, told “MediaBuzz” host Howard Kurtz on Sunday of the impeachment probe. “They’ve done good work ... but optically, it does make it seem as though they’re beating up on someone with addiction issues,” she added, referring to the intense focus on the president’s son, Hunter Biden. She encouraged Republicans to focus on the election instead. “This impeachment inquiry, unfortunately, is falling flat with a lot of viewers and voters,” she said.

The investigation has unraveled in recent weeks, leaving its fate up in the air after one of Republicans’ key sources in the probe was charged with lying to the FBI about the Bidens.

Lisa Murkowski Says She ‘Could Not Vote’ For GOP Front-Runner Donald Trump,marita vlachou,3/4/2024,"Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on Saturday said she’s not prepared to vote for former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican presidential primary, as she urged voters not to give up on his rival Nikki Haley’s candidacy. In a phone interview with NBC News, Murkowski, who endorsed the former South Carolina governor on Friday, said she refuses to accept that the two main options available for Americans to choose from this November will be Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden. “I could not” cast a vote for Trump, Murkowski, a frequent critic of the former president, told NBC’s Ali Vitali. “I can’t vote for Biden,” she added. Murkowski also called on voters who share her desire to avoid another Trump-Biden rematch to give Haley a chance. “It’s not just a situation where Nikki is the lesser of the evils,” Murkowski said. “She is a qualified, competent, capable leader at a time when the country needs them.” Haley on Sunday scored her first win in the GOP contest, defeating Trump in the Washington, D.C. primary, also becoming the first woman in U.S. history to win a GOP primary. However, Trump over the weekend won the caucuses in Missouri and Idaho and received all 39 delegates from a party convention in Michigan, further solidifying his position as the front-runner in the race. Alaska, Murkowski’s home state, is holding its primary on Super Tuesday along with 14 other states for Republicans. Haley has previously pledged to stay in the race through at least Super Tuesday. Asked if she was prepared to stay in the contest through the Republican National Convention in July, Haley told NBC’s “Meet The Press” Sunday: “If the people want to see me go forward, they’ll show it. They’ll show it in their votes, they’ll show it in their donations.” Murkowski said she wouldn’t know how to proceed if Haley chose to drop out.

(Watch the video below.) In the umpteenth regurgitation of lies that he was denied victory through fraud, the criminally indicted former president told supporters in North Carolina Saturday that a whopping share of the electorate agrees with him. “What happened at that last election is a disgrace, and we’re not going to let it happen again,” the GOP front-runner said ahead of Super Tuesday’s slate of primaries that includes North Carolina. “Did you ever notice they go after the people that want to find out where the cheating was — and, by the way, 82% of the country understands that it was a rigged election, OK? You can’t have a country with that.” “A poll came out, 82% ― but they go after the people — they don’t go after the people that rigged the election — they go after the people that looking, they’re looking for the people that rigged the election,” he continued. “And that’s the people they go after. They got away with something; they’re never going to get away with it again.” The only polls that appear to even remotely correspond to the numbers Trump blathered on about are referring to conservatives only. Not the country. A May 2023 Rasmussen poll found that 84% of those who voted for Trump believed it’s “likely the outcome was affected by cheating.” And according to a 2021 Public Religion Research Institute poll cited by the conservative Washington Examiner, 82% of “Republicans who most trust Fox News” either “completely agree” or “mostly agree” that Trump was robbed of victory.

(AP) — A group of men in masks opened fire at an outdoor party in central California, killing four people and injuring three others Sunday evening, police said. Police responded to a reported shooting around 6 p.m. in King City and found three men with gunshot wounds who were pronounced dead in a front yard, the King City Police Department said in a statement. Four other people sustained gunshot wounds, including a woman who died after being transported to Mee Memorial Hospital in King City, about 106 miles (170 kilometers) south of San Jose. The three injured men were transported to Natividad Hospital in Salinas, police said. Several people were at the party outside a residence when three men with dark masks and clothes got out of a silver car and fired at the group. The suspects, who were not immediately identified, then fled the scene in the car. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colorectal-cancer-prevention_l_65e1e971e4b013678e14fae7,I'm A Colorectal Cancer Doctor. Here Are 5 Things I'd Never Do.,julia ries,3/4/2024,"Colorectal cancer is the third-most common type of cancer around the world. In the earlier stages, it can be tough to catch. The symptoms, like diarrhea, abdominal pain and anemia, can easily be overlooked or mistaken for another, more benign issue. There’s also been a spike in colorectal cancer diagnoses among younger people. The reason for this, though unclear, is likely multifactorial, with genes, environmental exposures and lifestyle all contributing. What we do know is that when colon cancer is caught early, it can be effectively treated. Fortunately, there’s a lot you can do to keep your bowel health in check. We asked Dr. Ursina Teitelbaum, a medical oncologist and section chief for gastrointestinal cancers at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center, about the most common mistakes worth avoiding for the sake of your bowels. Here’s what Teitelbaum said she personally avoids, and what you should, too: Family history is one of the strongest risk factors for colorectal cancer. Up to 1 in 3 people who get diagnosed with colorectal cancer have family members who also had it. There are a few reasons why cancer runs in families: genetics, shared environmental factors, and some combination of the two, according to the American Cancer Society. Because the health of your relatives directly influences your individual risk of colon cancer, it’s crucial to know your family history. Teitelbaum recommended asking your parents, siblings or other relatives if any family members, including grandparents, cousins, or aunts and uncles, were ever diagnosed with colorectal cancer. If you find out a first-degree relative had colon cancer, for example, you’ll be advised to start screening earlier. “Your colon health depends on your genes,” Teitelbaum said. Cases of colorectal cancer have been rapidly increasing among young adults. Though the disease, which affects fewer than 1% of adults, is still rare, the spike in incidence has made early screening and diagnosis all the more important. Because of this alarming trend, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued new colon cancer screening guidance in 2021 to try to catch more cases. Now, all adults are advised to starting screening by a colonoscopy or stool-based test starting at age 45. Regular colonoscopies are especially important for people with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, since these conditions can increase your risk of colorectal cancer. But even otherwise healthy people who have no family history can get colorectal cancer. “No matter how healthy your lifestyle is, when you hit a certain age, you need to get screened,” Teitelbaum said. Getting screened is the best way to catch colon cancer early and treat it. Doctors across the country have noticed that many younger adults don’t think their abnormal symptoms could be cancer, Teitelbaum said. And because they’re so young, health care providers may not immediately suspect issues either. This can lead to delayed diagnoses and poorer outcomes, research shows. The takeaway? You have to pay attention to your body, Teitelbaum stressed. Look out for any changes in bowel habits ― if you have always pooped on schedule but now frequently feel constipated, or notice blood in your stool and have abdominal pain, it’s worth talking to a doctor. Diarrhea, fatigue or unexplained anemia also warrants a medical checkup. It’s important to advocate for yourself. If you feel like your doctor isn’t taking your symptoms serious, go get a second opinion. “If you’re really worried, you need to persist,” Teitelbaum said. Though the causes of colon cancer are poorly understood, over half of colorectal cancers are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors. Smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol and having a sedentary lifestyle are thought to go hand in hand with a heightened risk of colon cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Your diet also plays a big role. Red meats and overly processed foods, such as soda, candy and cookies, have been linked to a higher risk of colon cancer, whereas vegetables, fruits and whole grains have been associated with a lower risk. “There’s no perfect predictor for colon cancer, but globally, a healthy lifestyle may help” in avoiding it, Teitelbaum said. Finally, Teitelbaum recommended getting comfortable with talking about poop. The more we open up about the topic, the better we can break down the stigma around discussing it.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/first-born-daughter-study_l_65e0d429e4b005b858337e67,Is 'Eldest Daughter Syndrome' A Real Thing? A New Study May Surprise You.,brittany wong,3/4/2024,"Growing up as the oldest sibling, author Y.L. Wolfe often felt the lines between her role and her mother’s role were blurred. “By the time my youngest brother was born when I was almost 11, I was overwhelmed with feelings of responsibility for his welfare. I used to sit by his crib and watch him sleep just to make sure he was safe,” Wolfe, the oldest of four, told HuffPost. “It wasn’t that I thought my mother wasn’t competent ― but more that I felt we were both responsible for the family by that point in my life,” she explained. “As if I was literally ‘other mom,’ rather than big sister.” In other words, Wolfe is deeply familiar with “eldest daughter syndrome.” The internet is rife with thinkpieces about the plight of oldest daughters and tweets about how we ― I might as well reveal my bias here ― need to unionize: “If you are the oldest sibling and also a girl you may be entitled to financial compensation,” one woman joked on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Though “eldest daughter syndrome” is a pop psychology term ― you won’t find it listed as an official diagnosis in the DSM-V ― a new study suggests that there may be more science to the pseudo-syndrome than previously thought. A University of California, Los Angeles-led research team found that, in certain instances, first-born daughters tend to mature earlier, enabling them to help their mother rear younger siblings. Specifically, the researchers found a correlation between early signs of adrenal puberty in first-born daughters and their mothers having experienced high levels of prenatal stress. Why does age of adrenal puberty matter? Changes in skin (acne, for instance) and body hair happen during this phase, but so do changes in brain development. Adrenal puberty processes are believed to foster social and cognitive changes; basically, superficial physical changes correlate with emotional maturity. When times are tough and mothers are stressed in pregnancy, it’s in the mother’s adaptive best interest for her daughter to socially mature at a quicker pace, said Jennifer Hahn-Holbrook, one of the co-authors of the study and an assistant professor of psychology at the University of California, Merced. “It gives mom a ‘helper-at-the-nest’ sooner, aiding the women in keeping the latter offspring alive in difficult environments,” she said. Notably, adrenal puberty does not include breast development or the onset of menstruation for girls (or testicular enlargement, in the case of boys). The study posits that girls become mentally mature enough to care for their younger siblings while not being physically capable of having their own children, which would naturally draw them away from their older daughter responsibilities. Older brothers are seemingly off the hook when it comes to this kind of parentification: The researchers did not find the same result in boys or daughters who were not first-born. “One reason that we didn’t find this effect in first-born children who are sons could be that male children help less often with direct childcare than female children do, so mothers have less of an adaptive incentive to speed their social pubertal development,” Hahn-Holbrook explained. Plus, she said, previous research suggests that female puberty timing is more malleable in response to early life experiences than males. The results of this study, published in the February issue of Psychoneuroendocrinology (say that five times fast ― or just once), were a long time coming: Researchers tracked the families for 15 years, from the pregnancy stage to the babies’ teen years. Researchers recruited women from two obstetric clinics in Southern California during routine first trimester prenatal care visits. On average, the women were 30 years of age and pregnant with one child, not twins. It was their first pregnancy for roughly half of the participants. The women were nonsmoking and not using steroid medications, tobacco, alcohol or other recreational drugs during pregnancy. They were all over 18 years of age. At five different stages of pregnancy, the women’s stress, depression and anxiety levels were measured, and then measured cumulatively. The depression assessment asked the women to rate the truth of statements such as “I felt lonely,” while the anxiety question asked how often they felt particular symptoms, such as “jittery.” Of the children born to these mothers, 48% were female and 52% were male. As the children aged, characteristics of adrenal and gonadal puberty were separately measured ― things like body hair, skin changes, growth in height or growth spurts, breast development and the onset of menstruation in females and voice changes and facial hair growth in males. The study also measured childhood adversity to account for other factors known to correlate to early maturation or signs of puberty in children, like the death of a parent or divorce before age 5 and the absence of a father and economic uncertainties at ages 7–9. Taking all that into account, it was the eldest girls who matured the fastest when their moms experienced high levels of prenatal stress. Other studies suggest that there is some later-in-life payoff for highly responsible eldest girls: A 2014 study found that eldest daughters are the most likely to succeed out of any sibling type, while a 2012 study found that those who are eldest-born are more likely to hold leadership roles. The findings ring true for Wolfe, the aforementioned author who said she felt like a second mom to her siblings growing up. “I’m not at all surprised by what the study found,” Wolfe said. “My story is slightly different — I went through true puberty, not just adrenal puberty, at 12, though I suspect I experienced an early cognitive maturation.” The study is interesting for another reason as well: The findings add to social scientists’ growing understanding of fetal programming, a fascinating area of study that explores how stress and other emotional and environmental factors women experience during pregnancy affect their children long after birth. “This is a first-of-its-kind finding and is fascinating to look at through an evolutionary lens,” Molly Fox, a UCLA anthropologist and one of the co-authors of the study, said in a press release. In an interview with HuffPost, Fox delved deeper into how fetal programming works. “One fascinating theory is that when you’re still a fetus in your mothers’ womb, you get cues about what the world is going to be like, and your body can flexibly adjust the shape of your life-cycle to be optimally suited to those conditions you expect to encounter,” she said. Fox and her co-authors are excited their work is out there for the public to read, especially after following the families along for so long. The fact that the findings were published just as a cultural conversation about eldest daughters broke out was just a cherry on top, especially for Fox, a co-oldest daughter. (She’s a twin.)

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-nipples-get-hard-cold_l_65e0bda5e4b005b858336e6b,So THAT'S Why Your Nipples Get Hard When It's Cold,kelsey borresen,3/4/2024,"Exposure to cold temperatures can affect the body in a number of ways, like making your teeth chatter or cheeks redden. But have you ever wondered why nippy weather perks up your nipples? It’s not just a winter phenomenon — it can also happen in warmer times of year, like when the air conditioning is on full blast. So what exactly is occurring in the body when nipples become erect? The physiological process that leads to hardened nipples when cold is also what causes goose bumps (known medically as piloerections), dermatologist Dr. Joshua Zeichner told HuffPost. “This response is beyond our control and is a result of our bodies’ automated reactions to the environment,” said Zeichner, an associate professor of dermatology at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Essentially, a drop in temperature triggers your sympathetic nervous system, which is behind the fight-or-flight response and other involuntary bodily functions. This process activates specialized nerve cells controlling the erectile muscles that cause hard nipples and goose bumps, according to a 2016 study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. “When the body feels cold, the sympathetic nervous system contracts tiny arrector pili muscles, which are attached to hair follicles,” explained dermatologist Dr. Aanand Geria of Geria Dermatology in New Jersey. This creates goose bumps and makes the hair on your body stand upright. “In the case of nipples, it contracts the specialized smooth muscles,” Geria added. “This contraction pulls on the skin, erecting the nipple.” As for why this occurs, it’s one way that the body tries to retain heat in cold weather. The muscles beneath the skin contract “to trap the warm air near the skin and lose less heat from radiation coming off your skin,” plastic surgeon Dr. Michelle Lee told the outlet Shape. For mammals, including humans, “regulating core body temperature within a small range is crucial for survival,” Geria explained. The reflex that causes goose bumps (and nipple erections) in the cold is not so useful for humans today, but would have been quite important for our ancestors. Back when we were a much hairier species, having all of your body hair stand up helped with insulation — not to mention that it could make you look larger to ward off predators.

Nipples can become erect for other reasons unrelated to the cold, such as sexual arousal, tactile stimulation (like when they rub against your shirt), hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle, pregnancy or breastfeeding, and even “emotional responses like fear or excitement,” Geria said. Most of the time, hard nipples are just a normal bodily response to a number of different stimuli, he noted — but if you’re seeing “persistent or extreme erection unrelated to temperature or excitement,” then it could be indicative of a health problem. Also, if you’re experiencing pain with nipple erections or any type of discharge, it’s worth talking to your health care provider to rule out any underlying issues.

Sign up here for weekly book news, author interviews and more. It’s an impactful thing to see yourself — and the struggles you deeply feel — reflected on television screens and in the pages of books. Michael Arceneaux, a Black gay man who grew up in the South in what he describes as a difficult childhood, said he couldn’t see himself the way so many others could, especially in media dominated by the straight, white and financially comfortable. In Arceneaux’s collection of essays and other writings — a loosely connected series that will be complete with a third installment, “I Finally Bought Some Jordans,” in March — he describes wanting a kind of representation that goes beyond just Black or just queer, but rather a full-fledged and complex existence that everyone can and should find themselves in. In his first book, “I Can’t Date Jesus,” Arceneaux discusses what it was like to reconcile what he was taught to believe about homosexuality in an overtly religious household, and who he knew himself to be. Using candid, moving and hilarious prose, he explores how to still have a close relationship with his mother while also not completely agreeing on some of those fundamental beliefs. But it wasn’t easy to get to this point, according to the author. From very early on Arceneaux said there was some doubt about how commercially viable books written by someone Black and gay would be. As a result, he said he still experiences financial instability, amid inequities within the publishing industry and an on-going inability to shake some of the generational struggles that have and continue to impact Black men, like financial instability which he candidly explores in his second book, “I Don’t Want to Die Poor.” Despite all of this, Arceneaux’s persistence and dedication to the craft of engaging storytelling has managed to heal and bring together some unlikely audiences. I had the opportunity to discuss all of this with Arceneaux ahead of this upcoming book release, “I Finally Bought Some Jordans,” which will be released on March 12. Can you tell us a little bit about what readers can expect from “I Finally Bought Some Jordans” and how it relates to your other books? It’s more of a broader collection of essays than my other two books. There are similar themes of family and identity, but it’s focusing on the chaos of the last couple of years. I write a lot about the pandemic and grief and being impacted by death. I talk about suicidal ideation [and] losing friends to suicide. I try to make sense of how life’s not exactly turning out how I thought it would, even with all of the hard work and certain accomplishments, [while] still trying to maintain a sense of hope. I think a lot of other people are kind of secretly carrying a lot of pain and frustration or grief and still trying to process that pandemic. I hope I can give people some kind of comfort like no, you’re not crazy or alone, these are valid feelings. I think one of the things that you do so well is you write about these universal human experiences in a very relatable way that makes us all feel seen. Is this something that you intended for your writing to achieve? My intent with my work in writing or in anything is to make people laugh, make people think, and to also create nuanced narratives about people like me. And when I say people like me, that’s working class, Southern Black, that’s anyone coming from religious backgrounds. And fundamentally, I just didn’t want people to feel as alone, as I often have. In “I Don’t Want To Die Poor,” specifically, I write about private student loans and how they impacted every facet of my life. Private loans are disproportionately impacting a lot of Black college graduates and students, so I wanted to talk about what it’s like to have that financial insecurity. Another goal that I had was … particularly in publishing, to make it easier for people to see the commercial viability in stories that they don’t necessarily usually value monetarily and not on equal footing as often their white counterparts. Is that something then that you think would improve circumstances for minorities in the media and literary world? To make content like yours more mainstream and conventional? I do, honestly. I think a lot of us would be a lot better off if we really truly engaged with works that are created by people who are not like them because you can learn a lot from different types of people. When I’ve spoken on platforms like NPR and PBS, yes, I got so many messages from young queer black men or boys like happy to see someone like me speaking the way I do to them, and being comfortable in my own skin. But it’s also been very nice to get emails from nice white women in Maine or Vermont, saying they related to my story or, they didn’t get my references, but they Google[d] them, which is what I do when I read something from a white author or something I don’t know. I think smart is smart, funny is funny and a good story is a good story, so to say that my books only appeal to just Black people or queer people is really limiting. This country is truly segregated by design, in terms of class and race, so we don’t really get to interact as much as they make it seem on certain TV shows and films. So for me to be in these different types of spaces that you wouldn’t expect me to be in, and to speak the way that I do, and be very comfortable in my own skin [to] tell my story, is important because I write about things that are problems that we all share. *** You can shop Arceneaux’s works for yourself and pre-order a copy of “I Finally Bought Some Jordans” or keep scrolling to see some of his favorite Black-authored books that have served as personal inspiration for the author and can be vital reading for you.

But what if the real solution can be found in the hardware store? Have you ever noticed a change in the way your skin or hair looks and feels when you have showered someplace other than your home? Surprise! It could very likely be the water conditions that made a difference. These days, beautifying water filter ads come at us from every direction on social media, claiming to clear up your skin and add shine to your hair under a fancy new (and sometimes expensive) showerhead. So we wanted to know if experts thinks they really make a difference. Scientific research and water testing in the United States provides evidence that the water we shower with may contain contaminants that adversely affect the health of your skin, hair and potentially your overall health, particularly related to the amount of chlorine in the water along with other bacteria, chemicals and minerals. Angela Stiegler, a water infrastructure scientist, added that “although the water that arrives at your home from your local utility is safe to drink, in some cases, an at-home filtration system can be beneficial for your skin and hair because some water sources have more ‘hardness’ than others. Hard water contains more calcium and magnesium minerals than ‘soft’ water.” According to Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group (EWG) who researches contaminants in water, “Hard water, or water that contains higher levels of calcium or magnesium, can cause skin dryness or cause skin to be more sensitive.” In a previously reported HuffPost story, Dr. Brandon Kirsch, a board-certified dermatologist at Kirsch Dermatology in Naples, Florida, confirmed that hard water “can have cosmetic and dermatological effects, such as drying out hair and skin or exacerbating conditions like eczema. ... Chlorine and hard water minerals can also strip away natural oils from your hair, leaving it looking dull, and chlorine in particular can cause colored hair to fade faster.” Hard water can make shampoos, conditioners and cleansers “less effective and react with those products to form mineral build-up, which might irritate some people’s skin,” Stiegler added. “You’ll notice that if you have hard water at home, you can’t get as much lather or sudsiness with shampoos and cleansers, and your hair or skin just doesn’t feel as clean.” If you’re wondering about the state of the water coming out of your own shower or sink faucets, you can check the water contaminants in your area at www.ewg.org. You can also check the hardness of your water with home testing kits, which allow you to test water from multiple sources in your home. Solutions range from whole house systems to more affordable and “portable” systems for those who may not be homeowners. Let’s get into the different kinds of filters, what they remove and their efficacies. Studies have shown that charcoal is effective in removing chlorine, heavy metals and organic pollutants from water, and an activated charcoal system is a good option if you are a renter and not investing in something long-term. Charcoal water filters can be found in showerheads and showerhead filters, which attach between the wall spout and your current showerhead. A true filter, like the AquaYouth 2.0 filter ($60), fits 99.9% of showerheads, including hand-held units. It’s important to note that regular maintenance and filter replacement is required with a charcoal system ― filters need to be replaced about every six months. If you opt for a showerhead with the filter integrated, Canopy ($150) has a high rating of 4.8 stars. Canopy recommends filter replacements (which cost $65 for a two-pack) every 90 days. Your other option is a whole-house filtration system, like a reverse osmosis system, which can run you thousands of dollars and can use up to four times the amount of water than you’d use without a system, due to pushing so much water through the system in the filtration process. This can also reduce the water pressure in your faucets. The bottom line is that if you have hard water and can’t get your hair and skin products to work well, experts agree it’s worth giving water filtration a try. And luckily, that can be done by something as simple as trying a new showerhead. Take a look at the options below to find one for your budget.

Making tender, nutty-tasting brown rice takes one little trick that costs zero pennies. The step that is so important, and often overlooked, is simple: just take the pan off the heat and let the cooked rice sit, covered, for about 10 minutes to finish steaming. This also applies to other whole grains, like farro, wheat berries and sorghum. I wanted to find out the science behind what’s going on in that pot, so I asked Cameron Jacobs of the USA Rice Federation. “Brown rice has the nutritious and hearty bran layer surrounding the endosperm intact. The act of allowing it to sit covered allows the brown rice kernels to absorb additional moisture from all the steam and leaves the consumer with an optimal mouthfeel for brown rice and a much less chewy grain than if you were to eat directly after all the water was absorbed.” I also asked Harold McGee, author of the seminal book ”On Food & Cooking: The Science & Lore of the Kitchen,” and a food chemistry expert. “It takes time for the absorbed water to become distributed evenly throughout the grains and hydrate the starch at the center; and serving the hot rice immediately will cause it to evaporate away some near-surface moisture as visible steam, leaving the bran a little drier and firmer. I actually don’t mind that contrast in texture, but the 5-10 minute rest does give you a more evenly cooked pot.” First, you do need to rinse the rice. All grains rub against each other during shipping, scraping fine particles loose. To remove it, simply place your rice in a bowl, cover with cool water by an inch or two, and swish the rice around with your hands. Pour off the water and drain in a wire mesh strainer. Because brown rice is coated with a bran layer, where all that sturdy fiber resides, brown rice and whole grains can benefit from soaking overnight, or even for an hour or so. If you’re in a hurry and didn’t plan ahead, you can skip it. If you’ve heard that whole grains should be soaked to remove phytates, which might prevent absorption of some nutrients, don’t worry. According to registered dietician Kelly LeBlanc, “From a nutritional standpoint, the concern around phytates and mineral absorption seems to be overblown. Regularly eating a diet high in phytates may limit this ‘anti-nutrient’ eﬀect, as shown in a 2015 study in the Journal of Nutrition. Since phytates are found naturally in plants, it’s not surprising to learn that they may also have some antioxidant and anti-cancer properties. In my own personal kitchen, I’ll try to give long-cooking grains like sorghum, barley, and wheat berries a soak to help reduce their cooking time. But if I happen to forget, it’s not something I lose sleep over – my meals are still yummy.” The absorption method looks like this: Simply boil 2 cups water, add 1 cup rice, return to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, set a timer for 35 minutes and cook, covered, until the water is absorbed. Then let it stand for 10 minutes. If you prefer “pasta-style” cooking, you bring a pot of water to a boil, add the grain and boil until tender, then drain. Then, be sure to return the hot grain to the pot, cover and let stand for 10 minutes. If you have a standard rice cooker, it will turn itself off when the water has absorbed, and you should give it 10 minutes to finish steaming then. Multifunction rice cookers, like Zojirushi, have built-in soaking and steaming to the program for brown rice. In an Instant Pot or pressure cooker, use a 1:1 ratio of brown rice to water, and let the pot release naturally, for a final steam. If you’re still on the fence about cooking brown rice instead of white, just know that its rep as a “health food” is well-deserved. According to Emily Ho, a distinguished professor of nutrition at the College of Health at Oregon State University, “Because it still has the hull, bran layer and germ intact compared to processed white rice, it is packed full of nutrients like B vitamins, magnesium, potassium and iron. It also is a great source of dietary fiber that can help your gut health. Consumption of brown rice is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes compared to intake of white rice, and lowering of blood glucose.” What a difference a few minutes can make!

The MSNBC host, a former Biden White House press secretary, took a “bit of a deep dive” into McConnell’s “unwavering devotion to winning and winning at any cost” Sunday. She started with his support of campaign finance reform in the 1970s. “[He was] denouncing the cancer of the corrupting influence of money and politics, only to do a complete 180 in the U.S. Senate, where he became instrumental in opening up our politics to the flood of special interest dark money,” said Psaki. She also noted he once was a defender of the Voting Rights Act, which he had described as a “landmark piece of legislation” in 2006. “And yet, McConnell has blocked all attempts to rebuild the law after conservatives on the Supreme Court, of course, gutted portions in 2013,” Psaki said. “This all adds up” for the Kentucky Republican, Psaki said, arguing that McConnell realized that opposing campaign finance reform “would mean raising far more unrestricted money” that could help him politically and that “suppressing the vote might help Republicans win elections.” ""A cynic focused on power… only to be swallowed by the monster that he enabled to obtain it.""@jrpsaki on the real legacy of Mitch McConnell pic.twitter.com/IqfbX8xIZE She later referred to him having “stonewalled” President Barack Obama’s appointment for Supreme Court justice in 2016 and seeing former President Donald Trump as the “means to an end” when it comes to filling federal courts with conservatives. Psaki described McConnell as leaving his post in a “diminished” state. She added that there’s been a lack of action on new Ukraine aid “despite his insistence” and the inability to pass a bipartisan border bill. “And yet despite all that McConnell thinks about Trump, which we know, he’s already said that if he is the Republican nominee he will support him,” Psaki said.

Vance (R-Ohio) boasted on X (formerly Twitter) about having a “long memory” as he warned colleagues against attacking Donald Trump. But Vance’s post immediately went viral for all the wrong reasons, seeing as it conveniently ignored his own past trashing of the former president. “If you’re fighting Trump and his endorsed candidates politically today, don’t ask my help in a year with your legislation or your pet projects,” the “Hillbilly Elegy” author warned. A reader-added community note was soon added to the post. I have a long memory. If you’re fighting Trump and his endorsed candidates politically today, don’t ask for my help in a year with your legislation or your pet projects. “Vance has publicly called Trump an ‘idiot,’ ‘reprehensible’ and ‘noxious,’” it recalled. “In Facebook messages, Vance wrote ‘I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn’t be that bad… or that he’s America’s Hitler.’” Indeed, Vance was a fierce critic of Trump ahead of the 2016 election. He called himself a “Never Trump guy” who “will never vote for Trump.” Trump’s policies, meanwhile, ranged from “immoral to absurd,” he added at the time. Vance later went full MAGA with his 2022 run for Senate, though. Trump rewarded him with an endorsement.

The former president “has never evolved beyond the kind of person he was when he was very young, and it’s not at all surprising because he grew up in an authoritarian household,” Mary Trump told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour in an interview that was broadcast at the weekend. It’s “one of the things that should worry everybody about Donald,” the Republican front-runner’s niece claimed. Mary Trump, who has become a fierce critic of her uncle, described her grandfather Fred Trump as “a quite straight-up sociopath.” As “favorite son,” Donald Trump therefore “knew what he needed to do in order to stay on my grandfather’s good side,” she explained. “Because he also understood what would happen to him if he didn’t,” she added. “So he [Donald Trump] is very comfortable in this milieu and it is extremely important to him that he get the benefits of associating with strong men like [Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor] Orbán and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, but also that he be on their good side.” Last week, former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull recalled his unease at seeing Trump fawn over Putin on multiple occasions. Turnbull called it “really creepy.” It is “really no laughing matter when, at that point the leader of the free world is being described as a pre-pubescent child with a crush on an older, more powerful person,” Mary Trump said of Turnbull’s comments. Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull: “When you see Trump with Putin, as I have on a few occasions, he’s like the 12-year-old boy that goes to high school and meets the captain of the football team. ‘My hero!’ It’s really creepy.”pic.twitter.com/x89ogncwQz By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Primary Loss To Haley Is Mercilessly Mocked,lee moran,3/4/2024,"Former President Donald Trump’s spin on losing Sunday’s GOP presidential primary in Washington, D.C., to Nikki Haley was summed up by many critics with one word, “pathetic.” Following Trump’s first loss to Haley, the Republican 2024 front-runner’s campaign said “the swamp has claimed their queen” and claimed she only won thanks to “the lobbyists and D.C. insiders that want to protect the failed status quo.” Trump himself then ranted on his Truth Social platform that he’d “purposely stayed away from the D.C. Vote because it is the ‘Swamp,’ with very few delegates, and no upside.” “Birdbrain spent all of her time, money and effort there,” he continued, using his derogatory nickname for his former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Over the weekend we won Missouri, Idaho, and Michigan - BIG NUMBERS - Complete destruction of a very weak opponent. The really big numbers will come on Super Tuesday. Also, WAY UP ON CROOKED JOE!” he added. Trump wrote in a second post: “Birdbrain is a loser, record low performance in virtually every State. DeSanctus easily beat her in Iowa for a VERY DISTANT second place, and then she ran up to the podium, before he had a chance to do so, and claimed victory.” He continued, “I enjoy watching the Bird disavow her PLEDGE to the RNC and her statement that she would NEVER run against President Trump (‘A great President’). “Well, she ran, she lied, and she LOST BIG!” Critics responded in not so kind: Cry harder, you pathetic loser. pic.twitter.com/C40Vr7u904 YOU CAN'T HANDLE LOSS, TRUMP!

Steele, co-host of MSNBC’s “The Weekend,” flipped to a clip of the former president claiming that MAGA “represents 96% and maybe 100%” of the Republican Party as he spoke to supporters at a Virginia rally Saturday. “We’re getting rid of the Romneys of the world, we want to get Romneys – and those out,” said the GOP front-runner of the Utah senator who recently remarked that he would “absolutely not” vote for Trump in November. “But they know that we are the only ones who can stop them.” Steele, in response, noted that he’s a decadeslong member of the Republican Party before taking a swipe at Trump. “If anyone is the biggest RINO, it’s you, and we comin’ for you,” Steele said. “So, just so you understand, you drew the line, baby. I’m stepping up to it and a whole lot of Republicans out there –– at least 40% or more –– are stepping to that line, too. So you just need to chill on that.” Co-host Symone Sanders-Townsend added that Steele, a long-time critic of the former president, was putting Trump “on notice” before the ex-RNC chair chimed back in. “Just on notice — you bring it, baby, ’cause you wanna punk? Let’s punk, baby. Let’s go, one-on-one.” Co-host Alicia Menendez went on to note a post on X from Sarah Longwell, founder of the Republican Accountability Project, who pointed to former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake’s criticism of John McCain voters. “I forget, is she the Governor of Arizona right now, or no?” Longwell wrote in response to the Trump clip Sunday. “We’ve already seen this movie play out when you say, ‘We are not a big tent and we don’t want you at our table,’” Menendez said. Steele added that Trump — whom he called “the biggest RINO in the room” — has duped supporters into thinking he’s “somehow the conservative standard bearer.” “You want to try to build a party and grow it? You’re not doing it. You’re shrinking. What elections have you won? What elections have you won? None, except your own. And you’re not winning this one because you didn’t win the last one,” Steele said. The next four years will change America forever.

The two animals on the lam caused an unusual traffic jam Saturday afternoon as they wove through slowing traffic and then stopped it on Interstate 90 in the downtown Cleveland area. Cleveland.com reports that video from the Ohio Department of Transportation showed the animals trotting on the side of the road near the unit’s stables at about 12:15 p.m. Saturday. Another video showed them headed westbound in the eastbound interstate lanes, slowing and then halting traffic. The camera follows the animals, ultimately trailed by a police cruiser with flashing lights, heading further along the highway and then down an onramp before cutting across a grassy section onto a side street and out of view. Cleveland Police Sgt. Wilfredo Diaz told reporters that the horses were members of the department’s mounted division. He said they “inadvertently strayed” during “routine care and exercise.” “Mounted officers promptly recovered both horses, ensuring their safety, and no further incidents ensued,” Diaz said. Video of the horseplay prompted a good deal of online hilarity, with even the transportation department getting into the snarky act. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lee-speigel-ufo-journalist-huffpost-weird-news_n_64dce763e4b0eb9f33d7ec02,Famed UFO Reporter Puts Skeptics On Blast With A Defiant Final Act,david moye,3/4/2024,"When Lee Speigel arrived in New York City in the early 1970s, there was a word for people who reported seeing a UFO ― “kooks.” The world this 74-year-old man left behind on Aug. 14, after a battle with esophageal cancer, has vastly changed. Politicians, scientists and law enforcement officials are no longer laughing at those who say they’ve witnessed an unexplained phenomenon. Just weeks before Speigel’s death, military whistleblowers testified before a congressional committee, claiming the government has secretly retrieved and reverse-engineered unidentified flying objects. And though the Pentagon denied those claims, it soon unveiled a website devoted to sightings of unidentified flying objects. As 2023 drew to a close, Congress ordered all files on UFOs ― now classified as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) ― released within 25 years so long as there was no Oval Office objection. These are files that government officials barely acknowledged in years past ― and information Speigel and other UFO investigators spent their lives in search of. NASA still maintains that there’s no proof UFOs are the work of extraterrestrials, but it’s a conversation that can no longer be ignored. To be sure, no single person can take credit for shifting public opinion, but Speigel’s contributions over his 60-year career stand out. He is renowned as the first person to organize and host a conference at the United Nations on UFOs, attended by dignitaries from around the world. “Lee sought out interviews with military officers, commercial airline pilots and the best sources he could find. These people put their credibility on the line when they claimed they saw something in the sky that defied explanation,” said Buck Wolf, director of HuffPost Trends, who also worked with Speigel at ABC News. “Lee might be the only UFO writer and researcher from his generation to make the jump into mainstream journalism. At NBC Radio, ABC News and HuffPost, his colleagues looked at him with skepticism and amusement. But he also earned their respect,” Wolf said. Wolf and Speigel’s widow, Lorraine Simone, raised more than $10,000 from friends, family and admirers for one final tribute — to send Speigel’s cremated ashes into space. His remains will be loaded on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, scheduled for launch on March 4 at Vandenberg Space Force Base in Southern California. Speigel’s ashes will circle the Earth every 90 minutes at roughly 17,000 to 17,500 miles per hour on a mission slated to last two to three years and will burn up upon reentry, “like a shooting star,” said Dan Peabody, CEO of Beyond Burials, the company administering Speigel’s funeral service. “Star Trek” creator Gene Roddenberry, along with original cast members James Doohan and Nichelle Nichols; noted astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, best known for discovering Pluto; and 1960s counterculture hero Timothy Leary are among those who have also had space funerals. “Anyone who knew Lee knows he wanted to get into space somehow, especially after William Shatner did it,” said Simone. “I’m sure Lee is somewhere enjoying all this immensely.” Shatner, who portrayed the legendary Capt. Kirk on “Star Trek,” was 90 when he became the oldest man to voyage to space on a 2021 Blue Origin launch. In addition to the space funeral, Speigel’s friends and family organized and shipped his massive archive of taped interviews and case files to the National UFO Historical Records Center in Rio Rancho, New Mexico. Cmdr. Allan Palmer, a retired Air Force and Navy combat aviator, now serves as CEO and executive director at the National Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas. He thinks Speigel’s work is worthy of further study. Palmer consulted with Speigel in 2013 when creating the museum’s Area 51 exhibit. Area 51 is the now-famous top-secret site set up by the CIA and Air Force in 1955, which looms large in UFO lore. In the 1950s and 1960s, if a commercial pilot saw an aircraft flying at 70,000 feet or traveling at three times the speed of sound, it certainly would have seemed like otherworldly technology, Palmer said. Yet it wasn’t until 2013 that the government started acknowledging what was going on there. “Lee did so much in telling the story responsibly,” Palmer said. “Yet even with all we know today, there are still many unanswered mysteries.” Speigel’s personal journey is almost as amazing as some of the stories he covered. As a teen in Concord, New Hampshire, in the late 1960s, Elliot “Lee” Speigel was obsessed with the Apollo space program. But it was his other childhood love that brought him to New York City: folk music. By the early 1970s, he was singing and playing guitar on the same Greenwich Village stages that Bob Dylan and Harry Belafonte had been performing on a few years earlier. He went by the stage name Happy Day. Like any aspiring musician in the big city, Speigel scrambled to pay bills, working at times as a waiter, bartender and NBC page. He also put his tenor voice and audio production skills to use, crafting radio station ads and commercial jingles. In his downtime, Speigel devoured everything he could find on UFOs, but, except for sci-fi camp, all he could find were stray news clippings and paperback books. It struck him that there were no solid, feature-length recordings of some of the most credible UFO witnesses. He was soon pitching himself as the guy with the audio production skills to put that project together. By 1975, Speigel was traveling the country, conducting interviews that would become the CBS documentary record album “UFOs: The Credibility Factor,” featuring scientists, military personnel and aviation experts who admitted seeing things that defied explanation. Speigel focused extensively on the notorious July 1947 incident in Roswell, New Mexico, when the military seemed to admit — and then abruptly deny — that it had recovered the debris of an aircraft “not of this Earth.” In one of Speigel’s field assignments, astronomer J. Allen Hynek, a scientific adviser to the Air Force’s UFO study, Project Blue Book, invited him to North Carolina to investigate what the UFO website Rogue Planet described as “a spate of UFO sightings observed by local law enforcement.” During the trip, Speigel and multiple officers saw what he described as “the first well-documented UFO incident in the U.S. involving a triangle or boomerang-shaped UFO and multiple witnesses.” Speigel would joke years later that what they saw in the sky that day resembled “flying Doritos.” Speigel was hawking his UFO audio documentary album on late-night TV commercials in 1978 when he was invited by the island nation of Grenada to organize a meeting at the United Nations, attended by dignitaries from around the world, including U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. “Lee made a major contribution by organizing the U.N. meeting, which he is so well known for,” said Leslie Kean, author of the 2011 New York Times bestseller “UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record” and co-author of a 2017 New York Times investigative piece that revealed a secret Pentagon project to study UFOs. “He was one of the few reporters who had a platform to do regular stories on UFOs and related topics,” Kean said. By the late 1970s, Speigel’s work caught the eye of future MTV CEO Bob Pittman. In one of the most memorable nights of his life, they attended a party with comedian Richard Belzer. Together, they conceived of the late-night NBC Radio show “Edge of Reality,” hosted by Speigel, though at first he was billed only as “The Alien,” for promotional purposes. “There has always been huge interest in UFOs ― but not much info or ongoing dialogue, even more so way back then,” Pittman told HuffPost by email. “This was an attempt to tap into that for our audience.” Speigel dressed as a super-sized space lizard at promotional events to the delight of fans around New York City. If his shiny spacesuit looked a bit familiar, it’s because it was designed by the same NBC wardrobe team that threw together “Saturday Night Live’s” Conehead costumes. “It started as a gimmick, hence the name and suit. But [it] morphed into more serious reporting with Lee as the expert,” Pittman explained. “Did it change my views? Not sure, but it sure got me more interested,” said Pittman, adding that he thought Speigel was “a great human” who was “nice, considerate and thoughtful, as well as fun and funny.” Speigel shared an NBC studio briefly with notorious shock jock Howard Stern, who would occasionally go off on his otherworldly colleague. “He’d have people on from Mars,” Stern recalled in a hilarious 1992 on-air rant. “It was always UFOs. Every week. It’d be a whole show on UFOs. ... I’d say to him, ‘Have you seen a UFO?’” Stern denied that Speigel ever gave him a satisfactory answer. In an eight-year period beginning in 1978, Speigel recorded roughly 1,500 hours of local and national programming, interviewing actors William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, astronomers, astronauts and others who had something to say about the search for intelligent life in the universe. In that time, when Stephen Spielberg was working on projects like “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” and “E.T. the Extra Terrestrial,” Spielberg had Speigel flown out to his home. “Lee had his share of celebrity fans. Robin Leach would visit when Lee he was in New York, not to discuss lifestyles of the rich and famous, but to go UFO hunting,” Wolf said. “One time, Lee invited a few of us HuffPosters to go see ZZ Top, and it was because the band wanted Lee to stay after the show and talk about space aliens.” When “Edge of Reality” ended, Speigel remained at NBC Radio in New York working on science and human interest stories while also contributing to Omni magazine. He joined ABC Radio Networks in the late 1990s, eventually moving to ABCNews.com as a copy editor. In 2010, when Wolf offered Speigel a chance to write freelance articles on unexplained phenomena for AOL News, he quit ABC, even though that meant giving up his health insurance. He was eventually brought on to The Huffington Post (now HuffPost) as a full-time reporter, winning the 2012 International UFO Congress Researcher of the Year award. In his six years at The Huffington Post, Speigel was able to get astronauts Edgar Mitchell, Alan Bean and Leroy Chiao to go on the record about UFOs, as well as luminaries, like actor Morgan Freeman, who opined that, “We may already be in the midst of a growing zombie apocalypse.” “In the newsroom, Lee stuck out like a sore thumb. He was a showman, and he pitched so many out-there stories,” Wolf said, recalling that Speigel’s desk was festooned with “Star Wars” toys and a giant statue of a spaceling, which he called the Alien Butler. “Other reporters were sometimes skeptical, but Lee wouldn’t have had a second career as a copy editor and proofreader at major news outlets if he wasn’t trusted,” Wolf said. The span of Speigel’s work is hard to describe. One Huffington Post story was headlined, “Hey, Even a Yeti Needs to Pee Sometime.” Another favorite among his colleagues was when Swedish rapper Elliphant asked him to discuss “alien sex” in a Rolling Stone interview. That’s not to say that all of Speigel’s wild stories panned out. At one Huffington Post editorial meeting, jaws dropped when he said he was on the verge of uncovering a vast, multinational conspiracy, which involved high-ranking U.N. officials, to cover up the crash-landing of a spacecraft. HuffPost senior editor Andy Campbell recalled telling Speigel at the meeting, “If there were ever a time to burn your sources and report what you have for the good of humanity, it’s now, Lee. The Earth needs you more than ever.” Nevertheless, in the community of UFO enthusiasts — both the sci-fi pop culture enthusiasts and the committed researchers who believe the truth is out there — Speigel was a legend. “He was a great journalist,” George Noory, host of “Coast to Coast AM,” told HuffPost. “He understood the paranormal better than anyone. He was doing it years before I started.” As a career capstone, Speigel revived “Edge of Reality” on the UN-X Digital Broadcast Network, pushing forward his research and conversations. Speigel also helped write and produce “The Phenomenon,” a James Fox documentary that featured interviews with former White House chief of staff John Podesta and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who admitted a lot of evidence “hasn’t seen the light of day.” Speigel’s UN-X producer, Race Hobbs, said his work needs to be preserved and built upon. “He never led witnesses, but, if they strayed, he could steer them. He knew what was important for people not familiar with the subject,” adding that Speigel was “a genius.” In the final months of his life, Speigel also helped author Marc Hartzman with his book “We Are Not Alone,” a look at humanity’s evolving views on UFOs going back to biblical times. “Lee opened doors no one else could,” Hartzman said. With Speigel’s interviews and case files now in the hands of the National UFO Historical Records Center, other researchers and journalists will soon have access to his work. Simone, Wolf and other friends and family are planning to gather in Santa Barbara County on March 4 for the launch of Speigel’s ashes. Speigel and Simone, who met in 1982, dated on and off for more than three decades before tying the knot in 2019 on the east end of Long Island. She still recalls when he wandered into the Manhattan magic shop where she was working. Speigel did not enter the store to purchase a magic potion. He was seeking an advertiser for his NBC radio show. Simone quickly recognized him, not by his striking resemblance to a young Al Pacino, but by his voice. “Lee used to do the voiceovers in radio ads for Omni magazine, and every time I heard it, I would turn up the volume because I loved his voice,” Simone said.

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) slammed the Supreme Court’s decision to hear arguments from former President Donald Trump that he is immune from prosecution for any actions he took in the White House. Raskin told MSNBC’s Jen Psaki on Sunday he believed a lower court’s decision on the matter was already “completely exhaustive and totally compelling.” Trump has argued he cannot be prosecuted on charges he attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election, seeking to lean on an unprecedented and broad interpretation of presidential immunity. A three-judge panel on the D.C. Court of Appeals unanimously rejected that argument last month, but the Supreme Court agreed to decide on Trump’s claims last week. Arguments are set for the week of April 22, which effectively freezes special counsel Jack Smith’s case against Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and will likely push any eventual trial until much later in the year. “This was an obvious case not to take up, and just let the D.C. Circuit Court ruling stand,” Raskin said on MSNBC’s “Inside with Jen Psaki.” “We don’t have a king here, we had a revolution against a king and the Constitution is written so that [the] president’s main job is to take care the laws are faithfully executed, not faithfully violated in his own interest.” .@jrpsaki: ""Do you look at this court and think some of these justices want to delay these trials?""@RepRaskin: ""Yeah. If you don't believe that, you're too innocent to be let out of the house by yourself at this point."" pic.twitter.com/Z0YI3r0cJH Trump has largely moved to delay his trials on dozens of charges leveled against him in four different indictments. If he wins reelection and has not been tried, he could order the Justice Department to dismiss the federal cases against him or try to pardon himself. Raskin laid blame for the Supreme Court’s move on the three justices nominated during Trump’s presidency and others under former President George W. Bush. When Psaki asked the lawmaker if he believed some on the court also wanted to see a delay in Trump’s trials, Raskin said you only had to look at the court’s recent rulings.

In a behind-the-scenes look at her 2024 Super Bowl halftime performance, the Grammy winner told her hair and makeup team about how her “pushy” nine-year-old Genesis Dean had been angling to befriend the “Bad Guy” singer. After what Keys said was three days of pestering, she agreed to text Eilish a video of her son where introduced himself and said, “Hi, my name is Genesis and I really like your music. And I’m Alicia Keys’ son.” Laughing at Genesis’ boldness, Keys cackled as she watched the video with her beauty team and showed them her accompanying text to Eilish. “Someone wanted me to send you this message,” it read. “I hope it makes you smile. How are you, beautiful? Big love!” A little too eager to connect with the artist, Keys said Genesis prodded her to see if he got a response “over and over” again. “I said no, it takes a minute,” she recalled telling him. “She likes to take time, reconnect. It’s all good.” Much to the annoyance of his mother, Genesis decided to take it upon himself and text Eilish a simple “Hi” from her phone. “Don’t bother the girl,” Keys said she told her son. “She’ll write back if she can write back.” But as she sat in the makeup chair getting ready for the Super Bowl stage, the “Girl On Fire” singer got the reply Genesis had been waiting for. “Genesis, it’s Billie,” Eilish responded in a video beside her brother and producing partner, Finneas. “I’m ready to be your friend any day.” “I would like to be your friend,” she said eagerly, as Finneas chanted Genesis’ name in the background. “Alicia is my friend, I love her. I love you. Let’s hang out and be friends.” Keys and Eilish go back to at least 2019, when they performed a duet of the song “Ocean Eyes” during an episode of “The Late Late Show With James Corden.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nikki-haley-wins-dc-republican-presidential-primary_n_65e49820e4b013678e15af26,Nikki Haley Defeats Donald Trump In D.C. GOP Presidential Primary,jennifer bendery,3/3/2024,"WASHINGTON – Nikki Haley on Sunday defeated Donald Trump in the GOP presidential primary in Washington, D.C., her first win against the former president. It’s a relatively tiny victory, one Trump will almost certainly use to portray Haley as a creature of the D.C. swamp. D.C.’s 19 delegates will now cast their votes for her at the Republican National Convention in July. That’s out of 2,429 delegates, and so far, Trump has trounced her in all of the other state GOP primaries. Right on cue, shortly after Haley’s win was announced, Trump’s campaign said her victory means “the swamp has claimed their queen.” “While Nikki has been soundly rejected throughout the rest of America, she was just crowned Queen of the Swamp by the lobbyists and DC insiders that want to protect the failed status quo,” Karoline Leavitt, press secretary for Trump’s campaign, said in a statement. Trump has a total of 244 delegates and Haley now has 43. Whoever is first to hit 1,215 delegates will be the Republican presidential nominee. Trump is expected to get much closer following this week’s Super Tuesday primaries, where polls show him dominating from coast to coast. But Haley’s win counts for something. For starters, unbelievably, she is now the first woman to ever win a Republican presidential primary. Her ability to defeat Trump in any primary means he can’t celebrate a clean sweep, which, as petty as it sounds, is almost certainly going to infuriate him and delight his critics. And for Haley’s supporters in D.C., it’s a sign that there’s enough of them, even if in this small election, to send the message that they reject the MAGA grip on their party. “It matters for her to win in D.C. because I think it’s going to frustrate Trump more and more,” said Cherry, 66, who was one of about 250 people at a Haley campaign event in D.C. on Friday afternoon. She asked to use her first name only. “I’ve never hated a politician, but I hate Donald Trump,” she said. “This is America’s Hitler.” A Haley victory in D.C.’s GOP primary would “put our little group on the map,” said Dennis Paul, an 84-year-old semi-retired resident. “She seems to grasp things very well,” he said. “She’s obviously good on fiscal policy. She’s vibrant and exciting.” Joe, a long-time D.C. resident, praised Haley for her “message of real vigor and understanding of the issues.” He said he wants her to stay in the race as long as possible, even though it’s unlikely she can win. “First of all, she’s not Joe Biden. Secondly, she’s not Donald Trump,” said Joe, who is in his 60s and who also requested only using his first name, but confirmed his last name is not “Biden.” “Anywhere ― anywhere ― she can win and show momentum would be great,” Joe said of Haley. Some attendees at Haley’s event said she has come to represent something much bigger than herself. Antonia Ferrier, a former longtime senior aide to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the late Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), is now a major donor to Haley’s campaign. She said it’s clear there is a faction of voters who “feel almost voiceless in the Republican Party.” She rattled off recent polling that has deeply frustrated her: Nearly 70% of Americans don’t want a Biden-Trump rematch in November. Nearly 60% think they’re both too old. More than 40% of voters are registering as independent, tying a record high in 2014. “There is a collective scream in this country,” said Ferrier, who is currently an executive at a GOP nonprofit focused on advancing democracy. “It’s like a collective scream for a leader we can be proud of. But the established political class refuses to listen to it because of their own feedback loops or whatever fucking reason, and Haley is giving voice to that.” Ferrier said she wants the former South Carolina governor to stay in the race as long as she can, because “she is an affirmation of the politics saying there is a better way. She gets it. It’s clear she understands it.” “There is another way for our country,” she emphasized. Haley herself made this point at her campaign event on Friday. “We don’t have to live the way we’re living now,” she told the room, to applause. “But we need to be part of the solution. We’re gonna fight for Super Tuesday.” But what is Haley’s endgame, if it’s clear she can’t defeat Trump in the Republican primary but is continuing to campaign and raise money? The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jason-galanis-biden-impeachment-inquiry_n_65e778f0e4b0d2a2475ae706,Republicans Go To Bat For Federal Prisoner Who Testified In Biden Impeachment Inquiry,arthur delaney,3/5/2024,"WASHINGTON — House Republicans are chasing a new lead in their impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden, sending official demands for information about how the Justice Department handled a federal prisoner’s requests for home confinement. Impeachment investigators interviewed Jason Galanis last month at a federal prison in Alabama, where Galanis, who claimed to have been a business partner of Hunter Biden’s, is serving a 14-year sentence for his roles in two multimillion-dollar fraud schemes. Galanis claimed during the interview that his request for home confinement last year had been rejected in order to prevent him from talking to Republicans searching for evidence of Joe Biden’s involvement in his son’s business deals. “I’ve been the victim of a pattern of retribution by the Department of Justice in order to prevent my home confinement, which would have allowed full and free access to congressional investigators,” Galanis said, according to an interview transcript. Despite the Justice Department granting Republicans’ request for an interview with Galanis and talking to him for four hours, some GOP figures still think there’s something fishy going on. In a letter from House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) and Judiciary Committee member Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), the three said they were investigating Galanis’ allegations “and will take seriously any attempt by [the Bureau of Prisons] to obstruct the Committees’ inquiry, including by retaliating against witnesses.” The letter was sent Tuesday to the director of the BOP and the U.S. attorney’s office for the southern district of New York, which prosecuted Galanis. The U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment. The BOP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Galanis testimony and follow-up letter represent one of the more unusual rabbit holes Republicans have followed in their quest for incriminating evidence against the president. They have also interviewed a New York gallerist who sold paintings by Hunter Biden and the trustee of a bankrupt health care company that once hired the president’s brother. The gallerist and trustee (along with a series of other witnesses) have said they were unaware of Joe Biden being involved in his family’s business schemes. Republicans’ most serious allegation ― that the Bidens solicited bribes from a Ukrainian oligarch ― imploded last month when the Justice Department said an informant had made them up. Galanis testified that from 2012 to 2015, he partnered in business with Hunter Biden and Devon Archer, a friend of Hunter’s, on a scheme to rake in billions from overseas private equity investors. “The entire value add of Hunter Biden to our business was his family name and his access to his father, Vice President Joe Biden,” Galanis said, adding that he once witnessed Hunter Biden put his dad on speakerphone at a restaurant in the company of other business associates. “The Vice President said, ‘Hello,’ and some pleasantries, ‘Hope you had safe travels,’ and seemed like he wanted to bring the call to an end by saying, ‘Okay, you be good to my boy,’” Galanis said. As part of the venture, Galanis went on to say that he “engaged in unlawful conduct” and was sent to prison. In 2016, the Justice Department announced charges against Galanis, Archer and five others for defrauding a Native American tribe and pension fund managers in a self-enrichment scheme. Though the defendants used Hunter Biden’s famous last name to sell their plans, prosecutors didn’t press charges against him. His lawyers have said he wasn’t involved. In an interview last year, Archer told lawmakers that Hunter Biden put his father on speakerphone repeatedly in the company of clients, but the president only offered pleasantries and commentary on the weather — essentially the same thing Galanis said he witnessed. Archer said the elder Biden wasn’t involved in their work and that he was unaware of Joe Biden taking any action as a government official to benefit his son. In his own deposition last week, Hunter Biden said he did not partner with Galanis and that he only knew his name from news reports. “I think that 10 years ago, for 30 minutes, I was introduced to Jason Galanis, and that’s only ― the only time I ever recall meeting him,” he said. Republicans didn’t press for more. Though he wasn’t charged alongside Galanis and Archer, the Justice Department has charged Hunter Biden with crimes for failing to pay his taxes on time and for illegally owning a firearm in 2018 while he was addicted to crack cocaine. Prosecutors have suggested they may seek additional charges. Galanis said that while he was in a Florida prison last February, he applied for home confinement in California and was approved. However, the approval was reversed in July after Republicans announced their subpoena for Archer’s testimony. Galanis claimed that a former BOP official told him prosecutors weighed in on the request, and he said prison officials offered shifting justifications when they rejected his appeals. He said he received his current placement in Alabama in August after complaining of persistent sexual harassment from a prison staff member at the facility in Florida.

Although he’s been treated professionally at the Alabama prison, Galanis said his overall experience makes him suspect his past association with the president’s son has put a target on his back. “From the experiences I’ve had in the criminal justice system, I believe I am putting myself at grave risk within the BOP for providing information into these matters concerning the president and his son,” he said. Republicans first asked the BOP for time with Galanis in November, several months after his home confinement request had been denied and he had been transferred to Alabama.

No single or specific incident led to this decision. Our decision was made to prevent such a significant incident.” Fraternities and sororities are fighting back. In a statement to The Washington Post, three Greek organizations said that UMD hasn’t given an explanation for the suspension or allowed them to defend themselves. “This shut down was so sudden and we’re frustrated with no answers,” Spencer Doyle, chapter president of the Phi Kappa Tau fraternity, told The Washington Post. “It is not fair to chapters operating the right way.” According to national hazing statistics listed on UMD’s website, 95% of students who are hazed won’t report it.

Blackwell engaged in a pretty toxic relationship with fellow cast member Jimmy Presnell during Season 6, and their dynamic seemed to bring out the worst in both of them. Presnell was initially emotionally aloof with Blackwell, causing her to unleash all of her insecurities on screen, which was excruciating to watch. But even if Blackwell’s antics were annoying, it seems some fans have taken their dislike of her a tad too far. “You guys have every single right to, you know, have opinions on my life,” Blackwell said while addressing fans on Instagram last week. “But like, I don’t know, maybe cease the death threats for a minute? I don’t know, just a thought.” Earlier in her video, Blackwell acknowledged that she came off pretty cringe. “Let’s be honest … woof,” Blackwell said about watching herself on “Love is Blind” over a year after Season 6 was filmed. “Imagine spending the year really working on yourself, finding those inner demons, and really becoming the woman you’ve always wanted to be, sitting with hardships in your life that you’ve never really sat with before — and then having to relive it. It’s mental, OK?” Although Blackwell has taken some accountability for her bad behavior, other Season 6 cast members haven’t exactly done the same — and we’re looking at you, Trevor.

The actors were photographed together on a beach in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, over the weekend, as seen in photos published by E! News on Monday. The two were seen smiling and holding hands on the shoreline of a beach. One photo showed the pair embracing each other with their foreheads pressed together. Nyong’o and Jackson had previously fueled dating rumors in December, when they were seen holding hands while walking through Joshua Tree National Park in southeastern California. They were also spotted together in a car ahead of a trip to the grocery store in Los Angeles that same month, as seen in photos published by TMZ. Prior to that, fans of the actors speculated about their relationship on social media in October, when they were photographed at a Janelle Monáe concert with a group of friends. They have yet to publicly comment on their relationship. Representatives for Jackson and Nyong’o did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jackson was previously married to fellow actor Jodie Turner-Smith. The “Queen & Slim” actor reportedly filed for divorce from Jackson in October, after more than three years of marriage. They share a 3-year-old daughter. Tuner-Smith publicly discussed her divorce from Jackson for the first time last month. “Sometimes things we really want to work just don’t end up working. And that’s OK,” she told U.K.’s Sunday Times Style. “The most important thing is that you choose what’s healthiest for you and your family and definitely your children.” In October, Nyong’o shared her “heartbreak” with her Instagram followers after her split from sports commentator Selema Masekela.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/euphoria-actor-nina-king-cant-pay-rent_n_65e74105e4b0d2a2475ac6e3,'Euphoria' Actor Says She Hasn't Paid Rent For 6 Months Amid Season 3 Delay,curtis m. wong,3/5/2024,"“Euphoria” may have garnered Nika King and her castmates critical praise and some awards season love, but the actor is feeling the financial squeeze more than two years after the HBO series’ second season aired. King, who plays Leslie Bennett on “Euphoria,” said during a recent stand-up show that she doesn’t know when fans can expect new episodes of the show. “Season 3 is coming out — I don’t f**king know,” the actor and comedian said, as seen in a TikTok video she shared Monday. “Don’t ask me, I don’t know. It’s one of those things. People are like, ‘We need Season 3.’ I’m like, ‘Bitch, I need Season 3.’ I haven’t paid my rent in six months.” King then took a playful dig at her co-star, Zendaya, who plays her character’s daughter, Rue Bennett. “Zendaya’s over in Paris at Fashion Week,” she quipped. “I’m like, ‘Bitch, come home! I need you. Mama needs you!’” A two-time Emmy winner, Zendaya has been making the red carpet rounds on both sides of the Atlantic to promote “Dune: Part Two,” which also stars Austin Butler, Timothée Chalamet and Florence Pugh. Although King’s bit about Zendaya was meant in jest, she said her recent lack of steady employment was no laughing matter: “I haven’t booked nothing since ‘Euphoria.’ This is some bullshit.” “Euphoria” was officially renewed for a third season in early 2022. In November, however, HBO’s CEO Casey Bloys clarified that that the series wouldn’t return until 2025, partly as a result of the actors and writers strikes that brought most of Hollywood to a standstill last year. Since then, many of the show’s actors, including Colman Domingo and Jacob Elordi, have shared their thoughts on the delay. “[Creator Sam Levinson] is a person who writes and rewrites and writes and rewrites again, because I think he’s wrestling with what’s important,” Domingo, an Oscar nominee for Netflix’s “Rustin,” told GQ last month. “He’s responding immediately to what the ills of the world are. I know that the one thing I can tell you is that he’s very much interested in the existential question of who we are right now. Our souls. That’s what he wants to figure out with Season 3.” Elordi, who plays teen jock Nate Jacobs, joked to “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon in January that the “Euphoria” creative team might have to find a way to de-age him if the production delay was extended.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/injured-palestine-qatar-gaza-families_n_65e76032e4b0f9d26cac8ef1,These Injured Palestinians Made It Out Of Gaza. Their Loved Ones Did Not — And The Distance Is Agony.,akbar shahid ahmed,3/5/2024,"DOHA, Qatar ― Samira Thari recently told her six children still in Gaza that she doesn’t want to hear from them. She thinks of them constantly, especially those most hurt by the violence there ― like her 22-year-old son, who is in a wheelchair after being hit by shrapnel, and her 14-year-old daughter, who’s been rendered speechless by the shock of the war. But she knows that for the family to get cell service, they have to leave their tent shelter and climb up a hill that has previously been targeted by Israeli forces. “Don’t try to call me, because I won’t answer,” she told them on Feb. 23. Thari has been in Qatar for nearly three months, since she woke up there after she was injured in an Israeli strike on a United Nations school. The attack killed her 3-year-old granddaughter, who had been sitting with Thari as she made bread for her family, and wounded Thari so badly that emergency workers put her in a body bag ― only realizing she was alive when her grieving sister noticed Thari’s eyes were still moving. Medical teams moved Thari and her injured husband from hospitals in Gaza to an Italian hospital ship, then to Egypt and eventually Qatar. She’s now had five surgeries, and is awaiting one more in her back. “If I had the option to stop treatment, I would go back in a heartbeat,” Thari, 39, told HuffPost last week. In addition to the concern for her children, her “heart burns” for her parents, who are 70 and 75. “I’m not able to heal because of my mind and emotional state,” Thari said. “My therapist tells me to stop watching the news, but how can I stop? I have to check the lists of people being martyred. How can I stop?” Since Israel began its devastating U.S.-backed campaign in Gaza on Oct. 7, retaliating for a shock attack by Gaza-based Palestinian militants that killed some 1,200 people, only a handful of the region’s 2.3 million residents have gotten to safety. Up to a thousand are believed to be living in Egypt after relying on their dual nationalities or bribes to travel through the Rafah Crossing, currently the only functional pedestrian exit point into and out of Gaza. And medical and diplomatic personnel have overcome bureaucratic and logistical hurdles to evacuate some Palestinians, like Thari, who needed urgent, specialized care. About 700 Palestinian civilians ― among them 300 children ― are now in Qatar, local officials say, a group that comprises mostly wounded people but also some of their companions. In interviews with HuffPost in the Persian Gulf state, a U.S. ally that plans to treat at least 1,500 injured Gazans, evacuees described heartache over separation from their vulnerable loved ones, and deep disillusionment about the global response to Israel’s offensive. Despite Israel’s claims that its military operation is focused on the militant group Hamas, it has killed more than 30,000 people, most of them civilians, according to Palestinian authorities. Perched on a beanbag chair in the courtyard of a residential facility just a few miles from the offices where Israeli representatives have visited for U.S.-backed discussions about a possible truce with Hamas, a 30-year-old mother named Watfah described watching coverage of President Joe Biden discussing the prospect of a cease-fire on Feb. 26. “He’s doing it while eating ice cream, mocking us,” Watfah said. Thari had particular disdain for governments in the Middle East. Palestinians have traditionally looked to fellow Arab nations for support, but in recent years, Israel has successfully convinced several of those states to establish ties with it without an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. “The only reason this is happening to us is because of the silence of the Arabs,” Thari said, tearing up. “Arab leaders are too scared to stand up to Israel and America ... It’s like spraying pest control on animals, that’s how many people have died.” Views like these reflect not only how the ongoing war has traumatized Palestinians, but also a widespread wariness about discussions in Washington, regional capitals, and beyond about halting the fighting and negotiating a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. Simultaneously, the evacuees’ stories underscore the yearning for a respite among those who understand conditions in Gaza ― a goal that Biden and other key figures say they are working hard to achieve before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins on March 10. “Our hearts are still back in Gaza,” Thari said. “I die a hundred times a day for my kids.” Mohammed Obaid, 42, and his 13-year-old son Bahaa have been in Qatar since Jan. 18. Since they were hit by an Israeli airstrike on Nov. 6, both have had complex surgeries. Bahaa has lost his left leg and is hoping to soon get a prosthetic. “We’re tired,” Obaid said. “We just want peace.” He fought back tears remembering how he tried to hold his wife’s hand after the strike, and how he realized, once they were taken to a hospital, that she had lost too much spinal fluid to survive. Obaid’s uncle, a surgeon, was able to help him and Bahaa get to Egypt for treatment. But Obaid’s other children are still in Gaza, and he has only been able to speak to them once a week. Struggling to feed themselves, they always ask him what he and Bahaa have been able to eat. “They’re living with their uncle, but they need their father,” he told HuffPost. “They already lost their mom ― they need their father.” Many at the Qatari facility said reuniting with their loved ones was their chief priority. Some had already been separated from family members during the war, as more than 70% of Gaza’s population has been displaced into makeshift refuges amid Israeli evacuation orders, bombardments and troop advances. Naheel, 35, and her five children have only seen her husband for a handful of days since Oct. 7. On Oct. 11, a premonition prompted her to move with her kids into a U.N. school. Her husband didn’t want to abandon their home. Attacks in their neighborhood, initially designated a safe zone by Israel, soon wounded him, putting him in a hospital bed for months. Meanwhile, the relative safety of Naheel’s shelter had limits. When she went out to a balcony to check that her kids had not strayed off the school grounds, a large piece of shrapnel hit her in the back. “It felt like I was on fire,” she said. Amid chaos at the local Nasser Hospital, she only got a dressing for the wound, then hurried back to her children. Still, she couldn’t watch them at all times. One day in late October, two of her sons ― 15-year-old Anas and 10-year-old Adham ― joined a group of boys in search of wood for cooking. Suddenly they were engulfed in what Anas called “toxic bombs” that made them feel like they were suffocating. By the time they were taken to a hospital, Adham was near death. Doctors told his family his brain had run short on oxygen, leaving him disfigured and unable to speak or control his limbs. By late December, bullets through the windows of the U.N. school, as well as airdropped Israeli messages about continued attacks, convinced Naheel to move again. Her husband went to Rafah and secured a tent, and Naheel and their children traveled three hours on a donkey cart to reunite with him on Jan. 10. Four days later, she heard that Egyptian authorities were willing to let her and Adham exit through Rafah. She hoped that permission could extend to their whole family. But when they arrived at the crossing, border guards refused to let her husband cross. “My kids broke down,” she recalled. Since they have been transferred to Qatar, she and the children have had minimal contact with him, but she says nothing could be more important for them, especially Adham. She showed HuffPost a video of him reacting excitedly when she mentioned his father. She said she is “begging” multiple governments for help, awaiting the day she sees his name spelled out on the Rafah exit list: Mohammed Abu Al Ola. Fear and longing are paired with guilt for some evacuees, making each day of the war harder to bear. Watfah, who arrived in Qatar two weeks ago with her severely injured 13-year-old son, is wracked by thoughts of her other children. Her 9-year-old daughter “is a parent now,” she said, caring for her young siblings. The family has already endured a loss: Watfah was seven months pregnant when the war broke out, but due to malnourishment and dehydration, her baby was stillborn, she said. Iman, a young woman from Gaza City, told HuffPost she thinks constantly about her decision to get in an ambulance with her daughter Aleen after the girl was hit by shrapnel on the balcony of their apartment on Dec. 10. Emergency personnel brought the pair to a hospital through Israeli checkpoints. Because of the extent of Aleen’s wound, which left a gaping hole in the side of her face, doctors kept her in a hospital and ultimately sent them to Egypt, then Qatar. Iman wonders if she could have snuck her other two children ― boys aged 12 and 4 ― into the ambulance too. She says she’s regularly asked that question by other people. But she also knows Israeli soldiers would have likely pulled them out of the vehicle. “I didn’t expect my daughter to need this much treatment. I can’t handle one more day without my other kids,” she said, expressing particular concern about Israeli forces’ pattern of treating men and older boys like her husband and her 12-year-old as potential combatants. As Iman receives meals provided by the Qatari government, her children in Gaza can rarely get rice, she said: “They’re starving.” Northern Gaza, where Iman’s family and about 300,000 other Palestinians live, is enduring near-famine conditions and children there are dying of hunger, U.N. and aid experts say. Though Israel controls the area, it has offered little support to efforts by donor groups and Israeli partners like the U.S. to send in a huge surge of food and other supplies. Worsening humanitarian conditions in Gaza, and fears that continued bloodshed there will spark broader violence over Ramadan, are intensifying a U.S.-led attempt to negotiate a pause in fighting, allow in more aid and release Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. As HuffPost interviewed evacuated Gazans, Israeli technical experts and Qatari mediators with Hamas were assessing the possibility of trading Israeli hostages for Palestinians. Since then, however, talks have stalled over the questions of whether Israel will withdraw its troops from Gaza and whether Hamas will share details about individuals it wants included in the deal. From evacuees to well-connected sources, there’s little optimism among observers that a meaningful stop to the war is imminent. “They’re all liars. We were hopeful, but we kept getting let down,” Thari said in Doha. A U.S. official familiar with senior Biden aides’ thinking told HuffPost that top American officials know how dire the situation is ― and even anticipated a scenario like the tragedy last week, now being called a “flour massacre,” when more than 100 Palestinians trying to get aid were killed amid trampling and Israeli gunfire. Yet the president’s refusal to pressure Israel in a tangible way, for instance by suggesting limits on the American support fueling its Gaza offensive, is shaping U.S. policy, the official said. “Pushing Israel to allow food in is totally off the table,” they said. “Biden is not budging on anything.” The official, who has worked under both Democratic and Republican presidents, described a mix of incompetence and Biden’s “singularly” harmful views, like leaning more reflexively pro-Israel than other Democrats and, according to administration officials, viewing Israel as it was 30 or 40 years ago, rather than acknowledging its current strength and hard-right politics. The upshot, they said, is that the Biden administration would try to address the crisis through “complex, hard-to-do and low-yield PR stunts like airdrops.” Spokespeople for the White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Experienced humanitarians have condemned Biden’s new policy, launched over the weekend, of airdropping aid into Gaza. “The world’s wealthiest, most powerful, ‘greatest’ nation should not have to resort to needed, but inefficient and last-resort airdrops to get life-saving aid in,” Sean Carroll ― a former U.S. Agency for International Development official who now runs the group American Near East Refugee Aid ― recently wrote on LinkedIn. Given its influence, many say the U.S. could do more to change Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s approach. Netanyahu this week refused to even send an Israeli delegation to truce talks, and Israel has not permitted aid to enter northern Gaza through crossings it controls. “The Americans should be much tougher. They still don’t fully understand who they’re up against,” said a former senior Israeli official who requested anonymity to speak candidly. Advocates like Dylan Williams of the Center for International Policy argue that the U.S. should legally already be compelled to cut off military aid for Israel because the country is hindering the distribution of American aid. “It defies credulity for the administration to act as if it hasn’t made known to the President that the government of Israel restricts, directly or indirectly, the transport or delivery of US humanitarian assistance, which is the standard set in the law,” Williams told HuffPost by text message. “If there is not a massive increase in aid into Gaza, I think you can expect congressional calls for enforcement of this law to grow.” Palestinians with lives in the balance say a change in course is overdue. Evacuees described how their loved ones’ days are dominated by anxiety about Israeli airstrikes, how their chronically ill relatives are unable to get treatment as hospitals focus on war injuries, and how their own futures feel inextricably tied to the war. “We’re resisting food, on hunger strike,” said Thari, telling HuffPost she only accepts a couple of spoonfuls of food to take her medication. “How can I eat when my dad is eating grass?”",NA,NA

In a phone interview on “Fox & Friends,” hosts Brian Kilmeade and Lawrence Jones asked the GOP front-runner if he was “on board” with the way Israeli forces have been carrying out their offensive in Gaza. “You’ve got to finish the problem,” Trump said. “You had a horrible invasion that took place, that would have never happened if I was president, by the way.” Hamas militants launched a deadly attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 hostages. About half the hostages were released during a temporary cease-fire late last year; 100 of the remaining 130 hostages are estimated to still be alive. In retaliation, Israel launched a massive and ongoing military offensive in Gaza, killing more than 30,000 Palestinians and wounding many more, as well as displacing millions. Trump dodged multiple questions by the “Fox & Friends” hosts on his stances related to Israel and Gaza and instead reiterated that the Oct. 7 attack and Israel’s retaliation would not have happened had he been president. “They wouldn’t have done it to me I guarantee you that,” he said. “They did this because they have no respect for Biden, and frankly, they got soft.” ""You gotta finish the problem"" -- Trump endorses Israel's war effort against Hamas pic.twitter.com/5VXrqSiuNM President Joe Biden’s unconditional support for Israel and its military offensive is beginning to cost him votes in the 2024 election. Michigan, which has one of the largest Arab and Muslim American populations, saw an unprecedented number of Democratic voters cast their primary ballot for “uncommitted” instead of for Biden. The uncommitted movement, which has started spreading to other states, was led by voters who felt that Biden was not taking his constituents’ concerns seriously about U.S. involvement in Israel’s offensive. Despite the president’s strong allyship with Israel, Trump would likely still be the preferred candidate for the Israeli government’s far-right leaders, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. Last month, Ben Gvir told The Wall Street Journal that Trump would give the Israeli right a stronger backing than Biden currently does. The next four years will change America forever.

The two leaders were close during the Trump administration, which cut Palestinians out of the negotiations over the so-called Abraham Accords and supported expanding Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. However, after Netanyahu called Biden to congratulate him on his win in 2020, Trump began to sour on the Israeli leader. Just days after the Oct. 7 attack, Trump praised the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group as “very smart” while disparaging Netanyahu and Israeli military officials. The Republican candidate had since stayed noticeably silent on the war until Tuesday.

Bob Menendez and his wife that allege they accepted gold bars, cash and a luxury car in return for favors the senator carried out to assist three businessmen. The new charges were in a rewritten indictment returned against the Democrat in Manhattan federal court. New charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstruction of justice were added against Menendez and his wife, Nadine. An indictment already alleges that the couple conspired with three businessmen to accept the bribes in return for the senator’s help in projects pursued by the businessmen. Both have pleaded not guilty, along with two of the businessmen. A May trial has been scheduled. One businessman pleaded guilty to charges last week and agreed to testify at trial against the others. After his fall arrest, Menendez, 70, was forced to relinquish his chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but said he would not resign from Congress. According to an indictment, Menendez and his wife accepted gold bars and cash from a real estate developer in return for the senator using his clout to get that businessman a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund.

In an interview with Bustle published Tuesday, Johnson spoke about the film’s unfavorable reception while reflecting on what it was like to be a part of the project, saying that “it was definitely an experience for me to make that movie.” “I had never done anything like it before. I probably will never do anything like it again because I don’t make sense in that world. And I know that now,” she said. The “Fifty Shades” star continued, “But sometimes in this industry, you sign on to something, and it’s one thing and then as you’re making it, it becomes a completely different thing, and you’re like, ‘Wait, what?’” Johnson, who plays the clairvoyant Cassie Webb in “Madame Web,” said she’s “not surprised” that the film “has gone down the way it has” and added that “of course it’s not nice to be a part of something that’s ripped to shreds, but I can’t say that I don’t understand.” The actor also spoke on the challenges of getting movies made because “decisions are being made by committees, and art does not do well when it’s made by committee.” “Films are made by a filmmaker and a team of artists around them. You cannot make art based on numbers and algorithms. My feeling has been for a long time that audiences are extremely smart, and executives have started to believe that they’re not,” Johnson said. “Audiences will always be able to sniff out bullshit. Even if films start to be made with AI, humans aren’t going to fucking want to see those,” she continued. Many social media users on X, formerly Twitter, praised Johnson for her remarks in the interview.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iecc-icc-building-codes-climate_n_65e754f5e4b0170871fbcdbe,Gas Industry Loses Bid To Block Green Building Codes,alexander c. kaufman,3/5/2024,"The natural gas industry lost its initial bid to strip key climate-friendly measures out of national homebuilding guidelines, HuffPost has learned. The rules in the model building code will require new homes to come equipped with the circuitry to hook up induction stoves and electric car chargers, and will be used as a benchmark in almost every state. In November, trade associations representing gas utilities and furnace manufacturers launched a last-ditch effort to gut the provisions, which will be released this year. The International Code Council, the nonprofit organization that works with industry groups and local governments to write the generic codes enshrined into law across most of the country, even bent its own rules to grant players like the American Gas Association and the American Public Gas Association extra time to file appeals, HuffPost reported last month. The fossil fuel groups challenged codes that would make it cheaper for homeowners to opt out of gas, arguing that the proposals either fell outside the bounds of what the energy code was meant to do or were forged through improper procedures. But the ICC’s appeals board this week rejected all nine challenges to the latest energy codes, ruling that the “appellants have not demonstrated a material and significant irregularity of process or procedure.” The gas companies will have one more chance to make their case in a two-hour hearing later this month before the ICC’s board of directors, which will make a final decision at its March 18 meeting. The trade groups that filed the appeals say they plan to push the top executives to overturn the decisions. “This issue is, in fact, not concluded,” said Francis Dietz, a spokesperson for the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group for gas furnace manufacturers that filed an appeal. The American Public Gas Association said it was “disappointed” by the appeals board’s ruling, which the trade group representing municipal gas utilities framed as a threat to Americans’ access to “energy sources that they prefer.” “Fortunately, the appeals process is not over,” the trade group said in a statement to HuffPost. “In the end, the ICC’s Board of Directors will ultimately decide whether to support or reject the appeals. We are closely monitoring to see what they decide.” While the outcome isn’t guaranteed, two sources with knowledge of the process said it would be unusual for the executive panel to buck the appeals board’s recommendations. The ICC directed HuffPost to its public webpage about the current appeals process but did not respond to an emailed question about when the board of directors last overturned a decision by the appeals board. Rejecting the industry appeals may restore some credibility to the beleaguered ICC, whose once-sleepy tradition of updating the nation’s model building codes came under scrutiny in recent years following what advocates saw as an industry coup. “This is definitely a positive development, and we’ll see how the final step goes,” said Mike Waite, the director of codes at watchdog American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and a volunteer who helped author this year’s commercial building codes for the ICC. “The ICC needs to follow their written policies and we still need this code to go much further to hit our energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals.” Since the ICC became the national standard for model building codes in the 1990s, the organization had convened local governments and industry associations every three years to update its codebook. At the end of the process, elected officials alone voted on the final version of the codes, giving the ICC enough democratic legitimacy that virtually every state set its codes as the benchmark in local laws. In 2019, however, local governments under pressure to cut planet-heating emissions rallied to vote for the greenest energy codes enacted in a generation. Industry groups balked, first challenging local officials’ eligibility to vote, then filing appeals to strip key climate-friendly provisions out of the codebook. The ICC’s appeals board removed some provisions related to wiring needed for electric cars and appliances, handing a victory to the gas associations that challenged the codes. Then the ICC went a step further, and proposed eliminating governments’ right to vote on the final version of energy codes altogether. While elected officials would still get the last say on codes related to plumbing and swimming pools, energy codes would instead be written by “consensus”-minded committees where industry associations would enjoy equal representation with governments. Governments, including the newly-inaugurated Biden administration, urged the ICC against making the change. The ICC went ahead with the new system, which gas utilities hailed as a win for the industry. “Those appeals should not have been placed in front of it in the first place, so they made the correct judgment here.” Early on, gas companies sought broader influence over a system critics now saw as rigged — at least slightly — in the industry’s favor. Finding two-thirds supermajorities to enact proposals on each of the committees writing energy codes proved challenging. But the process ultimately yielded a proposed codebook for 2024 that the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory found improved efficiency by up to 10% and pushed decarbonization forward in particular with new electrification measures. While those efficiency gains fell short of the leaps the 2021 code made over its predecessor, the 2024 code’s circuitry for electric vehicles and appliances made significant progress on cutting emissions, according to the national lab’s preliminary analysis. Advocates who worked on the committees that wrote the latest code said the proposed 2024 codebook did not go as far as groups like ACEEE wanted, but the nonprofit said the compromise improvements made the package worth supporting. On its own, the fact that ICC broke its own rules to give the industry groups more time to file appeals amounted to a “scandal,” ACEEE said. But if the ICC granted the appeals and overturned the key electrification codes, ACEEE said advocates would look to abandon the ICC process altogether in favor of a new benchmark for model codes. “The appeals board itself dealt with what it had placed in front of it,” Waite said. “But those appeals should not have been placed in front of it in the first place, so they made the correct judgment here.” It’s still unclear how the next round of code-writing will play out, he said, and warned that advocates still doubt “that the ICC is a fair administrator of its own process.” Still, Waite said the appeals board’s ruling confirms that slashing planet-heating emissions is “within the scope” of the energy code-writing process. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

And so I did ‘Skirt Up Day’ and oh, my god. She lost it on me, and I was just not in the mood to back down.” Green said the fight was “a huge moment for everyone” on set at the time. Garth has spoken about her time on “90210” before, and said she also “struggled” with competitiveness stemming from being on the show. “If I’m honest, I think the show kind of taught me to be threatened by other girls, be threatened by other women and be more competitive because I wanted our costars’ approval or attention,” she said on an episode of her podcast, “9021OMG,” which she co-hosts with her former co-star and friend Tori Spelling, back in 2021.

Damian Hurley recently shared the first trailer for his feature directorial debut, “Strictly Confidential,” in which his 58-year-old mom gets hot and heavy with a younger woman (Pear Chiravara). Social media users were naturally baffled (and curious) by the trailer. “Part of me wants to thank [Damian Hurley], none of me wants to shake his hand,” one user wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “She’s a beautiful woman. It’s also peak Roman Empire for a kid to be directing mom in soft-core porn,” another wrote. According to People, “Strictly Confidential” is billed as a “sensual thriller with a devilish twist,” where a woman named Mia (Georgia Lock) goes to the Caribbean to investigate her friend’s death. While there, she meets Lily (Elizabeth Hurley) — and enters a “seductive world of sex, betrayal and murder.” Back in 2022, Damian Hurley explained on Instagram how his mother ended up in the film. “I want to worship [my mom] who, during the making of my first ever short film back in 2010 (when I was 8) promised me she’d be in my first feature,” he wrote at the time. “True to her word, the minute this film was greenlit, Mama dropped everything and raced out to the beautiful Caribbean to help.” While speaking with People, Damian Hurley elaborated on what it was like to work with his mother. “We only had 18 days to shoot the whole film, so our twin-like telepathy was invaluable throughout,” he said, adding that the “power dynamic” between them was “complicated at the best of times” but made for “a joy to come to work” with. Still, their upcoming collaboration has clearly unsettled some people.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kyrsten-sinema-senate-reelection_n_65e770f5e4b0d2a2475ae4cd,Kyrsten Sinema Announces She Won't Seek Reelection,igor bobic,3/5/2024,"Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) announced on Tuesday she won’t be seeking reelection in November, ending months of speculation about her political future. In a video released by her office, Sinema complained about the death of civility and compromise in American politics.` “The only political victories that matter these days are symbolic, attacking your opponents on cable news or social media. Compromise is a dirty word,” Sinema said. “I believe in my approach. But, it’s not what America wants right now.” “Because I choose civility, understanding, listening, working together to get stuff done, I will leave the Senate at the end of this year,” she added. Sinema’s decision not to run for reelection means that Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) is now set for a one-on-one race with election denier Kari Lake, the likely Republican candidate, in November. National Republicans believe Sinema’s exit will boost Lake’s chances of flipping the seat and winning control of the Senate next year. “An open seat in Arizona creates a unique opportunity for Republicans to build a lasting Senate majority this November,” Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement. “With recent polling showing Kyrsten Sinema pulling far more Republican voters than Democrat voters, her decision to retire improves Kari Lake’s opportunity to flip this seat.” Earlier public polls of a hypothetical matchup between Lake and Gallego have found Gallego leading or the two candidates neck-and-neck, with a large number of undecided voters. Lake, who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has been the outspoken supporter of Jan. 6, 2021, rioters, characterizing those prosecuted for their actions as “political prisoners.” She has also been a vocal critic of the late GOP Sen. Arizona Sen. John McCain. Gallego on Tuesday invited Sinema to help him defeat Lake in November. “Protecting abortion access, tackling housing affordability, securing our water supply, defending our democracy — all of this and more is on the line,” Gallego said in a statement. “That’s why Democrats, Independents, and Republicans alike are coming together and rejecting Kari Lake and her dangerous positions.” Sinema left the Democratic Party and became an independent in 2022. She has been fiercely criticized by some on the left for standing in the way of progressive priorities in the Senate, including a higher minimum wage, higher corporate tax rates, and the elimination of the filibuster. Those positions helped to effectively sour her standing with Democratic voters in Arizona. Her only path forward, had she chosen to run for reelection, would have been gathering enough signatures to appear on the ballot as an independent ― a difficult and risky campaign. Still, Sinema was deeply involved in crafting all the major bipartisan bills that passed in Congress in recent years, including the gun safety overhaul, infrastructure reform, new protections for gay marriage and improvements to the Electoral Count Act, to name a few. But it was the most recent negotiation over U.S. immigration and border policy that seemed to shake Sinema’s belief in bipartisan compromise. The next four years will change America forever.

Senate Republicans ― many of whom Sinema was closest to ― rejected her border bill at the last minute, leaving her fuming and now heading for the exits. “These solutions matter,” Sinema said of her bipartisan accomplishments on Tuesday. “They make an impact in the lives of everyday Americans.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. With endorsements from Wirecutter, Consumer Reports and Gear Patrol (along with thousands upon thousands of Amazon reviews), Coway is one of the most highly rated brands in the crowded space of air purification. When a Coway air purifier is on sale, you want to act fast to grab one at a discounted price. Right now, you can get the popular Coway Airmega 1512HH air purifier for 30% off its list price at Amazon. Unlike many bulky (and downright hideous) home appliances, the polished design of this device will actually make you want to show it off. It comes in black, white and a luxurious black and gold WiFi-enabled option (which is not on sale), and could easily become your favorite machine-turned-home decor. The sleek purifier has a complex, three-stage filter that captures and reduces up to 99.97% of irritating particles ― including pollen, pollutants and other allergens ― along with odors and volatile organic compounds (like airborne gases from your gas stove). It’s designed to purify rooms of up to 867 square feet and has a timer feature you can set to run one, four or eight hours before it automatically shuts off. It comes in black and white and measures 16.8 inches by 18.3 inches by 9.7 inches. When it comes time to replace your filters (the odor filter every six months and the HEPA once a year) the process couldn’t be any easier and a complete replacement set is easily available to grab with your purchase. You can see some promising reviews for the Coway down below or head back up to snag one for an impressive 30% off its regular price. Promising Amazon reviews: “Three weeks in and we couldn’t be happier with this filter. Quiet and effective. If it detects contaminants the light turns red and the fan kicks up to high, which is a bit loud (when set to auto), but it doesn’t run high for long.We have a woodstove for heat, which creates a lot of dust. This has cut it back a lot, and has cut the amount of dusting I have to do overall.We’re both breathing easier, and its cut down on the smell of our 2 large house dogs.” — SpragueRiverHomestead “Fed up with musty odors and dust this winter, we got several air purifiers. This one deserves its top reputation. It really cleans the air in a room―even a large room. I used to wake up with a headache every day; once we started using this guy, those were a thing of the past. My son was having trouble with allergies (probably to dust or mold), and we swapped units. After he started running this one in his room, he was fine. He could get a similar result with the other units only by running them at a higher, noisy level.The sleep mode is not completely silent, but quiet enough for me (a light sleeper). It is also not completely dark, but it’s easy enough to put an opaque object over the bright LED that can’t be turned off when the unit is on.One really great feature of this purifier is that if it loses power and then the power comes on again, it will start up with the same setting it was on before. All of our other air purifiers, once the power goes off, you have to manually turn it on again for it to run. Why does this matter? I plugged the Coway airmega into a smart plug so that I can control it from afar―turn it on when I’m away from home, or schedule it to run for a certain number of hours each day and turn itself off and on again. I can’t do that with the Levoits.” — Emommy “I have two Coway air purifiers in my apartment and have run them non-stop for nearly 5 years, aside from cleaning and changing filters. Online reviews said they are durable and this is quite true. Some of my favorite features:- Easy to service. There are three layers of filtration - a screen behind the front cover that captures lint, hair, large items, an activated charcoal filter to remove odors and a true HEPA filter behind that. Removing the outer cover to vacuum the screen is very easy. Accessing the other filters is also a snap.- Very durable. As I mentioned, mine are nearly 5 years old and one has always been in a room with my two boys, so seen its fair share of knocks.- Ability to run int auto mode where it speeds up if it detects pollutants- Adjustable sensitivity to pollutants- Three fan speeds. The first two are nearly silent. The 3rd (high) makes a decent amount of noise, but the only time I ever use high is during extreme wildfire/smog events or if cooking something smokey. Middle speed moves plenty of air and should be all you need.The only con I can think of is that my interior designer wife is not crazy about their appearance. Doesn’t bother me. One of my favorite home products.” — SeattleGreen By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

By 12:30 p.m., the outages, which were reported around the world, appeared largely resolved, according to tracking website Downdetector.com. Meta’s head of communications, Andy Stone, blamed a “technical issue” for some users’ inability to access the company’s servers. “We resolved the issue as quickly as possible for everyone who was impacted, and we apologize for any inconvenience,” he said in a statement posted to X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Facebook appeared to get hit the hardest of all Meta-owned sites, with nearly 500,000 users reporting outages just before 11 a.m. Messaging app WhatsApp, in comparison, only had a few hundred reported outages, according to Downdetector.com. The outages became a trending topic on X, with Meta users turning to the rival social media platform to express grievances. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

It didn’t work. (Watch the video below.) On a Saturday night airing of “King Charles” on CNN, the two watched a clip of Trump bragging about Black supporters who have “embraced” the shirts, which bear Trump’s booking photo in Georgia over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. “When you heard that, what did you think?” Gayle asked the basketball Hall of Famer. “First of all, I’m just going to say this: If I see a Black person walking around with Trump mugshot, I’m gonna punch him in the face,” Barkley replied. “Charles, you really can’t say that, ’cause, A, you don’t mean that,” King shot back. “Oh, I mean that sincerely,” he said. “And then you will be arrested for assault, and then what?” King said, perhaps still hoping for Barkley to withdraw the remark. “I’m gonna bail myself out and go celebrate,” Barkley responded. When the studio guests laughed, King told them not to encourage her colleague. The clip went viral and has been viewed by more than 7 million people.

The “Anti-Hero” hitmaker’s push for the polls comes after much talk about her potential endorsement for President Joe Biden.

It’s hard to miss in the skin care sphere, and is personally one of my favorite, must-have devices. If you’ve been eyeing one of these delightful tools then I have good news for you, because NuFace is having its Friends & Family sale this week, making it the perfect time to splurge on the brand’s award-winning devices and skin care products. Enjoy 25% off sitewide today through March 11— no code at checkout required. If you’re a skin care devotee, having a high-tech skin care device or two in your repertoire is the perfect way to amp up your beauty routine. From LED light masks to lasers and facial toning devices, the addition of a high-quality beauty tool can make quite a difference to a wide range of skin issues, from acne to tone and texture, fine lines, sagging skin, anti-aging and more. Unfortunately, if you want to get a device that actually works, you may have to make a pretty steep financial investment, which is why any time there’s a sale happening, we love to jump on it. The NuFace in particular is a great investment. It’s an FDA-cleared microcurrent device that claims to gently stimulate the face and neck in an effort to tone, lift and contour facial muscles and reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles. You can purchase various additional attachments, like a red light wrinkle reducer and a lip and eye wand, to make it a more versatile, multifunctional tool. It has five different intensity levels, so you can also work your way up if you find it to be a bit too strong at first. Users swear by its effectiveness, and I’ve noticed that nearly a year of regular use has resulted in firmer, tighter and even brighter skin around my face, jawline and neck. Used consistently, the NuFace Trinity can be an excellent complement to even the simplest beauty routine. I like to use it while watching TV — I just throw on the conductive gel and go to town for five to 10 minutes a day. It’s easy to incorporate into your regimen and will stand the test of time, making it worth ever penny. Below, I’ve rounded up a few of NuFace’s most popular items.

The union election held at the Ivy League school in Hanover, New Hampshire, could prove to be historic, but the legal battle over whether the players can bargain collectively is far from over. Dartmouth’s trustees have disputed the athletes’ legal status as employees eligible to unionize. It could be years before the case is resolved at the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees private-sector union elections, and possibly federal court afterwards. “These players are our members and we welcome them warmly.” But for now, the players have made clear they intend to bargain over their working conditions as part of the Service Employees International Union Local 560, the same group that represents cooks, custodians, groundskeepers and other workers on campus. The vote tally was 13-2 in the union’s favor. “These players are our members and we welcome them warmly,” the union’s president, Chris Peck, said in a statement. “We’re all looking forward to standing in solidarity as they begin to negotiate their historic first contract.” Dartmouth said in a statement that it was “proud to build productive relationships” with its unions, but that it doesn’t believe the basketball players are workers. “In this isolated circumstance ... the students on the men’s basketball team are not in any way employed by Dartmouth,” the school said. “For Ivy League students who are varsity athletes, academics are of primary importance, and athletic pursuit is part of the educational experience.” The National Collegiate Athletics Association, the governing body for college sports, has always insisted that college athletes are not employees, despite being the center of a billion-dollar industry. Union campaigns have percolated within the NCAA for years, but until Tuesday none had made it so far as to see the ballots opened following a vote. Football players at Northwestern University in Illinois held an election in 2014, but the labor board impounded the ballots pending the school’s appeal. Members of the board ultimately declined jurisdiction in the case, killing the union effort by punting on the politically explosive question of whether the athletes were really employees. 🏀MAKING HISTORY!🏀 Dartmouth Men's Bball team votes to join SEIU L560—our 500-strong union of campus custodians, security officers, museum guides, and others. @Dartmouth, it’s time to bargain a fair contract. NCAA athletes deserve better #UnionsForAll #GoBigGreen #MarchMadness pic.twitter.com/TAToB36hwI Changes in NLRB election rules since then allowed for the Dartmouth ballots to be opened on Tuesday immediately following the vote. The school filed a Hail Mary-motion last week trying to either block the election from happening or have the ballots locked up while its legal challenge played out. The labor board did not oblige. But immediately after Tuesday’s vote, the school appealed the decision that allowed for the vote to take place. That puts the issue before the NLRB’s board members in Washington. Due to appointments by President Joe Biden, the labor board now has a Democratic majority that tends to hold a broader, more union-friendly view of collective bargaining rights, with a track record that bodes well for the players and the SEIU. The board also had a Democratic majority when it decided to extinguish the Northwestern union effort, but the political and legal landscape around college sports has changed significantly over the past decade. College players can now profit off their name, image and likeness, while recent polling shows a majority of Americans believe college athletes should be paid directly by their schools. “The labor board now has a Democratic majority that tends to hold a broader, more union-friendly view of collective bargaining rights.” The next four years will change America forever.

Meanwhile, a separate NLRB case revolves around whether football and basketball players at the University of Southern California qualify as employees for the purpose of labor law. The labor board’s general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, argues that the university, the PAC-12 conference and the NCAA have misclassified the players as “student athletes” rather than the employees they are. Abruzzo told HuffPost in a 2021 interview that she believes college athletes are workers under the law. “If players at academic institutions feel like they want to choose a union to represent them in discussions with their employer over wages or working conditions ... then they should be filing [union representation] petitions,” she said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/j-michael-luttig-scotus-ballot-ruling_n_65e7326ee4b0d2a2475ac2f1,Conservative Legal Icon Has Harsh Words For Supreme Court’s Trump Ballot Ruling,josephine harvey,3/5/2024,"Conservative former federal Judge J. Michael Luttig slammed the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling allowing Donald Trump to remain on 2024 ballots, calling elements of the decision “stunning in its overreach.” On CNN Monday, Luttig said the ruling was “both astonishing and unprecedented, not for its decision of the exceedingly narrow question presented by the case — though that issue was important — but rather for its decision to reach and decide a myriad of the other constitutional issues surrounding disqualification under 14th Amendment.” Luttig, a former veteran conservative jurist on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, was among a number of prominent legal minds to begin publicly arguing last year that Trump was ineligible to hold office again under the so-called insurrection clause of the Constitution — Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. He filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in January, arguing his point. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously Monday that states do not have the authority to bar the former president from appearing on ballots, overturning a Colorado court’s decision to do so. The Supreme Court also ruled that only Congress has the authority to disqualify federal candidates under Section 3. The three liberal justices and conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett disagreed with that decision. In a concurrence, the liberal justices said they protested the “majority’s effort to use this case to define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision.” Barrett, in her own concurrence, wrote that the case did not require the court to decide the “complicated question” of whether federal legislation is the only enforcement mechanism for Section 3. According to Luttig, in deciding those questions unnecessarily, the majority “effectively decided that the former president will never be disqualified from holding the presidency in 2024 or ever for that matter.” He added, “But even more importantly, as the concurrence said, effectively, the court today decided that no person in the future will ever be disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, regardless of whether he or she has engaged in an insurrection or rebellion against the Constitution of the United States.” Listen to his analysis below on CNN’s “The Lead.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

(Watch the video below.) The former president baselessly insinuated last month at CPAC that California balloting is corrupt, but that God could fix that ― and guide him to victory. “If God came down and God was the vote checker, I believe we would win,” said Trump, who lost to Joe Biden by more than 5 million votes in the state in 2020. Not to mention that predominantly Democratic California has not voted for a Republican candidate in a presidential election since 1988. But that was beside the point for Meyers. “I doubt God wants anything to do [with you],” the “Late Night” host told Trump. “If God came down and counted votes, I’m sure you’d accuse him of cheating too.” Meyers then went into his Trump impression. “I find the robe very suspicious, the long flowing robes which he wears even in the summer,” the comedian said in Trump’s voice. “Even in the summer, a robe? You see the videos of him walking into the voting center. The robe is normal. And then he walks out. The robe is bulky. Because he’s hiding ballots under the robe and no one will check the robe because we’re all too woke now.” Fast forward to 2:25 for Meyers’ takedown of Trump’s heavenly hope.

David Franklin Slater, 63, was arrested Saturday after allegedly conspiring to transmit and transmitting classified information about Russia’s war on Ukraine to the unnamed individual over a three-month period in early 2022, which is when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began. “Dear, what is shown on the screens in the special room?? It is very interesting,” one message sent to Slater in March read, according to a copy of the three-count federal indictment. “You have a job in the Operations Center today, I remember, I’m sure there is a lot of interesting news there?” another message read. Slater, dubbed the person’s “Secret informant love” and “secret agent,” became employed in a classified area at the Offutt Air Force Base, south of Omaha, in 2021 after retiring as a lieutenant colonel from the Army the year prior. He was assigned to the United States Strategic Command at the base and attended classified briefings regarding Russia’s war against Ukraine from February to April 2022, according to the indictment. In messages allegedly exchanged between the pair, the individual asked for information about classified briefings and military strategies that could impact Russian President Vladimir Putin’s assault. “Dave, I hope tomorrow NATO will prepare a very unpleasant ‘surprise’ for Putin! Will you tell me?” one message cited in the indictment read. “Sweet Dave, the supply of weapons is completely classified, which is great!” read another. Another message applauded Slater for allegedly sharing information about NATO members’ movement by train before it was announced publicly on the news. “You are my secret informant love! How were your meetings? Successfully?” the message read. Slater, whose initial court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday, faces up to 10 years in prison for each count of conspiracy to transmit and the transmission of national defense information. He did not have an attorney listed. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tricia-rose-systemic-racism-book_n_65e5fc96e4b013678e163080,Where Is Systemic Anti-Blackness Lurking In 2024?,chaz l. cruz,3/5/2024,"During the past few years, discussions about racism and social inequities have swelled, especially in professional settings. The main message: Racism is bad. Let’s shut it down somehow. Yet, we’re not seeing progress. Instead, we’re seeing the implementation of anti-affirmative action laws, the elimination of diversity and equity inclusion positions, and the censorship of books that critically examine racism’s legacy and its insidious nature. Living in this contradictory reality sometimes makes me want to yell, “Computer, end program!” But I’m a gamer, so I stay in the game. What keeps me grounded and focused is that countless individuals share the vision of a more just and safe world — a world where we learn from our collective past and use that knowledge to cultivate systems that uplift — a world where cultural and systemic anti-Blackness is dismantled. Professor Tricia Rose is one of those touchstones who makes me feel hopeful; she’s spent much of her career shedding necessary insight on how to confront pervasive issues directly. In her latest book, “Metaracism: How Systemic Racism Devastated Black Lives — and How We Break Free,” which drops on March 5, she delves fearlessly into the intricate web of institutional anti-Blackness, offering vivid analysis of its impact on all of our lives. By tracing racism’s insidious influence across generations and through various societal institutions, we can better understand how we can arm ourselves against it. Ahead of her book release, I had the honor of chatting with Rose about what she feels are the most potent and pressing issues we, as Black and people of color, face today. Drawing from her extensive research, data analysis, and lived experiences, she provides powerful narratives and strategies for liberation and empowerment. In her work, she invites readers to critically engage with the systems perpetuating inequality, empowering them to become agents for change. What called you to write “Metaracism” at this particular moment in time, and what do you hope readers will take away from it? I started this larger project on systemic racism about eight years ago when I was teaching a class, and I began to realize that there was a lot of confusion around how racism worked. [The students] thought it was all attitudes and behaviors and individual mistreatments. The idea that affirmative action was reverse racism: even the Black kids, white kids, and other ethnic groups felt that way. I realized they didn’t understand what was happening. This is not just about individual values, beliefs, and attitudes. This process is built in such a way that you can be a neutral participant and really make a very negative contribution — you can be a nonconscious participant. So, visuals became important to me. People do not easily see how education and all these details connected to criminal justice and high levels of punishment and policing in and out of schools — they are really complicatedly interconnected over time. So, that’s when I started doing research about how these connections accumulate. And I realized this was much bigger than what I thought it was. What actionable steps or strategies do you suggest for anyone who is empowered to dismantle deeply embedded racism? The chapter at the end of the book focuses on what it takes to break free, and by that, I’m hoping people don’t think, “Oh, we changed this policy; we’ll be good,” or “We changed this approach to education, and it’ll solve it.” Many of us are trapped in a paradigm, and that paradigm includes the myth that racism is not systemic. That myth that society generally works fine, minus the couple of unintended consequences or bad apples or whatever. But when you change your paradigm and you tell stories that show the power of the interconnections and the way they harm Black people specifically, once you start unpacking that paradigm, a new one emerges. That new one means you’re asking different questions, and that’s the beginning of individual and collective change. One part of that argument really resonated with me — specifically where you say, in the book, “Our individual experiences are better understood when they are systemically informed.” I’m glad I said that! We are individuals. We don’t want to say, “I’m Black, I’m Latinx, I’m whatever it is, and this is the only experience I can have.” Many people have many constellations of disadvantages; they are not all the same. And our own individual will, intelligence, opportunity, luck can change things for us, but when we understand ourselves in the bigger picture of how things are systemically arranged, we should be more proud of how well we do and how much we contribute. We should recognize that we know more about the world we are in and what we are subjected to. It is empowering to me to know that. How do you navigate the heaviness of discussing systemic racism while also offering hope that things can potentially change? This is probably one of the most important difficulties that I’ve faced. I think if I try to empathize by exploring and exposing this reality that, it may be temporarily despairing. But if it’s going to continue on, then not knowing about it is actually self-destructive and dangerous. Pretending it’s not going on because you do not want to hear the details — this really diminishes your ability to effectively organize for the kinds of changes that will help the whole world, especially for those who are brown and Black people. For everybody, really. This system is designed to make things more difficult, not for everyone at every moment, but overall. I need to know this if I’m going to do well and if I’m planning to protect people around me. I think that we have muscles for dealing with human suffering — the muscles it takes to deal with human suffering in terms of landslides and genocides, and the Ukraine war, children starving. The world has a lot of suffering in it. But you have to develop the muscles for responding to that in the right way. And you don’t do that by running away. How do you, in this book, speak to non-Black readers or those who may be resistant or defensive readers in these difficult conversations? One of the things I tried to make clear was that Black people are specifically positioned in the ways I described at length, and that doesn’t mean that others are not a part of an oppressive system. But [these struggles] are not identical. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

That only scratches the surface of what’s been going on. And it not only impacts journalism, but the livelihood of journalists as well. That’s especially so for marginalized journalists who already over-index as freelancers. On the most recent episode of “I Know That’s Right,” HuffPost deputy front page editor and social media’s favorite news curator Phil Lewis noted that a big concern is audiences getting credible news about communities that typically go under-covered. “When you have all of these issues combining in an election year, all these things are happening and it’s this confluence of different factors and stresses on the field that are really making it difficult for journalists to cover the stories we find important,” he said. What makes matters worse is the rise in misinformation, via robocalls, AI and social media that erroneously parade as the truth. Lewis advises folks to tap into their local outlets and read more than one story on a single topic. As far as the future of newsrooms is concerned, Lewis believes we’ll begin to see more worker-owned publications like Defector, Hell Gate and 404 Media.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/egypt-gaza-ceasefire-talks-end-israel-ramadan_n_65e74460e4b0170871fbc57e,"With Ramadan Days Away, Egypt Says Gaza Cease-Fire Talks End Without Breakthrough","samy magdy, tia goldenberg, wafaa shurafa",3/5/2024,"CAIRO (AP) — Three days of negotiations with Hamas over a cease-fire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages ended Tuesday without a breakthrough, Egyptian officials said, less than a week before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the informal deadline for a deal. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent weeks trying to broker an agreement in which Hamas would release up to 40 hostages in return for a six-week cease-fire, the release of some Palestinian prisoners and an influx of aid to address the humanitarian catastrophe in the isolated territory. Two Egyptian officials said the latest round of discussions had ended. They said Hamas presented a proposal that mediators would discuss with Israel in the coming days. Hamas has refused to release all of the estimated 100 hostages it holds, and the remains of around 30 more, unless Israel ends its offensive, withdraws from Gaza and releases a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including senior militants serving life sentences. U.S. officials have said they are skeptical that Hamas actually wants a deal because the group has balked at a number of what the U.S. and others believe are legitimate requests, including giving the names of hostages to be released. “It is on Hamas to make decisions about whether it is prepared to engage,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday. “We have an opportunity for an immediate cease-fire that can bring hostages home, that can dramatically increase the amount of humanitarian aid getting in to Palestinians who so desperately need it, and can set the conditions for an enduring resolution,” Blinken said. Jihad Taha, a Hamas spokesperson, said the negotiations were ongoing but “the ball is in the Israeli court.” He said Israel had thus far refused Hamas’ demands for people who fled northern Gaza to be allowed to return and for guarantees of a long-term cease-fire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. “Hamas is open to proposals and initiatives that are consistent with its position calling for a cease-fire, withdrawal, the return of the displaced, the entry of relief convoys and reconstruction,” Taha said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly rejected Hamas’ demands and repeatedly vowed to continue the war until Hamas is dismantled and all the hostages are returned. Israel did not send a delegation to the latest round of talks. An Israeli official said Israel was still waiting for Hamas to hand over a list of hostages who are alive as well the hostage-to-prisoner ratio it seeks in any release deal. It was not clear if that information was included in the latest proposal. The Israeli and Egyptian officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media on the negotiations. Benny Gantz, a member of Netanyahu’s War Cabinet and his main political rival, met with senior U.S. officials in Washington on a visit that drew a rebuke from the prime minister, the latest sign of a growing rift within Israel’s leadership. Mediators had hoped to broker an agreement ahead of Ramadan, the month of dawn-to-dusk fasting that often sees heightened Israeli-Palestinian tensions linked to access to a major holy site in Jerusalem. The month is expected to begin around March 10, depending on the sighting of the moon. “The negotiations are sensitive. I can’t say there is optimism or pessimism, but we haven’t yet reached a point at which we can achieve a cease-fire,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Monday. The war began with a Hamas attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostages. More than 100 of them were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. The attack sparked an Israeli invasion of the enclave of 2.3 million people that Gaza’s Health Ministry says has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians. Aid groups say the fighting has displaced most of the territory’s population and pushed a quarter of the population to the brink of famine. The U.N. children’s agency said Monday that at least 10 children have reportedly died in isolated northern Gaza because of dehydration and malnutrition. “There are likely more children fighting for their lives somewhere in one of Gaza’s few remaining hospitals, and likely even more children in the north unable to obtain care at all,” Adele Khodr, the UNICEF regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. “These tragic and horrific deaths are man-made, predictable and entirely preventable,” she added. The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that 15 children have starved to death at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza and another six were at risk of dying from malnutrition and dehydration. It was not clear if the children had underlying medical conditions that increased their vulnerability. Northern Gaza, the first target of Israel’s offensive, has suffered mass devastation. The World Food Program recently suspended aid shipments to the north, citing the breakdown of security. An attempt by the Israeli military to bring in aid ended in tragedy last week when over 100 Palestinians were fatally shot by Israeli forces or trampled to death in a melee. Up to 300,000 Palestinians are believed to remain in northern Gaza after Israel ordered the evacuation of the entire region, including Gaza City, in October. Many have been reduced to eating animal fodder to survive. The U.N. says one in six children under 2 in the north suffer from acute malnutrition. The United States and other countries have carried out air drops in recent days, but aid groups say the expensive, last-ditch measure is not enough to address the soaring needs. Israel is still carrying out strikes in all parts of Gaza and has threatened to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, where around half of Gaza’s population has sought refuge. Gantz has said the Rafah operation could begin as soon as Ramadan if there is no deal on the hostages. Gaza’s Health Ministry said 97 people had been killed over the last 24 hours. bringing the overall Palestinian death toll to 30,631. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures, but says women and children make up around two-thirds of the total casualties. Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames the high toll on Hamas because the militants operate in dense, residential areas. But the army rarely accounts for individual strikes, which often kill women and children. The next four years will change America forever.

Lindsay Lohan officially confirmed on Monday that the beloved 2003 body-swap comedy is finally getting a sequel. After years of anticipation, Lohan said on SiriusXM’s “Andy Cohen Live” that she and Jamie Lee Curtis will return. “It is [true],” she told host Andy Cohen. “I don’t want to say too much. And we’re both excited.” Lohan caught herself and cheekily added, “I’m gonna speak for Jamie.” The duo spoke with The New York Times last year to celebrate the film’s 20th anniversary and teased fans with hopes for a sequel. “As I went around the world with ‘Halloween Ends,’ people wanted to know if there was going to be another ‘Freaky Friday,’” Curtis told the outlet. “Something really touched a chord … I called my friends at Disney and said, ‘It feels like there’s a movie to be made.’” Lohan added at the time that they’d “only make something that people would absolutely adore.” While she told People on Monday the sequel is “in the process,” however, a date to start filming remains under wraps. The first film starred Lohan and Curtis as a mother-daughter duo who magically swap bodies, but it wasn’t an original. Based on a 1972 Mary Rodgers novel, it was first adapted in 1976 with Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris and again in 1996 with Shelley Long and Gaby Hoffmann. The 2003 iteration was the most commercially successful take, however, and grossed more than $160 million at the worldwide box office — and spawned endless fan fever with every hint of a possible sequel in the decades to come.

Lohan, who was once deemed one of the most promising actors of her generation but left the spotlight amid substance abuse struggles, told People that she’s “just excited to work with Jamie again and see how much further we can take” the body-swap premise. The actor’s cinematic return is in full swing, however, with a three-film Netflix deal and surprise cameo in 2024’s musical version of “Mean Girls.” The newfound mother might just find her real comeback with “Freaky Friday 2.” “I think we’re going to have a lot of fun with this,” she told People.

At the end of the live show, the “High Horse” singer appeared onstage alongside host Sydney Sweeney and the rest of the cast members. Someone on X (formerly Twitter) posted a screenshot of the interaction between the actor and the country singer, which prompted Musgraves to point out her tiny fashion fail. “I just want someone to look at me the way Sydney Sweeney looks at Kacey Musgraves,” a follower wrote. “The clip.

Show a little restraint when you win. Show a little restraint when you don’t win.” Fox News host Trey Gowdy says Trump should exhibit some ""humility"" on the SCOTUS ballot ruling because it's very likely the court will also overwhelmingly rule against him on presidential immunity.""It's confusing when you say 'I love you' on one day and 'I hate you' the next."" pic.twitter.com/5Gg11O6Xn3 The U.S. Supreme Court’s Monday ruling ended an effort in several states to remove Trump from ballots over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection under the so-called insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment. In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that states do not have the authority to disqualify candidates for federal office under that clause. Trump called the decision a “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” Later, in remarks from his Mar-a-Lago estate, he urged the Supreme Court to rule in his favor on his claims of presidential immunity.

If they’re not allowed to do their job, it’s not what the founders wanted, but perhaps even more importantly it will be terrible for the country.” Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to rule on Trump’s claims that he is immune from prosecution for his actions as president, scheduling oral arguments for April 22. This means a delay of at least several months for Trump’s federal election interference trial. If it’s pushed back past the November election, and Trump returns to the White House, he could order the case to be dismissed. He is also criminally charged in three other cases.

While Willis admitted to having a relationship with Nathan Wade, whom she hired as one of the three special prosecutors in the case in November 2021, she said the romance didn’t start until the spring of 2022. Both testified their relationship ended last summer. David Shafer, a defendant in the case, has contested the testimony by Willis and Wade about when they started dating. In a court filing submitted Monday, Shafer’s lawyers Craig Gillen and Holly Pierson requested to subpoena Cindi Lee Yeager, a co-chief deputy district attorney for Cobb County, Georgia, for testimony if Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee grants a request to reopen hearings into the potential disqualification of Willis. Gillen and Pierson claim Yeager could testify that lawyer Terrance Bradley, who has previously appeared before the court, told her Willis and Wade “definitely” started dating when Willis was running for the district attorney’s office in 2019 through 2020. Bradley has already testified before McAfee, but said he was “speculating” when defense attorneys brought up a text he sent them stating he believed Wade and Willis had been dating since she was municipal court judge. Shafer’s attorneys added that Yeager could also provide testimony on a conversation she allegedly heard take place between Willis and Bradley when he visited her office around September 2023. Willis, according to the court documents, called Bradley to discuss an article in the press about how much Wade was being paid for his work on the Fulton County probe. “They are coming after us,” Willis allegedly told Bradley. “You don’t need to talk to them about anything about us.” Shafer’s lawyers added that Yeager became “concerned” over the inconsistencies she spotted in Bradley’s testimony. It’s unclear if this will have an impact on how McAfee will rule. The judge said Friday he would issue a decision on whether Willis should be disqualified within the next two weeks. “I think it’s been very much made clear by the argument made today that there are several legal issues to sort through, several factual determinations I have to make, and those aren’t ones I can make at this moment,” he said. Willis’ office has not commented on the allegations included in Monday’s filing, but the Fulton County district attorney has previously fiercely defended herself against accusations of wrongdoing. “I’m not on trial no matter how hard you try to put me on trial,” she told defense attorneys in a hearing last month.

They claim Wade paid for trips the two took with the money he made working on the election case. Willis has dismissed the allegations, claiming she split the costs with Wade and reimbursed him in cash. Shafer, Trump and 17 others were indicted in August over their efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. Four defendants have so far reached plea deals with prosecutors.

The “Shark Tank” star’s remark went viral on X, formerly Twitter, amid nagging concerns about Biden’s age — even though he is just four years older than his likely opponent, Donald Trump. While Trump is getting flak for his recent verbal stumbles, confidence in the incumbent has reportedly waned. According to a New York Times poll of 980 registered voters published Sunday, more than 60% of the voters who backed Biden in 2020 now believe he’s “just too old” to govern effectively. Cuban, the co-founder of Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs, was at the White House to advocate for lower prescription drug prices. The billionaire businessman told Bloomberg he was voting for Nikki Haley in Tuesday’s Texas Republican primary as a “protest vote against Trump.” Cuban buttressed his support for Biden by riffing on Elon Musk’s X post joking that Cuban would vote for the president if he were a flesh-eating zombie.

I’m gonna do it in a funny way. We’re gonna be on the stage.

The fact that his Netflix film “They Cloned Tyrone” premiered in June certainly didn’t help. Foxx himself previously touched on the rampant speculation and joked in December: “I know a lot of people been saying I was cloned out there. Boy, ya’ll ain’t shit.” While his exact medical diagnosis remains private, Foxx was just “thankful” to be here Sunday. “Because it was really … it’s beyond the scope,” he said at the luncheon. “Cherish life.

Here's What It Did To My Grief.",diana weisman,3/5/2024,"Artificial intelligence is widely believed to be the next frontier — an uncharted future, primed for exploration and new life — but since learning about ChatGPT, I can only think about the after-life. Will the way we view death transform with technology? It’s a question I’ve been asking myself for over 10 years. My recognition of a new type of graveyard began when I was a teenager and I understood a young person’s death meant they left behind more than just family or belongings — it also meant Facebook pages with entire personalities frozen in time. A profile of a deceased classmate would hold 300+ photos of a night buying slurpees at 7-Eleven, a badge proclaiming they “liked” baby sloths, and comments from friends saying they’d see them tomorrow. We were part of generation “me,” which made the sudden absence of “them” feel even more haunting in the digital realm. At that time, Facebook was also not prepared for the fact that its “friends” would die and their profiles would remain. After users started to get notifications to “add” their dead loved ones, the company made updates to its profile settings and created a process by which users could be allowed to control a deceased connection’s “digital legacy.” An explainer video on Facebook reads: “We live in a digital world, what happens when we leave it behind?” When my dad left his behind in 2019, I couldn’t bear to visit his Facebook page, but knowing it existed made it hard to avoid. There were too many comments left from people I didn’t know, all of whom proclaimed to love my Dad. It felt like a virtual tombstone that my family did not create. I didn’t know what was worse — the heartfelt messages from strangers or knowing that he’d never respond. I investigated how to get the page taken down so I wouldn’t be tempted to look at it again, but gave up filling out the online form required to do so when Facebook asked me to provide a death certificate. I thought, You want me to throw my dad’s death certificate into my at-home scanner to prove you should delete his page? I guess it’s probably a fair ask when I think about it now. One might wonder then, after years of avoiding his digital poltergeist, why I’d be hoping to get ChatGPT to speak like my dad. The concept came to me around the time of my wedding, when I contemplated revealing to our guests my life’s biggest regret: that my husband and dad had not gotten a chance to meet. I wanted to admit my failing to bring them together in my vows as a sort of public, emotional self-lashing, but that would have been a total downer. Having been exposed to ChatGPT in my work, I saw AI as my out. If I could train the bot to follow the speech patterns of my father, maybe he and my husband might finally be able to have a conversation. I knew this task would be challenging, as ChatGPT requires very specific prompts to produce optimal results. I would need to provide the bot with a full profile of my dad’s speaking characteristics for it to copy, and maybe even feed it past examples from our text conversations. For added flair, I could ask the bot to interrupt every now and then with a cough, as my dad frequently did from smoking cigarettes all his life. After working out lines of basic descriptions, like his age and the amount of words with which he would usually respond, I realized how difficult the rest of this process was going to be. Chats with my dad were often extremely random and I’d usually walk away from them wondering what it was we were even talking about. This was not because he didn’t know how to have a discussion, but because he was likely thinking of numerous things at once. As a documentary producer who worked in his field for 40 years, my dad was very creative and could make any conversation into a story. You could argue he was always producing your very interaction. He might begin singing lyrics to a song you didn’t know or drop names of people you’ve never met and then it was over. That was him. You never knew what you would get. So, could I get a bot to be him? The more I tried, the more my excitement waned. I spent hours researching the proper prompts and wrote long soliloquies dissecting my father’s persona. But every time the bot offered a response that sounded nothing like my dad — like when it called me a “youngster,” I could see the mask slip. In the midst of this private experiment, I began working with a creative who goes by Shxpir (pronounced Shakespeare). Even before we met, I knew we would have a lot in common, but I didn’t think we’d both be thinking about death. As we got to talking on the set of an ad campaign, he revealed he also had lost his father and was using tech to work through those emotions. In contrast to my guilt, his stemmed from a lack of having ample photographs of his father. He told me he’d been feeling his dad’s physicality in this world slipping from his memory with each passing day. Now, he’s working to render his father virtually, and in 3D, from the images he does have. His project will be completed in a few months and it will allow him to create new images of his father from every angle. In awe of his dedication, I asked Shxpir how he finds the strength to continue the project, as I continuously stumble over emotional roadblocks — memories, pain, the occasional cry — that keep me from trying again. “Sometimes I don’t know if I can handle it,” he admitted to me. Back in 2021, Shxpir began working on a proposal for a business that would recreate deceased loved ones digitally and is now actively working on his own Metaverse funeral for whenever he’s no longer on this planet. With a deep understanding of art and years of digital rendering experience, Shxpir knew that the business of death and mourning, like that of fashion and cosmetics, could be thrust into the digital space at any moment. Although it’s become more of a side project, rendering his dad has remained an important mission for him. “At the end of the day,” he told me with a resolve I could feel through the phone, “as an artist, it’s an experiment for my personal growth.” After some time, I stopped my experiment with ChatGPT and logged into an AI video generator for the first time. I typed “older man talking on the phone” into the generator bar and waited to see what it would return to me. For a long time, I wanted to create art about a vivid dream I had after my dad died. I even sought advice from a dream analyst to help interpret it. In the dream, I was on the phone with my dad and I suddenly realized his voice started to sound different, as if someone had been impersonating him the whole time. It felt so horrifyingly vivid, I woke up thinking I should call my dad and make sure he was OK. After the AI digested my prompt, a face appeared on the screen: a brunette older man, slightly balding, wearing large glasses and hunched over a desk while talking on the phone. I was surprised. Wow, there he is, I thought. He had about four extra fingers, a feature AI tends to trip up on, but he looked a lot like my dad. I went on from there, creating small one-second video scenes using the AI, until I had compiled a full visual retelling of my dream. The process of acquiring the “footage” felt strangely peaceful in its impassiveness. The AI did not ask why I wanted to create this rendering, it just provided scenes in response to my prompts. I added words and phrases like “film noir style” to get a darker effect. I could calmly say “try again” if it did not give me the render I wanted. The graphics it output looked human, but also alien — part dream, part nightmare. The shapes of people were not fully formed. The colors moved on the screen like ink in water. I thought one of the brunette women it rendered looked like me too. I finished the piece by adding my own audio narration and titled it “The Call.” After watching the final product, tears flowed from the bottomless pit that is the well of grief. But I also breathed a sigh of relief. Communicating with AI — creating this piece — gave me a sense of closure I hadn’t felt before. Still, I wondered if this whole process was healthy, or if I had just fallen for an illusion of feeling understood. I reached out to my friend and colleague Marni Blank for her perspective. Marni is a death doula — a person who guides people through the end-of-life process — for either themselves or a loved one. Her response to my project made me feel better. “Some people need to go through the stage of revisiting memories of the person or photos, over and over again — or some people need distance,” she told me. “I think it’s just about what that person needs at that moment.” Social media has also reprogrammed our brains to want to keep a white-knuckled grasp on our memories. “We live in an age where it’s really hard to let go of anything,” Marni said. “Pre-Instagram, you could completely forget someone you broke up with existed.” When I asked her if she would seek to have her social media accounts deleted after she passed, she sounded surprised by my question. “I think I’d want to leave it up to the people who are grieving ... I think to myself, who is going to be affected? Because it won’t be me.” My thoughts snagged on her words — her focus on “the people who are grieving.” That was me. I had only been focused on my dad, and how he could be real again. I thought AI was the answer, but it proved to be a mirror. Months after my ChatGPT experiment, I realized that my struggle with the AI bot was not that it could not “be” my dad. It was the deep sadness that came with facing the truth that he would never again be able to do something new — a new thought, a new conversation — like one I’d hoped he would have had with my husband. Only when I, myself, sought to create something new, like “The Call,” did AI truly give something valuable back to me. There’s irony in the fact that my nightmare of my dad’s voice not really being his voice was so similar to what I was experiencing while attempting to give AI his personality. I think back to Shxpir and his quest for “personal growth” and how I hadn’t realized he’d given me the answer I had been searching for all along. The next four years will change America forever.

Though I thought AI would be a fitting match for powerful emotions like sorrow and grief, which seem to transcend the physical world, it turns out AI’s power may be providing pathways to better understanding ourselves. Technology will never be able to replace the strength we need to go deep inside ourselves and make something of our darkest sorrows. The will to keep moving forward with our grief in tow will never be rendered for us by machines. While so many of us are trying to decipher how AI will play a role in our lives, we must seek to keep ourselves at the center of that search. Because the scariest thing about AI might be realizing that it can’t do it all — especially when it comes to curing the pain of losing someone real.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-potential-endorsement_n_65e715f0e4b0170871fbb4dd,Mitch McConnell Weighs Endorsing Donald Trump In Potential Stark Turnaround,lisa mascaro,3/5/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate leader Mitch McConnell is the highest-ranking Republican in Congress who has yet to endorse Donald Trump’s bid to return to the White House — having once called the defeated president “morally responsible” for the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack. But that’s potentially about to change. McConnell’s political team and Trump’s campaign have been in talks over not only a possible endorsement of the former president but a strategy to unite Republicans up and down the party’s ticket ahead of the November election, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. How, when or where McConnell would endorse Trump is less head-spinning than the idea that it could happen at all: A stunning rapprochement for two men who have not spoken since McConnell enraged Trump by declaring Joe Biden the legitimate winner of the 2020 presidential election. But a fast-moving series of events ahead of Super Tuesday’s elections have been set in motion by McConnell’s own sudden announcement he would step down as leader next session and as Trump is on track to move closer toward the GOP nomination. Taken together, it lays bare the lengths that McConnell, the longest-serving Senate leader and an ever calculating politician, will go as he works to win back Republican control of the Senate in what could be among his final acts in power. “I still have enough gas in the tank to thoroughly disappoint my critics, and I intend to do so with all the enthusiasm which they have become accustomed,” McConnell said last week in announcing his decision to step aside as leader for the next session. Not long ago, it appeared Trump would have few fans politically lining up behind his bid to return to the White House, particularly from the halls of Congress. In the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, key Republicans, including McConnell, signaled unequivocally they were done with Trump. In a scathing speech during the Senate impeachment trial on charges Trump incited the insurrection at the Capitol, McConnell decried Trump’s intemperate language and the “entire manufactured atmosphere of looming catastrophe” and “wild myths” about a stolen election. “The leader of the free world cannot spend weeks thundering that shadowy forces are stealing our country and then feign surprise when people believe him and do reckless things,” said McConnell after the mob siege. Still, McConnell declined to vote to convict Trump of the impeachment charges in the Senate trial, saying it was for the courts to decide, since the defeated president by then was out of office. “He didn’t get away with anything yet,” McConnell said in the February 2021 speech. Trump is now charged in several cases including a federal indictment of conspiring to defraud the U.S. and obstruct an official proceeding related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by supporters trying to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 election. Trump has appealed claiming immunity. The first sign that McConnell was leaving the door open to reuniting with Trump came in early 2023 when he was asked about Trump’s potential return to the presidential campaign. At the time, McConnell suggested he would support the Republican Party’s eventual nominee, declining to name names or mention Trump. But endorsements matter to Trump, who has assigned key campaign staff in charge of roping in support from elected officials in what has become a two-way political street. The GOP leaders are also relying on Trump to support — or at least not attack — their own nominees for the House and Senate. As McConnell is weighing his decision to endorse Trump despite his concerns over Jan. 6, he is watching core Republican voters flock to the former president. And he is wary of being the one to try to stand in their way. It’s not just McConnell but the other Republican leaders on Capitol Hill who have all quickly fallen in line as Trump emerges ever so close to again becoming the party’s nominee at the top of their party ticket this November. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson traveled to Mar-a-Lago last month to meet with Trump at his private club about House races as the new speaker works to keep his slim GOP House majority. The other House Republican leaders endorsed Trump as the former president’s team pushed for backing ahead of the Iowa, New Hampshire and other early contests. Senate Republican leaders did the same. And Republican Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, the chairman of the Senate GOP campaign arm who is a friend, hunting and fishing partner to the president’s oldest son, Don Trump, Jr., had told others as far back as 2022 he hoped Trump would run again. He became the first member of Senate GOP leadership to endorse him. When Daines traveled to Mar-a-Lago for his own visit in February 2023, he told Trump the most important thing he could do for Trump was deliver a Senate majority to confirm Cabinet nominees and approve conservative policies, according to another person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. Daines remains close to Trump, and the two speak often, the person said. “I’m encouraging the Republican Party to unite behind President Trump,” Daines said in a recent statement to the media, including AP. McConnell’s past political distaste for Trump appears to be no match for the GOP leader’s desire to win back a Senate majority for Republicans one more time as he prepares to exit the leadership stage. The two have traded harsh words since even before McConnell’s 2021 speech, with Trump deriding the now 82-year-old as an “Old Crow.” But in recent weeks Trump has refrained from name-calling McConnell, or using racial slurs against McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, the former Trump Transportation Secretary, who resigned in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack.

Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on Monday held a meeting with former President Donald Trump as he is reportedly mulling entering the race to succeed Mitch McConnell (Ky.) as GOP Senate leader. McConnell, 82 last week announced his decision to leave the post in November, putting an end date to his tenure as the longest-serving Senate leader in history. Scott posted a photo with Trump Monday on X, formerly Twitter, writing it was “great” to meet the former president. “We’re going to continue working together to win big in 2024 and fix Washington,” Scott wrote. Great to see President Trump tonight! We’re going to continue working together to win big in 2024 and fix Washington. pic.twitter.com/hsdgGJFfqA Scott endorsed Trump in the Republican primary contest in November.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/haiti-violence_n_65e6fe9ee4b0f9d26cac5a08,Gangs In Haiti Try To Seize Control Of Main Airport In Newest Attack On Government Sites,"evens sanon, pierre-richard luxama",3/5/2024,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Heavily armed gangs tried to seize control of Haiti’s main international airport on Monday, exchanging gunfire with police and soldiers in the latest attack on key government sites in an explosion of violence that includes a mass escape from the country’s two biggest prisons. The Toussaint Louverture International Airport was closed when the attack occurred, with no planes operating and no passengers on site. Associated Press journalists saw an armored truck on the tarmac shooting at gangs to try and prevent them from entering airport grounds as scores of employees and other workers fled from whizzing bullets. It wasn’t immediately clear as of late Monday whether the attack, which was the biggest one in Haiti’s history involving the airport, was successful. Last week, the airport was struck briefly by bullets amid ongoing gang attacks, but gangs did not enter the airport nor seize control of it. The attack occurred just hours after authorities in Haiti ordered a nighttime curfew following violence in which armed gang members overran the two biggest prisons and freed thousands of inmates over the weekend. “The secretary-general is deeply concerned by the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Port-au-Prince, where armed gangs have intensified their attacks on critical infrastructure over the weekend,” said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. A 72-hour state of emergency began Sunday night. The government said it would try to track down the escaped inmates, including from a penitentiary were the vast majority were in pre-trial detention, with some accused of slayings, kidnappings and other crimes. “The police were ordered to use all legal means at their disposal to enforce the curfew and apprehend all offenders,” said a statement from Finance Minister Patrick Boivert, the acting prime minister. Gangs already were estimated to control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince, the capital. They are increasingly coordinating their actions and choosing once unthinkable targets like the Central Bank. Prime Minister Ariel Henry traveled to Kenya last week to try to salvage support for a United Nations-backed security force to help stabilize Haiti in its conflict with the increasingly powerful crime groups. Dujarric said the secretary-general stressed the need for urgent action, especially in providing financial support for the mission, “to address the pressing security requirements of the Haitian people and prevent the country from plunging further into chaos.” Haiti’s National Police has roughly 9,000 officers to provide security for more than 11 million people, according to the U.N. They are routinely overwhelmed and outgunned. The deadly weekend marked a new low in Haiti’s downward spiral of violence. At least nine people had been killed since Thursday — four of them police officers — as gangs stepped up coordinated attacks on state institutions in Port-au-Prince, including the international airport and national soccer stadium. But the attack on the National Penitentiary late Saturday shocked Haitians. All but 98 of the 3,798 inmates being held at the penitentiary escaped, according to the Office of Citizen Protection. Meanwhile, at the Croix-des-Bouquets prison, 1,033 escaped, including 298 convicts. The office said late Monday that it was seriously concerned about the safety of judges, prosecutors, victims, attorneys and others following the mass escape. It added that it “deplored and condemned the policy of nonchalance” demonstrated by government officials amid the attacks. Following the raid at the penitentiary, three bodies with gunshot wounds lay at the prison entrance Sunday. In another neighborhood, the bloodied corpses of two men with their hands tied behind the backs lay face down as residents walked past roadblocks set up with burning tires. Among the few dozen people who chose to stay in prison are 18 former Colombian soldiers accused of working as mercenaries in the July 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse. “Please, please help us,” one of the men, Francisco Uribe, said in a message widely shared on social media. “They are massacring people indiscriminately inside the cells.” Colombia’s foreign ministry has called on Haiti to provide “special protection” for the men. A second Port-au-Prince prison containing around 1,400 inmates also was overrun. Gunfire was reported in several neighborhoods in the capital. Internet service for many residents was down on Sunday as Haiti’s top mobile network said a fiber optic cable connection was slashed during the rampage. After gangs opened fire at Haiti’s international airport last week, the U.S. Embassy said it was halting all official travel to the country. On Sunday night, it urged all American citizens to depart as soon as possible. The Biden administration, which has refused to commit troops to any multinational force for Haiti while offering money and logistical support, said it was monitoring the rapidly deteriorating security situation with grave concern. The surge in attacks follows violent protests that turned deadlier in recent days as the prime minister went to Kenya seeking to move ahead on the proposed U.N.-backed security mission to be led by that East African country. Henry took over as prime minister following Moise’s assassination and has postponed plans to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, which haven’t happened in almost a decade. Jimmy Chérizier, a former elite police officer known as Barbecue who now runs a gang federation, has claimed responsibility for the surge in attacks. He said the goal is to capture Haiti’s police chief and government ministers and prevent Henry’s return. The prime minister has shrugged off calls for him to resign and didn’t comment when asked if he felt it was safe to come home. ___ Associated Press writers Joshua Goodman in Miami and Dánica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The real action will be farther down the ballot. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will continue their steady marches toward their party’s nominations when states including Alabama, Colorado, California, North Carolina, Utah and Vermont head to the polls. (Also in the mix: American Samoa, the one territory that Michael Bloomberg managed to win during the former New York mayor’s doomed 2020 quest for the Democratic presidential nomination.) Biden faces only nominal opposition from Rep. Dean Phillips, whose home state of Minnesota votes today. Biden’s so far won all 206 Democratic delegates up for grabs. Trump, meanwhile, still faces a challenge from former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. Trump has amassed 244 delegates to Haley’s 43, nearly half of which she won in last weekend’s GOP primary in Washington, D.C. But though Trump is expected to collect the roughly 1,200 delegates he needs to clinch the Republican nomination before the end of the month, Haley might do unexpectedly well in states like Vermont and Utah that have either open primaries where Democrats can vote for her or more moderate GOP bases that may reject Trump. Haley might need only a few victories to prolong Trump’s pursuit of the nomination, precious days and weeks putting him and the Republican National Committee further behind Biden and the Democratic National Committee in fundraising. Haley has only committed to staying in the race through Super Tuesday, so it’s not entirely out of the question the former South Carolina governor might suspend her campaign following Tuesday’s elections, at which point it’s not clear whether she might walk back her attacks on the former president and endorse him. The make-or-break races, however, will be in critical House, Senate and gubernatorial primaries, including the massive intra-party brawl among Texas Republicans; a fight to determine whether progressives have a shot at succeeding the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein in California; indications of how Israel’s war in Gaza is playing in Democratic primaries; and a race in which a Trump-backed conspiracy theorist is favored to win the GOP nomination for governor. Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a conspiracy theorist who has claimed that Beyoncé is “satanic,” the 1969 moon landing may have been fake and there is a ruling class of secretive reptiles, is on track to win the Republican nomination for governor in North Carolina. Robinson, who has been endorsed by Trump, is poised to take on Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein. The current governor, Democrat Roy Cooper, is term-limited out. Even when compared to recent extreme GOP nominees, Robinson’s record of sexism, homophobia and Islamophobia is particularly ugly. He’s mocked kids who survived school shootings as “immature media prosti-tots” for advocating gun safety reforms. He’s claimed that homosexuality leads to pedophilia. He’s referred to former first lady Michelle Obama as a man. Despite all of that, Robinson has risen politically for one reason: He’s fashioned himself in the mold of Trump. They have endorsed each other, and last weekend, Trump attended a rally with Robinson and declared that he is “Martin Luther King on steroids.” Of course, Robinson has insulted King in the past, too. He said the civil rights leader was an “ersatz pastor” and a “communist” and that the 1960s civil rights movement was “crap.” North Carolina will have the biggest and most expensive governor’s race nationwide. It’s a crucial swing state in the presidential election, and of the 11 gubernatorial elections this year, just two are in swing states: North Carolina and New Hampshire. Beyond that, if Robinson wins in November, the GOP will have total control of the state’s government. At least one local political analyst previously speculated to HuffPost that Robinson’s extremism will backfire on him in the November election. “We have seen ever since the elevation of Trump, Republican primary voters, again and again, time and time and time again, choosing the candidate who makes an awful general election candidate in a purple state,” said Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. “My presumption is Mark Robinson will fall right into this pattern.” Centrist Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff is almost certain to nab the leading spot in California’s top-two “jungle” primary contest for the open seat previously held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, but all eyes will be on progressive Rep. Katie Porter and her bid to secure second place over the Republican candidate in the race, former baseball player Steve Garvey. Porter, who rose to prominence in Congress for grilling fossil fuel industry and Wall Street CEOs, has faced a multimillion-dollar barrage of television advertising funded by wealthy donors who are seeking to deny her a spot in the runoff. Separately, Schiff’s campaign has spent heavily to elevate Garvey in conservative media in hopes of boosting his appeal and ensuring that Schiff faces an easily beatable Republican candidate in California, a Democratic stronghold, instead of Porter. Polls have found Porter struggling to keep even with Garvey for second place in the race even though his campaign has barely spent any money of his own on advertising. Meanwhile, Rep. Barbara Lee, the other major progressive candidate in the race, trails in third place, splitting the left in yet another advantage for Schiff’s establishment-backed campaign. U.S. Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas) is facing off against Texas state Sen. Roland Gutierrez for the Democratic nomination to run against one of the most polarizing Republicans in Congress, Sen. Ted Cruz. Cruz came close to losing to his Democratic challenger, Beto O’Rourke, in 2018 and remains unpopular in Texas. Allred is a mild-mannered former NFL player who has boasted a fundraising and polling advantage since announcing his candidacy last year. Gutierrez’s district includes Uvalde, site of a horrific elementary school massacre in May 2022, and he has pushed for stricter gun control as a state legislator and an unapologetic progressive. During a debate in January, Allred defended his moderate voting record, including his support for a symbolic resolution condemning President Joe Biden’s handling of immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border. “I’ve built broad coalitions in my campaigns,” Allred said. “That’s how you win tough races.” There are seven other candidates in the race, and the winner needs 50%, so the biggest question may be whether Allred can win outright or will wind up in a runoff against Gutierrez, who should do well among the state’s large Latino population. Everyone knew that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee would be spending big money in Democratic primaries this year, but the mammoth pro-Israel group’s decision to make California state Sen. Dave Min its first target of the cycle has puzzled observers across the spectrum. Min, who is competing against attorney Joanna Weiss, also a Democrat, for the chance to succeed Rep. Katie Porter in California’s 47th Congressional District, has not called for a cease-fire in Israel or for restricting U.S. aid to Israel. But AIPAC’s super PAC, the United Democracy Project, has still spent $4.7 million on ads blasting Min. The TV, digital and direct-mail campaign has cast Min as a general-election liability against a likely Republican opponent due to his arrest in May for driving under the influence of alcohol. Min maintains that AIPAC is trying to beat him because he, like Biden, has been critical of Israel’s expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank. “Maybe AIPAC wants a rubber stamp. I’m not going to be a rubber stamp,” Min told Semafor. Min, a former banking law professor who is the sole Korean American in the state legislature, has the support of Porter; Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.); the AAPI Victory Fund, which supports Asian American and Pacific Islander candidates; organized labor; and many of his fellow state lawmakers. But Weiss, who founded a local Democratic club, has an outside money advantage. Two super PACs affiliated with EMILY’s List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, have spent nearly $1 million on her bid. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is backing primary challenges against 10 of the Texas state House Republicans who voted against the creation of a private school voucher program, helping to kill the proposal. School vouchers have long been a white whale in Texas, one of the only Southern states that does not already have such a program. The overwhelmingly right-wing proponents of vouchers, who insist that they give parents mobility when a local school isn’t cutting it, have blamed the mostly rural Texas Republicans opposed to the program for being too close to teachers unions. In reality, those lawmakers say they oppose the voucher plan for fear it would deplete enrollment at rural schools with little room to lose funding. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) is backing his own slate of primary candidates against House Republicans who voted to impeach him on corruption charges in May, and he has endorsed several who stood by his side as the state Senate acquitted him. Paxton’s efforts have less money behind them, but in at least one case, they conflict with Abbott’s preference. Paxton is supporting state Rep. Travis Clarty, a rural Republican opposed to vouchers, while Abbott has endorsed a pro-voucher challenger against Clarty. The cryptocurrency industry, which profits from investment in digital forms of money, is putting a lot of actual dollars in the hat to avoid the kind of federal regulation that might affect profits as it faces intense scrutiny. In the California Senate primary, Fairshake, a super PAC funded by leading crypto players, including Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, has spent more than $10 million trying to sink Porter, a proponent of stricter banking rules and protégé of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Protect Progress, a separate super PAC with a nearly identical list of donors, has spent $1.7 million to support Shomari Figures, a former Biden and Obama administration official running on Tuesday in a competitive Democratic primary in Alabama’s newly redrawn 2nd Congressional District. In October, a federal court ordered the creation of Alabama’s 2nd, where the voting-age population is nearly half Black, after finding that the previous districts had suppressed Black political power. Figures’ strongest Democratic rivals are state Reps. Anthony Daniels and Napoleon Bracy. Should no Democrat get an outright majority on Tuesday, there will be a runoff on April 2. Democrats are strongly favored to pick up the seat in November. And in Texas, Protect Progress has spent nearly $1 million in support of state Rep. Julie Johnson, who is running to succeed Rep. Colin Allred, a Senate candidate, in a district representing a large share of Dallas and its suburbs. Johnson is running against Dr. Brian Williams, a trauma surgeon and former Air Force officer. Immigration is consistently the top issue for GOP voters in public polling, and a primary for a U.S. House district along the U.S.-Mexico border will test whether Republicans are willing to make a statement on the border crisis using one of their own. GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales is facing four primary challengers who argue he’s out of step with the MAGA wing of the party on a host of issues, including border security, marriage equality and gun rights. Texas’ 23rd Congressional District, which stretches along the southern border in western Texas from El Paso to San Antonio, contains the city of Uvalde, site of the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School, where a gunman killed 17 children and two teachers. In the wake of the massacre, Gonzales supported stricter gun safety rules, a move that earned him a censure from the Texas Republican Party and other grassroots groups. And challengers including local GOP activists and a retired U.S. Border Patrol agent soon lined up to take out the incumbent representative, arguing he isn’t tough enough on the border at a time when the country is seeing a deluge of migrant crossings. Gonzales, who came into office in 2020 after a close race against Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones, downplayed his chances of losing the party’s nomination in the primary. “Anybody who wishes to challenge me — it’s a fool’s errand. I’ll run you into the deep end of the pool every single time and drown you. So, I welcome it,” he said. California’s 22nd Congressional District, located in the state’s agricultural Central Valley, has long frustrated Democrats. In majority Latino district where Democrats have a massive registration advantage, low turnout has meant Republican Rep. David Valadao has won five of the last six congressional races. This cycle, the party looked to have an even worse problem: It was possible neither of the two Democrats running for the seat ― former state Rep. Rudy Salas and state Sen. Melissa Hurtado ― would advance in the state’s top-two primary system. Though Valadao was a lock to advance, his support for Trump’s impeachment would generate just enough intra-party opposition for another Republican to qualify instead. The problem set off a round of backbiting within the party, with Democrats grumbling about EMILY’s List working to recruit Hurtado, whom they ultimately never endorsed. National Democrats, who prefer Salas as their candidate, have spent $1.3 million to back Salas, and newer rounds of data show the chances of a lockout fading. Still, it’s $1 million the party would prefer not to spend this far from November. The next four years will change America forever.

Over the years, she’s developed a reputation as a leading progressive and member of the Congressional Black Caucus ― and for churning through staff at record levels. Her treatment of staff member helped doom her run for Houston mayor last year. Now she’s trying to hold on to her House seat representing a majority-Black district surrounding Houston against a challenge from former Houston City Councilwoman Amanda Edwards, 42, who began running while Jackson Lee was still campaigning to be mayor. The race against the 74-year-old Jackson Lee has been an old-fashioned generational showdown.

Then came the zinger: “But apparently, he can’t even say the word ‘Russia’ without climaxing.” Trump has repeatedly sided with Russia and its authoritarian leader, Vladimir Putin, over U.S. interests, a dynamic that last week was called “really creepy” by former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/massage-gun-neck_l_65e5e229e4b0d2a2475a39c9,"Why You Should Never, Ever Use A Massage Gun On Your Neck",leigh weingus,3/5/2024,"Massage guns have surged in popularity in recent years, and for good reason: They actually work. According to a 2023 systematic review, massage guns can help improve short-term range of motion, flexibility and recovery. This likely comes as good news to anyone who deals with a lot of muscle stiffness. “I used to think they were just gimmicky things that might feel good in the moment but were not that useful,” admitted physical therapist Ingrid Anderson, founder of Intown Physical Therapy in Atlanta, Georgia. “Now, I believe they have a place for pain relief and treating certain conditions.” But before you whip out that massage gun, are there any parts of the body where a massage gun will do more harm than good? The answer is yes. If you’re one of the 30-50% of adults in the U.S. who suffer from chronic neck pain, please don’t use your massage gun regularly to remedy it. According to Anderson, you’ll want to stay away from any bony area of your body when using the machine ― and your neck is very bony. If you use it on areas with lots of muscles, like your shoulders or the back part of your neck, that’s a safer bet. “I don’t recommend using a massage gun on your neck,” she said. “While necks have lots of muscles, there are many superficial bony prominences and superficial nerves, neither of which like being pounded with a massage gun.” The neck is composed of sensitive areas and vital blood flow that connect to the brain, making using a massage gun on it a not-so-great idea, said Kevin Lees, a chiropractor in Arizona. “Some areas of muscle have receptors that help with balance. If these receptors are overstimulated or damaged, they can cause nausea and dizziness,” he said. “Pressure from a massage gun may cause soft tissue damage and possibly vascular damage.” Perhaps you’ve also seen the viral TikTok where one user warned viewers about the dangers of using the tool on your neck after she experienced problems herself. As Health reported, putting the tool on your neck ― which helps with blood flow to the brain ― may also lead to rare but serious injury if you’re not careful. Ryan Krzyzanowicz, a clinical associate professor and program director of the Master of Science in Athletic Training program at the University at Buffalo School of Public Health and Health Professions, told the outlet that “you do not want to use percussive therapy (a massage gun) over an artery.” “In the neck we get worried with blood flow to the brain, and in theory, percussion could temporarily starve the brain from blood flow, causing mini-stroke or stroke-like symptoms,” Krzyzanowicz continued. Again, this is more rare, but still a risk to consider. If your neck is really bothering you, turn to the pros. “If you are experiencing neck pain, it’s best to see your doctor to determine the underlying cause. If massage is the solution, have a professional work on the affected muscles,” Lees told HuffPost. Neck pain is a pain in the neck (sorry, we had to), and it’s clear that a massage gun isn’t the solution. So what is? First, get to the source of the neck pain. “Neck pain can be caused by a variety of things. Some of the most common are poor posture, stress and poor sleeping positions,” Lees said. “While a massage gun may help with some of the symptoms, addressing the underlying condition is the only way to prevent the problem from recurring. Poor posture can be due to the ergonomics of a workstation, or a muscle imbalance that causes hunching of the upper back. Sleeping awkwardly with an improper pillow or stomach sleeping may also cause neck pain.” The best way to relieve neck pain, Anderson said, is to stop doing the things that cause it. “This includes a good work-station setup, not craning your neck forward while working, and, most importantly, lots of breaks. Data show that a 20-second movement break every 20 minutes goes a long way towards preventing neck pain,” she said. Once you have a stiff and sore neck, Anderson added, the best things you can do at home are heat or cold (whichever feels good!), topical pain relievers such as lidocaine patches or pain-relieving creams and movement. “Even if it doesn’t feel the best, moving through neck range of motion ― looking right, left, up and down ― goes a long way to shortening an episode of neck pain,” Anderson said. If your pain doesn’t resolve, chat with your doctor or a physical therapist. You may need some manual interventions like medication, specific exercises or trigger point shots (or all of the above) to help relieve the pain. “Massage guns are best used on large muscles, especially in the legs, shoulders, and back,” Lees said. “These muscles tend to do most of the work when exercising or doing physical labor. Because they are large it’s generally safe to work them with a massage gun unless a tear is suspected.” Anderson also pointed this out. “Areas of big muscles are the best for massage guns,” she said. “My favorites are quads, calves and glutes. Just make sure and stay away from anything bony, even if it feels useful.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/theragun-massage-gun-relief_l_65e225d7e4b0d2a247594afc,"Reviewers Say This Light, Reasonably Priced Massage Gun Was Their 'Best Purchase Ever'",haley zovickian,3/5/2024,"HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. Rarely do you encounter a product so effective that it blows you away. For me and a plethora of reviewers, the Theragun Relief massage gun is one of those things. It’s a massage gun designed to unknot clenched muscles and help relieve everyday pain and tension. What makes it so impressive, to me, is that it does so surprisingly gently given its power — and at a comparatively accessible price point that reviewers described as “an absolute steal,” given that many quality massage guns can run for well over $500. “I’ve found that the Theragun brand offers a better variety of pressure and speed for all levels of comfort,” Hilary Burkholder, a massage therapist at The Summit in Philadelphia, previously told HuffPost. Dr. Mathew J. Hamula, an orthopedic surgeon at New York-Presbyterian Medical Group, also previously told HuffPost that Theragun massage guns can reduce perceived pain in users by stimulating nerve receptors that in turn relax muscles. “For the most part, they have been successful in treating delayed onset muscle soreness as well as acutely improving range of motion,” Hamula explained. “[Theraguns] tend to be best suited for muscle aches and pains as well as myofascial release to treat areas of tension, knots, adhesions from trauma and tightness.” This has been my experience as a user of Theragun massage guns; I’ve been fortunate to try several of their models and to own the Theragun Relief, the brand’s newest model that’s designed to work as an everyday massager with three speeds and three attachments to target different muscles. It’s also an affordable alternative to some of the brand’s pricier models. Before trying the Theragun for myself, I was skeptical that it would even work for me. I deal with persistent pain from tight, clenched muscles that make it difficult to sleep, and which only seemed to be worsening. I didn’t know what to expect when I first turned it on, and when I did, it at first felt a little strange, like a high-percussion pounding that flattened my muscles but strangely did not hurt, instead delivering a physical relief and release. After spending a few minutes on each of my shoulders, I found that my previously tight, knotted muscles felt liquid-y and knot-free, like I was once again a kid with fluid, pain-free muscles. Of course, you should see a doctor or physical therapist if you feel consistent pain in your body. But the ability to feel this level of relief so quickly blew my mind, and felt like something of a miracle. Reviewers agree with me, too. “I was initially skeptical,” wrote one Best Buy reviewer, “but I was blown away by its performance.” Another Best Buy reviewer swore by it for helping their arthritis, and an Amazon reviewer called it “great for relieving the daily stiffness that comes with advanced age.” Reviewers appreciate how lightweight it is, making it easy for those with small hands and those sharing their Theragun with the rest of their household found their family members delighted: “‘[O]ne of my kids said, ‘[B]est purchase ever!’” And while you can find other cheaper options, reviewers say this one is well worth the extra money. “I [had] the cheaper off-brand version of one of these for a while and the on-brand is definitely worth the extra price,” one Amazon reviewer said. You can grab one of the Theragun Relief models at Amazon, Target or Best Buy, or check out other Theragun options at Amazon or Therabody. Take a look at reviewers’ input below: “I was initially skeptical about the ‘Relief’ given its much lower price point compared to other Therabody products, but I was blown away by its performance! Not only does it deliver the same high-quality deep tissue massage I’ve come to expect from Therabody, but at $149, it’s an absolute steal. The “Relief” has been a game-changer for my post-workout recovery. Its ergonomic design, combined with the power it packs, rivals the more expensive models in the market that go for $200+. It’s clear that Therabody has once again prioritized the user experience without compromising on quality. For those on the fence because of the cost of premium massage guns, the ‘Relief’ is your answer. Highly recommended!” — LlamasRFun, Best Buy “Perfect for my tight muscles! I was a massage therapist for 10 years. I wish I had this back then. Everybody needs this! It has several speeds and three different attachments to target specific areas of tightness/sensitivity.” — AndreaH, Best Buy “Exactly as described. Gr8 for ppl who suffer from arthritis. I was able to single handidly hit the knot between my shoulder blade and spine. This lil fella has enough power to break up tension areas and loosen them without any muscular assistance from me. FYI: if I’m leaving a review, that must mean that it was a pretty dang good product. Just sayin because I don’t leave reviews lightly.” —diSguisedRealist, Best Buy “So worth it!! We are a family of four and we all have enjoyed using it. We are planning on buying a second one! one of my kids said, ‘best purchase ever!’” — Soniagris, Best Buy “I wish I had discovered this years ago! Easy to use, very good battery life with multiple uses before charging is required. It can be used by ones self with the triangle handle that can be held in many ways, as well as used on someone else. This model has 3 levels, I’ve never gone above the second setting, and prefer the first setting but I am thin and boney. My husband prefers the 2nd level setting. It is very effective muscle relief for soreness and stiffness. It helps loosen everything up for flexibility and movement.” — Jody, Amazon “I have the cheaper off-brand version of one of these for a while and the on-brand is definitely worth the extra price. It’s a little bit easier to use on yourself due to the handle and it is also a lot quieter than the cheaper version that I used to have” — anne sue, Amazon “Great for relieving the daily stiffness that comes with advanced age.” — Weaverlady, Amazon “I have small hands and this gun is small and light enough for me to use.” — M.Bermudez, Amazon By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The longer you stay at these jobs, the more comfortable you may get ― even if it does feel increasingly like your career is stalling. And that’s where you might hit the dreaded “job plateau.” It’s a period of time in a long-term job where you feel stuck, frustrated or bored by what you do. Lisa Orbé-Austin, a licensed psychologist who focuses on helping professionals manage their careers, said she sees a lot of people who will ignore for a long time that they are in a job plateau because it’s often a job they know how to do well. “The beginning of a plateau doesn’t feel terrible,” Orbé-Austin said. “But it’s when that ... becomes kind of a feeling of ‘I’ve done this 1,000 times; what’s new about this?’ you have to kind of then think about ‘What is next for me?’” If you do not take action, you can hold yourself back from taking more fulfilling opportunities and stay stuck in a job you should have long left. Sometimes there are warning clues and hints that will alert you to your plateau before you are fully ready to acknowledge or address the problem. Here are some of the most common ones: If you feel you’ve done all you can in terms of skills you can develop and things that you can learn, you’re likely in a job plateau, said Nell Wulfhart, a decision coach who helps professionals get “unstuck” so they can move on. To decide if you’ve really stopped learning useful skills, Wulfhart suggests writing down what you want your future to look like a year to 10 years from now, as well as your long-term goals. “Maybe it’s boring at the moment, but is [the job] actually getting you the skills you need for that next big job leap? Or are you learning things that could be useful when you want to start your own business in five years?” Wulfhart gave as examples. “Sometimes you literally just have to put in the time. And there’s no way to sort of avoid it or skip over it or take a shortcut,” Wulfhart said. But if what you are doing is not serving these long-term goals, then you know that you have hit your plateau. Your ability to be promoted and get raises are tangible ways to track your opportunities for growth in a role. Wulfhart said to watch out if there’s a repeated pattern of your boss promising opportunities and promotions over months and years, but they never happen. “People love praise, and they love the idea that someone is looking out for them,” Wulfhart said. “That kind of thing can keep you coasting along for a really long time.” Wulfhart said many of her clients come to her with job plateaus they have been in for years. She said one of the big signs of a plateau is if you keep obsessing over the idea of leaving your job. “If the thought starts buzzing in your brain, like, ‘Maybe I’ve done all I can with this,’ or ‘Maybe it’s time to get out of here,’ that probably is not going to go away,” Wulfhart. For clients who are torn between leaving and staying at a job, Wulfhart said she asks them to answer: “Would I take this job now if somebody offered it to me?” That’s because one of the reasons people stay put in a job that has plateaued is because it is a job that seems good on paper, Wulfhart said. Answering this question can help you clarify if this is really a job that you are content to stay in long-term. “I would encourage people really to look at who they are now, not who they were when they got the job, just to see if it’s still a fit for them,” Wulfhart said. Does every day feel the same at work? When you’re not learning or growing, you can become completely disengaged from your projects, and it’s a sign that you’ve hit your plateau. “Oftentimes when people are in a plateau, they’re not really thinking about it. They’re just going through the motions more than anything,” Orbé-Austin said. A job plateau is a tough place to be in, but it is possible to address it more immediately. Here’s how: Before you start job-hunting, assess what your current job is offering you. A stable but boring job that you know how to manage may be just what you need to complete higher priorities in your life. Wulfhart gave the example of a job that is helping you pay off credit card debt or helps fund your true passion of being in a band. “I have a friend who has worked in medical publishing for 25 years. And he does not care about medical publishing,” she recalled. “But he has a band, and he’s really into the band. And this is a steady, reasonably well-paid job ... So that’s a perfectly good reason to stay at a job.” While you feel stuck, Wulfhart suggested, it can help to find a hobby unrelated to your job, like pottery, a book club or crafting, that you enjoy doing. Nurturing a new passion can help you see what you have been missing at your job. “When you find something that you’re actually really hyped and passionate about, then it kind of puts the rest of your life into perspective,” she said. “You’re like, ‘Oh, this is actually what it looks like to really enjoy the thing that I do. Like, why am I putting up with less at my actual job?’” People often stay in job plateaus because of their fear of the unknown. Deep down, you may know you need to quit, but you’re afraid of ending up in a job that is worse than what you have. Doing informational interviews with people in other jobs you’re interested in can dispel those anxieties and give you the encouragement you need to take action. With informational interviews, you will also learn what responsibilities you can do at your current job to look like a better candidate for positions you actually want, Orbé-Austin said. You want to take these responsibilities “strategically, so they can be helping you get to the next place you want to go,” Orbé-Austin said. “But you’ve got to know the place first before you start doing that.” Ultimately, getting out of a job plateau and finding a more rewarding opportunity can be tough, hard work, which is why so many of us simply stay put.

A recent study published in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that playing is good for your brain health as you age. Researchers examined 1,107 people in the U.K. over the age of 40 with an average age of 67.82. Participants self-reported their musical experience via a questionnaire and took part in a cognitive assessment, which tested their working memory and executive function. Researchers then studied how four aspects of musicality — listening to music, playing an instrument, singing and self-reported ability — impacted cognitive behavior and compared that to people who did not have a musical background. “This large-scale, longitudinal study supports previous research indicating that musical training supports cognitive health by improving memory and lowering risk for age-related cognitive decline,” Dr. Gary Small, a memory, brain and aging expert at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, told HuffPost via email. Small is not affiliated with the study. It’s worth noting that 83% of participants were women, so it’s not totally indicative of the general population. Another caveat is that some data was self-reported, said Dr. Arman Fesharaki-Zadeh, a behavioral neurologist and neuropsychiatrist at Yale Medicine in Connecticut, who is not affiliated with the study. Self-reporting leaves room for error; people may misremember their musical background or misunderstand a question. Playing music largely involves your executive function, so it’s natural for folks with a musical background to see an improvement in the brain, said Dr. Golnaz Yadollahikhales, a neurologist at Cedars-Sinai in California, who is not affiliated with the study. Your executive function refers to your “ability to multitask and organize oneself, and being able to sequence and prioritize,” Fesharaki-Zadeh explained. Additionally, playing music keeps you cognitively active, meaning it challenges your brain. “Being cognitively active throughout one’s life can have a protective role” in brain health, Fesharaki-Zadeh continued. This is known as your cognitive reservoir (or cognitive reserve) and activities like playing music can build this up. Yadollahikhales noted that she’s seen the study’s findings in her day-to-day work, too. People with a good cognitive reserve perform well even when their brain imaging has signs of atrophy. Brain atrophy is linked to issues like dementia and aphasia, according to the Cleveland Clinic. “The patients of mine who were musicians or who were still playing music at the time of diagnosis would show better cognitive function than what was expected to be seen based on their structural imaging findings,” Yadollahikhales said. You may want to consider dabbling in music. The research and the experts who spoke to HuffPost were all pretty clear that playing musical instruments and singing can be beneficial for your long-term cognition. If you’re ready to start some lessons and are open to the process, consider trying specific instruments. The study found that playing keyboard-based instruments, like the piano or organ, had the biggest benefit on memory and executive function, study author Anne Corbett told Newsweek, followed by brass and woodwind instruments. The social aspect of music may be beneficial for your brain, too. Corbett also told Newsweek that the singers in the study had better complex task completion as they aged. But the study noted that the benefits that come with singing may also have to do with the social connections that are formed when singing with a choir or in a group setting. “Music doesn’t usually happen in isolation,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said. Think about it: Music is often played in a group, practiced with a teacher or performed for other people. That social interaction is one of those protective factors for brain health, he added. Bottom line: You’re never too old to start learning and challenging your brain. “Overall, it is recommended that people start building their cognitive reserve early in life,” Yadollahikhales said. “This can be achieved by playing music and games such as puzzles, reading books and being physically active ... also, as mentioned in this study as well, higher education can affect cognitive reserve positively.” Even if it’s been years or even decades since you’ve challenged your brain to something new, hope is not lost. “We’re never too old to learn, I think that’s a known concept,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said. Benefits can be seen whether you’re 65 or 18. Neurogenesis, the forming of new connections and new cells in the brain, is often not as robust for someone in their mid-70s when compared to someone, say, learning at a new job in their mid-20s. But by learning music (or by learning anything new) you activate this process again, Fesharaki-Zadeh added. “So, let’s say somebody doesn’t have dementia [and] they’re wondering what are the ways that they can protect their brains against dementia — music could be potentially a viable strategy because it does incorporate a lot of the other factors such as learning, emotional well-being, social connections ― and they’re all great for the brain,” Fesharaki-Zadeh said. It’s important to keep in mind that while you can control certain risk factors, you can’t control your genetics. “Although this study demonstrates that musicality provides a significant cognitive benefit, other non-genetic ... and genetic risk factors contribute to the risk of cognitive decline,” Small said. “So, even highly successful people with healthy lifestyles will develop dementia if they have a strong genetic predisposition.” But, as Yadollahikhales mentioned above, if you build your cognitive reserve throughout your life, you’ll be better off if you do develop cognitive impairment or dementia. Studies “have shown that being cognitively, socially and physically active after the development of cognitive impairment and dementia can slow down the progression of the disease,” Yadollahikhales said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/signs-parentification-child_l_65d7982ae4b0189a6a7d425f,4 Signs You May Have Been 'Parentified' As A Child,kelsey borresen,3/5/2024,"It’s common for parents to gradually give their kids more responsibilities as they grow up. When those responsibilities are age-appropriate, that can be a good thing and help the child build skills like accountability, independence and teamwork. But when a child is saddled with adult responsibilities, it can turn into a damaging phenomenon known as “parentification.” Parentification is essentially when the child and caregiver swap roles. So the kid is emotionally supporting the adult (known as emotional parentification) and/or managing the logistics of the household (known as instrumental parentification). Emotional parentification tends to be more harmful than the instrumental type. ″[It’s] the phenomenon that happens when a parent relinquishes the role of parent and a child feels the need to step into that role,” Kristene Geering, a parent educator at the family resource Parent Lab, previously told HuffPost. “So instead of the parent taking care of the child’s needs, the child takes care of the parent’s needs,” she said. Expecting your kid to be a contributing member of the household by putting away their laundry, cleaning up their toys or feeding the dog is not the same as parentification. Parentification is when the burdens placed upon the kid are excessive and prolonged, putting “an emotional toll on the child and getting in the way of developmentally appropriate social, emotional and academic endeavors,” Dr. Khadijah Booth Watkins, associate director of the Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds at Massachusetts General Hospital, previously told HuffPost. Examples of parentification might be if a child is expected to act as their parent’s therapist, be the caregiver for younger siblings or the peacemaker during adult squabbles. Clinical psychologist Cindy T. Graham, founder of Brighter Hope Wellness Center, told HuffPost it’s important to keep cultural and ethnic differences in mind when having these conversations, as “many cultures value interconnectedness among family members and ‘pitching in.’” In cultures where this is the case, “we would also expect to see that the children are allowed to be kids with time to play with other children, be involved in education with other children,” she added. “We would expect that the responsibilities of the home do not regularly overshadow an appropriate childhood experience.” Certain circumstances increase a child’s risk of being parentified, like if their parent is struggling with a physical or mental health issue, a substance use disorder, a divorce or financial troubles, trauma therapist Maggie Nick told Care.com. Immigrant families may also find themselves in this type of dynamic due to language barriers and culture shock. “We are more likely to see parentification in single-parent households, with the oldest siblings being most at risk,” Nick told the publication. If this sounds all too familiar, read on as therapists share the signs you may have been parentified as a child. Struggling to set and maintain boundaries is a sign you may have experienced parentification, said Evelyn Pechous, an associate marriage and family therapist at The Expansive Group. You may have a habit of neglecting your own desires, plans and preferences in order to satisfy someone else’s. In adulthood, you may continue to take on a lot of responsibility and feel a “consistent need to be in control of situations,” Graham said. “Adults who were parentified as children may struggle with allowing others to take the lead in situations,” she said. “This could also result in having relationships with those who will allow them to take charge. Adults who were parentified as children might harbor feelings of resentment from the lack of support.” Over time, this inability to let others share some of this responsibility can leave you “overburdened and eventually burned out,” Graham added. Perhaps your parent treated you like their confidant when you were just a kid and leaned heavily on you for comfort and support. They may have even made comments like, “I need you to make me happy” or “If I didn’t have you to talk to about this, I don’t know what I’d do.” In adulthood, you may continue to feel like you’re responsible for other people’s feelings and well-being. “The caregiver may also have communicated messages such as, ‘If you don’t do well in class, you’re going to make me angry. So do well so you don’t make me angry,’” Pechous said. “This message can then develop an internalized narrative for the child that they must be ‘good’ or ‘perfect’ to prevent their caregiver from becoming angry.” When a loved one is venting to you about something happening in their life, you can’t resist the urge to offer unsolicited advice and solutions in an effort to save the day. “While adults who were parentified as children can be empathetic peacemakers in their relationships, this can also lead to over-involvement in the interpersonal dynamics of others,” Graham said. She added: “In short, the adult who was a parentified adult can struggle with internal feelings of discomfort stemming from having to watch others figure out how to navigate their own lives.” Being placed in situations that were not developmentally appropriate as a kid can hinder your emotional and cognitive development and lead to high stress, anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed, according to The Attachment Project. Making matters worse, your caregivers may not have given you the comfort or support needed to help you work through these emotions, which “can further interfere with the development of healthy emotional regulation skills,” the project’s website says. You may have also had trouble socially and academically as a kid because of all the responsibility you carried at home. Long term, you may struggle with maintaining healthy boundaries and relationships. Additionally, you may develop clinical depression “due to a constant hypervigilance of a caregivers’ emotions or challenges with identifying wants and needs,” Pechous said. But not all of the outcomes are negative, Graham noted. It can be useful to consider some of the positive effects of this kind of upbringing. “For example, parentified adults may be dependable and high-achieving, or even the ‘rock’ of their families, friend circle, workplace and community,” she said. “They may also be likely to remain calm in difficult interpersonal situations.” If you’re an adult trying to deal with the parentification you experienced as a child, there are things you can do to process and move forward. For starters, work on identifying your own authentic desires and needs, Pechous said. “Notice how different situations, such as boundary-setting, physically feel in our bodies. When we are able to slow down and help our bodies understand that we might no longer be in the same environment or unsafety we were in before, our nervous system can become much more attune to the present,” she said. “When we are able to slow down and help our bodies understand that we might no longer be in the same environment or unsafety we were in before, our nervous system can become much more attune to the present.” Building a consistent routine with protected time set aside for relaxation and self-care practices “can reduce the potential for burnout and overcommitment,” Graham said. “Having an accountability buddy, or someone who checks in to make sure that one is not overcommitted, is also a helpful strategy.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

(AP) — A single-engine plane crashed near a highway in Nashville, Tennessee, just a few miles short of the airport it had tried to reach for an emergency landing, killing five people aboard, authorities said. The pilot made an emergency call to John C. Tune Airport around 7:40 p.m. Monday, reported engine trouble and was given clearance to make an emergency landing, Metro Nashville Police Department spokesman Don Aaron said. A short time later the pilot radioed that the aircraft would not reach the airport, he said. The plane burst into flames when it crashed in a grassy median just off Interstate 40 and behind a Costco on the city’s westside. The crash scene was about 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) south of the general aviation airport. “It appears that everyone on board perished,” Aaron said. In a statement early Tuesday on the social media platform X, police said five people died. It said the Federal Aviation Administration was at the scene and the National Transportation Safety Board planned to arrive Tuesday. The next four years will change America forever.

Those other moves include a proposal by Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel to limit bulk billing of broadband services in multi-household buildings, such as condo and apartment complexes, and a move by the Agriculture Department to boost competition for processing in livestock and poultry markets. But the CFPB rule, to be officially published Tuesday, may get the most notice. The bureau said banks collected more than $14 billion in late payments in 2022 and that those fees made up more than 10% of all the fees and interest banks charged customers. A 2009 law was meant to limit late fees to no more than the amount needed to actually recover late payments. But in implementing the law, the Federal Reserve provided an exception for banks that charged no more than $25 for the first late payment and $35 for subsequent ones, and it allowed those amounts to rise with inflation. The average fee is now $32, said the CFPB, which is now in charge of enforcing the 2009 law. Its new rule would bring that down to $8, saving an estimated $220 annually for the 45 million people who pay late fees. Though fees have long been a steady source of income for banks, they are in good financial shape and may not feel much of an effect from the change. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in November that U.S. banks made $68.4 billion in profits in the third quarter of 2023, down slightly from the quarter before. Still, major banking trade groups — the American Bankers Association, the Consumer Bankers Association and the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions — warned in 2023 that the change would mean more borrowers would pay late because the fees would not deter them and would subsequently see their creditworthiness suffer.

The CFPB said its proposal would only cover issuers with more than 1 million open accounts and would not affect the ability to raise interest rates on late payers, cut credit lines or take other actions to encourage timely payment. “In fact, the rule would increase the desire for credit card companies to facilitate on-time payment, since it would lower incentives to build a business model on late fees,” the agency said.

During an interview with Right Side Broadcasting Network that was broadcast in front of supporters from his Mar-a-Lago home, Trump claimed there are “people who are coming from parts unknown, countries that you’ve never heard of.” “Languages that nobody in this country speaks. We don’t even have teachers of some of these languages,” he continued. Then he asked, “Who would think that we have languages that are like from the planet Mars?” The line drew a laugh from the audience. “Nobody, nobody, knows how to, you know, speak it,” Trump added.

We have nobody that even speaks those languages. They’re truly foreign languages. Nobody speaks them,” he added. “And they’re pouring into our country, and they’re bringing with them tremendous problems, including medical problems, as you know.” CNN’s fact-checking reporter Daniel Dale, though, at the time said the claim “seems to be just conjured out of thin air” and is “nonsense.” Amid record levels of migrants at the border, Republican 2024 front-runner Trump has sought to make immigration a key issue in the 2024 election, which is looking increasingly likely to be a repeat of the 2020 vote between himself and President Joe Biden. Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration and limit legal immigration if he returns to the White House, promising “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.” “Look, we have to deport a lot of people, and they have to start immediately,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity last week. Local police officers would play a key role in the deportations, he explained. MARS-a-Lago? This tracks, for a man who stared directly into an eclipse. Donald Trump, in an interview with RSBN, says that some of the immigrants crossing the border are speaking ""languages that are, like, from the planet Mars. Nobody knows how to, you know, speak it.""Trump often makes similar claims, but this is a new interplanetary variant. His cheese has slid off the launch pad ~ fucking Mars? Does he think illegal aliens are......aliens????? Pretty sure he couldn’t point to Mars on a map of the solar system. The next four years will change America forever.

During a discussion on President Joe Biden’s fitness for office on Monday, Democratic strategist Jonathan Kott said he’d rather have a POTUS “who maybe has a stutter once in a while than one who spews conspiracy theories, racist nonsense, and has dinner with Nazis.” Bruce fired back by falsely accusing Kott, a former aide to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), of calling “a number of Republicans Nazis and racists.” She railed, “So, I think we can put him in the category of willing to go there.” DAMN! Fox News guest Jonathan Kott slammed Trump live on air today saying “I would rather have a president who maybe has a stutter once in a while than one who spews conspiracy theories, racist nonsense, and has dinner with Nazis.” Perfectly said!!! pic.twitter.com/EniOfM47Ub Kott clarified he hadn’t called all Republicans Nazis and was just talking about Trump and his 2022 meal at his Mar-a-Lago home with Fuentes and rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. (Trump later claimed he’d “never heard” of Fuentes before their “very quick dinner”). But the Fox News personalities didn’t allow Kott’s defense. “That is a tactic that is not going to work,” raged Bruce. “The American people don’t like it, and they are taking it personally. Look at his numbers. It’s not going to work.” As Faulkner drew the conversation to a close, she told Kott she was withdrawing her earlier praise of him for not name-calling.

Then she added, “What I love about him, he never plays the victim. He was like, ‘Keep weaponizing me. I just keep winning.’ Never plays the victim. I thought he was super presidential today.” The claim confused many, seeing how Trump’s attempt to portray himself as a political martyr is actually one of his main campaign tactics as he closes in on the Republican presidential nomination.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-supreme-court-legal-peril_n_65e6a554e4b0f8905933ba3a,"Trump’s Staying On The Ballot, But His Legal Peril Is Just Starting",nicholas riccardi,3/4/2024,"DENVER (AP) — Former President Donald Trump gained a clear win at the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, which unanimously ruled that states don’t have the ability to bar him — or any other federal candidates — from the ballot under a rarely-used constitutional provision that prohibits those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. The decision shuts down a push in dozens of states to end Trump’s candidacy through a clause in the 14th Amendment, written to prevent former Confederates from serving in government after the Civil War. But it may open the door to further electoral uncertainty, exposing more state officials to disqualification under the provision and setting up a constitutional showdown should Trump win the election. Facing four separate criminal trials, Trump’s legal peril may just be beginning. So is the Supreme Court’s role in that process. Here are some takeaways: A TECHNICAL, BUT STILL BIG, WIN The most significant thing the court did Monday was to overturn a Colorado Supreme Court ruling from December that Trump was not eligible to be president because he violated the insurrection clause, Section 3, of the 14th Amendment. This will also stop efforts to kick him off the ballot in Illinois, Maine and other states. Had the Supreme Court let the Colorado ruling stand, it could have triggered a new wave of litigation that might have left Trump disqualified in many states. The high court avoided addressing that politically contentious issue of whether Trump played a role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol that would have barred him from seeking office. The ruling is almost devoid of references to Jan. 6 or insurrection, and doesn’t address whether Trump committed such an act by sparking the attack on the Capitol. Instead it focuses on the technical, procedural question of who gets to decide an election challenge under Section 3. All nine justices agreed that is the purview of Congress. But a narrower majority of five went further, ruling it can only be done through legislation. That exposes significant splits underneath the unanimous majority, and points toward the greatest uncertainty the ruling creates. A TIME BOMB FOR JAN. 6, 2025? One possible outcome that the case presented was the prospect of unelected judges disqualifying the man dominating who has already received hundreds of thousands of votes in the nominating process. But another potential nightmare is that if Congress is the only entity that can determine whether a presidential hopeful is indeed disqualified for engaging in “insurrection,” that it makes that determination on Jan. 6, 2025, when required to certify a possible Trump victory in the presidential election. The high court shut down the first possibility, but may have left the door open to the second one. The five-justice majority — all from the court’s conservative wing — said Congress can implement Section 3 through legislation, “subject of course to judicial review.” (That means the court reserves for itself the right to have the final say.) That triggered a dissent from the court’s three liberals, who complained that that “shuts the door on other potential means of federal enforcement.” That would appear to include a rejection of Trump’s electors should he win the election ― but multiple legal experts said Monday that it wasn’t that clear, and the only way to know may be for Congress to try. FEELING THE HEAT The 14th Amendment case is one of two putting the high court squarely in the midst of the ongoing presidential election. Last week, the court agreed to hear Trump’s appeal of a federal ruling that he’s not entitled to immunity from criminal charges for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Trump’s trial on those charges was originally scheduled to begin Monday, but has been postponed because of the battle over his immunity challenge. The high court taking up his appeal in late April raises the possibility that trial won’t conclude until after the presidential election. The justices’ discomfort over being put in the middle of the nation’s partisan divide came through in a brief, but notable, concurring opinion by Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Though one of the court’s conservatives, she didn’t agree with the majority’s ruling that Congress can only enforce Section 3 through legislation. But she didn’t want to sign onto the liberals’ dissent, either, instead warning against focusing too much on partisan divisions. “...this is not the time to amplify disagreement with stridency,” Barrett wrote. “The Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up.” “For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case,” she concluded. “That is the message Americans should take home.” ACTION IN THE STATES The court’s ruling shuts off using Section 3 against federal officials absent action by Congress but it leaves open the ability of states to use the provision against their own state officials, noting there’s a rich record after the Civil War of just those sorts of actions. That’s already begun anew in the post-Jan. 6 era. The first disqualification under Section 3 in more than a century came in 2022, when a New Mexico court removed Couy Griffin, who was convicted of entering the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6 while leading a group called “Cowboys for Trump,” from his rural county commission. The group that brought that case, Citizens for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington, next filed the Colorado case against Trump. They said they were eager to continue filing Section 3 cases against lower-level Jan. 6 participants. TRUMP’S LEGAL TRAVAILS AHEAD Few observers expected the Supreme Court to keep Trump off the ballot. But he’s facing far more perilous legal road ahead. The first of Trump’s criminal trials, for allegedly falsifying business records to pay hush money to an adult film actress during the 2016 presidential campaign, is scheduled to start in New York later this month. The former president is also appealing a New York judge’s ruling that he pay $355 million for fraud committed by his businesses, and verdict that he pay a writer $83 million for defaming her after she sued him for sexual assault.

Depending on how and how quickly the high court rules on Trump’s immunity claim, he could still face charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election in Washington DC before this November’s election. Two more cases are more likely to come later – in Atlanta where Trump faces state charges for his 2020 election plot, and in Florida where he’s tentatively scheduled for a May trial on improper retention of classified documents after leaving the presidency, but the trial date is expected to be postponed. Monday was a win Trump needed to continue his campaign, but his days in court are far from over.

The suit was filed by former Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal, former chief financial officer Ned Segal, former head of legal and policy Vijaya Gadde and former general counsel Sean Edgett. The executives, fired after Musk’s 2022 takeover, say they were entitled to severance due to clauses in their contracts. (Twitter was later renamed X.) The amounts include a year’s salary and stock options, but the group claims Musk “fired them without reason, then made up fake cause and appointed employees of his various companies to uphold his decision.” According to Agrawal’s offer letter, obtained by The New York Times, he was entitled to a severance payment of more than $57 million. Segal was entitled to more than $44 million in benefits and Gadde more than $20 million. Edgett was also entitled to nearly $7 million, according to the suit. “Musk’s refusal to pay Plaintiffs their benefits is part of a larger pattern of refusing to pay Twitter’s former employees the benefits and other compensation they are due,” the complaint says. “He claimed in his termination letters that each Plaintiff committed ‘gross negligence’ and ‘willful misconduct’ without citing a single fact in support of this claim.” The group’s lawyers argued the tactic fit with Musk’s public pledges to deny severance to employees he fired after taking over Twitter. The suit added Musk had vowed a “lifetime of revenge” on the former executives after the group blocked his attempt to walk out on the $44 billion takeover deal.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/election-2024-north-dakota-gop-trump_n_65e68359e4b0d2a2475a7a93,"Donald Trump Wins North Dakota Republican Caucuses, Adding To Victories Going Into Super Tuesday",jack dura,3/4/2024,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Donald Trump won the North Dakota Republican presidential caucuses on Monday, adding to his string of victories heading into Super Tuesday. The former president finished first in voting conducted at 12 caucus sites, ahead of former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The results resumes Trump’s winning streak, which was briefly interrupted on Sunday when Haley notched her first victory of the campaign in the District of Columbia’s primary. The White House hopefuls now turn their attention to Super Tuesday, when results will pour in from 16 states in contests that amount to the single biggest delegate haul of any day in the presidential primary. Trump and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, are dominating their races and are on track to winning their nominations later this month. Under North Dakota’s rules, candidates are eligible to win delegates if they finish with at least 20% of the vote. However, a candidate who wins at least 60% of the vote receives all of the state’s 29 delegates. Four candidates were on the ballot, including Trump and Nikki Haley. The other candidates, who have received little attention, were Florida businessman David Stuckenberg and Texas businessman and pastor Ryan Binkley, who recently ended his campaign. In 2016, it was a North Dakota delegate who helped Trump secure the number needed for the Republican presidential nomination. He swept North Dakota’s three electoral college votes in 2016 and 2020, winning about 63% and 65% of those votes, respectively. As president, Trump visited Bismarck and Mandan in 2017 to talk about tax cuts, and he campaigned twice in Fargo in 2018 for Kevin Cramer in the then-congressman’s successful Senate bid against Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. North Dakota’s Democratic-NPL Party is holding a presidential primary almost entirely by mail, with mail-in voting from Feb. 20 to March 30, and limited in-person voting for residents of Indian reservations. President Joe Biden, Rep. Dean Phillips and six others are on the ballot. A third party will count ballots in Fargo on March 30, with results available on the party’s website afterward.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/producer-lil-rod-recording-studio-shooting-new-complaint_n_65e6320ce4b0f890593397ec,"Producer Lil Rod Accuses Diddy, Diddy's Son Of 'Massive' Cover-Up In Studio Shooting",taiyler s. mitchell,3/4/2024,"Music producer Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones is accusing Sean “Diddy” Combs and his son of a “massive” cover-up of their involvement in a 2022 shooting, according to an amended complaint. The new allegations add to Jones’ original lawsuit, in which he accuses Diddy of sexual assault and harassment. In new filings, Lil Rod claimed that Diddy or his son Justin shot Justin’s friend, identified in the complaint as a 30-year-old named G, in the abdomen and near his leg or hip area in a bathroom at Chalice Recording Studio in Los Angeles in September 2022. He claims that G has since disappeared. The complaint, which included pictures purported to show a bloodied bathroom, said the shooting followed an argument involving Diddy, Justin and G during a “writers and producers camp” at the studio. The three moved to a nearby bathroom just 2 feet away from Lil Rod when multiple shots were fired, at which point the producer feared being shot through the door, according to the complaint. It then added that Diddy and Justin left the bathroom while G remained on the floor and that multiple people then crowded around the door. In an effort to help G, Lil Rod applied pressure to his wounds, propped him up on the toilet and urged the surrounding bystanders to call for an ambulance, according to the complaint. Lil Rod then carried G to the ambulance in front of the studio as Diddy and his son “disappeared to another part of the studio,” according to the document. The complaint claims that G was “physically incapable of walking” and that Lil Rod had to carry him to the ambulance. “Mr. Combs gave strict instructions to inform the police that he had nothing to do with the shooting. He also forced Mr. Jones to lie to the police by telling them that G was shot standing outside the studio by a drive-by assailant,” the complaint says. Lil Rod’s recollection of the shooting clashes with the official Los Angeles Police Department account and claims from Diddy’s attorney Shawn Holley that the shooting did not happen at the studio, NBC News reported Monday. At the time, KCAL-TV in Los Angeles reported that the victim was shot outside of the studio, citing the LAPD. The report, which was featured in the amended complaint, did not include names. “When LAPD arrived on scene, it was immediately determined (conclusively) that the shooting took place some distance from the studio,” Holley told NBC News. “Neither Sean nor Justin were in the vicinity or even aware of what had occurred until afterwards. So I don’t think either of them were interviewed [by police],” Holley added. Further, the complaint included a screenshot of an Instagram message from the studio to an unnamed recipient that claimed the shooting occurred “half a block away from Chalice.” “As of the date of this filing, neither the Los Angeles Police Department, nor the Los Angeles Fire Department have released any official reports surrounding this shooting. There has been no body camera footage, and no 911 call recording. What is even more disturbing, is that there has been no citing [sic] of G,” the complaint said. In Lil Rod’s initial complaint, filed on Feb. 26 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, he accuses Diddy of “constant unsolicited and unauthorized groping”; coercing him to engage in sexual acts with sex workers; as well as lacing alcohol given to Lil Rod and his guests, which included underage girls. In addition, the complaint says that Diddy runs a racketeering enterprise has not paid him for his production work on his latest album, “The Love Album.” Rod also claims in the suit that Diddy said he was “responsible for” a shooting involving a rapper named Shyne in 1999. “Filing a lawsuit should never be the first option in a dispute. We can have an honest discussion to resolve the issues as I suggested, or we can follow the same plan Shawn Holley used that got her clients Danny Masterson and Tory Lanez convicted. Makes one wonder who is really managing this situation for Mr. Combs,” Lil Rod’s attorney Tyrone Blackburn said, according to NBC News. Lil Rod is the first man to file a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against Diddy, who has branded himself as “Brother Love” despite previous allegations of violence and faulty business practices from numerous men who had been employees, Rolling Stone reported. The Bad Boy Entertainment founder was accused of sexual abuse in four other lawsuits in November, starting with a harrowing lawsuit filed by an ex-girlfriend, model and R&B artist Cassie. In a 35-page complaint, Cassie accused Diddy of raping and abusing her, forcing her to have sex with male sex workers as he watched, and inciting a drug and alcohol addiction. The “Me & U” singer’s accusations came as the Adult Survivors Act in New York, which allowed accusers to come forward with allegations of sexual abuse beyond the set statute of limitations, was set to expire in November. Cassie and Diddy settled the lawsuit the day after it was filed. Following Cassie’s suit, at least three more from other women were filed under the New York statute before it expired. One woman, identified in the lawsuit as Liza Gardner, accused Diddy and singer Aaron Hall of raping her and her friend in 1990 or 1991. Another woman, Joi Dickerson-Neal, accused Diddy of raping her, filming it and showing the video to others in 1991. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a lawsuit claiming that Diddy, former Bad Boy Records President Harve Pierre and an unnamed man “gang raped” and “sex trafficked” her when she was 17 years old in 2003. At the time, Diddy was 34. Following the onslaught of lawsuits, Diddy, who has denied all the accusations against him, stepped down from his position as chairman of the media company Revolt in November. Plans for a reality TV show that was set to focus on his life and family were cut short in December. “Enough is enough,” he wrote in an Instagram post in December. “Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear: I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. I will fight for my name, my family and for the truth.” The next four years will change America forever.

John Thune (R-S.D.) confirmed Monday that he’s throwing his hat in the ring to become the Senate Republican leader once Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) steps down. Thune, the Senate minority whip, shared the news with KELO-TV in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. “Well, I hope to be, and I’m going to do everything I can to convince my colleagues,” Thune replied when asked if he was gunning for the leadership position. “They’re the voters. They’re the ones who ultimately make the decision. But that, as we look at a new generation of consistent, principled, conservative leadership in the United States Senate that empowers our Senate Republicans, that puts a [check and balance] against ... what has been the, a very liberal Schumer/Biden agenda, I’m prepared to lead that effort,” referring to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and President Joe Biden. His announcement comes days after 82-year-old McConnell, the longest-serving Senate leader in history, said he’ll step down in November and leave office when his term ends in January 2027. “One of life’s underappreciated moments is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter. This will be my last term as Republican leader in the Senate,” an emotional McConnell told his colleagues Wednesday. Thune has served in the Senate since 2005 and has been the Republican whip since 2019. He was a vocal opponent of efforts by former President Donald Trump, the likely GOP nominee in this year’s presidential election, to overturn the 2020 election results. Trump’s plot to overturn Biden’s victory would “go down like a shot dog,” Thune said at the time, adding, “I just don’t think it makes a lot of sense to put everybody through this when you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be.” The next four years will change America forever.

The “Baywatch” star — whose ultra feminine and glammed-up appearance contributed to impossibly high beauty standards for women in the 1990s — made headlines in September when she decided to ditch her signature look and attend Paris Fashion Week without makeup. In an interview with fashion and lifestyle outlet Highsnobiety that was published last week, the former Playboy model said that her decision to go makeup-free has been a part of her “healing experience” and noted that she now uses a “more natural” beauty routine. She also shared how the choice to get rid of her glam team made those closest to her, including her two sons, Brandon Thomas and Dylan Jagger, nervous. “My boys were like, ‘Mom, you must have a glam team,’” Anderson said. “And my agents were like, ‘You have to have a glam team! Where’s the stylist?’ I go, ‘I know how to put a dress on myself. I don’t need someone buttoning up my blouse. I got this.’ And they were just horrified.” Anderson’s decision to nix the makeup has received praise. Scarlett Johansson called Anderson’s makeup-free look at Paris Fashion Week “powerful,” while Jamie Lee Curtis said she was “so impressed and floored” by the “Home Improvement” actor’s “act of courage and rebellion.” Elsewhere in her Highsnobiety interview, Anderson said that the look that made her famous was never authentic. “I was actually always a tomboy growing up,” she said. “I never wanted to wear a dress. I was athletic. I made mud pies.” She also hinted as to why she initially embraced a style that wasn’t really hers. “We all get roped into, ‘Oh, I want to be successful so I can have this and this, and show people that I’m cool, chic, admired,’” Anderson said. “And then we’re all just left with debt and a fancy car. It’s just like chasing age. You’re not going to win.

Under their agreements, Kenneth Chesebro and Jim Troupis turned over more than 1,400 pages of documents, emails and text messages, along with photos and video, offering a detailed account of the scheme’s origins in Wisconsin. The communications show how they, with coordination from Trump campaign officials, replicated the strategy in six other states including Georgia, where Chesebro has already pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the 2020 election. The agreements settle a civil lawsuit brought by Democrats in 2022 against the two attorneys and 10 Republicans in Wisconsin who posed as fake electors. The Republicans settled in December. “Our democracy demands better than this,” said Scott Thompson, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys who helped negotiate the agreements. “That is why this lawsuit … consistently sought transparency, accountability and deterrence. We can’t let this happen again.” There is no admission of wrongdoing or liability in the agreements in which Chesebro and Troupis promise to never participate in similar efforts involving future presidential campaigns. Troupis must also pay an undisclosed amount to the plaintiffs. Troupis said Monday in an emailed statement that the “alternate elector ballots” were “a reasonable course of action” given that the 2020 results were appealable to the U.S. Supreme Court. “The settlement was made to avoid endless litigation, and nothing in today’s settlement constitutes an admission of fault, nor should it,” he added. Phone and text messages left Monday for Chesebro weren’t immediately returned. Electors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party’s electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome. The documents show how Chesebro and Troupis, Trump’s attorney in Wisconsin, used arcane laws in rationalizing and drafting the false certificates for the fake electors. They also reveal how the two strategized ways to delay deadlines for certifying electoral votes and sway public opinion, including floating ideas on conservative talk radio. In November 2020, as they were awaiting a decision from the then-conservative leaning Wisconsin Supreme Court on Trump’s effort to invalidate thousands of votes in the state, Chesebro suggested to Troupis that they contact conservative radio hosts in Milwaukee and Madison: “Mostly to maximize the chance that SCOW (Supreme Court of Wisconsin) justices hear about this quickly and prejudge the case?” He ended with a winking emoji. The fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied wrongdoing. Michigan and Nevada have criminally charged fake electors, but there’s no known criminal investigation in Wisconsin. Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, has suggested he’s relying on federal investigators while also not ruling out a state probe. Attorneys who negotiated the settlement said information in the documents has already been provided to Kaul’s office. Monday’s agreements were announced by Georgetown University Law Center’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, Law Forward and the Madison-based Stafford Rosenbaum law firm. According to the plaintiffs’ attorneys, the documents show how Troupis, an attorney who has represented the Republican Party of Wisconsin and is a former judge, was deeply involved in the origins of the effort. Trump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes. At Troupis’ urging, Chesebro drafted memos in the final months of 2020 detailing how to prepare the fake elector certificates and how they should be signed. The documents include a 10-minute video of the fake electors who cheer and take photos as they cast and sign ballots for Trump at the Wisconsin State Capitol. There are no direct communications with Trump in the documents, but there are exchanges with top campaign aides and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. A day after Chesebro shares a Dec. 6 memo on strategies, Troupis follows up via text: “I have sent it to the White House this afternoon. The real decision makers.” There’s a brief mention of a Dec. 15 afternoon meeting with Trump in the Oval Office that both men attended with others. Days later, Chesebro refers to Trump’s social media post summoning followers to Washington on Jan. 6, saying “Be there, will be wild!” “Wow. Based on three days ago, I think we have a unique understanding of this,” Chesebro texts Troupis. Trump campaign officials did offer their assessment of each state’s progress on the fake elector plan. “Wisconsin appears to be the most organized state so far,” concludes a Dec. 11, 2020, email from Trump campaign associate general counsel Joshua Findlay to Chesebro. “This all came out of Wisconsin and expanded to other states,” said attorney Mary McCord with Georgetown’s institute, who helped negotiate the settlement. “That was a significant part of the narrative that led to the violence on Jan 6.” After the deadly attack at the Capitol, the attorneys discussed falsely deflecting blame from Trump supporters to members of the anti-fascist movement, among others. “It’d be nice if Trump surrogates could get across that without antifa’s role in the actual breaking in … the scene at the Capitol would have been entirely peaceful. And that Trump could not (have) reasonably foreseen this,” Chesebro wrote in a text to Troupis. The next four years will change America forever.

Cohen broke out a bottle of tequila and a pair of shot glasses, clearly happy with the decision. Cooper, who is not a drinker, was less happy about it.

He later admitted he had been “a bit overserved.” With booze off the menu last year, the two were given alcohol-free “mystery” shots and tried to guess what they were.

In Australia, more than 1 million people watched a pyrotechnic display centered around Sydney’s famous Opera House and harbor bridge — a number of spectators equivalent to one in five of the city’s residents. “It’s total madness,” said German tourist Janna Thomas, who waited in line since 7:30 a.m. to secure a prime waterfront location. Some 90,000 police and security officers were deployed around France including along Champs-Elysees Avenue, where large crowds took in a multidimensional light show projected onto the Arc de Triomphe showcasing the history of Paris and sports on the menu for next year's Summer Olympics in the city. In New York, people lined up early to nab a spot in Times Square for the midnight ball drop. Officials and party organizers said they were prepared to keep tens of thousands of revelers safe in the heart of Manhattan, as the city has seen near-daily protests sparked by the Israel-Hamas war. Stunning fireworks displays bloomed at iconic locations like the Acropolis in Athens, Greece; reflected in the sleek glass walls of the world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates; and accompanied a collective cheer filling the air in Nairobi, Kenya. China celebrated relatively quietly, with most major cities banning fireworks over safety and pollution concerns. Still, people gathered and performers danced in colorful costumes in Beijing, while a crowd released wish balloons in Chongqing. During his New Year address, President Xi Jinping said the country would focus on building momentum for economic recovery in 2024 and pledged China would “surely be reunified” with Taiwan. In Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, the mood was upbeat as revelers gathered for a fireworks show at the bamboo-shaped Taipei 101 skyscraper and at concerts and other events citywide. In India, thousands of revelers from the financial hub of Mumbai watched the sun set over the Arabian Sea. Fireworks in New Delhi raised concerns that the capital — already infamous for its poor air quality — would be blanketed by a toxic haze on the first morning of the new year. Across Japan, people gathered at temples such as the Tsukiji Temple in Tokyo, where visitors were given free hot milk and corn soup as they stood in line to strike a massive bell. At the Vatican, Pope Francis recalled 2023 as a year marked by wartime suffering. During his traditional Sunday blessing from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square, he offered prayers for “the tormented Ukrainian people and the Palestinian and Israeli populations, the Sudanese people and many others.” “At the end of the year, we will have the courage to ask ourselves how many human lives have been shattered by armed conflict, how many dead and how much destruction, how much suffering, how much poverty,” the pontiff said. In Russia, the country's military actions in Ukraine overshadowed end-of-year celebrations, with the usual fireworks and concert on Moscow’s Red Square canceled, as they were last year. Even without the festivities, people gathered in the square,and some cheered and pointed their phones at a clock counting down the year's final seconds. After shelling in the Russian border city of Belgorod Saturday killed 24 people, some local authorities across the country also canceled their firework displays, including in Vladivostok. Millions were expected to tune in to President Vladimir Putin’s New Year’s prerecorded address, in which he said no force could divide Russians and stop the country’s development. Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 35 people Sunday, hospital officials said, as fighting raged across the tiny enclave a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war will continue for “many more months,” resisting international calls for a cease-fire. Skyscrapers in Tel Aviv were lit up in yellow to call for the release of hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza for more than 80 days. “While you are counting down until the new year, our time and our lives stopped,"" said Moran Betzer Tayar, the aunt of Yagev Buchshtab, a 34-year-old hostage. In the Gaza Strip, displaced Palestinians huddled around fires in a makeshift refugee camp. “From the intensity of the pain we live, we do not feel that there is a new year,” said Kamal al-Zeinaty, who has lost multiple family members in the conflict. “All the days are the same.” In Iraq, a Christmas tree was decorated with Palestinian flags and symbolic bodies in funeral shrouds, placed beside a liberty monument in central Baghdad. Many Christians in Iraq have cancelled this year’s festivities in solidarity with Gaza, and have chosen to limit their celebrations to prayers and rituals. “We hope that the new year, 2024, will be a year of goodness, prosperity and joy,” said Ahmed Ali, a Baghdad resident. In Muslim-majority Pakistan, the government banned all New Year’s Eve celebrations in solidarity with the Palestinians. New York Mayor Eric Adams said there were “no specific threats” to his city’s annual bash. Nevertheless, police said they would expand the security perimeter around the party, creating a “buffer zone” that would allow them to head off potential demonstrations. On New Year's Eve 2022, a machete-wielding man attacked three police officers a few blocks from Times Square. The next four years will change America forever.

German authorities said they etained three more people in connection with a reported threat of a New Year’s Eve attack by Islamic extremists on the world-famous Cologne Cathedral. In Berlin, some 4,500 police officers were expected to keep order and avoid riots like those seen a year ago. Authorities also banned the traditional use of firecrackers for several streets across the city. They also banned a pro-Palestinian protest in the Neukoelln neighborhood of the German capital, which has seen several pro-Palestinian riots.

In an interview with Israeli Army Radio, ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that his “demand” was for Gaza to stop being a “hotbed where 2 million people grow up on hatred and aspire to destroy the State of Israel.” He did not specify why Palestinian civilians in Gaza would aspire to destroy Israel. According to a translation by Haaretz, the Religious Zionism party chairman also said that Israel must occupy and resettle Gaza in order to regain security. “If we act strategically, they will emigrate and we will live there. We won’t let 2 million stay. With 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs in Gaza, the ‘day after’ debate will be different,” Smotrich said, as translated by an Israel analyst with the nonprofit Crisis Group. “They want to leave, they’ve been living in a ghetto for 75 years.” Smotrich agrees with @mashagessen that Gaza is a ghetto: ""If we act strategically they will emigrate and we will live there. We won't let 2 million stay. With 100-200K in Gaza, the 'day after' debate will be diff. They want to leave, they've been living in a ghetto for 75 years."" https://t.co/jbUaFBClMF Comparing the plight of Palestinians to the suffering of European Jews during the Nazi regime has been a taboo subject, though human rights organizations and scholars have drawn similarities between the two struggles, particularly after Oct. 7. Just days ago, South Africa launched a case at the top United Nations court accusing Israel of carrying out the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Earlier this month, prominent Russian American journalist and writer Masha Gessen was almost not awarded the prestigious Hannah Arendt prize in Germany after they published an essay in The New Yorker comparing Gaza to the Jewish ghettos of Nazi-occupied Europe. “For the last seventeen years, Gaza has been a hyperdensely populated, impoverished, walled-in compound where only a small fraction of the population had the right to leave for even a short amount of time ― in other words, a ghetto,” they wrote in their Dec. 9 essay. “Not like the Jewish ghetto in Venice or an inner-city ghetto in America but like a Jewish ghetto in an Eastern European country occupied by Nazi Germany.” “Presumably, the more fitting term ‘ghetto’ would have drawn fire for comparing the predicament of besieged Gazans to that of ghettoized Jews,” they continued. “It also would have given us the language to describe what is happening in Gaza now. The ghetto is being liquidated.” This is not the first time Smotrich has spoken offensively of Palestinians. In March, the minister delivered a speech in Paris claiming that there is no Palestinian “nation,” “history” or “language.” In February, he called for a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank to be “erased” after Jewish settlers rampaged through it in response to a shooting attack that killed two Israelis. Immediately after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, he reportedly told fellow Cabinet members that “it’s time to be cruel,” even if it means killing hostages in Gaza in the process. But Smotrich is not the only Israeli official saying the quiet part out loud about Gaza. Several of the country’s lawmakers have made comments appearing to support a second Nakba (when Palestinians were expelled from their homes and land en masse 75 years ago) in Gaza in order to feel a sense of security after the war. Last week, lawmaker Danny Danon told Kan Bet radio that it would be humane for Israel to “make it easier for Gazans to leave for other countries.” Intelligence Minister Gila Gamiliel published an op-ed in The Jerusalem Post last month suggesting that Western nations should take in Palestinians from Gaza as an act of “voluntary resettlement.” Netanyahu himself has made similar comments, telling members of his right-wing Likud coalition at a meeting last week that the mass expulsion of Palestinians out of Gaza would be a positive outcome of the bombardment. Nihad Awad, the national executive director for the Muslim rights group CAIR, released a statement on Sunday demanding that the Biden administration condemn the “latest open call for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza.” “Our nation’s leaders must finally acknowledge what has long been known and demonstrated daily by Israel’s genocidal actions,” Awad said. “That Israel’s racist government seeks to ethnically cleanse Gaza by slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians and making it unlivable for those it does not kill.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The former public diplomacy minister told Channel 13 TV that she “sinned against” the democratic, secular public and, as a result, “caused pain” for Israelis as well as fear. “And I am sorry for this,” she said. The Hamas assault, which led to an estimated 1,200 deaths and 240 kidnappings, has triggered a devastating war that has raged for nearly three months.

Kathleen Wilson filed the lawsuit last week in Hennepin County District Court, accusing Dr. Kevin Molldrem of Molldrem Family Dentistry in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, of providing negligent treatment in July 2020 that caused significant injuries to Wilson, along with providing an unsafe dosage of anesthesia and falsifying medical records to cover it up, the Star Tribune reported. Molldrem and his attorney, Nathaniel Weimer, did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday. According to the Star Tribune, Wilson’s legal team retained Dr. Avrum Goldstein, a dentist in Florida, to provide an expert opinion and review Wilson’s medical records from Molldrem and subsequent providers. Goldstein’s Nov. 14 report identified various duty-of-care breaches. Goldstein said in the report that Molldrem made the right diagnosis, but he provided poor-quality treatment. Wilson had decay on “virtually every tooth in her mouth, something that is quite rare,” Goldstein wrote. Molldrem’s attempt to restore all Wilson’s teeth in one visit did nothing to address her susceptibility to disease or the potential of losing teeth, he said. “Katie required a slow, thoughtful, careful and measured response to her disease. Trying to fill every hole in every tooth in her mouth in one visit is not only the antithesis of what was indicated, it is not humanely possible to achieve in an effective or constructive manner,” Goldstein said, adding that it is “inconceivable” to address 28 teeth in 5 1⁄2 hours. One challenge of a long appointment is maintaining adequate anesthesia, Goldstein said. The maximum dosage is 490 mg — but Molldrem administered 960 mg to Wilson. Wilson’s records show that Molldrem said he administered eight tubes of dental anesthetic, known as carpules. But Goldstein found the first dose alone was eight carpules, and he administered 15 carpules throughout the visit. Wilson went to a different dental office for an evaluation showing recurrent decay and other damage. For several months in 2022 she was treated at the University of Minnesota Dental School “for repair and replacement of many of her restorations in an attempt to stabilize her mouth,” Goldstein said.

Eddie Bernice Johnson Dies At 88,ap,12/31/2023,"DALLAS, Texas (AP) — Trailblazing longtime U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, a nurse from Texas who helped bring hundreds of millions of federal dollars to the Dallas area as the region’s most powerful Democrat, died Sunday. She was 88. Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson and many other leaders issued statements about her death after her son posted about it on Facebook. The Dallas Morning News also confirmed her death with an unnamed source close to the family. No cause of death was given. “She was the single most effective legislator Dallas has ever had,” the mayor said in a statement. “Nobody brought more federal infrastructure money home to our city. Nobody fought harder for our communities and our residents’ interests and safety. And nobody knew how to navigate Washington better for the people of Dallas.” Eddie Bernice Johnson served in the House for three decades after becoming the first registered nurse elected to Congress and first Black chief psychiatric nurse at Dallas’ Veterans Affairs hospital. She went on to become the first Black woman to chair the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and she also led the Congressional Black Caucus. She left office in January after repeatedly delaying her retirement. Before Congress, she served in the Texas legislature. Johnson used her committee leadership position to fight against Republican efforts to block action on climate change. Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford said Johnson was “a fierce advocate for expanding STEM opportunities to Black and minority students” who also played a key role in helping the Biden administration pass a major package of incentives for computer chip manufacturers. Johnson was born in Waco and grew up in the segregated South. Dallas’ once-segregated Union Station was renamed in her honor in 2019. Her own experience with racism helped spur her to get involved in politics. She recalled that officials at the VA hospital were shocked that she was Black after they hired her sight-unseen, so they rescinded their offer for her to live in a dorm on campus.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) cares about only one of them. A few weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered the unsealing of court documents that identified people associated with the disgraced financier, who died in a New York City jail in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to traffic minors for sex. The list could be released on Tuesday, and some of the names expected to be on it include former presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. On Sunday, Greene offered her take on the upcoming release and used the opportunity to attack Clinton, who reportedly flew on Epstein’s jet multiple times, according to Epstein’s former pilot, in a post on X: “For some us, it’s no surprise at all that Bill Clinton will be named in the Jeffrey Epstein files. “We said it a long time ago but they labeled us conspiracy theorists. “There will be lots of names you’ve never heard of and the IC collected info on them. “Pedophiles belong in jail not on secret government lists.” For some us, it’s no surprise at all that Bill Clinton will be named in the Jeffrey Epstein files.We said it a long time ago but they labeled us conspiracy theorists.There will be lots of names you’ve never heard of and the IC collected info on them.Pedophiles belong in… Clinton’s friendship with Epstein, who’s death was ruled a suicide, admittedly looks sketchy. Still, many people on X, formerly known as Twitter, called out the controversial congresswoman for going after Clinton, a Democrat, while ignoring Epstein’s longtime association with Trump. I find it really rich that Republicans are so quick to jump to, “Bill Clinton is on the Jeffrey Epstein list” and even THEN, they still can’t say the next obvious statement - that if Clinton is in it, so is Trump. If they’re both on it, lock them both up. https://t.co/5WrqNjO1cQ You're so obsessed with Bill Clinton being on the list that you're overlooking that Trump, the leader of YOUR party, will be on the same list, you raging hypocritical bigot.

Video footage of Clarkson’s New Year’s Eve performance at Planet Hollywood’s Bakkt Theater shows the three-time Grammy winner speaking with two concertgoers, identified by Rolling Stone as Ryan and Marcelo. “Our wedding is tonight, with you,” one of the men told Clarkson, who responded by handing her microphone to an officiant who then performed the quickie ceremony. “By the power of Kelly Clarkson’s show ... I pronounce you both husband and husband,” the officiant said as the crowd erupted in cheers and applause. Watch footage of the Dec. 31 nuptials below. After posing for photos with the newlyweds, a beaming Clarkson gestured to a woman who appeared to be the mother of one of the grooms. “What did your baby just do?” she quipped.

Clarkson’s Vegas residency premiered in July, shortly after the release of her latest album, “Chemistry.” Though the original 10-show run concluded in August, she later announced a four-date extension that’s slated to wrap next month. “Chemistry,” which dropped in June, is Clarkson’s 10th studio album. The 14 new songs are said to have been inspired by the “American Idol” veteran’s contentious 2022 split from ex-husband Brandon Blackstock. “I hadn’t really been working hardcore on an album until I needed to,” she told Variety in 2022. “But then the whole divorce thing happened, and I needed to write it. And then I didn’t know if I was going to release it, because you can be very angry in that state of mind. So some of the songs, they definitely cover the gamut of emotions; there’s everything on the album. It’s almost like the arc of a relationship, because the beginning is so beautiful and so sweet, and then it evolves. And sometimes it doesn’t evolve how you want.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

On Sunday, the actor and comedian revealed on Instagram that she’s been confiding in Jane Fonda as she prepares to finalize her split from husband Randy Bick. She shared photos of a recent hangout with the “Monster-in-Law” star, showing the two women seated in a kitchen with the remnants of food on an assortment of tableware before them. “My girlfriends are going to get me through this,” Griffin wrote in a caption. “Last night I had to use the bat phone. Me…‘Fonda, it’s Griffin. My heart is broken. I can’t eat I can’t sleep.’” Fonda, she said, responded by telling her: “Come on over kid. I’ll make you something. You’ll eat and I’ll listen.” A post shared by Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) By Monday afternoon, a number of other celebrities had pledged their support for Griffin under the post. “Oh Kathy,” actor Debra Messing wrote in the comments section. ”You are loved and supported and you will rise out of this life’s difficult chapter stronger. You are a survivor. I’m so so sorry you’re hurting. I wish I could take it away.” Added Broadway’s Kristin Chenoweth: “You. Will. Get. Through. This.” Griffin filed for divorce from Bick last week, citing “irreconcilable differences.” The two began dating in 2011 and were married on New Year’s Day in 2020. Their officiant was none other than Lily Tomlin — who, incidentally, co-starred with Fonda in the classic 1980 comedy “9 to 5,” as well as on Netflix’s “Grace and Frankie,” which wrapped in 2022 after seven seasons. When news of her impending divorce broke, Griffin issued a short, albeit succinct, statement on social media. “Well...sh*t. This sucks,” she wrote.

Since then, they’ve appeared together at a number of events, including a 2019 concert organized by the Los Angeles LGBT Center and a 2012 pre-Grammy Awards gala. In a 2016 appearance on “Larry King Now,” Griffin recalled looking to Fonda for support following a “really gnarly breakup” with an undisclosed partner. As for specific advice, she said Fonda had told her: “Whenever you’ve been through something that really rocks your world, don’t do anything for a year.

On Monday, the “Avengers” star called his 10-year-old daughter, Ava, “Reason number One” for his recovery after he was critically injured on New Year’s Day in 2023. “I asked her to ‘wait for me’ when I first saw her January 14 as I arrived home,” Renner captioned a heartfelt Instagram post, which included a photo of Ava hugging him. “As I got better, she got better, less afraid. There is simply no better motivator to recover than to heal your family and friends.” He added: “Thank you all for your love and support this last full year. I needed every ounce of goodwill and prayer.” The Marvel actor broke more than 30 bones and underwent multiple surgeries after he was crushed by a 7-ton snowplow on Jan. 1, 2023, in Reno, Nevada. While appearing on a New Year’s Eve broadcast Sunday, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Renner what motivated him to pull through his “unbelievable battle,” prompting the actor to gush about the love of his family.

Although the idea of Trump running the country from a prison cell instead of the West Wing might be disturbing to many Americans, at least one commentator on Monday’s episode of “Outnumbered” seemed OK with it. Panelists on the Fox News show were discussing the upcoming GOP primary season and how it may affect Trump’s chances of retaking the White House when attorney Paul Mauro predicted that Trump would be the candidate “left standing” by the time Super Tuesday rolls around on March 5. But co-host Kennedy wondered what might happen if the former president, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges he faces, is “indicted at some point.” Fox News medical contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat was quick to proclaim a simple solution. “He can be president from jail if he has to,” she said, adding that Republicans are still rallying around Trump despite the multiple trials he faces. “What happens if he’s indicted at some point?”“He can be President from jail if he has to” pic.twitter.com/StvF60cW4q Although Nesheiwat and others might be comfortable with the leader of the free world governing from behind bars, many users of X, formerly known as Twitter, weren’t as enthusiastic, with some saying that her suggestion smacked of “cult” like behavior.

Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told CNN in August that the Constitution “has very few requirements to serve as President,” but “does not bar anyone indicted, or convicted, or even serving jail time, from running as president and winning the presidency.” That is one reason why many opponents to Trump’s reelection are instead looking at the Constitution’s 14th Amendment as a way to keep him from appearing on ballots. They argue that Trump’s links to the 2021 Capitol riot would prohibit him from holding office under the so-called insurrectionist clause.

After getting boozed up with Andy Cohen while hosting CNN’s live New Year’s Eve show on Sunday night, Cooper found himself cracking up after singer John Mayer dialed into the show alongside some unexpected guests — a whole gang of cats. After Cohen noted that the Grammy winner was calling from a cat bar in Tokyo, a visibly off-guard Cooper launched into a fit of laughter as Mayer sat at the bar surrounded by furry friends. The “Your Body Is a Wonderland” crooner maintained a deadpan expression throughout the interview as a variety of well-fed cats inched by him, adding to the hilarity of the situation. “This doesn’t look sanitary, John!” Cohen commented as Cooper continued giggling. A totally unbothered Mayer casually replied, “I believe it passes all health codes, so I think it’s just fine.” As Mayer continued talking about the bar, Cooper fought back his laughter before stepping away from the camera. “He’s gone. He’s off with the fairies here,” Cohen joked of his co-host. “Just the shot of the cat’s ass in your face is making him delirious,” Cohen added as Mayer impressively maintained a straight face while Cooper tried to hold it together. Fans on X (formerly Twitter) couldn’t hold back from reacting over the amusing moment. John Mayer in this damn Cat Cafe and Anderson crying laughing is too much and I’m about to pee on myself. #CNNNye pic.twitter.com/Kpv4omj15v John Mayer being just absolutely dead serious at a cat bar is probably one of my absolute favorite things on any of the #CNNNYE's.

On Dec. 20, U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney temporarily blocked the law from going into effect, calling it “sweeping, repugnant to the Second Amendment, and openly defiant of the Supreme Court.” The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit delayed that order Saturday to give the court more time to consider the constitutionality of the law, meaning it could take effect Jan. 1 as planned. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) praised the decision in a statement Saturday. “Californians overwhelmingly support efforts to ensure that places like hospitals, libraries and children’s playgrounds remain safe and free from guns,” he said in a statement. Newsom signed several pieces of gun control legislation into law in September, including Senate Bill 2, which restricts the ability to carry firearms in “sensitive places,” such as schools, zoos, religious institutions and sporting events, and on public transportation. In his decision, Carney argued the law “turns nearly every public place in California into a ‘sensitive place.’” The California Rifle and Pistol Association is suing to block the law. Senate Bill 2 is one of many state laws going into effect Monday. Minnesota and Colorado also have gun-related laws going into effect.

Trump fans attempted to shade the band as “sellouts,” “losers” and “pro big government.” Punk rock sellouts 🖕🏻🖕🏻 I’m glad they love the government because I don’t. This is what we call attention seeking sellouts.

That’s so rock n’ roll. 🙄 https://t.co/UAsTcZble8 Nothing says “punk rock” like Government bootlicking, millionaire sellouts playing on ABC. 😂😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/xIOq4cj9ys Three old swifties sucking up to the establishment—among other things—is about as cringe as it gets. https://t.co/QYwILINyse Green Day aint said one word all through the Obama years and not one word about Biden Bought and sold, more like Green Payed However, many people who were pro-Green Day and/or anti-MAGA were quick to point out that the band has made no secret about its politics and that the song was written as a critique of George W. Bush’s presidency. To the bitches bitching: Green Day was never on your side. American Idiot came out in 2004, who was president then? EXACTLY. That album was a middle finger to Dubya, you were just too stupid to realize it. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-us-senate-fetterman_n_6593013ae4b0bf73e176f30f,Sen. Fetterman Feared News About His Depression Would End His Political Career,ap,1/1/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. John Fetterman acknowledges having “dark conversations” about harming himself before he hit “the emergency brake” and sought treatment for depression. He remembers thinking about his three school-age kids. “I can’t be a blueprint for my children. I can’t let them be left alone or not to understand why he would have done that,” the first-term Pennsylvania Democrat told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in a deeply personal and introspective interview taped before the broadcast that aired Sunday. So he checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, last Feb. 15. “There was nowhere else to go,” he said, describing how he often felt during his stay that “there wasn’t any hope sometimes and like, ‘What do I have left?’” He also wondered whether he would survive politically. “When it got released where I was and where it was going, it was a big story. And so, I had assumed that that would be the end of my career,” he said When he sought treatment for clinical depression, Fetterman was still coping with the effects of the stroke he had in May 2022, during his campaign for one of the Senate’s most contested seats. “My heart technically stopped, and it was a very touch-and-go situation,” said Fetterman, 54. A pacemaker was implanted with a defibrillator to manage two heart conditions, atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy. His victory over Republican Mehmet Oz had helped Democrats keep control of the Senate and made him a national figure. It was the height of his political career. But he couldn’t make it out of bed at his home in Braddock, in western Pennsylvania. “I really scared my kids, and they thought, ’You won, Dad. Why aren’t we enough? Why are you still so sad? Why are you even more sad?' And it was hard for — to explain why I was. And, of course, a 9-year-old child wouldn’t understand that. And it was awful,” Fetterman said. So much so that he said he “pleaded not to go down to D.C.” later that November for orientation sessions in Washington for newly elected lawmakers. His favorite holiday was nearing, yet he was unable to think about getting Christmas presents for his children and “dreading” his swearing in on Capitol Hill early in the new year. Within two months, he was at Walter Reed. Aides had described the new senator as being withdrawn and uninterested in eating, discussing work or the usual banter with staff. “This is a conversation that I’ve had with myself and anybody that knows they’re unable to address their depression, is they start to have dark conversations with themself about self-harm,” Fetterman said. “And things continued to kind of tick off the list. And then I kind of hit the emergency brake."" He added, “I knew I needed help.” Before checking into Walter Reed, Fetterman had never publicly discussed his battle with depression. He has since said that he has experienced it on and off throughout his life. He left Walter Reed at the end of March after six weeks of inpatient treatment with his depression “in remission,” according to a statement from his office. Doctors describe “remission” as when a patient responds to treatment so that they have returned to normal social function and they are indistinguishable from someone who has never had depression. Fetterman has since become a visible presence in the Capitol, bantering with reporters, joking with Senate colleagues and speaking up at Senate hearings. To others who are now “facing a really dark holiday time,” Fetterman offered this guidance: “I know that last year’s was desolate. And this year’s might be desolate. Next year’s can be the best ever. And that’s what happened for me.” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-ml-israel-politics_n_6592f5d0e4b0b01d3e403eaa,Israel's Supreme Court Overturns Key Part Of Netanyahu's Judicial Overhaul,"josef federman , melanie lidman",1/1/2024,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel’s Supreme Court on Monday struck down a key component of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s contentious judicial overhaul, a decision that threatens to reopen the fissures in Israeli society that preceded the country’s ongoing war against Hamas. Those divisions were largely put aside while the country focuses on the war in Gaza, which was triggered by a bloody cross-border attack by Hamas. Monday’s court decision could reignite those tensions, which sparked months of mass protests against the government and had rattled the cohesion of the powerful military. There was no immediate reaction from Netanyahu. In Monday’s decision, the court narrowly voted to overturn a law passed in July that prevents judges from striking down government decisions they deem “unreasonable.” Opponents had argued that Netanyahu’s efforts to remove the standard of reasonability opens the door to corruption and improper appointments of unqualified cronies to important positions. The law was the first in a planned overhaul of the Israeli justice system. The overhaul was put on hold after Hamas militants carried out their Oct. 7 attack, killing some 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others. Israel immediately declared war, and is pressing forward with an offensive that Palestinian health officials say has killed nearly 22,000 people in Gaza. In an 8-7 decision, the Supreme Court justices struck down the law because of the “severe and unprecedented harm to the core character of the State of Israel as a democratic country.” The justices also voted 12-3 that they had the authority to overturn so-called “Basic Laws,” major pieces of legislation that serve as a sort of constitution for Israel. It was a significant blow to Netanyahu and his hard-line allies, who claimed the national legislature, not the high court, should have the final word over the legality of legislation and other key decisions. The justices said the Knesset, or parliament, does not have “omnipotent” power. Netanyahu and his allies announced their sweeping overhaul plan shortly after taking office a year ago. It calls for curbing the power of the judges, from limiting the Supreme Court’s ability to review parliamentary decisions to changing the way judges are appointed. Netanyahu and his allies said the changes aim to strengthen democracy by limiting the authority of unelected judges and turning over more powers to elected officials. But opponents see the overhaul as a power grab by Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, and an assault on a key watchdog. Before the war, hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in weekly protests against the government. Among the demonstrators were military reservists, including fighter pilots and members of other elite units, who said they would stop reporting for duty if the overhaul was passed. The reservists make up the backbone of the military. While the reservists quickly returned to duty after the Oct. 7 attacks in a show of unity, it remains unclear what will happen if the overhaul efforts are revived. A resumption of the protests could undermine national unity and affect the military’s readiness if soldiers refuse to report for duty. Under the Israeli system, the prime minister governs through a majority coalition in parliament — in effect giving him control over the executive and legislative branches of government. As a result, the Supreme Court plays a critical oversight role. Critics say that by seeking to weaken the judiciary, Netanyahu and his allies are trying to erode the country’s checks and balances and consolidate power over the third, independent branch of government. Netanyahu’s allies include an array of ultranationalist and religious parties with a list of grievances against the court. His allies have called for increased West Bank settlement construction, annexation of the occupied territory, perpetuating military draft exemptions for ultra-Orthodox men, and limiting the rights of LGBTQ+ people and Palestinians. The U.S. had previously urged Netanyahu to put the plans on hold and seek a broad consensus across the political spectrum. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-us-new-state-laws_n_6592ea53e4b0cd3cf0e5c0fe,New Law Means Fuzzy Dice Are Finally Free To Dangle In Illinois,"david a. lieb , geoff mulvihill",1/1/2024,"Fuzzy dice finally will be free to dangle in Illinois. Starting Monday, police there no longer will be allowed to pull over motorists solely because they have something hanging from the rearview mirror of the windshield. That means air fresheners, parking placards and, yes, even those dice are fair game to hang. The revised Illinois windshield rule is one of hundreds of new laws taking effect with the new year in states across the U.S. While some may seem a bit pedestrian, others have real practical effects or touch on controversial issues such as restrictions on weapons and medical treatments for transgender people. Though the original Illinois windshield law was meant to improve roadway safety, it came to be seen by some as an excuse for pulling over drivers. The new law still prohibits objects that obstruct a driver’s view but forbids law enforcement officers from conducting stops or searches solely because of suspected violations. “With this new law, we are sending a powerful message that the state does not tolerate racial profiling or other forms of discrimination,” said Democratic state Sen. Christopher Belt, one of the bill’s sponsors. Another new Illinois law seeks to stifle a more modern form of distracted driving by prohibiting people from participating in video conferences or scanning social media while behind the wheel. GUNS AND PORNOGRAPHY Several states have new laws regulating guns and online activity. A Minnesota law will allow authorities to ask courts for “ extreme risk protection orders ” to temporarily take guns from people deemed to be an imminent threat to others or themselves. Minnesota will be at least the 20th state with such a red-flag law. Colorado will become one of a dozen states banning so-called ghost guns. The new law prohibits firearms that are assembled at home or 3D-printed without serial numbers, practices that have allowed owners to evade background checks. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to block an Illinois law from taking effect Monday that bans high-powered semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity magazines. But a federal judge recently blocked a California law that would have banned carrying concealed guns in many public places. Several state laws delve into acceptable online activities. A new Connecticut law requires online dating operators to adopt policies for handling harassment reports by or between users. A North Carolina law will require pornographic website operators to confirm viewers are at least 18 years old by using a commercially available database. The law lets parents sue companies if their children were allowed to access the pornography. Another new Illinois law will allow lawsuits from victims of deepfake pornography, in which videos or images are manipulated without their consent. LGBTQ+ ISSUES Over the past few years, there has been a major push by conservatives to restrict access to gender-affirming treatments for transgender minors. Bans are on the books in 22 states, including some where judges have paused enforcement as they consider challenges to the policies. New bans on access for minors to puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery, which is rare, are scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 in Idaho, Louisiana and West Virginia. The West Virginia law contains an exception: Teens could still access treatment with parental consent and a diagnosis of severe gender dysphoria from two doctors. While many Republican-led legislatures have imposed restrictions, many Democrat-dominated states have responded with transgender protections. A law taking effect Monday in Hawaii requires new marriage certificates to be issued to people who request to change how their sex is listed. The state also is replacing gender-specific terms in state law; “mother” is being replaced with “birthing parent” and “father” with “non-birthing parent.” In Colorado, new buildings wholly or partly owned by government entities will be required to have on every floor where there are public restrooms at least one that does not specify the gender of the users. The conservative push on LGBTQ+ policies also has come with efforts to keep certain books out of school or public libraries. An Indiana law taking effect makes it easier for parents and others to challenge books in school libraries. By contrast, a new Illinois law would block state funding for public libraries that ban or restrict books. TAXES AND WAGES The new year brings a variety of new laws on taxes and wages — perennial issues for state governments. More than 20 states will raise minimum wages for workers, further widening the gap between state requirements and the federal minimum, which has been static at $7.25 an hour since July 2009. In several states, the new minimum wage will more than double that rate. Maryland’s minimum wage will be set at $15 an hour. In New Jersey, it will be $15.13 an hour for most employees. In Connecticut, $15.69 per hour. In New York City, $16 an hour, though it will be $15 in most of the rest of the state. California’s statewide minimum wage also will rise to $16 per hour. And in Washington, the minimum rate will be $16.28. Residents in some states will gain money by paying less in taxes, continuing a three-year trend in which nearly every state has reduced, rebated or suspended some type of broad-based tax. In Kansas, the sales tax on groceries will drop from 4% to 2% in its next step toward eventual elimination, producing a savings of $208 annually for a family spending an average of $200 weekly on groceries. About 1 million tax filers are expected to benefit from Connecticut’s first income tax rate reduction since the mid-1990s. Lower-income workers and retirees also stand to benefit from expanded tax breaks. Missouri also will reduce its income tax rate while expanding tax exemptions for Social Security benefits and military training pay. Businesses will be able to claim tax credits for hiring interns or apprentices. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-troops-gaza_n_6592d942e4b0b01d3e403bcd,"Israel Pulling Thousands Of Troops From Gaza, Military Says","tia goldenberg, najib jobain , samy magdy",1/1/2024,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Thousands of Israeli soldiers are being shifted out of the Gaza Strip, the military said Monday, in the first significant drawdown of troops since the war began as forces continued to bear down on the main city in the southern half of the enclave. The troop movement could signal that fighting is being scaled back in some areas of Gaza, particularly in the northern half where the military has said it is close to assuming operational control. Israel has been under pressure from its chief ally, the United States, to begin to switch to lower-intensity fighting. Word of the drawdown came ahead of a visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the region and after the Biden administration bypassed Congress for the second time this month to approve an emergency weapons sale to Israel. But fierce fighting continued in other areas of Gaza, especially the southern city Khan Younis and central areas of the territory. Israel has pledged to charge ahead until its war aims have been achieved, including dismantling Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for 16 years. The military said in a statement Monday that five brigades, or several thousand troops, were being taken out of Gaza in the coming weeks for training and rest. In a briefing Sunday that first announced the troop withdrawal without specifying how many forces were leaving, army spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari did not say whether the decision meant Israel was launching a new phase of the war. “The objectives of the war require prolonged fighting, and we are preparing accordingly,” he said. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas’ military and governing capabilities in its war, which was sparked by the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people. Roughly 240 people were taken hostage. Israel responded with a blistering air, ground and sea offensive that has killed more than 21,900 people in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count. Israel says more than 8,000 militants have been killed, without providing evidence. It blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll, saying the militants embed within residential areas, including schools and hospitals. The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents, sending swells of people seeking shelter in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless bombed. Palestinians are left with a sense that nowhere is safe in the tiny enclave. BATTLES IN THE SOUTH In Khan Younis, where Israel is believed to have thousands of troops, residents reported airstrikes and shelling in the west and center of the city. The military and the militant group Islamic Jihad reported clashes in the area. The Palestinian Red Crescent said on X, formerly Twitter, that it transported several dead and injured following a strike late Sunday in the Beach Street in Khan Younis. It posted nighttime footage showing medics carrying casualties to ambulances. Combat was also reported in urban refugee camps in central Gaza, where Israel expanded its offensive last week. “It’s our routine: bombings, massacres and martyrs,” said Saeed Moustafa, a Palestinian from the Nuseirat camp. He said he could hear sporadic explosions and gunfire in Nuseirat and in the nearby Bureij and Maghazi camps. “Just as we speak, there is a big explosion not far from my home,” he said in a phone call Monday morning. Gaza’s Health Ministry said Monday that 156 people were killed in the past day. The Israeli military meanwhile said an airstrike killed Adel Mismah, a regional commander of Hamas’ elite Nukhba forces, in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Hamas fired a large barrage of rockets toward Israel, including at its commercial hub Tel Aviv, as the clock struck midnight on New Year’s Eve. ‘A DIFFERENT MODE OF OPERATION’ Israel has said the war will last for months. It has argued that it needs time to clear Gaza of militants’ weapons and infrastructure and to prevent Hamas from being able to stage more attacks. Israel has resisted international calls for a long-term cease-fire, saying doing so would amount to a victory for Hamas. Shlomo Brom, a retired brigadier general once in charge of strategic planning in the Israeli military, said the troop changes may be a result of the U.S. pressure. He said it indicated a shift in how Israel was conducting the war in some areas. “The war is not stopping,” said Brom. “It is the beginning of a different mode of operation.” Israelis still largely support the wars aims, even as the cost in soldiers’ lives is mounting. Over the weekend, the military said that of the soldiers killed since the ground operation began — as of Monday, 172 in total — 18 were killed by friendly fire while another 11 died by weapons or equipment malfunctions or accidents. ___ Jobain reported from Rafah, Gaza Strip and Magdy from Cairo. ___ Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/queen-margrethe-ii-abdicate_n_6592c86de4b0bf73e176ecc1,Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II To Step Down From Throne After 52 Years,david keyton,1/1/2024,"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — Denmark’s Queen Margrethe II announced Sunday that she plans to abdicate after 52 years and hand over the throne to her son, Crown Prince Frederik. The queen, who is Europe’s longest-reigning living monarch, announced during her New Year’s speech that she would step down on Jan. 14th, which is the anniversary of her own accession to the throne at age 31 following the death of her father, King Frederik IX. Margrethe, 83, said the back surgery she underwent in early 2023 led to “thoughts about the future” and when to pass on the responsibilities of the crown to her son. “I have decided that now is the right time,” she said in her speech. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen paid tribute to her in a statement, offering a “heartfelt thank you to Her Majesty the Queen for her lifelong dedication and tireless efforts for the Kingdom.” Margrethe is the “epitome of Denmark” Frederiksen’s statement read, and “throughout the years has put words and feelings into who we are as a people and as a nation.” The 6-foot-tall (1.82-meters-tall), chain-smoking Margrethe has been one of the most popular public figures in Denmark, where the monarch’s role is largely ceremonial. She often walked the streets of Copenhagen virtually unescorted and won the admiration of Danes for her warm manners and for her talents as a linguist and designer. A keen skier, she was a member of a Danish women’s air force unit as a princess, taking part in judo courses and endurance tests in the snow. Margrethe remained tough even as she grew older. In 2011, at age 70, she visited Danish troops in southern Afghanistan wearing a military jumpsuit. As monarch, she crisscrossed the country and regularly visited Greenland and the Faeroe Islands, the two semi-independent territories which are part of the Danish Realm, and was met everywhere by cheering crowds. Denmark has Europe’s oldest ruling monarchy, which traces its line back to the Viking king Gorm the Old, who died in 958. Although Magrethe is head of state, the Danish Constitution strictly ruled out her involvement in party politics. Yet the queen was clearly well-versed in law and knew the contents of the legislation she was called upon to sign. She received training in French and English from her earliest years, as well as Swedish from her mother. In addition to archaeology, she studied philosophy, political science and economics at universities in Copenhagen, Aarhus and Cambridge along with the London School of Economics and the Sorbonne in Paris. Ever since his birth on May 26, 1968, Frederik André Henrik Christian has been the heir to the Danish throne. He is the oldest son of Queen Margrethe and her late French-born husband, Prince Henrik, who died February 2018. Frederik, 55, has a younger brother, Prince Joachim. Since the age of 18, he has served as regent whenever his mother was outside the kingdom and carried out official duties, shaking hands with thousands and receiving foreign dignitaries. The queen’s announcement made up only a few sentences at the end of her wide-ranging New Year’s speech which reflected on the “turbulence and upheaval in the world” amid the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, and the climate crisis.

Nichols died in the hospital three days later. Demonstrations broke out across the country following Nichols’ death. The five officers, who were all Black, were swiftly fired from the police force; the elite tactical unit they belonged to, which specialized in street crime, was disbanded. One officer, Desmond Mills Jr., pleaded guilty to civil rights and conspiracy charges in November. The other four officers — Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Justin Smith — are still awaiting trial on murder charges and federal civil rights violations. Nearly a year after Nichols’ death, Memphis finds itself at a crossroads — and at the center of a national debate about what police reform can or should look like. The city has a new mayor, progressive district attorney and ordinance meant to put an end to the kinds of traffic stops that preceded Nichols’ death. But many question whether Memphis has made, or can make, real progress. In April, the Memphis City Council passed the Driver Equality Act — locals often call it the “Tyre Nichols ordinance” — which was meant to keep police from stopping drivers for minor traffic infractions. Officers initially claimed they had pulled over Nichols for reckless driving. Under it, Memphis police are also required to make public their data about pulling over civilians and what happens when they do. Memphis police published a database before the ordinance passed, but it doesn’t include all of the details required under the new mandate, such as the type of stop, type of vehicle and if some use of force was used during the encounter. But residents and activists say one ordinance alone can only change so much, especially if it’s not clearly enforced. “We still have the exact same training, the exact same culture — so why would you expect that anything would have fundamentally changed?” Hunter Demster, an activist with the police reform group Decarcerate Memphis, told HuffPost. “The city and the country were in such shocking dismay” after Nichols was killed, he added. “The fact that you cannot put any finger on any type of real change is deafening.” Demster alleges that he personally has been pulled over multiple times for a broken taillight since the passage of the Driving Equality Act. He said he has reported traffic stops in Memphis, including his own, to the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. And he’s concerned for the drivers from marginalized communities who have historically been targeted at traffic stops. Black drivers in Memphis were disproportionately stopped between 2017 and 2021, according to Shelby County court records obtained by Decarcerate Memphis, and were twice as likely to receive multiple citations on one ticket as white drivers. Chase Madkins, a Black father in Memphis, told HuffPost he doesn’t believe the new ordinance has changed policing in the city. Madkins said he was falsely arrested during a traffic stop in May. He said officers accused him of driving a stolen vehicle, which Madkins had recently purchased from an auction. Madkins alleges that an officer attempted to pull him out of the car, wrapping her arms around his neck and abdomen while he still had his seatbelt on. Madkins’ 2-year-old son was in the vehicle with him. “I told them, ‘You know what y’all was doing is illegal. The Tyre Nichols ordinance doesn’t allow for y’all to do these types of stops,’” he told HuffPost. “The officer said he would look into it, but he was trying to sweep it to the side.” “They literally detained me and were attempting to detain my son,” he said. “I was livid to even see them physically touching my child.” Madkins’ case was dismissed three months later because he hadn’t been driving a stolen vehicle. Part of the responsibility to enforce the Driving Equality Act will fall on newly elected Memphis Mayor Paul Young. Young has publicly supported the traffic-stop ordinance. Nevertheless, activists are concerned over the mayor-elect’s decision to keep Cerelyn Davis, who was already a controversial figure in the city before Nichols’ death, in her role as police chief. Davis previously led the “Red Dog” unit at the Atlanta Police Department, which had a reputation for terrorizing the city’s residents. She established a similar unit as leader of the Memphis Police Department: the SCORPION Unit, which stands for Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods and soon gained a similar reputation. All five officers who pulled over Nichols were members of the unit, and Davis disbanded it after his death. “These are all various different types of really aggressive police units that are hyperaggressive and over-police Black folks in urban neighborhoods,” Kareem Ali, a Memphis activist who works closely with Nichols’ family, told HuffPost. “With Tyre, it has opened up a conversation and policy change and enforced accountability in these types of police units that profile Black people while driving.” Residents are also skeptical of Young for selecting Tony Armstrong, a former Memphis Police director, to handle policing issues on his transition team. In July, Armstrong chastised Black Lives Matter supporters and activists for not being concerned about “Black-on-Black crime,” telling a local television station, “There should not be an asterisk (that) Black lives matter only when they are taken by law enforcement official.” Police oversight will also fall to the office of Steve Mulroy, who became the Shelby County district attorney in September 2022. Many Memphis residents were cautiously optimistic that his election would serve as a turning point for the city after the long tenure of Amy Weirich. The DA’s office immediately made some changes, including establishing the city’s first-ever unit tasked with handling wrongful convictions — something Weirich had long been against. Most recently, the unit reviewed the case of Gershun Freeman, a Black man who died in custody of the Shelby County Sheriff’s Department in 2022. Nine Shelby County deputies were charged in Freeman’s death in September, Mulroy’s office announced. “He has done tenfold better than past district attorneys, and I can’t imagine navigating that field with the state legislator coming after you, right-wing people coming after you, left-wing people coming after you,” Demster said. “I think in his first year in office he has a good start, but he has a long way to go.” “There is a lot of political chess going on. If he does not pursue certain cases, prosecute certain cases, the state can remove him,” he added, noting that Tennessee’s Republican governor has the right to remove a district attorney. Memphis had seen other high-profile shootings of citizens by police over the years, but the officers involved saw minimal repercussions. During her tenure as district attorney from 2011 to 2022, Weirich did not file charges against any officer in a case involving a civilian dying due to lethal force used by police. In 2015, then-Memphis Police Officer Connor Schilling fatally shot Darrius Stewart, a 19-year-old Black man, during a traffic stop. A grand jury did not indict Schilling; after Nichols’ death, Stewart’s family demanded that a new grand jury be convened. Mulroy’s office said in February that it would review information on Stewart’s case, but no movement has been made. In 2018, Martavious Banks, a Black man who was 24 at the time, was critically injured when then-Memphis Police Officer Jamarcus Jeames shot him as he ran toward his mother’s home during a traffic stop. Jeames violated policy by not having his body camera operating during the shooting, and he resigned. But none of these cases caught national attention as Nichols’ did. The Department of Justice opened a pattern and practice investigation into the Memphis Police Department in July, which is ongoing and may take up to a year to conduct. The DOJ is investigating whether Memphis police exhibited bias during traffic stops and participated in discriminatory policing, and could impose new guidance on officers if it determines they did. Tennessee state Rep. Justin Pearson (D) told HuffPost that Nichols shouldn’t have had to die for local reform to start taking place. “We have to remember, as we remember Tyre and so many lives lost to police brutality and racism, that was the same situation as the loss of Emmett Till. It shook the nation,” he said. “It should not be this way. It should not require the death of more Black people for our country to have consciousness. We do not have to wait for a tragedy to happen in order to do that work.” But Memphis residents — and people nationwide — are still waiting for police reform at the federal level. Nichols’ death prompted lawmakers to discuss once again trying to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The legislation is focused on bringing an end to tactics such as no-knock warrants and would make it easier for officers to be prosecuted for crimes against civilians; Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) said during Nichols’ funeral that the bill should include a “Tyre Nichols duty to intervene” amendment, which would require an officer or officers to intervene in a situation deemed as excessive force by one of their partners on a civilian. The original bill passed the House and has been sent to the Senate, but has not moved since March 2021. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-senate-2024_n_658c420ae4b014ec45a2f589,The Senate Is Turning More MAGA ― And It Could Boost A 2nd Trump Presidency,igor bobic,1/1/2024,"WASHINGTON ― A second Donald Trump presidency could be more unbound thanks to the changing face of the Republican Party, where traditional GOP stalwarts are gradually being replaced with hard-charging MAGA loyalists eager to defend and amplify his tactics. During his first term in office, Trump squared off with the likes of John McCain, Bob Corker, and Mitt Romney, establishment Republican senators who were often a thorn in his side. Now, many of the lawmakers most likely to push back against his worst instincts are either gone or heading for the exits, and a favorable electoral landscape for the GOP next year could install even more dutiful Trump allies in the upper chamber, who will be more eager to help his promised campaign of revenge than hinder it. It’s an open question as to how long 81-year-old Mitch McConnell ― the Senate GOP leader who Trump loathes ― will stick around after battling ailments this year. There is growing evidence that his once-dominant influence within the conference is waning amid numerous challenges from a wing of conservative and MAGA-allied senators who are eager to flex their muscles and forge closer ties to the de facto leader of their party. Trump’s campaign already has the backing of over 100 Republicans in Congress ― including 17 of 49 sitting GOP senators ― despite him facing historic criminal charges in four separate cases and his being impeached twice, including for trying to overturn his loss in the 2020 election. That number is only expected to grow as Trump continues his march toward the GOP presidential nomination. With just a few weeks until voters begin to cast their ballots, he dominates in polls of the 2024 race by a wide margin. The field has yet to consolidate behind an alternative; it may be too late by the time it even does. A resounding win in the Iowa caucuses could help seal the deal early for Trump, making the following primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina less relevant and setting him up for a glide path to victory. Trump’s allies believe it’s only a matter of time until the rest of the party gets behind the program ― and that this time, if he wins, his agenda, which could include massive camps to hold immigrants awaiting deportation, further corporate tax cuts and an economically disruptive 10% tariff, would be much easier to enact. “A lot of people are politically cautious, they don’t want to get involved in the primary while it’s going on, but my view is the primary is effectively over, and I’ve encouraged my colleagues to get on board,” said Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), a top MAGA supporter in Congress. “The more populist or America First side of [the GOP] will have more of an upper hand the second time around than it did in the first,” he predicted. “But it’s going to be a work in progress. These things take time.” Trump has been open about seeking vengeance in his second term, vowing to weaponize the government against his opponents if he returns to power. He has suggested that he would direct the Department of Justice to open investigations into President Joe Biden, his family and others. His allies have also described sweeping plans to expand the presidency and give Trump more power than ever if he is elected to the White House again. Many of those plans will hinge on support from his party in Congress. Some Republicans have expressed unease with the idea of restructuring federal agencies or the civil service, but there’s no telling what Trump could accomplish by pushing the bounds of executive power on his own, especially with a conservative 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court. The Senate will, at least, have a say in approving who leads Trump’s executive agencies if he wins again. An extreme choice for attorney general like Stephen Miller, who is known for his anti-immigration views, for example, would face difficulty with the current GOP leadership, but the math gets better for such a scenario with each year more Trump loyalists fill the Senate. In 2022, Trump gained several new allies in the Senate who are now enthusiastically backing his 2024 bid. Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) replaced Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who was one of a handful of Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, Vance replaced Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a former George W. Bush administration official, and Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) replaced veteran dealmaker Roy Blunt. Trump stands to gain even more allies next year, with West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice almost certain to replace Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and several other Trump acolytes vying for seats, including businessman Bernie Moreno in Ohio and veteran Tim Sheehy in Montana, both in states represented by vulnerable Senate Democrats facing reelection. Meanwhile, GOP resistance to Trump in the Senate is fleeting, and there are even signs of fatigue among some anti-Trump senators. If he wins the nomination, Trump will once again dominate questions to GOP lawmakers about his many rants, incendiary threats against opponents, or his racist comments. Some lawmakers have already taken to refusing to answer questions about the 2024 campaign entirely. Romney, Trump’s loudest critic who voted to convict him in both his impeachment trials, is retiring next year and the odds seem low that Utahns will elect someone as committed to battling the former president as he did. Even he seems a bit worn out from denouncing Trump all the time. “Donald Trump says so many absurd things,” Romney said recently in response to a Trump interview in which he said he would only be a dictator on “day one” of his presidency. “I sort of laugh at what he’s saying,” he added. “The other day, he was saying, ‘We’re going to get rid of Obamacare.’ It’s like, really, what have you got? You said that when you were president, did you ever introduce a plan to replace Obamacare? No. So at some point, you realize you don’t have to take him literally, and you don’t have to take him seriously either.” Asked about Trump’s much-criticized comments that migrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country, Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.) replied sarcastically: “Looks like I’m looking forward to another year of answering these questions.” Earlier this year, the Indiana Republican vowed not to support Trump in the 2024 GOP race, saying that conservatives would not be well served “by electing someone whose core competency seems to be owning someone on Twitter.” Now he, too, seems to be dreading the odds that Trump wins the nomination again. “Horse race? Is it a horse race? No,” Young said earlier this month when a reporter tried to ask him about another Trump 2024 campaign-related question. Of course, Republicans could have avoided this scenario had more of them voted to convict Trump after Jan. 6, 2021, which would have disqualified him from holding future elected office. But a second Trump presidency, if it comes to pass, wouldn’t be entirely free of GOP detractors. Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska aren’t expected to leave Congress any time soon, and they’ve both shown a willingness to criticize the former president and join Democrats in voting against his priorities in Congress. Murkowski, for example, recently condemned Trump for making “hateful” comments about immigrants, saying that it is his rhetoric that is “poisoning our country.” The Alaska Republican won reelection to another six-year term last year and is more insulated from political pressure than most of her colleagues. Which Republican eventually succeeds McConnell in the Senate as leader could also help determine the fate of a possible second Trump presidency. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the minority whip and No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is considered a possible successor in the mold of McConnell. Thune backed Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) in the 2024 race and has made positive comments about former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Another possible successor, Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), on the other hand, has backed Trump and is more aligned with the MAGA wing of the party. It’s not hard to tell which way the wind is blowing, however. The McConnell-backed freshman Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama, a rising star at age 41 who had been mentioned as a possible face of the GOP post-Trump, recently endorsed the former president’s 2024 bid. In an op-ed, Britt framed the choice as between Trump and Biden, even though there are several other (and younger) choices in the GOP race. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), who once called Flordia Gov. Ron DeSantis the “leader” of the Republican Party, acknowledged that the GOP is “in transition” right now. “I do think that what I would call the ‘neocon’ part of the Republican Party is all but gone, and so there is more pragmatic thought on matters that involve not only the Department of Defense but the U.S. role in foreign conflicts,” Lummis said. “I do think in that regard President Trump has influenced some of the thinking. It’s healthy.” And Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), another Trump-skeptical Republican who had endorsed Scott’s failed 2024 bid, pointed out that the Republican base doesn’t see an alternative to Trump right now, even with other GOP candidates in the race.

And then it hit Los Angeles and perhaps Austin around 2015. You’d be walking down the street and get a whiff of something unique and intoxicating that was spicy and comforting all at once. It was strong and it lingered, so even if you wanted to ask the delicious stranger which scent they were wearing, they’d be long gone. It started as the aromatic emblem of American hipster culture, but Le Labo Santal 33 now has a chokehold on people of ages, genders and socioeconomic brackets (I’d keep buying the $7 sample every week, like some kind of fragrance fiend, until I could afford a small bottle). “It’s a gender-bending scent that defies traditional scent categories, with creamy sandalwood and cedarwood mingling with smoky papyrus and leathery notes,” said Bernadette Lim, a perfumer and fragrance specialist I tapped to better understand what continues to make people so rabid for Santal 33. The fact that it transcends what we’ve been conditioned to believe smells either “girly” or “masculine” is a huge selling point. The initial challenge of Santal 33, Lim argues, is part of its allure. “This complexity sparks curiosity, inviting a deeper exploration that makes the journey of appreciation more rewarding,” she said. “It develops and evolves on the skin, revealing new facets like the green, floral-woody combo.” Its dynamic nature gives the scent new life with every wear. Lim made me realize that I love bold scents that embrace the notes and traits that Santal 33 does. I truly believe the fragrance increased our collective thirst for sandalwood, leather, and a heavier scent that lustily lingers.

The New Year’s Day quake, whose preliminary magnitude was respectively measured at 7.5 by the U.S. Geological Survey and at 7.6 by Japanese agencies, was followed by multiple powerful aftershocks. At least three deaths were reported by CNN, Financial Times and NBC. HuffPost did not independently confirm those reports. The Japan Meteorological Agency initially issued a “major tsunami warning” for portions of Ishikawa prefecture, where the quake was centered, saying waves could reach roughly 16 feet. That warning was later downgraded, saying waves could potentially reach 10 feet. Early Tuesday morning, the agency downgraded the alert again, to a tsunami advisory, but still advised residents that deadly waves could occur, according to the Associated Press. The agency also advised residents to watch for additional potential quakes over the next few days. On Monday, TV broadcasts urged “immediate” evacuation, with residents told to seek higher ground or move to the top floors of taller buildings. Authorities issued warnings for Niigata, Toyama, Yamagata, Fukui and Hyogo prefectures. Much of the rest of the coast along the Sea of Japan was placed under a tsunami advisory, where smaller waves may be expected. Multiple rail lines ― including Shinkansen routes ― have been suspended, and some highways near the quake’s epicenter have been closed, according to NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster. There are also reports of fires, building collapses and landslides. No abnormalities have been detected at the nation’s nuclear power plants, the government said. North Korea and South Korea issued tsunami warnings to residents after the quake in Japan. South Korea’s meteorological agency reported a small tsunami on the country’s eastern coast Monday morning, and said that there was the potential for larger waves to come. Officials of Ishikawa Prefecture's Suzu City say they have confirmed several houses and power poles have collapsed following a magnitude 7.4 quake Monday afternoon. https://t.co/IhqLpATlRE One of Japan’s worst natural disasters came in 2011, when a magnitude 9.0 quake triggered a tsunami, which in turn led to a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. More than 18,000 people were killed in that disaster. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

On Tuesday, the actor shared an image of herself on Instagram accompanied by a lengthy caption discussing the ups and downs of her 2023, writing, “What a year.” “This past year humbled me, broke me, built me, betrayed me, freed me, and showed me what it means to really be alive,” Bush said. “No more playing small. No more turning my back on myself. No more settling for what falls short because ‘who am I to ask for more?’ This year put me back in my body.” She said that 2023 taught her to listen to herself and to “not care about optics and instead invest in honesty,” and how that led her to leave some relationships behind. “It took me out of relationship with many of you but put me back into relationship with myself,” she said. In August, People reported that Bush had filed for divorce from Grant Hughes after a little over a year of marriage. She has since been rumored to be dating retired U.S. soccer star Ashlyn Harris, though they have not publicly confirmed their romance. Toward the end of the Instagram post, Bush also reflected on dealing with an illness. “This year I slowed down; first because illness forced me to. Second because recovery required more stillness,” she said. “In that way both sickness and healing are a gift. For those gifts I am so grateful.” Bush is presumably referencing the illness she had while working on a West End production of “2:22 A Ghost Story” in London. In July, she revealed in an Instagram post that she left the play after contracting a virus. “After weeks of being intermittently pulled off stage & visiting multiple doctors, specialists, & an all nighter in the ER, I’ve been advised by my medical team in London & America to stop performing in order to get this under control & to do so in the country where I reside under the care of my own doctors,” she wrote in the post’s caption.

Family members identified Keith “KJ” Frierson on GoFundMe as the 10-year-old victim of a fatal shooting on Saturday, after a boy of the same age allegedly stole his father’s gun. The boy who authorities say shot Keith has been arrested and charged with murder, while his father, 53-year-old Arkete Davis, is facing multiple charges including child endangerment. According to a release from the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office, deputies responded to a report of a shooting outside Keith’s family home in Foothill Farms, where they found him unresponsive and bleeding from his head and neck. Keith’s godmother, Nina Trepagnier, told CBS affiliate KOVR-TV that Keith was outside riding a bike he’d gotten as a Christmas gift. “He was helping [his mother] bring in groceries and he had just gotten his bike for Christmas, and he wanted to go out there to ride his bike,” Trepagnier told the outlet. “He was outside for all of 15 or 20 minutes just literally riding his bike right here with another little kid.” According to the statement from the sheriff’s office, responding deputies began performing life-saving efforts on Keith until fire department personnel arrived to the scene. Keith was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead, authorities said. In a post on social media, Sacramento County Sheriff Jim Cooper said the shooting occurred in front of a 6-year-old boy. Trepagnier also indicated that Keith’s older brother was present at the scene. “His brother had to see his little brother laying on the ground, covered in blood,” Trepagnier told KOVR-TV. Witnesses told deputies that the child who allegedly shot Keith ran to a nearby apartment. Law enforcement detained everyone inside, including Arkete Davis and his two children, authorities said. According to the sheriff’s office, earlier that day Davis’ 10-year-old son had gone to get cigarettes for his father from the car, where he found a gun. The 10-year-old allegedly took the gun from the car, then “bragged” about it before shooting Keith outside the apartment’s parking lot. Detectives later found the gun in a nearby trash can and accused Davis of trying to “dispose of it.” According to deputies, Davis was legally prohibited from owning or possessing a firearm due to a felony. The gun the 10-year-old allegedly found in Davis’ car was reported stolen in 2017. “We cannot let this boy’s murder be a one-day news story and forgotten about by tomorrow morning,” Cooper said. In a GoFundMe launched to offset Keith’s funeral costs, Trepagnier said Keith’s mother and brother decided to leave their home following the shooting. The next four years will change America forever.

Bob Menendez Faces New Allegations In Criminal Case,larry neumeister,1/2/2024,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez introduced a member of the Qatari royal family and principal in a company with ties to the government of Qatar to a New Jersey businessman before the company invested millions of dollars in the businessman’s real estate project, a rewritten indictment alleged Tuesday. The latest version of the indictment against the Democrat in Manhattan federal court did not identify the member of the Qatari royal family, but it said the individual was a principal of the Qatari Investment Co. The indictment said the Qatari investor then considered and negotiated a multimillion-dollar investment in the real estate project planned by Fred Daibes, one of three businessmen charged in the indictment along with the senator and his wife. All of them have pleaded not guilty. No new charges were added to the latest version of an indictment that already charged Menendez in a bribery conspiracy that allegedly enriched the senator and his wife with cash, gold bars and a luxury car. The allegations involving Qatar occurred from 2021 through 2023, the indictment said. According to the indictment, Menendez accepted cash and gold bars in exchange for seeking to induce the Qatari Investment Co. to invest with Daibes, including by taking actions favorable to the government of Qatar. The indictment said that while the Qatari Investment Co. was considering its investment in the real estate development owned by Daibes, Menendez made multiple public statements supporting the government of Qatar and then provided them to Daibes so he could share them with the Qatari investor and a Qatari government official.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-defend-itself-genocide-claims-icj-hague-gaza-south-africa_n_65946b28e4b0f27b6e357cd1,Israel Prepares To Defend Itself Against Genocide Claims In First Hearing At The Hague,sanjana karanth,1/2/2024,"Israeli officials have said that the country will defend itself in next week’s hearing at the International Court of Justice, days after South Africa called for proceedings based on its accusation that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The move is rare considering Israel often denounces the United Nations’ top court as biased against it and rarely cooperates in international cases involving Israel. It appears to be a signal that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is concerned that the charges could taint its reputation among other nations. On Friday, South Africa launched the case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague alleging that Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip is “genocidal in character” because the mass death, destruction, displacement and starvation of Palestinians without regard to the lives of women, children, journalists and humanitarian workers meets the qualifications of genocide under international law. South Africa can bring the case under the Genocide Convention because both it and Israel are signatories. The case itself could take years. However, South Africa has also asked the court to issue an interim order for Israel to immediately cease military operations it alleges are meant “to destroy Palestinians in Gaza.” At a Tuesday news conference, Netanyahu spokesperson Eylon Levy promised that Israel would contest South Africa’s accusation, calling the claim of genocide antisemitic and “blood libel.” The idea of blood libel, also brought up Friday by Israeli Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lior Haiat, is an antisemitic trope that falsely claims Jews ritually sacrifice Christian children. It is unrelated to the government of Israel being criticized for killing Palestinian civilians. Hamas is “hell-bent on the genocide of the Jews and sacrificing its own civilians for that cause,” Levy added. Israel “emphatically condemns South Africa’s decision to play advocate for the devil and to make itself criminally complicit with the perpetrators of the Oct. 7 massacre.” Hamas, a Palestinian militant group, launched an attack on Oct. 7 that led to the deaths of an estimated 1,200 Israelis and the kidnappings of about 240 people. Since then, Israeli forces have killed at least 22,100 Palestinians in Gaza, about 9,100 of whom are children, according to a report Tuesday from the Gaza Media Office. At least 57,000 Gazans have been wounded and at least 7,000 are missing. The collapse of the Palestinian territory’s health system has prevented the Gaza Health Ministry from being able to provide regular casualty updates since Nov. 10, according to Al Jazeera. Israel has also killed at least 324 Palestinians and injured more than 3,800 in the occupied West Bank, where Hamas is not stationed, according to the territory’s Palestinian Ministry of Health. Israel accuses South Africa of being “complicit with Hamas’ campaign of Genocide against our people”- saying “We assure South Africa's leaders, history will judge you”.Govt spox added that Israel will appear at ICJ where SA has filed a case accusing Israel of genocidal acts. pic.twitter.com/WCZrgBsMCc South Africa’s ruling African National Congress became aligned with the Palestine Liberation Organization under Nelson Mandela’s leadership. Mandela was a vocal supporter of the PLO and its leader Yasser Arafat, saying in 1990 that South Africa identified with Palestinians “because, just like ourselves, they are fighting for the right of self-determination.” Many present-day South Africans see their fight against colonialism and apartheid in Palestinians’ struggles, with President Cyril Ramaphosa repeatedly condemning Israel’s increased violence against Palestinians since Oct. 7. “Genocide is a violation, the proof of which in court requires two elements,” Eliav Lieblich, an international law professor at Tel Aviv University, told Haaretz. “First, you have to show intention of annihilation, and second ― certain actions in the field that promote this intention.” “According to South Africa, the intention is proven by statements of senior Israeli figures and a public atmosphere of erasing or flattening Gaza, and the widespread harm to civilians and the hunger in Gaza show the factual element of the deed.” According to Haaretz, a senior legal expert familiar with the matter recently warned Israeli military leaders, including Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi, that there is a real risk of the International Court of Justice issuing an injunction demanding a cease-fire – stressing that Israel is bound by the court’s rulings, even if it considers the ICJ to be unfair. The ICJ is incredibly influential in shaping international law and public perception. This means the court’s recognition of South Africa’s genocide accusation could shape the public perception that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza and lead to diplomatic chaos. Israeli officials told Axios and Haaretz that Netanyahu wants controversial U.S. lawyer Alan Dershowitz to represent Israel at the hearing. Dershowitz, a vocal supporter of Israel, declined to comment, according to Axios. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-appeals-maine-ruling-barring-him-from-the-ballot_n_659485d7e4b0f27b6e359ec8,Donald Trump Appeals Maine Ruling Barring Him From The Ballot,nicholas riccardi,1/2/2024,"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday appealed a ruling by Maine’s Democratic secretary of state barring him from the ballot over his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He was expected to also ask the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on his eligibility to return to the presidency in a related Colorado case. The Republican candidate appealed the Maine decision by Shenna Bellows, who became the first secretary of state in history to bar someone from running for the presidency under the rarely used Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. That provision prohibits those who “engaged in insurrection” from holding office. The appeal now goes to Maine’s Superior Court. Trump was also expected to appeal a similar ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. The nation’s highest court has never issued a decision on Section 3, and the Colorado court’s 4-3 ruling that it applied to Trump was the first time in history the provision was used to bar a presidential contender from the ballot. Trump’s critics have filed dozens of lawsuits seeking to disqualify him from the ballot in multiple states. None succeeded until a slim majority of Colorado’s seven justices — all of whom were appointed by Democratic governors — ruled against Trump. Critics warned that it was an overreach and that the court could not simply declare that the Jan. 6 attack was an “insurrection” without a more established judicial process. A week after Colorado’s ruling, Bellows issued her own. Critics warned it was even more perilous because it could pave the way for partisan election officials to simply disqualify candidates they oppose. Bellows, a former head of Maine’s branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, has previously criticized Trump and his behavior on Jan. 6. Bellows said her own views had nothing to do with her ruling, which sought to apply the law. She acknowledged the Supreme Court would probably have the final say after the Colorado case but said she still had a responsibility to act. She was the first top election official to do so. Many others, Democrats and Republicans had told activists urging them to strike Trump from the ballot that they did not have that power. Section 3 is novel legal territory in the past century, barely used since the years after the Civil War, when it kept defeated Confederates from returning to their former government positions. The two-sentence clause says that anyone who swore an oath to “support” the Constitution and then engaged in insurrection cannot hold office unless a two-thirds vote of Congress allows it. Congress granted amnesty to most former Confederates in 1872, and Section 3 fell into disuse. Legal scholars believe its only application in the 20th century was being cited by Congress in 1919 to block the seating of a socialist who opposed U.S. involvement in World War I and was elected to the House of Representatives. But it returned to use after Jan. 6, 2021. In 2022, a judge used it to remove a rural New Mexico county commissioner from office after he was convicted of a misdemeanor for entering the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Liberal groups sued to block Republican Reps. Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene from running for reelection because of their roles on that day. Cawthorn’s case became moot when he lost his primary in 2022, and a judge ruled to keep Greene on the ballot. Some conservatives warn that, if Trump is removed, political groups will routinely use Section 3 against opponents in unexpected ways. They have suggested it could be used to remove Vice President Kamala Harris, for example, because she raised bail money for people arrested after George Floyd’s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police in 2020. Trump and his allies have attacked the cases against him as “anti-democratic” and sought to tie them to President Joe Biden because the Colorado case and some others are funded by liberal groups who share prominent donors with the Democratic president. But Biden’s administration has noted that the president has no role in the litigation. The next four years will change America forever.

They joined the Colorado Republican Party in petitioning the high court to review the case, which rests on a clause of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment barring insurrectionists from office. In December, Colorado’s state Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that Trump’s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election — an effort that included goading his supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — meant that he had violated that Reconstruction-era clause. Trump is widely expected to fight Colorado’s ruling. He appealed a similar order keeping him from primary ballots in the state of Maine on Tuesday. Both decisions sparked scorn from the former president on social media. “I’m not an Insurrectionist (‘PEACEFULLY & PATRIOTICALLY’),” Trump wrote last month on his Truth Social platform, placing the label instead on his successor in the White House. “Crooked Joe Biden is!!!” The Colorado voters’ petition outlines two main questions for the high court: whether the president is among those elected officials subject to the 14th Amendment’s ban on insurrectionists, and whether action from Congress is required.

The voters urged the court to set aside a third question presented by the Colorado GOP: whether the First Amendment’s free speech protections might apply to the situation, giving Trump a right to appear on the ballot regardless of whether he is actually eligible.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/diversity-hollywood-directors-2023_n_65946411e4b0912833ae1433,Directing In Hollywood Is Still Mostly A Mojo Dojo Casa House,marina fang,1/2/2024,"Greta Gerwig’s smash hit “Barbie” dominated headlines in 2023, making over $1 billion at the box office and becoming one of the year’s biggest cultural phenomena. But Gerwig’s successful trajectory from directing indie films to 2023’s highest-grossing movie — and the highest-grossing film directed by any woman in history — is still the exception to the norm. The club of directors at the helm of Hollywood’s biggest movies remains primarily a Mojo Dojo Casa House, the masculine abode of Ken (Ryan Gosling) in her film. Women, people of color, and especially women of color remain woefully underrepresented in the director’s chair on major theatrical releases. It’s a persistent problem each year, and 2023 was unfortunately no different, according to the latest research from the University of Southern California’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which has gathered data on representation and inclusion in Hollywood dating back to 2007. Based on the initiative’s data, it has become increasingly apparent that recent pledges from Hollywood gatekeepers to hire more directors from underrepresented communities have been “performative acts by the entertainment industry and not real steps towards fostering change,” the group, founded by USC professor Stacy Smith, wrote in its latest report, whose findings were released Tuesday. Year after year, the initiative has found minimal changes in the levels of women and people of color directing major movies. For instance, over the past 17 years, just 19 women of color have directed at least one of the top 100 highest-grossing films at the box office annually (from a total of 1,700 films between 2007 and 2023), according to the group’s data. Four of them were in 2023: Adele Lim (“Joy Ride”), Celine Song (“Past Lives”), Fawn Veerasunthorn (“Wish”) and Nia DaCosta (“The Marvels”), who was the only Black woman to direct a major box-office film last year. These four women of color accounted for just 3.4% of the directors behind the 100 top-grossing films of 2023. That figure was similarly low in 2022, when 2.7% of the directors on the highest-grossing films were women of color. Women overall have also made few, if any, gains in directing in recent years. Just 12.1% of the directors of 2023’s top 100 films at the box office were women — barely a difference from 2022, when the figure was 9%, according to the report. “The percentage has not changed notably since 2018, when 4.5% of directors were women,” the report said. On average across all 17 years of the group’s data, only 6% of directors on major films were women. “These figures are not merely data points on a chart,” Smith said in a statement. “They represent real, talented women working to have sustainable careers in an industry that will not hire them into jobs they are qualified to hold solely because of their identity.” Directors of color have seen a similar lack of progress. Across the 100 top-grossing films of 2023, a total of 26 directors (22.4%) were people of color. When broken down by race and ethnicity, 14 were Asian (53.8%), eight were Black (30.8%), two were Hispanic/Latino (7.7%) and two were multiracial or multiethnic (7.7%). Once again, there was no notable improvement from 2022, when the figure was 20.7%. Both years marked a decrease from the 27.3% of directors of color in 2021. According to the group’s data, there has been no significant shift for such directors since 2016, when 13.3% of the filmmakers behind the year’s major movies were people of color. When breaking down 2023’s top films by studio and distributor, the group found that much of the work in hiring directors of color has come from smaller, independent distributors like A24, Crunchyroll, Angel Studios and United Artists Releasing, rather than from the major Hollywood studios. Year after year, the group’s findings, along with similar studies elsewhere, have continually identified a pipeline problem. Compared with their white male counterparts, most women and people of color don’t get the chance to move up the ladder, from directing independent films to episodes of major television shows, streaming movies and, eventually, big box-office hits. In other words, the larger the project, the more likely a white man gets hired to direct it. To show a snapshot of the issue, researchers compared three different levels of directing. For instance, on average, nearly 55% of directors competing in the most recent four years of the Sundance Film Festival’s U.S. Dramatic Film category — which comprises independent movies — were women, and 52% were people of color. For episodic television, 38% of directors during the 2020-2021 TV season were women, and 34.5% were people of color, according to data from the Directors Guild of America. And among Netflix’s original feature films in 2021, 26.9% of directors were women, while 22.4% were people of color. Given the drop-offs at each level, it’s no wonder that the percentages of women and people of color directing at Hollywood’s top echelons are so low.

These numbers clearly demonstrate that industry leaders and major executives with the power to greenlight movies haven’t followed through on their repeated promises to hire and support a more diverse range of directors, according to the group. “This report offers a contrast to those who might celebrate the dawning of change in Hollywood after a year in which ‘Barbie’ topped the box office. One film or one director are simply not enough to create the sea change that is still needed behind the camera,” researchers wrote in the report. “Until studios, executives, and producers alter the way they make decisions about who is qualified and available to work as a director on top-grossing films, there is little reason to believe that optimism is warranted.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

My mother & father in law left in there [Rolls-Royce].” David was referencing an exchange between him and Victoria that was seen in his Netflix docuseries, “Beckham,” in October. ""Actually, no, that's not the truth, Victoria."" pic.twitter.com/kiwKlAN5nX Victoria was filmed in one scene discussing the time she first met her husband, and how she was attracted to the fact that he appeared to be close with his family. “Both of our parents work really hard, we’re very working, working class,” she said, before David interrupted her from off screen: “Be honest.” Victoria protested that she was being honest, but David wasn’t having it. He repeatedly asked her to name the make of the car that her dad drove her to school in. “OK, in the ’80s my dad had a Rolls-Royce,” Victoria finally conceded.

The 29-year-old actor and stunt performer sustained serious injuries after a driver crashed into an outdoor dining shed at the Chirp restaurant in Manhattan at around 1:30 a.m. Monday, her representative told People in a statement. Bernans suffered multiple broken bones in the incident and is currently in stable condition. She was among eight pedestrians injured. Her son, whom she recently gave birth to, was not with her at the time of the crash. According to the NYPD via NBC New York, the accident took place during a foot chase after officers were informed about a physical assault involving a male driver, 44, and a female passenger, 34, in his black Mercedes. The driver, whose name has yet to be released, was hospitalized in critical condition and is in police custody, according to CBS News. On Monday, Bernans’ mom, Patricia Lee, opened up about the terrifying experience on Instagram, saying that her daughter is in “so much pain” and “can’t answer calls at this time.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

On Sunday night, the journalist co-hosted CNN’s “New Year’s Eve Live” alongside Andy Cohen. During their broadcast, Cohen played a clip from his Bravo talk show, “Watch What Happens Live,” for Cooper. In the clip that aired earlier this month, rapper Nicki Minaj shared her plans for 2024. “My new year’s resolution is to keep my foot on the bitches’ necks!” Minaj said. After the clip was played Sunday, Cooper appeared to be completely baffled by Minaj’s remark. “Wow, what did she say?” he asked Cohen. “Keep my foot on these bitches’ necks!” Cohen repeated, clearly amused. “Wow. Who is she referring to?” Cooper asked, puzzled, to which, Cohen hilariously replied: “Bitches!” (To those who are as bewildered as Cooper, the “Barbie World” rapper meant she wants to remain dominant over her supposed opponents.) Social media users — who instantly understood Minaj’s promise to keep her haters at bay — got a kick out of Cooper’s befuddlement and Cohen’s drunken silliness. Its him confirming its ""bitches"" for me....😭😭😭😭 🥴🥴 lmfaooo Anderson w his cute ass 😂😂😂😂😂 who is she referring too ???? Bless his heart But perhaps one TikTok user put it best. “Anderson Cooper’s journalism side couldn’t help itself! He needed clarity & answers!!” they joked.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/online-dating-app-dateability-disability_n_65943760e4b0912833adfcf3,"Online Dating Sucks. This App, Designed For People With Disabilities, Makes It Suck Less",harshada rajani,1/2/2024,"After graduating college, Jacqueline Child — like so many other busy 20-something Americans trying to find a partner or a hookup — dived into the tumultuous world of dating apps. In 2019, a few weeks after she started actively trying to meet someone, she matched with a guy on Bumble. When they decided to meet in person, he suggested they go for a walk. Jacqueline responded by telling him that she was recovering from a surgery, so a picnic would be better. When he inquired about the surgery, Jacqueline told him she had a connective tissue disorder. He then responded, “Well… I hope you’re not planning on having children because that would be really selfish. That’s how genetics work.” This was just one of the dozens of offensive messages Jacqueline, a Colorado native, had to stomach as she tried to navigate the toxic world of dating culture as a woman with a disability or chronic illness. And that particular message is not all that uncommon — as a young stroke survivor, I’ve even been told that online by strangers before, too. Disabled people attempting to enter their online dating era have to deal with much more than the ignorant comments. There are personal safety concerns (especially for the physically disabled) and the difficulty of navigating online dating platforms. And there’s so much more pressure involved in what most people consider the fun part: meeting in person in hopes that the online flirtation translates to real life. I don’t know anyone, disabled or not, who actually enjoys dating apps. For most of us, they’re merely a means to an end. Having to market oneself online with a perfectly curated profile, dealing with frequent rejections and investing hours trying to engage with strangers you may never meet — it’s exhausting. Those of us who are disabled or have a chronic illness also have to deal with the anxiety that comes along with not knowing how a match will respond to it. How do I tell them? When do I tell them? Will they immediately ghost or reject me? The anxiety around the disclosure of a disability can be paralyzing in itself. After being called a “burden” one too many times, Jacqueline started to feel that she might be unworthy of a romantic relationship. One day in 2021, she said to her older sister, Alexa, that she wished there was a legitimate and free dating app specifically designed for disabled and chronically ill people. Alexa, who had seen Jacqueline struggle with hurtful remarks for years, replied, “Let’s make it ourselves.” In October 2022, the sisters launched a free app called Dateability in North America. As of the end of 2023, they have 11,000 members, ranging from wheelchair users to people who are immunocompromised to even nondisabled allies. “We want to be an inclusive place where people feel safe and feel like they matter,” Jacqueline said. The decision to welcome nondisabled allies on their app stemmed from not wanting to send the important and underrated message that disabled people should only date other disabled people. “[Disabled people] are free to love whoever they want and they deserve that,” Alexa said. “But this is a good way to filter out people who would discriminate against disability.” Personally, I wholeheartedly align with the sisters’ decision to include nondisabled people on this platform, because I’m very open to being with a partner who can do the things I physically can’t. Still, I’ve always been hesitant about dating apps because I’m a hopeless romantic with a nostalgic penchant for meet-cutes and serendipitous encounters. I have no real idea what I’m looking for, or, to put it plainly, if anyone is looking for someone like me. Still, I had to check this app out, if nothing else, for the sake of good journalism. So, I recently downloaded the app, created a profile, added a few photos and started swiping away. The app lacked the sleek, streamlined aesthetic of some of the mainstream apps, but it was pretty user-friendly, efficient and accessible on more devices than just my cell phone. As I was swiping, however, I saw a few of the same faces pop up again. Since Dateability is relatively new and caters to a minority demographic (albeit the largest minority demographic), the pool of potential matches that met my age and location preferences was understandably limited. And speaking of minorities, there wasn’t much racial diversity either, but I wasn’t surprised by this: The stigma against disability in immigrant communities (among other communities of color) is such a deterrent from being public about a disability. But there was one seemingly innocuous element that made this app a bona fide game changer. As I filled out the routine questions about age, height and location, I came across a question titled, “Dateability Deets.” It then gave a pretty extensive list of options to broadly describe my disability, chronic illness or lack thereof. There was actually a box with an accurate descriptor for me to select: ambulatory wheelchair user. The phrase appeared at the bottom of my profile along with all of my other personal details. It was so freeing, knowing that whoever I match with will already know about this part of my identity — just like my listed political affiliation or religion — and be OK with it. “With the ‘Dateability Deets’ question, no awkward disclosure discussion is needed,” Alexa said. By making a disability or chronic illness no longer something that needs to be disclosed, it helps eradicate some of the stigma that comes along with it. In this space, our disabilities become an identity marker versus something to be ashamed of. “If we can be open and normalize disability, not only will our community benefit from it because we will see ourselves as more worthy, but also the people outside our community will see us that way too,” Jacqueline said.

Having every type of single person on this app will help ensure that we, as a community, aren’t willfully partitioning ourselves off on the fringes of society (the disability-unfriendly world does that enough for us anyway).

In a statement shared to his Instagram account Monday, the “Beverly Hills, 90210” actor said he and his 12-year-old daughter, Mia, were unhurt in the headline-making brawl, which was partially documented in a video published by TMZ. “Yesterday, I experienced an alarming incident involving a group of individuals on mini bikes,” he wrote. “While stuck in traffic, my car was approached aggressively by one of these riders leading to an unsettling confrontation. In an attempt to assess any damage I exited my car. This action, unfortunately, escalated into a physical altercation, which I navigated to protect myself.” Though Ziering wasn’t injured, the incident has left him “deeply concerned about the growing boldness of such groups who disrupt public safety and peace.” “This situation highlights a larger issue of hooliganism on our streets and the need for effective law enforcement responses to such behavior,” he said in his statement. “As a citizen and a parent, I find it unacceptable that groups can freely engage in this kind of behavior, causing fear and chaos, while the response from authorities seems insufficient.” He went on to urge law enforcement “to take decisive action against such lawlessness and provide the necessary resources to prevent future occurrences.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

A second video, taken immediately after the incident and also published by TMZ, shows Ziering returning to his car and comforting his daughter. On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed that Ziering was listed as a victim on a battery report taken after the Sunday incident.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/claudine-gay-resigns-harvard-crimson_n_659451cbe4b0bf73e1777f1c,Harvard President Claudine Gay Announces She Will Resign,matt shuham,1/2/2024,"Harvard University President Claudine Gay resigned Tuesday, announcing the news in a letter to the university community. The Crimson, a student-run paper at the university, first reported the news. The resignation follows weeks of pressure after congressional testimony in which Gay appeared to prevaricate on whether calls for the genocide of Jewish students ― or simply using phrases like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” ― would violate Harvard’s rules. More recently, Gay was caught up in a wave of plagiarism allegations, including new allegations published Monday in The Washington Free Beacon. In her statement to the university community, Gay, Harvard’s first Black president, wrote that “it has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigor ― two bedrock values that are fundamental to who I am ― and frightening to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fueled by racial animus.” Gay’s tenure was the shortest of any Harvard president, having begun just last summer, The Crimson noted. Gay’s resignation follows that of Liz Magill, the University of Pennsylvania’s president, last month, shortly after a congressional hearing on campus antisemitism. In that hearing, when pressed by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Gay, Magill and Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth all said that the bounds of acceptable and unacceptable speech regarding Israel, Palestine and the ongoing war in Gaza would depend on context. Their remarks led to outrage from Stefanik, as well as many alumni and donors to the schools, who consider some pro-Palestinian phrases to be tantamount to calls for violence. The same universities have also faced criticism from pro-Palestinian students who say administrators have failed to stand up for their free speech rights in the face of harassment and censorship. In November, Gay condemned the phrase “From the river to the sea,” writing that it bore “specific historical meanings that to a great many people imply the eradication of Jews from Israel and engender both pain and existential fears within our Jewish community.” Notably, an antisemitism advisory group established by Gay did not include several scholars of antisemitism at Harvard whose views, Jewish Currents editor-at-large Peter Beinart observed, “complicate the conflation of antisemitism and anti-Zionism.” The initial attacks against Gay after her congressional testimony were met with opposition from some Harvard faculty and students. More than 700 faculty members urged the Harvard Corporation, the school’s governing board, to resist calls for Gay’s ouster, signing a letter calling on the body to “defend the independence of the university and to resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard’s commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay.” But the accusations of plagiarism in Gay’s academic work proved difficult to ignore. Though they were first raised publicly by the conservative Free Beacon and the right-wing political activist Christopher Rufo, Harvard on Dec. 12 acknowledged “a few instances of inadequate citation” in Gay’s work that it nonetheless said did not qualify as research misconduct. On Dec. 20, the university said Gay’s doctoral dissertation included “duplicative language without appropriate attribution,” and said Gay would update the dissertation. In response to the allegations, Gay said on Dec. 11 that she stood by “the integrity of my scholarship,” which focuses on race and politics. In a separate note Tuesday, the fellows of Harvard College, who make up the Harvard Corp., said that Gay had “acknowledged missteps and has taken responsibility for them.” The letter also condemned “repugnant and in some cases racist vitriol” directed at the outgoing president. Alan M. Garber, the university’s provost and chief academic officer, will serve as interim president, the letter said. In her statement Tuesday, Gay wrote that it had become clear, after consulting with the Harvard Corporation, that it was “in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge with a focus on the institution rather than any individual.” She also indicated that she would not be leaving the university, and would return to the Harvard faculty. Gay previously served as dean of the school’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The next four years will change America forever.

Blanchard pleaded guilty in 2015 to the second-degree murder of her mother, Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard, and was sentenced to 10 years behind bars. Following her early release last Thursday, she posted two videos on TikTok to celebrate. “I’m finally free,” Blanchard, 32, said in the first clip, posted Sunday. “I just wanted to send a quick video to thank everyone for the massive amount of support that I’ve been getting on social media. Everyone has been really, really nice and supportive. I really appreciate that. It’s nice to be home.” “I’m back home in Louisiana, enjoying a beautiful day outside,” she continued. “I’ve got a lot of great things happening really soon. I’ve got my documentary series coming out, ‘The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard.’ I just put out an e-book that I’m super proud of.” Blanchard said the book won’t be “a rehashing of everything that happened,” but a “reflection” of what she has “learned and experienced” during her time at Missouri’s Chillicothe Correctional Center before she was cleared for early release in September. Her story has already been dramatized in the 2019 Hulu series “The Act” and detailed in HBO’s 2017 documentary “Mommy Dead and Dearest.” “Happy New Year’s Eve! I’m about to celebrate with my family,” Blanchard said in another video. “I have my dad and my stepmom Kristy here, and of course my husband,” Blanchard continued in the follow-up TikTok. “We’re looking to ring in the new year together, and it’s going to be really awesome to have some family time after so long.” Blanchard married Louisiana teacher Ryan Scott Anderson behind bars in 2022. For years, Blanchard’s mother foisted a litany of illnesses and conditions upon her ― including brain damage, leukemia and muscular dystrophy ― that she did not actually have. Blanchard was also made to use a wheelchair, fed unnecessary medicines, and forcibly kept indoors by her mother. Dee Dee Blanchard was found stabbed to death in her home in Springfield, Missouri, in 2015. Gypsy Rose ultimately admitted to conspiring with her boyfriend at the time, Nicholas Godejohn, to kill her mother. Godejohn was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Blanchard has found support for her early release among countless abuse victims in addition to her own family. Her stepmother, Kristy Blanchard, suggested in 2019 that Gypsy Rose would have died had things continued on the way they had been. “Dee Dee would tell me, ‘When I die, I hope she dies with me, because one can’t live without the other,’” Kristy told In Touch Weekly. “Now thinking back, it’s like, ‘Oh my god, she would’ve ended up — She would’ve killed Gypsy. She would have.’” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

The individual, who was not immediately identified, shot out a window to gain access to the Ralph L. Carr Colorado Judicial Center in Denver shortly after being involved in a two-car crash outside the building around 1:15 a.m., the Colorado State Patrol (CSP) said in a release. The man, who allegedly pointed a handgun at the other driver before fleeing the scene, entered the building and held an unarmed guard with the CSP’s Capitol Security Unit at gunpoint. He then demanded access to other parts of the building, which also houses the Colorado Court of Appeals, the CSP said. “The individual obtained keys from the security guard and proceeded into other parts of the building and accessed an unknown number of floors,” state police said. The suspect fired multiple gunshots inside before calling 911 and voluntarily surrendering around 3 a.m. No injuries were reported, though there is “significant and extensive damage to the building and the investigation is ongoing,” police said. The man was taken to a local hospital for evaluation, authorities added. The next four years will change America forever.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. One of the many great things about the holidays is spending them with those you love the most, but that can also mean a higher chance of COVID-19 exposure, especially at large gatherings or events. These rapid antigen tests from Amazon are 30% off right now, just in time. The iHealth COVID-19 tests are authorized by the FDA and have a recently extended shelf life of 15 months, up from their previously allotted six months (you can cross-check your test’s lot numbers with the FDA’s list of expiration dates). Each kit comes with five tests, perfect for everyone in your close circle of friends and family, or for performing multiple days of testing. They promise results in just 15 minutes. These tests use a non-invasive nasal swab that doesn’t require all of that eye-watering discomfort that some of us are unfortunately familiar with. Many reviewers also attest to their easy-to-follow instructions and accuracy. You can read more about real user experiences below, or grab a pack of tests on sale from the link above. Promising Amazon reviews: “The Antigen Rapid Test has proven to be both effective and user-friendly. It provides a quick and straightforward method for testing, making it a valuable tool to have on hand for occasional use. However, it’s crucial to emphasize checking the expiration date to ensure the reliability of the results, as an expired test may compromise accuracy.” — Chasing Krista “The iHealth test is pretty solid. The instructions are straightforward, and you can get your results pretty quickly. It’s user-friendly, so you don’t need to be a tech whiz to figure it out. Really convenient if you want to keep tabs on your health without any hassle, the iHealth test is a good shout.” — Lulu “Have used 5 other test kits so far since start of COVID19. While most do the job as desired, most also seem rather flimsy and clumsy to use. IMO, iHealth is just a better design that I keep coming back to.” — Man from plaid “Both my husband and I work in places where there are a lot of people (and children).

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/top-hamas-official-killed-in-beirut-blast-hezbollahs-tv-station-says_n_659440b6e4b0f27b6e3569f8,"Top Hamas Official Killed In Beirut Blast, Hezbollah Says",bassem mroue,1/2/2024,"BEIRUT (AP) — An apparent Israeli strike in the Lebanese capital of Beirut killed Hamas’ No. 2 political leader Tuesday, marking a potentially significant escalation of Israel’s war against the militant group and heightening the risk of a wider Middle East conflict. Saleh Arouri, who was the most senior Hamas figure killed since the war with Israel began, was also a founder of the group’s military wing. His death could provoke major retaliation by Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah militia. The strike hit an apartment in a building in a Shiite district of Beirut that is a Hezbollah stronghold, and Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to strike back against any Israeli targeting of Palestinian officials in Lebanon. Hezbollah and the Israeli military have been exchanging fire almost daily over the Israeli-Lebanese border since Israel’s military campaign in Gaza began nearly three months ago. But so far the Lebanese group has appeared reluctant to dramatically escalate the fighting. A significant response now could send the conflict spiraling into all-out war on Israel’s northern border. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said the strike was carried out by an Israeli drone, and Israeli officials declined to comment. Speaking to reporters, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari did not directly mention Arouri’s death but said, “We are focused and remain focused on fighting against Hamas.” “We are on high readiness for any scenario,” he added. The killing comes ahead of a visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, even as the United States has tried to prevent a spread of the conflict, repeatedly warning Hezbollah — and its regional supporter, Iran — not to escalate the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with the assault in Gaza until Hamas is crushed and the more than 100 hostages still held by the militant group in Gaza are freed, which he has said could take several more months. At the same time, Israeli officials have increasingly warned in recent days of stepped-up action against Hezbollah unless its cross-border fire stops. Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened to kill Hamas leaders wherever they are. The group’s Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into southern Israel killed around 1,200 people, and some 240 others were taken hostage. Israel claims to have killed a number of mid-level Hamas leaders in Gaza, but this would be the first time it has reached into another country to target the group’s top leaders, many of whom live in exile around the region. Arouri was the deputy of Hamas’ supreme political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and headed the group’s presence in the West Bank. He was also a key liaison with Hezbollah. Tuesday’s blast shook a residential building in the Beirut suburb of Musharafieh, killing four people, according to the Lebanese news agency. Hamas confirmed that Arouri was killed along with six other members of the group, including two military commanders. Haniyeh said the movement was “more powerful and determined” following the attack. “They left behind them strong men who will carry the banner after them,” he said of those killed. Hezbollah called the strike “a serious attack on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty and resistance.” “We affirm that this crime will never pass without response and punishment,” it said. Since the Gaza conflict began, Lebanese have feared their country could be pulled into a full-fledged war. Hezbollah and Israel fought a monthlong war in 2006, when Israeli bombardment wreaked heavy destruction in southern Lebanon. Israel’s air, ground and sea assault in Gaza has killed more than 22,100 people in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The campaign has driven some 85% of Gaza’s population from their homes, forcing hundreds of thousands of people into overcrowded shelters or teeming tent camps in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless bombed. Israel’s siege of the territory has left a quarter of Gaza residents facing starvation, according to the United Nations. Israel announced Monday that it would withdraw five brigades, or several thousand troops, from Gaza in the coming weeks. Still, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said it would be a mistake to think that Israel is planning on halting the war. “The feeling that we will stop soon is incorrect,” he said Tuesday. “Without a clear victory, we will not be able to live in the Middle East.” Israel has said it’s close to achieving operational control over most of northern Gaza, where ground troops have been battling militants for over two months. But Gallant said several thousand Hamas fighters are believed still to be in the north, and residents reported clashes in several parts of Gaza City, as well as in the nearby urban Jabaliya refugee camp. Fierce fighting has continued in other parts of the Palestinian territory, especially the south, where many of Hamas’ forces remain intact and where most of Gaza’s population has fled. Palestinians reported heavy airstrikes and artillery shelling in the southern city of Khan Younis and farming areas to the east. The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israel bombed its headquarters in the city, killing five people. At least 14,000 displaced people are sheltering in the building, it said. Fighting was also underway in and around the built-up Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. The army issued evacuation orders to people living in parts of nearby Nuseirat camp. A strike Tuesday leveled a building in Nuseirat, killing at least eight people, according to officials at the nearby hospital. Associated Press footage showed people pulling several children out of the wreckage. In other developments, officials said Israel will defend itself before the United Nation’s top court against charges that it has engaged in genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. The announcement set the stage for what is likely to be a landmark case in international law. South Africa launched the case Friday at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands, saying the Israeli military campaign targeting Hamas has resulted in enough death, destruction and humanitarian crisis in Gaza to meet the threshold of genocide under international law. South Africa asked the court to order Israel to halt its attacks in Gaza. Israel rarely cooperates in international court cases against it, dismissing the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased. Its decision to respond to the charge signals that the government is concerned about potential damage to its reputation. The genocide charge strikes at the heart of Israel’s national identity. The country sees itself as a bulwark of security for Jews after the Holocaust killed 6 million Jews, and world support for Israel’s creation in Palestine in 1948 was deeply rooted in outrage over Nazi atrocities. The convention against genocide was drawn up by world powers the same year in hopes of preventing similar atrocities. Eylon Levy, an official in the Israeli prime minister’s office, accused South Africa of “giving political and legal cover” to Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack triggered Israel’s campaign. “The state of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at the Hague to dispel South Africa’s absurd blood libel,” he said. Many South Africans, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, have compared Israel’s policies regarding Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank with South Africa’s past apartheid regime of racial segregation.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/vivek-ramaswamy-cnn-debate-iowa_n_659426eee4b0f27b6e355ba4,Vivek Ramaswamy Mad About Likely Not Qualifying For CNN's Iowa Debate,igor bobic,1/2/2024,"GOP presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy, whose poll numbers are likely too low to allow him to participate in CNN’s upcoming GOP presidential debate in Iowa, lashed out at the network on Tuesday. In a statement, the biotech entrepreneur claimed that the polling requirements amount to “a desperate bid by CNN to limit the scope of debate in the Republican presidential primary and to prop up the least conservative and most corrupt candidate in the race (Nikki Haley),” referring to the former U.N. ambassador who is also in the 2024 GOP contest. Ramaswamy said he’ll be attending a competing event with conservative podcaster Tim Pool in Des Moines instead. To qualify for the Jan. 10 debate, each candidate must be polling at least 10% in three surveys, including one CNN poll of likely Iowa GOP caucusgoers. Ramaswamy has consistently polled well under 10%, and Tuesday’s attack against CNN is likely a bid to preempt the network’s debate announcement. Ramaswamy’s self-funded campaign has struggled in recent weeks. It stopped spending money on television ads, a major way of getting your message out in early-nominating states. Ramaswamy instead seems to be adopting a strategy of bashing the media and sharing conspiracy theories to draw eyeballs. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the race by a mile, is scheduled to attend a Fox News town hall at the same time as the CNN debate, in another bid to counterprogram his dwindling GOP competition. Trump, who was impeached for inciting an insurrection, is skipping the primary debates entirely. Last month, Trump said he would be willing to participate in a primary debate if the race comes down to just him and a single rival after the New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23.

The “Killers of the Flower Moon” star revealed Sunday in an interview with People that her Indigenous heritage — she has Blackfeet and Nez Perce ancestry — taught her to rethink pronouns at an early age. “I remember being 9 years old and just being a little disheartened, seeing how often a lot of my boy cousins were misgendered because they wore their hair long,” Gladstone, 37, told the outlet. “It happens to a lot of kids, I think, especially Native boys … getting teased for it.” “So I remember back then being like, everybody should just be they,” she said. Gladstone added that most Indigenous languages use only “they” pronouns and that the gender of Blackfeet members “is implied” in their name. She also noted that even this isn’t binary, however, as Gladstone’s grandfather was named “Iron Woman” despite his gender. “I wouldn’t say that he was nonbinary in gender, but he was given a woman’s name because he kind of carried himself, I guess, the way that women who have that name do,” Gladstone said. “And there were lots of women historically and still now who are given men’s names,” she continued. “They fulfill more of a man’s role in society as far as being provider, warrior, those sort of things. So, yeah, my pronoun use is partly a way of decolonizing gender for myself.” Gladstone, who was raised on a Blackfeet reservation in Montana until she was 10, is already garnering Oscar buzz for her performance in “Flower Moon.” The Martin Scorsese drama chronicles the real-life murders of Osage Nation members in 1920s Oklahoma.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. When I planned a long trip to the snowy north last winter, this Miami girl had a slight panic: What could I wear on my legs if went outside to exercise? My ski pants seemed excessive, so I went on a search and discovered Baleaf’s fleece-lined leggings. They’re available with multiple pockets and even in a water-resistant option I knew would serve me well if it began to snow while I was on a walk. And I loved them. Turns out I’m not alone: These have rave reviews from shoppers who say the leggings keep them warm without limiting movement or looking bulky, are flattering, don’t feel cheap, are comfortable, are good for both winter sports and wearing around the house, fit well and keep them coming back to buy more. Best of all, they’re up to 36% off right now at Amazon, in one-pocket, three-pocket and water-resistant styles, each in many colors and sizes XS-6XL. To my shock, these are even cheaper right now than they were for Amazon’s huge Prime Big Deal Days sale. The fleece lining isn’t ultra-thick, but I did find it made a huge difference in how warm I was (Baleaf says they can keep wearers warm even in temperatures under 50 degrees, which tracked with my experience). They were also great to wear as pajamas and sitting around in the house, which means fall is the perfect time to buy and begin enjoying them. Because they’re a wee smidge thicker than regular leggings, I found they were just a bit tight in my usual leggings size, though I still wore them comfortably without exchanging. Baleaf provides a chart on the listing page so you can find the perfect fit. Check out some promising reviews from Amazon: ″I live in these! I saw these out because I was looking for a fleece lined legging. It’s harder to find than you would think. I absolutely love these and keep coming back and buying more. I got the three pocket kind recently which is perfect for my phone. I wear them for all my winter sports and even around the house too. There’s enough spandex to keep it flexible but not too stretchy plenty to keep warm. I highly recommend these. Sometimes this brand feels cheap to me but not in the case of these leggings.” — Melissa “I l love the Beleaf clothing. I am a senior citizen and I get a lot of compliments. I have the Bermuda shorts, fleece leggings, sport tops and they are fabulous. Fit perfectly.” — Amazon customer “Keep you warm! I bought 2 pairs of these for a trip to Iceland. I literally wore them everywhere!! They were so cozy, comfortable and looked great.” — Amazon customer “So cozy! I ordered these leggings after seeing then advertized on TV. I am wearing them right now as it has cooled off today in NC. They are so comfortable, fit so great. They have a cozy, light weight fleece lining and have two pockets for a cell phone. I am 5′8′ and 180# and ordered an XL as I don’t like spandex leggings too too tight. These fit perfect. I know I will wear them alot this fall and witner for walking, running errands or just relaxing at home. Don’t hesitate to buy these. A great purchase!!!!” — LM Smith “Get them and be invincible. I hate the cold, like I medically have a cold aversion. But I just went on a walk in 50 degrees F on a RAINY day and felt amazing! The water kind of beaded on the [water resistant] pants but didn’t soak in. I washed before wearing and don’t see any change in quality… yet. I’m 5’5, 140lb, athletic and pear shaped and the M is a fantastic fit, hitting my ankle with a functional waist tie. I feel like I can actually be inspired to go outside in winter and fall now? I dunno, just get them.” — Ziroinka ″Bought two pair of these and wore them while on vacation in October in Ireland. These kept me warm in windy weather. They fit great and have a pocket on each leg big enough to hold my cell phone. Highly recommend.” — Charlotte E. Carver",0.219208674,0.245760621

She was 32. In a statement on Sunday, South Australia Police said a woman had died after she was struck by a car in an inner suburb of the city of Adelaide on Saturday night. She suffered serious injuries and died in a hospital overnight. Police said the driver, a 33-year-old man, was known to the woman, and was arrested and charged with causing her death by dangerous driving, driving without due care and endangering life. He was bailed and is scheduled to appear in court on March 13. Local media named Hoskins as the woman, and it was widely reported that her husband, fellow pro cyclist Rohan Dennis, was the man arrested. Reached for comment, a South Australia Police spokesperson told HuffPost it is policy not to name those involved in an incident due to local privacy laws. Hoskins was allegedly hit by a pickup truck driven by Dennis near their Adelaide home, Australia’s public broadcaster, ABC News, reported. Hoskins’ parents, Peter and Amanda, and sister, Jess, issued a joint statement on Tuesday via AusCycling. “Words cannot convey our grief, sadness and the tragic circumstances of Melissa’s passing. Myself, Amanda, Jess and families, are utterly devastated and still struggling to process what has happened,” the statement said. “Not only have we lost a daughter and sister, her children have lost their mum, a freewheeling spirit, a giver with a big heart, patience and zest for life.” “She was the rock of their life and ours and we need to honour her memory so they can grow up knowing who she was, what she stood for and what she gave to everyone whose life she touched,” it continued. The funeral will be held in Hoskins’ hometown, Perth, and a memorial service will take place in Adelaide after this month’s Tour Down Under event. The family has requested privacy as they grieve. Hoskins competed in team pursuit at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. Her team won gold in the team pursuit at the 2015 world championships in France. Dennis was part of the Australian team that won silver in the team pursuit at the London 2012 Olympics. He won bronze at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. Hoskins had retired from pro cycling in 2017; Dennis retired earlier this year. Tributes flowed from members of the cycling community around the world. The Australian Olympic Committee expressed “the utmost sadness” over the news. “Our condolences go to Melissa’s family, friends and the cycling community at this extremely difficult time,” it said. “I have a very heavy heart. My thoughts are with their children, family and fellow friends. This is a very difficult and tragic time. RIP,” wrote Australian Olympic cyclist Anna Meares. Annette Edmonson, another champion cyclist from Australia, said that “the world has lost one of its shining stars this weekend.” “A fun, loving, hilarious person, who was so talented in so many areas. A force to be reckoned with, she took the track and road cycling world by storm, before pursuing her next dream, starting a family and becoming the ultimate Mum,” she wrote. “You drove me to become a better athlete,” she added. “We were so competitive on the track and road, but when we came together in the team time trial and team pursuit, we were one.” The next four years will change America forever.

The “Doggystyle” rapper has been officially hired by NBC as “special correspondent” for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris, and will not only provide his distinctive take on the competitions but also visit famous landmarks and interview the athletes. The news was first announced at halftime during “Sunday Night Football’s” coverage of the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings game on NBC and its Peacock platform. Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, has since confirmed the new gig himself. “I grew up watching the Olympics and am thrilled to see the incredible athletes bring their A-game to Paris,” he told several outlets in a statement Sunday. “It’s a celebration of skill, dedication and the pursuit of greatness.” “It’s going to be the most epic Olympics ever, so stay tuned, and keep it locked,” Snoop continued. “Let’s elevate, celebrate and make these games unforgettable, smoke the competition, and may the best shine like gold. Peace and Olympic LOVE, ya dig?” Snoop has undergone a transition over the years from 1990s gangsta rapper to a family-friendly face who has co-starred in a variety show with Martha Stewart, made his own cereal and partnered with dozens of recognizable brands. NBCUniversal says it will livestream all Olympic competitions on Peacock, and are hoping to differentiate its nightly broadcast so sports fans will still tune in. The network is counting on the rapper, who previously commentated the 2021 Tokyo Olympics alongside Kevin Hart, to do just that.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/datebook-planner-calendar-life_n_658db9fde4b03057f5ccb00a,I've Bought This 1 Inexpensive Item Every January For Decades And It's Changed How I See My Life,jean coco,1/2/2024,"Recently, I pulled a 1985 datebook from a bookcase to fact-check a date for an essay I was writing. Fascinated by what it held, I grabbed the rest of the books I have from the ’80s, ’90s and ’00s. Looking at 25-plus years scattered across my desk, I wondered: How had I accumulated so many datebooks? Saving datebooks isn’t a practice I’ve pursued; it evolved from drinking coffee with my pocket planner every morning. Scanning lists, ticking off completed tasks, adding appointments and reminders — all of it grounds me and gives me the feeling I have a modicum of control over my life. So, come every new year, I can’t just ditch the 12-month relationship I’ve established with my little Moleskine from the previous year. I’ve always saved my journals — but datebooks (also known as calendars) capture something else. Cracking open a calendar from the past is like rummaging through the junk drawer in your childhood kitchen. You’ll find knickknack notations, gobs of cyclical tasks, grocery lists, birthdays to remember, library books to renew, coffee dates with people you can and can’t recall and cryptic notes. Surveying the detritus of my daily doings from 1989, I was befuddled by notes devoid of context. “Order 40-pound pig.” Why? “Get more boxes. Pack books, chairs, dishes.” Which move was that? On Feb. 15, 1993, I scribbled “Buy Amtrak ticket.” Two weeks later the reminder resurfaced. Where was I going? Flipping ahead to April, it ends up I’d planned what I thought might be my last solo trip (to Washington, D.C.) before I delivered my first child four months later. With planners as dated as mine, I come across obsolete errands and practices — videos to return to Blockbuster, typewriter ribbons to replace and stamps to buy for mailing self-addressed stamped envelopes with manuscripts. It’s hard to believe, but I even wrote my Social Security number on 1983’s personal information page. I’ve encountered cringeworthy relics, too. Leafing through calendars from my 20s, I winced at daily calorie consumption totals, weekly assessments of how my Levi’s fit (“tight”/“medium”/“loose”) and predictions of when a letter would/should arrive from a man who never wrote me back. Still, I unearthed enough nuggets to neutralize those embarrassing bits. Take, for instance, a yellow sticky note that fell from 2007: “Can’t wait for your visit!” in my mom’s happy handwriting. Inside July 30, 2006, my then 10-year-old daughter used a hot pink marker to scrawl “My brithday” in her dyslexic print. Quotes and random journal-ish jottings cropped up, too. What prompted me, as a high school junior, to copy this line from poet Dylan Thomas across 1978’s address page: “I said some words to the close and holy darkness, and then I slept.” In another datebook from 1985, desperation claimed the first week of May: “The uncertainty is too much. I’ve taken enough risks to last a lifetime.” That year I was recovering from a failed attempt to serve in the Peace Corps, a throughline manifested in a slew of affirmations, inspirational quotes and therapy appointments. Most years contained throughlines — some more dramatic than others. In 2009, a family move from New York to North Carolina explained the endless to-do list dominating the pages from February through August. September through December exposed the fallout: I found Zoloft refill reminders, mentions of family therapy sessions and weekly grief counseling appointments for my depressed teenage daughters. Clocks move ever forward but datebooks provide a tangible conduit to the past. They allow us to flip forward or backward in time, a tactile experience that’s more satisfying than swiping a finger across a screen. This is something I realized at the beginning of 2021 when I tried relying solely on Google Calendar. With the ongoing pandemic I figured I wouldn’t have much to keep track of since 2020 was practically blank. But by mid-February 2021, I had a fresh Moleskine in hand. I know you’re probably wondering: Why go old-school analog with a tool as essential as a datebook? I still use Google Calendar at times because it can be more efficient. But consider how much time you waste being sucked into the vortex of rabbit holes inherent in apps. Consider the satisfaction intrinsic in dragging a pen through a procrastinated task you’ve finally tackled. Consider how open dates are waiting for on-the-fly brainstorming and the chance to accommodate an impromptu journal entry. And, lastly, let’s not forget posterity: how your handwritten notations will preserve a smidgen of your physicality for the ages. Paging through a datebook from the past, you’ll find yourself taking stock. How did I use my time? Why did I waste it on that job/project/relationship? Look at what I accomplished! As acclaimed author Annie Dillard famously said: “How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.” Several years ago, while clearing my parents’ attic, I discovered a calendar my dad kept in 1965. A freebie from his insurance agent, the datebook’s weeks were cluttered with junk drawer minutiae: reminders to vote, attend barbershop quartet practice, church suppers and coin collector meetings — along with doodles galore. Gazing at the gray ovals penciled inside an eight, I wondered: Is this how he’d occupied himself on a call with a long-winded someone? Paging past June, I stopped on July 22, where he’d written “7:30 Poverty Program, City Hall,” in his slanted script. In 1965, I was four, too young to know about then-President Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty initiatives. Decades later, after Alzheimer’s began affecting my dad’s memory, I learned from a family friend that he had helped launch a local chapter of Head Start in my hometown, Jennings, Louisiana. The initiative, which was originally called Project Head Start, began as an eight-week summer program before becoming a federally funded project for low-income and at-risk children and families. Now, I have evidence of his involvement with the group and his calendar plays a newfound role as a primary source document. That discovery got me thinking about how our seemingly mundane notations provide continuity between the past and present, and how they hold far more resonance than we might imagine at the time. As the blank dates of a new year accrue the granular minutia of our day-to-day stuff, week after week, month after month, the datebook morphs into a retrospective collage that’s as messy as life itself. Taken together, the datebooks from my 20s tell the story of a young woman who made too many lists, wanted to save the world and was teetering toward an eating disorder. One day, when my daughters survey my datebooks, they’ll recognize aspects of the 60-something me in the 20-something me. They’ll smile at the solo escapes I planned on Mother’s Day when they were little and be reminded that our shabby Ethan Allen sofa was delivered on Nov. 8, 2004. But will they notice the emotional mud seasons I slogged through? How calls, dinner dates and birthday reminders nurtured my deepest friendships? Whatever they (or anyone else) finds, my datebooks will tell the story of not only what I was up to, but who I was and who I was becoming over time. And as my life continues to unfold, my datebooks serve as a constant reminder of Annie Dillard’s sage advice. This is why I’m inviting you to use a datebook in 2024. Who knows? Years from now, you or someone else might come upon a gem amid the minutiae of your days — a doodle, stray jotting or something else that reveals something about you or how you lived. Something you can’t know now because you haven’t yet written it in your datebook. You can read Jean Coco’s recent work in Brevity, Ninth Letter online, Hippocampus and The Sun’s Readers Write.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heart-health-cardiologists-new-years-resolutions_l_65831ae9e4b0d9bdbf6876af,The 4 New Year's Resolutions Cardiologists Always Make,jillian wilson,1/2/2024,"It’s the season when many people set New Year’s resolutions for the year ahead, and these goals are often related to physical health. Experts say there’s one big area that many people should focus on when it comes to their well-being: cardiovascular health. “Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in America,” said Dr. William Cornwell, a cardiologist at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital. “And, sadly, people... lack a clear understanding of the health or unhealth of their hearts until something catastrophic happens, such as a heart attack or a stroke.” But there are lifestyle habits you can adopt to manage some of the factors ― like high cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure ― that put you at risk of heart attack and stroke. Cardiologists say they encourage these lifestyle habits every year. Below, doctors shared with HuffPost the New Year’s resolutions they set and recommend to patients in the name of heart health. No surprise here: All of the experts we spoke to said exercise is an important resolution to set every single year. “First and foremost, from a cardiac standpoint regarding cardiovascular health, exercise needs to be at the forefront,” Cornwell said. “For me, personally, it is a part of my everyday routine and every year,” he said. “There needs to be a renewed commitment to ensure that exercise is at the forefront of everything that you should be thinking about to improve or maintain your cardiac health.” “Exercise also brings a number of other benefits to other organ systems, in addition to improvements in quality of life and your overall ability to function well without symptoms,” Cornwell noted. “So, for many reasons — the heart really only being one of many — if there was going to be one New Year’s resolution, exercise should be the one.” Admittedly, it can be hard to jump into fitness in January, a month marked by early sunsets and cold temperatures in much of the country. But it’s still important to prioritize movement during this time of year, said Dr. Johanna Contreas, a member of the National Hispanic Medical Association and a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York. “Winter months, we tend to see an increase in cardiovascular disease and heart attacks and heart failure, hospitalization,” Contreas said, “because those winter months, you’re more indoors, less likely to be active. So, we always try to tell patients: Think about ways that you can remain active.” In other words, your version of exercise does not have to take the form of an outdoor run or walk. You could focus on walking up and down the stairs throughout the day, making a point to get up from your computer after long meetings, or signing up for a fitness app that allows you to exercise from home. (Peloton, Alo Moves and FitOn are all good options.) As for how much you need to exercise each week, Cornwell said the American Heart Association’s guidelines recommend 150 to 300 minutes of mild to moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking, doubles tennis or gardening), or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous exercise (like running, jumping rope or swimming laps), each week. “I tell people, [if] you really want to start a healthy year, know your numbers and know what is healthy for you,” Contreas said. When talking about “numbers,” experts are referring to things like a person’s blood pressure, cholesterol and fasting glucose, said Dr. Elizabeth Jackson, director of the cardiovascular outcomes and effectiveness research program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medicine. High cholesterol and high blood pressure can put you at increased risk for heart attack and stroke, which means they’re important to manage through medication and/or lifestyle changes. Jackson also recommends “knowing your fasting glucose, because we know that in the U.S. we have a high prevalence of diabetes, but we also have a high prevalence of pre-diabetes — people who are not quite meeting the definition of diabetes, but they’re not in the normal range.” According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, having diabetes makes you two to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease. You can ask your doctor for your numbers, and they can either share the data they have on file or order tests to determine this information. “It’s important to know where you’re at in terms of those numbers, but also not to be discouraged if numbers are out of whack,” Jackson noted. You can get to a healthier place by adhering to lifestyle adjustments like sticking to an exercise regimen, quitting smoking, and more ways that are outlined in the AHA’s Life Essential 8. Additionally, you can talk to your doctor about medication to see if that’s the right choice for you. Eating a nutritious diet full of things like fruits, veggies, whole grains, lean protein and beans is known to be beneficial for your heart health and your health overall. According to Jackson, thinking wholeheartedly about your diet is a good goal for the new year. To focus on your nutrition, Jackson suggests food-prepping for the week so you’ll have something nutritious to grab when you’re hungry. She also suggests trying out new heart-health recipes each week. The American Heart Association has recipes, she noted, that can help maintain or improve your cardiac health. If this feels too daunting, Contreas said, you can try simple hacks like adding vegetables to your rice to make your meals more nutritious. Additionally, you could try eating vegetarian a few days a week, or even for a few meals a week. Contreas noted that it’s important to be mindful of your salt intake, too. Consuming too much salt can increase your blood pressure, she said. And, as mentioned above, high blood pressure can put you at risk for heart attack and stroke. “Sleep is very important,” Contreas said. “Sleep deprivation, we know now, is very unhealthy, and it can cause increasing cardiovascular disease” and put you at higher risk for depression and high blood pressure. Contreas said one of her New Year’s resolutions is to help workers at her hospital get better sleep, in particular those who have to work the night shift. It’s recommended that adults get between seven and nine hours of sleep each night. “It may not be possible every night,” Contreas acknowledged. “But as much as we can stick to [it] would be important.” Jackson and Cornwell both pointed out that healthy sleep is part of the AHA’s guidelines to better cardiovascular health, and is an important goal to focus on every year. “We don’t have to go and be perfect every day right away,” Jackson said. “It’s not like January 1 starts, and all of a sudden your lifestyle habits are going to change dramatically and never go back.” You should cut yourself some slack if you miss a day at the gym or fall back into an old habit you’re trying to break. Additionally, it’s OK to let yourself have rest days (your body needs them!) and allow yourself desserts and foods that aren’t particularly heart-healthy, too. “But, knowing that if you’re putting in more healthy-type behaviors — healthy diet, physical activity, good sleep — most days, or more than you were, then that’s contributing,” Jackson said. “It really adds up.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-eat-on-a-budget-without-cooking-at-home-all-the-time_l_6580bfa6e4b0e142c0bee0d6,"How To Eat On A Budget Without Giving Up Takeout, According To Financial Planners",leigh weingus,1/2/2024,"There are tons of reasons why cooking at home is a great idea, and I can recite them all. Home-cooked food is almost always healthier than anything you’ll get in a takeout container, it’s better for the environment, and it can be a mindful, meditative way to spend an evening. Last, but certainly not least, home cooking will definitely be easier on your bank account than the GrubHub app. But while I strive to cook at home as often as possible, sometimes I want — no, need — to just have a plate or bowl of fully prepared food handed to me. In a month like January, that makes me feel extra guilty because I’ve already spent way too much money during the busy holiday season. In an effort to spend less on food this month and in the coming months of 2024, I decided to talk to financial experts to get their best tips for eating on a budget without cooking all the time. Here are their top budget-friendly food tips that involve as little cooking as possible. While this tip does involve a little bit of cooking, it really is just a little bit. According to Shinobu Hindert, a certified financial planner (CFP), the prepared foods section of your local grocery store can be your best friend. “You can buy a pre-made chicken salad and add it to a pre-made salad mix that you toss together,” Hindert told HuffPost. “You can have that for two nights, depending on the size of the chicken salad you get. Trader Joe’s has great pre-made options, too. For example, you can buy a pre-made salad mix or burrito. This is more expensive than buying it all together, but you save money by not wasting any food you’re not eating and it’s less expensive than going out.” While takeout is more expensive than eating at home, every takeout order doesn’t have to make a huge dent in your credit card. “Make a list of local places you like to have takeout from that are under your budget,” Hindert said. “Tier them into two categories: Budget-friendly and splurge. If you know cooking a typical meal at home costs you about $10 per person then grabbing takeout from Chipotle, for example, won’t break the bank.” But, she said, if you have a favorite takeout place where dishes run $15-plus, this becomes an expensive habit. “If you have restaurants pre-picked and budget out what you can comfortably spend, it minimizes any hangry splurges,” Hindert noted. “Maybe you skip the appetizers and use the leftovers for lunch the next day to make this budget-friendly. Get creative!” As with most things in life, there is a way to save money on takeout. Tori Dunlap, the author of ”The Financial Feminist,” says she’s all about the DashPass, which offers $0 delivery fees, lower service fees, and 5% DoorDash credits back on pickup orders, and much more. “One of my favorite strategies is using the free DashPass subscription that comes with my credit card to cut down on costs,” she said. Dunlap also suggests thinking through our takeout orders before you place them. “What can you order that will last?” Dunlap said. “Ordering meals that are larger that you can split up, for example, can be a smart move. A pizza can be dinner then lunch the next day. I also try to order things I know will keep for a day or two — sushi, for example, is so yummy but hard to keep as a leftover.” One of the best ways to limit what you spend on takeout (or restaurants in general) is to make a plan for it. While we all go over budget sometimes, having a rough guideline for how much you want to or able to spend on takeout can be helpful. “Carve out time to sit down and budget what you really spend on take-out,” Hindert said. “It may be more or less than you think. Once you see your bottom-line number you can make choices.” If you want to continue spending at the same rate, Hindert added, where can you cut back? “It could be on your daily morning latte or maybe the weekend brunch with friends,” she said.

Log in to hide these messages. If you carve out space in your budget for ordering takeout, you don’t need to cut it out of your life. You need to make lifestyle choices of what is most important to you.” One point both Dunlap and Hindert make is that when it comes to budgeting, as long as your needs are met, you should focus on spending your money in a way that makes you happy. So hey, if takeout or eating out at restaurants makes you happy, create a budget that accommodates that want. Just be forewarned that you’ll probably need to put a limit on how many impulsive Amazon purchases you make, but that’s not so bad, right?

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/free-people-v-neck-sweater_l_6579c13ee4b0881b79193a53,This Free People Sweater Is The Only Thing I Want To Put On My Body Right Now,lindsay holmes,1/2/2024,"By the time winter rolls around, my brain is usually too exhausted to conceptualize cute outfits and my body is too cold to wear anything that isn’t cozy. Thankfully, Free People has rescued me from both of these problems. Enter the Alli V-neck tunic sweater, which I discovered through Nuuly, a clothing rental service that’s part of Free People’s parent group, URBN. Since then, I’ve purchased it (and re-rented it) in multiple colors. This knit sweater is thick, oversized and soft. My biggest pet peeve with sweaters is how itchy or irritating they can be on your skin, especially in winter when skin is already parched and suffering. That isn’t an issue with this V-neck. I own it in camel and black, but I’ve also worn it in white and green through my rental subscription. It also comes in pink, blue, gray, lavender and more, depending on where you purchase it. Best of all, this sweater is incredibly versatile. It makes you feel like you’re the main character in a Nancy Meyers movie ― or at the very least, the main character of your Zoom calls. I’ve used it as a pullover instead of a sweatshirt. I’ve worn it under coats to protect me from frigid temps. I’ve dressed it up for holiday dinners. I’ve lounged in it on days when I’m too lazy to wear anything else. The sweater comes in sizes XS to XL, and I highly recommend sizing down. I normally take a size large, but I’ve worn it in a medium and even a small, and both maintained the oversized look. This is also a dream garment if you’re on the taller side. I’m 6 feet tell and I can easily wear it with leggings, although the more you size down, the shorter it gets. (But it’s still workable!) If you’re looking for a sweater that can do it all, this is it. The only thing you’ll regret about your purchase is that you didn’t do it sooner. Trust me. You can check out some reviews below or just scroll down to get this versatile winter must-have for yourself. “I purchased the Titan grey color and it’s so gorgeous. It has a really large gauge knit. It’s a nice thickness. It hangs well and sort of slides off toward the shoulder. It’s a very flattering sweater; I may purchase more colors!” — AngieH at Nordstrom “Wow! What a great piece! I love oversized sweaters and have plenty from FP, but didn’t really like the look of this sweater online. I was wrong! Bought it only because of great reviews. Now it is my absolute favorite sweater! It is oversized but not too bulky. It is very soft and hangs beautifully. I love how heavy and thick it is. The neck line is so flattering. It is so very stylish and warm. I am 5’5 , 102 lb and XS fits great. I wouldn’t want it to fit any tighter. Love it!!!” — Babka at Free People “If u want the v neck to hang off your shoulder like the image order TTS, if you want just an oversized look order 1 size down.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) went to a football game on Monday to support the Texas Longhorns in their Sugar Bowl matchup against the Washington Huskies. It didn’t go well for Texas as Washington won 37-31 to advance to next week’s national championship game. The Texas defeat also continues what some fans see as a trend: When Cruz turns up, his team loses. In autumn, he showed up to support the Houston Astros in the American League Championship Series. They lost, and some fans blamed Cruz. In 2018, he was blamed for jinxing the Houston Rockets when the team was eliminated from the NBA playoffs with Cruz in attendance. And in 2017, fans blamed a poorly timed Cruz selfie for Texas Tech’s defeat in the NCAA finals. Last year, Cruz pushed back at the notion that his presence is a curse for sports teams, calling Rolling Stone magazine “lying hacks” for an article on fans begging him to stay home from the Astros game. But after the Longhorns’ loss, some fans are taking it out on Cruz: Sports bettors are now 15-2 since 2017 when betting the moneyline against teams Ted Cruz shows up to support in person.They would have profited $2,344 if they placed a $100 bet on each game. pic.twitter.com/WBH5vq36VW Its time for UT to ban Ted Cruz from all games The all time greatest jinx in sports, Ted Cruz ladies and gentlemen pic.twitter.com/alenudVpsD Hear us out.

The airline said all 379 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated. The coast guard pilot escaped its aircraft but the other five crew members were found dead, Japan’s transport minister, Tetsuo Saito, confirmed. The plane was due to travel to the guard’s Niigata base to assist with recovery efforts after a series of earthquakes. At least 17 of the people evacuated from the plane were injured, according to NHK, citing the Tokyo Fire Department. A Japan Coast Guard spokesperson confirmed a collision between the passenger plane and its flight MA-722, a Bombardier Dash-8. Footage from NHK showed the Japan Airlines aircraft ablaze on the runway. Earlier footage posted online showed a burst of flames as the plane landed. 【羽田空港 日本航空の機体が炎上】国土交通省東京空港事務所によりますと、羽田空港でJALの旅客機から炎があがっていると聞いているが客が搭乗しているかどうかなどはまだわからない、情報を確認中だと話していました。https://t.co/UGWveQ1hVi#nhk_video pic.twitter.com/s4YDQhcfll The flight, JAL516, had departed from New Chitose Airport in Hokkaido to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. All of Haneda Airport’s runways were closed from around 6 p.m. local time, The Japan Times reported, with flights being diverted to Narita Airport. Authorities were still working to extinguish the blaze, which appeared to have spread to most of the plane, more than an hour after the flight landed. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, addressed the incident in a news conference Tuesday night. He confirmed that the coast guard team had been on their way to deliver aid to the earthquake-stricken region in western Japan. He called it a “very disappointing and saddening situation,” according to a Sky News translation. “I’d like to express my respect towards their sense of duty, as well as offer my heartfelt condolences for their losses,” he said. The transport minister said the cause of the incident was unclear and multiple departments, including police and the Japan Transport Safety Board, were investigating. He said the ministry was working to get Haneda Airport’s operations back up and running as soon as possible. Plane manufacturer Airbus said that the A350-900 plane involved in the collision was delivered to Japan Airlines from the production line in November 2021.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/japan-earthquake_n_6593d250e4b0bf73e1772096,"Powerful Earthquakes Leave At Least 48 Dead, Destroy Buildings In Western Japan","hiro komae , yuri kageyama",1/2/2024,"WAJIMA, Japan (AP) — A series of powerful earthquakes that hit western Japan have left at least 48 people dead and damaged thousands of buildings, vehicles and boats. Officials warned that more quakes could lie ahead. Aftershocks continued to shake Ishikawa prefecture and nearby areas a day after a magnitude 7.6 temblor slammed the area on Monday afternoon. Forty-eight people were confirmed dead in Ishikawa, officials said. Sixteen others were seriously injured, while damage to homes was so great that it could not immediately be assessed, they said. Japanese media reports said tens of thousands of homes were destroyed. Government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi said 17 people were seriously injured and gave a slightly lower death tally, while saying he was aware of the prefecture’s tally. Water, power and cell phone service were still down in some areas, and residents expressed sorrow about their destroyed homes and uncertain futures. “It’s not just that it’s a mess. The wall has collapsed, and you can see through to the next room. I don’t think we can live here anymore,” Miki Kobayashi, an Ishikawa resident, said as she swept around her house. Their house was also damaged in a 2007 quake, she said. Although casualty numbers continued to climb gradually, the prompt public warnings, relayed on broadcasts and phones, and the quick response from the general public and officials appeared to have kept at least some of the damage under control. The rescue efforts that quickly followed from firefighters, police and the military proved a testament to how this nation has repeatedly withstood disasters, which have practically become a part of everyday life. Toshitaka Katada, a University of Tokyo professor specializing in disasters, said the people were prepared because the area had been hit by quakes in recent years. They had evacuation plans and emergency supplies in stock. “There is probably no people on earth other than Japanese who are so disaster-ready,” he said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Katada warned the situation remains precarious and unpredictable. The March 2011 quake and tsunami in northeastern Japan had been preceded by other quakes. “This is far from over,” Katada said. Predictions by scientists have repeatedly been proven wrong, such as with the 2016 quake in southwestern Kumamoto, an area previously seen as relatively quake-free. The only real projection possible is that you can’t make projections, Katada added. “Having too much confidence in the power of science is very dangerous. We are dealing with nature.” Japanese media aerial footage showed widespread damage in the hardest-hit spots, with landslides burying roads, boats tossed in the waters and a major fire that had turned an entire section of Wajima city to ashes. Japan’s military dispatched 1,000 soldiers to the disaster zones to join rescue efforts, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday. “Saving lives is our priority and we are fighting a battle against time,” he said. “It is critical that people trapped in homes get rescued immediately.” A quake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.6 shook the Ishikawa area as he was speaking. More quakes continued to rock the area, reaching more than 100 aftershocks over the past day. Nuclear regulators said several nuclear plants in the region were operating normally. The 2011 quake and tsunami caused three reactors to melt and release large amounts of radiation at a nuclear plant in northeastern Japan. News videos showed rows of collapsed houses. Some wooden structures were flattened and cars were overturned. Half-sunken ships floated in bays where tsunami waves had rolled in, leaving a muddied coastline. On Monday, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a major tsunami warning for Ishikawa and lower-level tsunami warnings or advisories for the rest of the western coast of Japan’s main island of Honshu, as well as for the northern island of Hokkaido. The warning was downgraded several hours later, and all tsunami warnings were lifted as of early Tuesday. Waves measuring more than one meter (3 feet) hit some places. People who were evacuated from their houses huddled in auditoriums, schools and community centers. Bullet trains in the region were halted, but service was mostly restored by Tuesday afternoon. Sections of highways were closed. Weather forecasters predicted rain, setting off worries about already crumbling buildings and infrastructure. The region includes tourist spots famous for lacquerware and other traditional crafts, along with designated cultural heritage sites. U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that his administration was “ready to provide any necessary assistance for the Japanese people.” Japan is frequently hit by earthquakes because of its location along the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. ___ Kageyama reported from Tokyo.

Officials in New Jersey say at least 13 buses from Texas and Louisiana have arrived in the state since Saturday ferrying about 450 migrants. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has continued to send migrants from his state to Democrat-led cities in a so-called protest against President Joe Biden’s immigration policies, despite sharp criticism from human rights advocates who have accused him of using human beings as political pawns. 2/4 Below is info from our JC emergency management that tracks these issues. At this point, approximately 10 busses from various locations in Texas and one from Louisiana have arrived at various transit stations throughout the state, including Secaucus, Fanwood, Edison, Trenton. 3/4 Approx 397 migrants have arrived at these locations since 12/30. NJ Transit is apparently the receiving agency, and there was a conf call between state police/NJT earlier today, which local governments were not part of. Adams last week passed an executive order meant to limit such arrivals in New York, requiring bus companies to provide 32 hours notice before dropping migrants off in the city. Arrivals are also limited to specific times of day between Monday and Friday. “We cannot allow buses with people needing our help to arrive without warning at any hour of day and night,” Adams said at the time. The shift was meant to address a surge in asylum seekers in New York, which has processed more than 161,000 since the spring of 2022, according to The New York Times. But the mayors of Secaucus, New Jersey, and Jersey City, New Jersey, said in recent days buses have unloaded hundreds of passengers who are then guided to train stations to New York. “It seems quite clear the bus operators are finding a way to thwart the requirements of the executive order by dropping migrants at the train station in Secaucus and having them continue to their final destination,” Michael Gonnelli, the mayor of Secaucus, said in a statement, describing the set-up as a “loophole” around Adams’ order. He added the outcome seemed to be an “unexpected consequence” of the new rules. Adams’ office blasted Abbott’s busing policy in a statement this week. “Texas Governor Greg Abbott continues to treat asylum seekers like political pawns, and is instead now dropping families off in surrounding cities and states in the cold, dark of night with train tickets to travel to New York City, just like he has been doing in Chicago,” his office said in a statement to media outlets.

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) knows who to blame for her decision to ditch her own constituents and run in a different district in the upcoming election: Barbra Streisand and Ryan Reynolds. “Hollywood is trying to buy their way into Congress,” the conspiracy theorist and “Beetlejuice” fan told right-wing podcaster and former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon on his “War Room” show Saturday. Boebert barely won reelection in 2022, defeating Democratic challenger Adam Frisch by 546 votes in a race virtually no one expected to be close. Rather than face Frisch again, Boebert said last week she’ll run in a neighboring district instead. Frisch has so far raised $7.7 million, compared to Boebert’s $2.4 million ― a difference she attributed to Deadpool and pals. “It’s coming from Hollywood when you have Barbra Streisand coming in and donating to the Democrat, when you have Ryan Reynolds coming in and donating to the Democrat,” she told Bannon. The two Hollywood stars named by Boebert combined for about 0.03 percent of Frisch’s haul: FEC records show Reynolds contributed $1,500 in 2023, while Streisand contributed $1,000. “We have to shut down the Hollywood elites who are trying to buy my current district,” Boebert declared.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-as-south-korea-politician-attacked-busan_n_65937639e4b0b01d3e40580a,South Korean Opposition Leader Stabbed By An Unidentified Man,ap,1/1/2024,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s tough-speaking liberal opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, was stabbed in the neck by an unidentified knife-wielding man during a visit Tuesday to the southeastern city of Busan, police said. Lee, 59 and the head of the main opposition Democratic Party, was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Police and emergency officials said he was conscious and wasn’t in critical condition, but his exact status was unknown. The attack happened when Lee walked through a crowd of journalists and others after finishing a tour of the site of a new airport in Busan. The attacker, posing as a supporter, approached Lee, saying he wanted to get his autograph, and then stabbed Lee in the neck with a knife, according to Busan police. Lee slumped to the ground, where a person pressed a handkerchief to his neck to stop the bleeding. A witness, Jin Jeong-hwa, told YTN television that Lee bled a lot. Videos circulated on social media showed the suspect, wearing a paper crown reading “I’m Lee Jae-myung,” being chased and tackled by several people. Police said officers arrested the man on the spot. During questioning, he refused to identify himself or say why he attacked Lee, according to Yonhap news agency. Lee’s Democratic Party called the incident “a terrorist attack on Lee and a serious threat to democracy.” It called on police to make a through, swift investigation of the incident. Party spokesperson Kwon Chil-seung told reporters at Pusan National University Hospital that Lee’s jugular vein was believed to have been damaged and there was concern over the large amount of bleeding. He said Lee was being airlifted to a hospital in Seoul for surgery. Hospital officials would not comment on Lee’s condition. President Yoon Suk Yeol expressed deep concern about Lee’s health and ordered authorities to investigate the attack, saying such violence would not be tolerated, according to Yoon’s office. Lee lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon by 0.7 percentage point, the narrowest margin ever recorded in a South Korean presidential election. Since his election defeat, Lee has been a harsh critic of Yoon’s major policies. Last year, Lee launched a 24-day hunger strike to protest what he called Yoon’s failure to oppose Japan’s release of treated radioactive wastewater from its crippled Fukushima nuclear power, his mishandling of the country’s post-pandemic economy and his hardline policies on North Korea. Lee faces an array of corruption allegations, including one that he provided unlawful favors to a private investor that reaped huge profits from a dubious housing project in the city of Seongnam, where Lee was mayor for a decade until 2018. Lee has denied legal wrongdoing and accused Yoon’s government of pushing a political vendetta. Last September, a South Korean court denied an arrest warrant for Lee over the allegations, saying there wasn’t a clear risk that he would destroy evidence. The court hearing was arranged after South Korea’s opposition-controlled parliament voted to lift Lee’s immunity to arrest, a move that reflected growing divisions within his Democratic Party over his legal troubles.

His supporters see him as an anti-elitist hero who could reform establishment politics, eradicate corruption and solve growing economic inequality. Critics view him as a dangerous populist who relies on stoking divisions and demonizing his conservative opponents. Lee is also known for his self-made success story. He worked in a factory as a boy, an experience that left him with an arm disability. He later made his own way through school and passed the country’s notoriously difficult bar exam to work as a human rights lawyer. Lee joined a predecessor of the Democratic Party in 2005. Previously a political outsider, he rose sharply amid public anger over an explosive 2016-17 corruption scandal that eventually led to the ouster of then conservative President Park Geun-hye.

Franco appeared before prosecutors while accompanied by two lawyers, days after not showing up for a meeting with prosecutor Olga Diná Llaverías, according to the official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the case. The official said the interview lasted nearly three hours. Llaverías had originally requested Franco appear Dec. 28, two days after prosecutors and police visited two of Franco’s properties in Baní, the All-Star player’s hometown some 37 miles (60 kilometers) southwest of the capital, to request his appearance. They did not find the 22-year-old player there. Authorities have released little information about the case because it involves a minor. Franco must be brought before a judge within 24 hours, according to Dominican law. Franco’s U.S. attorney, Jay Reisinger, declined comment. The AP was not able to reach Franco’s attorneys in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic’s prosecutors’ office said on Aug. 14 that Franco was under investigation because of postings on his social media channels suggesting he had a relationship with a minor. The AP has not been able to verify the reported posts. Franco was placed on administrative leave by Major League Baseball in August under its the joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy with the players’ association. He was paid and received service time while on administrative leave.

The “Green Lantern” star wrapped up the year Saturday by paying homage to some of her “2023 highlights” on Instagram, which included a postpartum trip to Disneyland Paris. In a series of photos, Lively, 36, posed alongside the beloved rodent chef Remy from Disney’s 2007 “Ratatouille” film while dressed casually in a long-sleeve yellow T-shirt, Mickey Mouse ears and sneakers, with her handy-dandy breast pump on her hip. “Pumping at @disneylandparis,” she captioned her post, including an emoji of a glass of milk. “Cheers Remy.” In comments on the post, fans expressed appreciation for her openness about using a portable breast pump on the getaway. “Love seeing pumping normalized! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 get it mama! Happy new year!” one person commented. Another joked, “If you haven’t pumped while waiting in line at Disneyland what are you even doing?! 😂 Mine was an hour wait at Indiana Jones. Pumped 11oz.” “Thank you for pumping in public and helping to make a positive change for the next generation of pumping moms out there,” another wrote in a lengthy comment. “I’m hoping that by the time my daughters become moms they’ll live in a society where moms feel comfortable and empowered to take care of their babies wherever they are. The more people see women breastfeeding in public, the more normal it becomes, so thank you for being a part of that.” Another added, “Love normalizing pumping in public 👏❤️.” Lively tied the knot with Ryan Reynolds in 2012. Last February, the couple announced the birth of their fourth child but gave no details. They also share daughters James, 9, Inez, 7, and Betty, 4. In May 2022, Lively gushed about the positive effect motherhood has had on her self-image. “I think having children for me made me feel so much more in my skin,” she told Forbes at the time. “I never felt more myself or at ease in my own body or more confident — not to say that there aren’t a bevy of insecurities coming at me a million times a day, but I just feel incredibly settled.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

With admirers including Quincy Jones and Miles Davis, he went on tour worldwide and released dozens of albums, starting in 1960 with ""Les McCann Ltd. Plays the Truth.” He was best known for “Compared to What,” a funky protest song on which he first teamed up with his future musical partner, saxophonist Eddie Harris. Written by Eugene McDaniels and recorded live at the 1968 Monteaux Jazz Festival, “Compared to What” blended jazzy riffs and McCann's gospel-style vocals. The song condemned war, greed and injustice with such couplets as “Nobody gives us rhyme or reason/Have one doubt, they call it treason.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The rhetoric has garnered charges of ethnic cleansing and forced displacement, and a rare rebuke from U.S. officials. But there are no signs of the calls losing steam within Israel. “What needs to be done in the Gaza Strip is to encourage emigration,” Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Sunday. Referring to Gaza as a “ghetto,” he added: “If in Gaza there will be 100,000 or 200,000 Arabs and not 2 million, the entire conversation on ‘the day after’ will look different.” The following day, Smotrich referred to the Jewish settlement of the territory as “important” and said Palestinians should be encouraged to leave the Gaza Strip. The idea of expelling ― or encouraging the “voluntary” migration of ― Palestinians from Gaza, once a fringe view held by extremists like Meir Kahane, has become normalized in Israeli society since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that resulted in the deaths of some 1,200 Israelis and the abduction of 240 more, according to Israeli officials. National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said Monday that the current war presented an “opportunity to concentrate on encouraging the migration of the residents of Gaza.” Such a policy, he added, was “a correct, just, moral and humane solution.” And last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told one lawmaker who’d called for “voluntary immigration” from Gaza that he was working to facilitate that movement. “Our problem is [finding] countries that are willing to absorb Gazans, and we are working on it,” Netanyahu said. One unnamed senior source in Israel’s security cabinet (Smotrich and Ben Gvir are both members) told Zman Israel, The Times of Israel’s Hebrew sister site, “Congo will be willing to take in migrants, and we’re in talks with others.” Israeli military action has already forcibly displaced the vast majority of the population within Gaza, which itself consists mostly of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and their descendants. Throughout the recent bombardment and invasion of Gaza, Israel has repeatedly urged civilians to move further south within the territory ― only to strike those areas as well. Infrastructure in Gaza, from homes to bakeries to hospitals, has been devastated, and the territory faces widespread medical need and looming famine. “The bottom line is that, in Gaza, pretty much everybody is hungry at the moment,” Arif Husain, the chief economist at the United Nations World Food Program, told The New Yorker recently. Some in Israel ― including parliamentarian Ram Ben Barak, co-author of a Wall Street Journal opinion article calling for international “relocation programs” for tens of thousands of Gazans ― have stressed that their proposals would be voluntary. But Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, featuring what President Joe Biden last month called “indiscriminate bombing,” has left few safe options left for Gazans wishing to remain in the territory, which is about the size of Philadelphia. In that context, critics say, “voluntary” migration amounts to illegal forced displacement. “It’s so cynical to call it ‘voluntary migration,’” Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, told Democracy Now on Friday. She added: “It’s forced displacement. It’s a crime against humanity ... . It should be stopped. It’s shocking to see the silence of the international community in the face of these unfathomable ideas.” Also last week, Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met and “reiterated their complete rejection of all attempts to liquidate the Palestinian issue and forcibly displace Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,” according to Jordan News Agency. And on Wednesday, Josep Borrell Fontelles, the European Union’s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, condemned Ben Gvir and Smotrich’s comments, writing, “Forced displacements are strictly prohibited as a grave violation of [international humanitarian law] & words matter.” “It’s so cynical to call it ‘voluntary migration.' It’s forced displacement.” The Biden administration, Israel’s chief ally and weapons supplier, showed no signs of cutting off arms sales to Israel due to the “migration” rhetoric, even though the calls were at odds with U.S. priorities for the region. On Friday, the State Department announced that it had yet again circumvented Congress to sell Israel roughly $147.5 million worth of 155-millimeter artillery shells and related components. Still, U.S. officials did condemn the language: Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesperson, said Tuesday that the U.S. “rejects” the statements from Ben Gvir and Smotrich, calling the rhetoric “inflammatory and irresponsible.” Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, amplified that sentiment with a statement of her own. But the statements appeared weak to some observers. “I wonder which speaks louder,” former State Department lawyer Brian Finucane observed: “[The State Department] continuing to authorize US arms transfers to Israel, including the 155mm artillery shells approved via emergency procedures on Friday” or “issuing sternly worded statements.” Israeli politicians quickly answered the question. “I really admire the United States of America but with all due respect, we are not another star in the American flag,” Ben Gvir said, adding: “The emigration of hundreds of thousands from Gaza will allow residents [of the border area] to return home and live in security and protect [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers.” Smotrich, for his part, referenced a poll that he said indicated “more than 70% of the Israeli public today supports a humanitarian solution of encouraging the voluntary immigration of Gaza Arabs and their absorption in other countries.” Smotrich did not say where the figure came from, though at least one recent poll showed similar figures. (In 2016, Jewish Currents noted recently, a Pew poll found that almost half of Israeli Jews either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, “Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel.”) They’re not alone: Israel’s intelligence minister and several members of the Israeli Knesset have also called for the international community to take in Gazans via “voluntary” migration. Some Israeli politicians have also explicitly called for the re-establishment of Israeli settlements in Gaza, another idea that has gained steam since Oct. 7. (Israel withdrew its settlers from the Strip in 2005.) And one recent Jerusalem Post opinion piece, by an Israeli geographer, referred to Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula as “an ideal location to develop a spacious resettlement for the people of Gaza.” Gazan objections to such a plan, the geographer Joel Roskin argued, can be chalked up to “their desire to destroy Israel.” The next four years will change America forever.

You’ve got to be clear that you don’t want certain customers coming in.” Wilson, who is no longer with Lululemon, also criticized the company’s decision to include people in its advertising whom he deemed “sickly” and “unhealthy”-looking and “not inspirational,” according to Forbes. Wilson founded the apparel brand in 1998 and resigned as chairman in 2013, after making fatphobic remarks in response to a backlash the company received for the sheerness of some of the brand’s leggings. “Frankly, some women’s bodies just don’t actually work [for the yoga pants],” Wilson said on Bloomberg TV’s “Street Smart” program in November 2013, months after the company initially came under criticism for selling yoga pants that turned out to be see-through. “It’s more really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time, how much they use it.” In recent years, the company has tried to distance itself from Wilson’s infamous comments, introducing extended sizing in 2020. The retailer now says its core values include “personal responsibility, entrepreneurship, honesty, courage, connection, fun, and inclusion.” In 2020, the company created a team dedicated to the principles of inclusion, diversity, equity and action, or “IDEA.” However, some Lululemon employees have said the company lacks racial sensitivity. One former employee told Business Insider in 2021 that Lululemon remained an emblem of “privileged white wellness.” Wilson, a 68-year-old billionaire, still owns an 8% stake in Lululemon. He has made or been accused of making a number of controversial comments over the years — including blaming divorce rates on birth control pills and allegedly suggesting that child labor is acceptable. He has also repeatedly suggested that the “Lululemon” name was chosen with the Japanese market in mind. “A Japanese marketing firm would not try to create a North American sounding brand with the letter ‘L’ because the sound does not exist in Japanese phonetics,” Wilson wrote in a blog post for the company in 2009, Business Insider reported. “By including an ‘L’ in the name, it was thought the Japanese consumer would find the name innately North American and authentic.” The next four years will change America forever.

At the event, Haley said that the Civil War was about the government and “the freedoms of what people could and couldn’t do.” She later admitted to Fox News that “the first thing I should’ve said was slavery.” “It just shows you who she is,” Hostin said. “Maya Angelou said, ‘When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.’” But Hostin wasn’t done. She pointed out that “this isn’t the first time” the former South Carolina governor has been a “hypocrite” on race. “She said, ‘I, as a South Carolina governor, took down the Confederate flag,’” Hostin said. “Nikki Haley, you took down that flag because you were forced to.” Haley was praised by then-President Barack Obama in 2015 for calling and later succeeding in the removal of the Confederate flag from the South Carolina State House, The Washington Post reported. But she also did this after nine Black churchgoers were murdered in Charleston in 2015 by an avowed racist and had previously dismissed the issue of the flag, suggesting its presence wasn’t a big deal. Hostin noted on “The View” that she covered the shooting as a journalist, was in Charleston when the flag was taken down and was enraged by Haley’s speech at the time. “When she took it down, she said, ‘For many people in our state, the flag stands for traditions that are noble. Traditions of history, of heritage and of ancestry,’” Hostin said, pointing at the camera. “So you can kiss my grits when you try to say some nonsense about how you ‘should’ve said slavery, everybody knows slavery.’ She didn’t say it intentionally because 85% of Republicans are white and she does not want to lose those votes.” Haley’s remarks that the Confederate flag represent noble traditions and Southern heritage are nothing new. The Confederate flag is thought by some to be a tribute to the “Lost Cause” — or the belief that the Confederacy fought not to uphold slavery but to protect states’ rights and preserve a genteel way of life for white landowners. This reimagining of the cause of the war was created by white Southerns shortly after their 1865 defeat in the Civil War. It was an attempt to show the South’s role, and the deaths of thousands of Confederate soldiers, in a more positive light, according to National Geographic.

The Confederate flag, however, wasn’t a popular way to boast of Southern pride until “the 1940s and 1950s as part of a massive resistance campaign against the civil rights movement,” Matthew Guterl, a professor of Africana and American studies at Brown University, told The Washington Post in 2015. “It wouldn’t exist in our national popular culture without this moment,” Guterl said. “When African Americans fought for their equality … the battle flag was recovered and redeployed as a symbol of opposition to it.” He added: “What was once a very blatant, full-throated defense of white supremacy has now become this gesture to heritage and history that is presented as though it has nothing to do with the civil rights movement.

Greg Abbott to court again over his escalating response to border crossers arriving from Mexico. The lawsuit draws Texas into another clash over immigration at a time when New York and Chicago are pushing back on buses and planes carrying migrants sent by Abbott to Democrat-led cities nationwide. Texas is also fighting separate court battles to keep razor wire on the border and a floating barrier in the Rio Grande. But a law Abbott signed last month poses a broader and bigger challenge to the U.S. government’s authority over immigration. In addition to allowing police anywhere in Texas to arrest migrants on charges of illegal entry, local judges could also order migrants to leave the country. The law is set to take effect in March. The lawsuit was filed in Austin. Civil rights organizations and officials in El Paso County, Texas, filed a lawsuit last month that similarly described the new law as unconstitutional overreach. The Justice Department sent Abbott a letter last week threatening legal action unless Texas reversed course. In response, Abbott posted on X that the Biden administration “not only refuses to enforce current U.S. immigration laws, they now want to stop Texas from enforcing laws against illegal immigration.” On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson and about 60 fellow Republicans visited the Texas border city of Eagle Pass, which has been the center of Abbott’s $10 billion border initiative known as Operation Lone Star. Johnson suggested he could use a looming government funding deadline as further leverage for hard-line border policies. President Joe Biden has expressed willingness to make policy compromises because the number of migrants crossing the border is an increasing challenge for his 2024 reelection campaign. Johnson praised Abbott, who was not in Eagle Pass, and slammed the lawsuits that seek to undo Texas’ aggressive border measures. “It’s absolute insanity,” Johnson said. There are consequences for migrants who enter the U.S. unlawfully by crossing the border between ports of entry. You may be returned to your home country if it is quickly determined you are not eligible for asylum. pic.twitter.com/2BrS7gdPlJ Illegal crossings along the southern U.S. border topped 10,000 on several days in December, a number that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Troy Miller called “unprecedented.” U.S. authorities closed cargo rail crossings in Eagle Pass and El Paso for five days last month, calling it a response to a large number of migrants riding freight trains through Mexico to the border. Authorities this week also resumed full operations at a bridge in Eagle Pass and other crossings in San Diego and Arizona that had been temporarily closed. Legal experts and opponents say Texas’ new law is the most far-reaching attempt by a state to police immigration since a 2010 Arizona law that was partially struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. Under the Texas law, migrants could either agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Migrants who don’t leave could face arrest again under more serious felony charges. The next four years will change America forever.

The law can be enforced anywhere in Texas but some places are off-limits, including schools and churches. For more than two years, Texas has run a smaller-scale operation on the border to arrest migrants on misdemeanor charges of trespassing. Although that was also intended to stem illegal crossings, there is little indication that it has done so.

Later in the chat, Owens was asked if he considers himself to be “the catch” in his relationship with Biles, to which he replied: “I always say that the men are the catch.” Among those who came to Biles’ defense was “View” co-host Sunny Hostin, who expressed her dismay over Owens’ comments on Tuesday’s episode. “He knew who she was. She was on a Wheaties box,” Hostin said. “Everybody knows who Simone Biles is. I don’t know who he is.” Later, she added: “I have trouble with a man who can’t let his spouse or partner shine. That’s troubling to me ... you’re both shining. You’re thriving. You have each other.” Echoing those sentiments was Sara Haines, who zoomed in on Owens’ gender-specific observation. “The part that got me is when he says: ‘I always think the man is the catch,’” Haines said. “Have you met other men, and are you listening to yourself right now? I cannot believe.” Alyssa Farah Griffin, however, urged her co-hosts not to criticize Owens so harshly, given that he was attending college when his future wife catapulted to global fame in 2016. “If you watch them together, he treats her like a queen,” she noted. “He realized he did get the greatest of all time, and she’s amazing. I think he actually does treat her super well. I root for this one.” Biles and Owens went public with their romance in 2020, and got married in April of last year. Appearing on Peacock’s “Back That Year Up” last week, Biles didn’t address her husband’s comments directly but hinted that the two athletes have a competitive nature. “At the end of the day, gymnastics is harder, if he agrees or not,” she said. “He has done my workout in the gym, and he could barely do it, and then I went to their NFL workout and I crushed it.” Watch “The View” segment on Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens below.

Christina Block’s two kids, Klara, 13, and Theodor, 10, were with their father and Block’s ex-husband, Stephan Hensel, at a cafe in Gråsten, Denmark, on Monday around 12:15 a.m., according to Bild, a German tabloid newspaper. Danish police told the Telegraph a group of men attacked the father and knocked him to the ground before kidnapping the children in two separate cars. Both vehicles had German license plates. It is unclear whether they may have crossed the Danish border. Block’s children were still reported missing as of Tuesday, according to the outlet. German Federal Police and Schleswig-Holstein state police did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for an update on the children’s whereabouts. Authorities have not released a motive, however Danish police are currently investigating whether the kidnapping is connected to Block and Hensel’s ongoing custody battle, according to Metro. The couple has been involved in “an ugly custody battle” since their divorce in 2018. Block previously told the German tabloid that her former husband had “kidnapped” their two youngest children before in 2021, after they did not return home to Hamburg.

I miss the days when my kid pronounced it “skellington” like some kind of victorian urchin Even though my oldest daughter is now 20 I'm still a annoyed that someone at some point told her they're pronounced strawberries, not straw babies My toddler pronounces “twirling” like “squirreling” and no one better not ever correct her. #toddlerlife #toddlers #parenting 9 is a FAB reader.But yesterday he pronounced “prologue” as “proLUGE” & it reminded me of the words he mixed up as a toddler:McDonald’s was “making Donald’s”Yellow was “yeller”fruit snacks were “nemos” (my fave)I needed that throwback after another LONG homeschool day ❤️ Please don’t be offended when my 4yo introduces you to Percy, his toy parrot. He can’t pronounce his “r”s. My 2 yo pronounces Corn Flakes ""porn face"", which makes the sentence ""mommy is eating corn flakes"" less family friendly than it should be. 9: Daddy, I’m only going into 4th Grade, I don’t talk like William Shakespeare yet (pronounced as Shaq-is-pear) My 4yo pronounces peanut butter as ""peed-a-butter"" and that is now how that is pronounced from here on in, and I will not be taking questions on the matter.

A trailer for a new horror movie starring a knife-wielding Mickey Mouse dropped Monday — the same day the 1928 version of the Disney character featured in the short film “Steamboat Willie” entered the public domain. Titled “Mickey’s Mouse Trap,” the trailer features a “Steamboat Willie” version of the rodent playing a fatal game of cat and mouse with a group of young adults who have to Donald duck his blade. The film was shot, edited and directed by Jamie Bailey and written by Simon Phillips, who also assumes the role of the murderous mouse, Entertainment Weekly reported. Phillips also posted the trailer to his YouTube account. The upcoming movie isn’t just having fun at Disney’s expense. It seems to be lifting iconography from other beloved franchises as well. In the teaser, the killing spree is set in an amusement park arcade — a setting better suited for another well-known mouse, Chuck E. Cheese. The villain in this movie also wears a twisted-looking Mickey Mouse mask that vaguely resembles Ghostface’s in the “Scream” movies. If that seems like a stretch, a character in the trailer literally says: “Like, if he was in a horror movie, you’d never say, ‘I’ll be right back.’ Because then you don’t.” In the original 1996 “Scream” movie, a character says the line: “Never ever ever under any circumstances say ‘I’ll be right back’ because you won’t be back.” The idea to model a murderous Mickey after Ghostface may seem a bit lazy, but it makes sense if you want to slap together a trailer quickly enough to release it the same day the copyright on the “Steamboat Willie” film expired. Creators are only allowed to use “the more mischievous, rat-like, non-speaking boat captain” featured in “Steamboat Willie” in their work, according to copyright law, The Associated Press reported. So, modeling a murder-happy Mickey that’s not allowed to talk after the mostly silent Ghostface — who rarely speaks in person and usually makes his legendary quips over the phone — creates a nice loophole. “Mickey’s Mouse Trap” isn’t the only “Steamboat Willie” horror offering we’re going to get, either. A video game from Nightmare Forge, titled “Infestation 88,” also released a trailer Monday featuring a much more sinister Mickey. Director Steven LaMorte is set to work on an untitled horror-comedy based on “Steamboat Willie” that will start production in the spring, Variety reported. But this time the “sadistic mouse will torment a group of unsuspecting ferry passengers.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

(AP) — A New Jersey imam shot outside a Newark mosque on Wednesday succumbed to gunshot wounds, authorities said. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said that the imam’s loss will be felt across the state and city. He said the evidence doesn’t indicate a motive related to bias or terrorism. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — A New Jersey imam was critically wounded in a shooting outside a mosque on Wednesday. Officers sought to identify and arrest the shooter, and while the motive wasn’t clear, the governor promised to do what’s possible to protect houses of worship. The cleric was shot after 6 a.m. outside the Masjid-Muhammad-Newark Mosque, Newark Public Safety Director Fritz Fragé said in an emailed statement. The victim was taken to nearby University Hospital and is in critical condition, authorities said. Hours later, police had no one in custody. It's unclear what led to the violence and if the imam was targeted. Fragé said the shooting is under investigation and no other information is available. A message seeking more information was left with the mosque. Gov. Phil Murphy identified the victim as Imam Hassan Sharif. He noted that authorities have no information about who shot him, or why. “At a time when the Muslim community is concerned by an increase of bias incidents and crimes, I want to assure the Muslim community and people of all faiths that we will do everything in our power to keep all residents safe, especially in or near our houses of worship,” Murphy's statement said.

Holmes,kimberley richards,1/3/2024,"Amy Robach says that she fell “into like” with fellow TV journalist T.J. Holmes and there was nothing she could do about it. During an episode Tuesday of their iHeartMedia podcast, “Amy and T.J.,” the couple and former co-hosts of “GMA3: What You Need to Know” reflected on their relationship and their eventful past year. The two became the subjects of a media frenzy when news of their romantic relationship became public in November 2022, and now they’re dishing on how their romance came to be. Speaking about things that she’s learned in 2023, Robach said: “It’s better to fall into like and then walk into love.” “I chose love after falling into like,” she said about her feelings for Holmes. “I couldn’t help how much I liked you. I just always liked being around you.” Holmes and Robach were married to other people when the Daily Mail sparked a media frenzy on Nov. 30, 2022, by publishing photos of them having drinks together and staying at a cottage in upstate New York. A spokesperson for ABC announced in January 2023 that the two would be leaving the network after they were taken off the air the month before. The two had also appeared frequently on “Good Morning America.” They both have insisted in earlier episodes of their podcast that they were in the middle of divorcing their spouses when they were photographed out and about together. Robach reportedly separated from actor Andrew Shue in August 2022, and their divorce was finalized last March. Holmes filed for divorce from attorney Marilee Fiebig in December 2022 and reached a divorce settlement in October. Elsewhere in Tuesday’s episode of “Amy and T.J.,” the TV journalists shared a slew of lessons from 2023, with many of their revelations hinting at their past relationships and their very public romance scandal. “You don’t really know someone until you divorce them,” Robach said at one point in the episode. “In 2023, I learned that tabloid stories aren’t reported, they’re planted,” Holmes said at another point. On Sunday, Robach and Holmes shared a video montage recapping their past year together in a joint Instagram post on New Year’s Eve.

The NLRB officials allege in a complaint filed Wednesday that SpaceX interrogated workers about the letter and pressured them not to distribute it, according to board spokesperson Kayla Blado. The letter had directly criticized Musk’s behavior on social media. The complaint also claims the company “invited employees to quit” and threatened them with termination for exercising their rights, Blado said. SpaceX, which is based in Hawthorne, California, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is against the law for employers to retaliate against workers for exercising “protected concerted activity,” or banding together with other workers in hopes of improving their working conditions. Employers who violate the law can be ordered to offer reinstatement or other measures to make workers whole. Late last year an attorney filed charges with the labor board against SpaceX alleging the company had fired several workers for “speaking up against SpaceX’s failure and refusal to address the culture of sexism, harassment and discrimination that permeates the workplace.” Employees had written the open letter in 2022 and cited some of Musk’s tweets on his social media platform now known as X, according to the charges. The decision by the NLRB’s general counsel to pursue a case against SpaceX means investigators at the board looked into the allegations and found merit in them. Barring a settlement between the board and the company, the case would go to a hearing in which witnesses are called for both sides. The charges submitted to the labor board alleged that after firing five workers, SpaceX continued a “campaign of retaliation and intimidation,” including “coercive interrogations” that led to another three terminations. They also said that during interviews, management showed workers screenshots from private Signal chat groups, making them believe they were being watched. One of the fired workers told The New York Times in November that “it was hard for me to believe what was happening, it was so brazen.” The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/state-capitols-bomb-threats-secretary-of-state_n_6595a4ebe4b0bf73e17828ef,String Of State Capitols Evacuated In Response To Reports Of Bomb Threats,sanjana karanth,1/3/2024,"A growing number of states across the country are reporting that they have received bomb threats to their Capitols on Wednesday morning ― just days after the Maine secretary of state expressed concern about her safety. As of Wednesday afternoon, the states that have reported receiving bomb threats include Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi and Montana. The threats resulted in government buildings either proceeding with an evacuation or a lockdown as police searched the area, but local authorities so far have not found evidence of dangerous items. Gabriel Sterling, the operating officer for the Georgia secretary of state’s office, said earlier Wednesday that a bomb threat was delaying the state Capitol from opening. The Georgia Department of Public Safety said it determined the threat was not credible after conducting a sweep of the building. According to the department, the bomb threat response was triggered by a hoax email sent to a state employee. The state Capitol has since been given the all clear. In Kentucky, police asked everyone to evacuate the state Capitol after the secretary of state’s office received an email containing a bomb threat. KSP is investigating the threat, according to Gov. Andy Beshear (D), who added that everyone who was at the Capitol is safe. Officials said the threat was also sent to multiple secretary of state offices throughout the country, according to LEX18-TV. It’s unclear if all the state Capitols reporting threats on Wednesday specifically received the same email containing a bomb threat. “We are aware of similar threats made to other offices across the country,” Beshear posted on X. “We thank our first responders for their quick response, and we will provide more updates.” While everyone is safe, KSP has asked everyone to evacuate the state Capitol and is investigating a threat received by the Secretary of State’s Office. We are aware of similar threats made to other offices across the country. 1/2 In Michigan, an emergency announcement said that the state Capitol had been evacuated on Wednesday morning “due to safety and security concerns. According to The Detroit News, an email reportedly containing a bomb threat was sent to the Michigan State Capitol Commission’s general account. State troopers were still sweeping the Capitol as of Wednesday afternoon, the outlet reported, and officials will keep the building closed for the rest of the day. “This is not how I wanted to start 2024,” Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky tweeted. “I’m glad everyone is safe, but this violence is detrimental to our democracy.” The Mississippi State Capitol went on lockdown due to a bomb threat, according to Department of Public Safety spokesperson Bailey Martin. Martin said the investigation is ongoing, but police have since searched the area and did not find any dangerous items. Connecticut and Montana’s state Capitols also underwent evacuations in response to a bomb threat, however officials in both states have since reported that a police sweep of the buildings revealed no explosives. Across the state Capitol, local outlets reported that the Minnesota Supreme Court had to evacuate the building in the middle of oral arguments due to a threat. It’s unclear whether that threat has been resolved. In a statement to HuffPost, the FBI said it is “aware of the numerous hoax incidents wherein a bomb threat at a state Capitol building is made,and urges the public to “remain vigilant” and inform law enforcement of any suspicious activity. “The FBI takes hoax threats very seriously because it puts innocent people at risk,” the agency said. “While we have no information to indicate a specific and credible threat, we will continue to work with our local, state and federal law enforcement partners to gather, share and act upon threat information as it comes to our attention.” The threats come just days after Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows became the target of a swatting attempt, where someone makes a fake call to emergency services with the intent of bringing a large first responder presence, including SWAT teams, to another person’s residence. Bellows was not home at the time. Last week, Bellows came under the spotlight for deciding to remove Trump from the 2024 presidential ballot. The secretary of state believes that the swatting attempt stemmed from that decision because it occurred after a conservative activist posted her home address on social media. “And it was posted in anger and with violent intent by those who have been extending threatening communications toward me, my family and my office,” she told The Associated Press on Sunday.

From bending to lifting to pushing, shoveling snow is nothing short of a whole-body workout. And while we don’t have the answer to making snow removal completely effortless, there is a solid solution for making it a whole lot easier. In fact, there’s a Shovelution. With an ergonomic spring-loaded double handle, Snow Joe’s strain-reducing Shovelution shovel helps you clear walkways and stairs without all the hunching over (the brand says it can reduce up to 30% of back strain). The second handle acts as a fulcrum to let you “spring and fling” snow with ease and lift more without bending and toss it out of the way without over-extending. And right now, it’s on sale for even less than its Black Friday price. This 20-inch-wide shovel is currently $29.99 with an additional $6-off coupon you can apply before checkout, making it less than $24. It’s a lightweight shovel that reviewers say is great for older folks, people with mobility or back issues or anyone who just really despises shoveling. It even has an impact-resistant blade for tough jobs. “I was worried this would be a gimmick, but it isn’t,” one reviewer wrote, adding that because the shovel itself is lighter than other models, they didn’t think it would be durable, but the spring-assisted handle really made shoveling easy. In fact, multiple reviews call this shovel a game-changer. Whether you have a lot of space to clear or just need to shovel a short walkway, this ingenious two-handle shovel is here to save you from straining and stressing your muscles this winter. The brand even offers a two-year warranty. Read some of the thousands of reviews from Amazon, where the Shovelution has a 4.5-star rating from more than 25,000 users: “As the person that shovels the driveway, I can say this is a great shovel. Always used a tradition one, but having the added handle makes so much difference in moving/throwing the snow. Have used it once with an 8-inch wet snowfall. First time I finished shoveling snow & didn’t have a backache!” — b.horn “Wow, I should have bought this sooner! This is my 2nd winter living in a place where it snows. I was clueless last winter and bought a cheaper, more standard snow shovel. It took forever to clear snow and my back would be sore afterwards. That’s not the case with this snow shovel! As a short, disabled woman, I was able to use it to clear 8 inches of snow from this season’s first snowstorm quickly and easily with 0 back pain. Definitely recommend it.” — Annie H “Love the additional handle to help in lifting heavy wet snow. We had a lot of snow this past winter and this shovel met our needs. Cut threw the ice adequately although some areas were pretty packed due to our laziness. But all in all this is the best shovel we’ve had in years.” — CJ “Normally, I don’t give any product 5 stars, but this shovel is easily 5 stars! First, it is my lightest shovel. Second, it has a metal strip that not only makes the shovel stronger but makes it easier to scrape ice off the sidewalk. Then there is the flexible handle. I can push the snow, then easily scoop it up and flip it with NO back strain. I can do this standing straight up. I have a bad back and this shovel is very back friendly. An incredible and simple invention. I like it so much I was thinking of buying several of these and giving them to my neighbors as gifts. They are all using older shovels with no handles and they have to hunch over to move the snow.” — Amazon customer“I was a little worried when i unpacked the shovel and seen the secondary handle was made from flat flexible metal but ended up being my favorite part about the shovel. It being able to flex makes the shovel even easier to use as it just adjusts to your movements while tossing snow or going to shovel some up. The light weight of the shovel has me a little worried about how long it will last but the plus side to that is it is light weight and good for when you need to shovel heavy snow. I’ve had this for over a year with no signs of any failures or issues.” — Nicholas Raimondo",0.109508562,0.185476638

Ex-musician Theobald “Theo” Lengyel, 54, was arrested in connection to the homicide of Alice “Alix” Kamakaokalani Herrmann, authorities announced Tuesday, after the unidentified remains were discovered in a wooded area in Tinley Regional Park in Berkeley. Herrmann, a 61-year-old resident of Capitola, was last seen in nearby Santa Cruz on Dec. 3. She was reported missing by her relatives after she missed a flight to Hawaii on Dec. 12, the Capitola Police Department said in a Dec. 26 press release. In Wednesday’s court filing, the offense date is listed as Dec. 5. Hermann, a competitive paddler and member of the Santa Cruz Outrigger Canoe team, had participated in a morning paddling practice on Dec. 3, according to a Facebook post by the Northern California Outrigger Canoe Association. Authorities said Hermann’s SUV had been found parked in front of Lengyel’s house in El Cerrito, and that they had found evidence indicating that she was the victim of a homicide. Lengyel, also known as Mylo Stone, was a former saxophonist and a founding member of the experimental rock band Mr. Bungle. He had been named a primary person of interest early in the investigation and had not been cooperating with investigators, the El Cerrito Police Department said in a Dec. 18 statement. At the time, authorities asked residents who frequented “regional parks and open spaces” to “be on the lookout for anything suspicious” that could provide information related to Herrmann’s disappearance. Herrmann’s parents were folk musicians, and she had composed a “round” for a popular New Year’s song sung every year by the San Francisco Folk Music Club, a member of the club said on its Facebook page. Friends of Herrmann described her as a “sweet and trusting soul” and a “warm, loving human” with an adventurous spirit, noting that she traveled the world to compete in outrigger races. In a 2015 interview shared by Loudwire, former Mr. Bungle musician Trevor Dunn said the band had “unanimously decided to go on without [Lengyel] because he wasn’t growing with the rest of the band and we were running out of things for him to do. He got pissed off and I haven’t heard from him since.” The Capitola Police Department said formal identification of the remains is pending DNA confirmation. The Santa Cruz County Coroner’s Office told HuffPost the results are still pending. Lengyel is also charged with felony burglary and felony auto theft for unlawful taking or driving a vehicle.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-trump-presidential-immunity_n_65943b0fe4b0f27b6e356793,"Biden Could Kill Donald Trump And Not Be Prosecuted, Under Trump's Own Legal Theory",s.v. date,1/3/2024,"WASHINGTON ― President Joe Biden could, in theory, have Donald Trump abducted from his Mar-a-Lago home, spirited off to St. Helena in the faraway South Atlantic, and secretly kept there indefinitely, or even straight-up killed, without ever having to worry about criminal charges. Or so says Donald Trump’s logic. As part of his arguments against special counsel Jack Smith’s federal case against him for his actions leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, the former president continues to claim that commanders-in-chief can never be charged for anything they do as part of their official duties. It’s a view that has galvanized lawyers from across the political spectrum to urge federal appellate judges to reject Trump’s claims. “It would turn the office of the presidency into the office of state-approved lawlessness,” said Glenn Kirschner, a federal prosecutor for more than two decades in Washington, D.C. Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House lawyer and one of the signatories to an amicus brief in the case, said Trump’s argument that he should be immune from any prosecution is “no more ridiculous” than the Biden hypothetical. He said Trump’s lawyers have not been able to come up with any sound legal arguments on his behalf because there aren’t any. “There is no legal support. That’s the reality,” he said. “It’s the same as he’s been saying for years: He could kill someone on 5th Avenue.” Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago, said that as outlandish as the Biden example sounds, if Trump’s view of presidential immunity is correct, Biden could get away with it ― “as long as he could assert some sort of national security rationale for doing so.” Neither Trump’s campaign staff nor his lawyers responded to HuffPost’s queries. But his lawyers have repeatedly argued that everything Trump did leading up to and during the assault on the Capitol by a mob of his followers was part of his “official” duties as president, and therefore cannot be punished via the criminal justice system. In defending Trump’s action, his lawyers in a Tuesday night filing repeated Trump’s claims that he was looking into voter fraud, although the only real allegation of “fraud” was coming from Trump himself with virtually no evidence. “President Trump was carrying out his duties as chief executive to investigate the overwhelming reports of widespread election fraud,” wrote lawyers John Sauer, John Lauro and Todd Blanche, who then cited one of Trump’s own social media posts as proof. Smith, who is prosecuting Trump on a range of charges including conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding based on the Jan. 6 coup attempt, said in another filing that if Trump’s analysis is correct, it would legalize a parade of tyrannical behavior. “The defendant’s sweeping immunity claim threatens to license presidents to commit crimes to remain in office. The founders did not intend and would never have countenanced such a result,” Smith wrote in an 82-page brief filed over the New Year’s weekend. He then went on to present scenarios even more extreme than the hypothetical of Biden shipping Trump off to the island where Napoleon was ultimately exiled, should Trump’s immunity claim be accepted by the courts. “That approach would grant immunity from criminal prosecution to a president who accepts a bribe in exchange for directing a lucrative government contract to the payer; a president who instructs the FBI director to plant incriminating evidence on a political enemy; a president who orders the National Guard to murder his most prominent critics; or a president who sells nuclear secrets to a foreign adversary, because in each of these scenarios, the president could assert that he was simply executing the laws; or communicating with the Department of Justice; or discharging his powers as commander-in-chief; or engaging in foreign diplomacy,” Smith wrote. “Under the defendant’s framework, the nation would have no recourse to deter a president from inciting his supporters during a State of the Union address to kill opposing lawmakers ― thereby hamstringing any impeachment proceeding ― to ensure that he remains in office unlawfully,” he went on. A White House spokesperson, citing its continuing policy, declined to discuss Trump’s legal case but said that Biden had worked to restore the Department of Justice’s independence. Norm Eisen, a White House lawyer during the Obama administration who worked on the House of Representatives’ legal team during the first Trump impeachment, said Trump’s immunity theory would undo the founders’ goal of avoiding an unaccountable monarchy. “Trump’s argument actually turns the American idea on its head,” Eisen said. “Election to the presidency would become an authorization to go on a non-stop crime spree as long as a president could claim that his actions, however tangentially, were related to his official duties. This can’t be right.” Trump’s claim of “absolute immunity” has already been rejected by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the case. Smith asked the U.S. Supreme Court to step in and settle the question immediately, skipping review by the appellate level court, but the high court declined to do so. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has fast-tracked the case and could rule relatively soon after next week’s oral arguments. If it upholds Chutkan’s December ruling, Trump would have the right to appeal that to the Supreme Court, although that court may choose not to take it. Chutkan had planned to start Trump’s trial on the four-count indictment in early March, a date that may not be possible given the months likely to be lost in the current appeal. Trump is separately under federal indictment in South Florida for refusing to turn over secret documents he took with him to his Palm Beach country club when he left the White House. He also faces an indictment in Georgia state court based on his attempt to overturn the state’s 2020 election results, and another indictment in New York state for falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to a porn star.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/steve-king-vivek-ramaswamy-endorsement_n_65959488e4b0912833aeb3da,Vivek Ramaswamy Touts Endorsement Of White Supremacist Former Rep. Steve King,christopher mathias,1/3/2024,"Steve King, the white supremacist former congressman from Iowa, endorsed longshot candidate Vivek Ramaswamy in the state’s Republican presidential primary on Tuesday. “Vivek Ramaswamy is going to shock the world at the Iowa caucus because he is the only candidate in this race who’s had the courage to oppose the CO2 pipelines here in Iowa, to publicly oppose the climate change cult, to commit to pardon peaceful Jan 6 protestors on day 1, and to end birthright citizenship for kids of illegals in this country,” King said in a statement obtained by Politico. The Ramaswamy campaign also produced a video of King making the endorsement, in which he calls Ramaswamy the candidate who will “restore the pillars of American exceptionalism.” King, a Republican, spent 18 years in Congress as a representative for the conservative northwest corner of Iowa, earning a reputation as one of the furthest-right and most racist legislators in Washington. He lost his 2020 primary race to a relatively more moderate Republican, Rep. Randy Feenstra, after a series of remarks he made condoning white supremacy. Since he left office, King has openly embraced well-known white supremacists, even speaking at the 2022 American Renaissance conference in Tennessee, the annual gathering that has attracted some of America’s most notorious racists and anti-Semites, including Nick Fuentes and Richard Spencer. On Tuesday, Ramaswamy responded to King’s endorsement on X, formerly Twitter, saying: Most people are sheep when it comes to making endorsements, but @SteveKingIA doesn’t do what he’s “supposed to.” He votes his conscience and that’s why I respect him. Steve King was America First before it was cool. The likes of Steve King & Pat Buchanan were the OGs. He doesn’t back down from a fight and he certainly doesn’t bow to the Establishment. Grateful for his endorsement. Next up #shocktheworld on Jan. 15. Ramaswamy, a former biotech entrepreneur, has repeatedly embraced fringe far-right figures and positions during his campaign. He has touted the work of Richard Hanania, a racist far-right writer exposed by HuffPost as “Richard Hoste,” the pseudonymous author of dozens of articles on white supremacist website. Some of the articles Hanania wrote under the pen name advocated for the forced sterilization and ethnic cleansing of non-white people. Ramaswamy provided a blurb for Hanania’s book, “The Origin of Woke,” published by HarperCollins in September, calling him “unafraid to transcend the Overton Window on issues of race and gender” and saying that his book amounted to “a devastating kill shot to the intellectual foundations of identity politics in America.” And as noted by Politico, Ramaswamy has called the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol an “inside job” and even used a televised debate appearance in December to push the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, which maintains that Democrats are importing immigrants into the U.S. to replace white voters. Ramasamy called the Great Replacement — which has motivated multiple white supremacist mass shootings — “not some grand right-wing conspiracy theory, but a basic statement of the Democratic Party’s platform.” King’s endorsement was once highly sought after in Iowa, with Republican presidential hopefuls courting the congressman every couple years. But King’s political capital slowly depleted after a series of reports detailed his extensive history of racist comments and deep ties to white supremacists at home and abroad. In 2018, HuffPost reported that King had traveled to Austria, where he did an interview with a far-right publication in which he promoted the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. He also made headlines for repeatedly promoting neo-Nazis on Twitter and for endorsing a white supremacist candidate for mayor of Toronto. “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King told The New York Times in a 2019 interview about immigration. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?” The next four years will change America forever.

A federal judge on Thursday ordered former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis to fork over the six-digit figure, which is in addition to a $100,000 award that a jury ordered her to pay to the couple in September. This new award, issued by U.S. District Judge Daniel Bunning, will cover $246,026.40 in attorneys’ fees and $14,058.30 in expenses that David Ermold and David Moore reported racking up in their lawsuit against Davis. Bunning said he reviewed the attorneys’ detailed time records and considered rates of inflation before approving the award. “Given the nature of this case and its lengthy procedural history, the Court finds the hours expended to be reasonable,” he wrote in his opinion. Liberty Counsel, a conservative Christian organization that represented Davis, said it will appeal the September verdict against her up to the U.S. Supreme Court following this latest ruling. That court previously declined to hear an appeal from Davis’ lawyers in the case in 2020. “…Davis is not liable for any damages because she was entitled to a religious accommodation from issuing marriage licenses under her name and authority that conflicted with her religious beliefs,” Liberty Counsel said in a statement Tuesday. The judge’s ruling follows Davis denying the couple a marriage license in 2015 under her personal belief that marriage is only legitimate between a man and a woman. Issuing a license to a same-sex couple as county clerk — whose responsibilities include issuing such licenses ― would violate her beliefs and rights, she argued. Her refusal, however, violated the couple’s constitutional rights, Bunning ruled in 2022. Davis “cannot use her own constitutional rights as a shield to violate the constitutional rights of others while performing her duties as an elected official,” he argued.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-us-harvard-president-plagiarism-claudine-gay_n_6595960ae4b0bf73e17820de,Plagiarism Charges Downed Harvard’s President. A Conservative Attack Helped To Fan The Outrage,"collin binkley , moriah balingit",1/3/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — American higher education has long viewed plagiarism as among the most serious of offenses. Accusations of plagiarism have ruined the careers of academics and undergraduates alike. The latest target is Harvard President Claudine Gay, who resigned Tuesday. Reviews by Harvard found multiple shortcomings in Gay’s academic citations, including several instances of “duplicative language.” While the university concluded the errors “were not considered intentional or reckless” and didn’t rise to misconduct, the allegations continued, with new ones as recently as Monday. Many came not from her academic peers but her political foes, led by conservatives who sought to oust Gay and put her career under intense scrutiny in hopes of finding a fatal flaw. Her detractors charged that Gay — who has a Ph.D. in government, was a professor at Harvard and Stanford and headed Harvard’s largest division before being promoted — got the top job in large part because she is a Black woman. The focus on Gay came amid backlash over her congressional testimony about antisemitism on campus. Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist who helped orchestrate the effort against Gay, celebrated her departure as a win in his campaign against elite institutions of higher education. On X, formerly Twitter, he wrote “SCALPED,” as if Gay was a trophy of violence, invoking a gruesome practice taken up by white colonists who sought to eradicate Native Americans and also used by some tribes against their enemies. “Tomorrow, we get back to the fight,” he said on X, describing a “playbook” against institutions deemed too liberal by conservatives. His latest target: efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in education and business. “We must not stop until we have abolished DEI ideology from every institution in America,” he said. In another post, he announced a new “plagiarism hunting fund,” vowing to “expose the rot in the Ivy League and restore truth, rather than racialist ideology, as the highest principle in academic life.” Gay didn’t directly address the plagiarism accusations in a campus letter announcing her resignation, but she noted she was troubled to see doubt cast on her commitment “to upholding scholarly rigor.” She also indirectly nodded to the December congressional hearing that started the onslaught of criticism, where she did not say unequivocally that calls for the genocide of Jews would violate Harvard policy. Her departure comes just six months after becoming Harvard’s first Black president. As the figureheads of their universities, presidents often face heightened scrutiny, and numerous leaders have been felled by plagiarism scandals. Stanford University’s president resigned last year amid findings that he manipulated scientific data in his research. A president of the University of South Carolina resigned in 2021 after he lifted parts of his speech at a graduation ceremony. In Gay’s case, many academics were troubled with how the plagiarism came to light: as part of a coordinated campaign to discredit Gay and force her from office, in part because of her involvement in efforts for racial justice on campus. Her resignation came after calls for her ouster from prominent conservatives including Rep. Elise Stefanik, a Harvard alumna, and Bill Ackman, a billionaire hedge fund manager who has donated millions to Harvard. The campaign against Gay and other Ivy League presidents has become part of a broader right-wing effort to remake higher education, which has often been seen as a bastion of liberalism. Republican detractors have sought to gut funding for public universities, roll back tenure and banish initiatives that make colleges more welcoming to students of color, disabled students and the LGBTQ+ community. They also have aimed to limit how race and gender are discussed in classrooms. Walter M. Kimbrough, the former president of the historically Black Dillard University, said what unfolded at Harvard reminded him of an adage from his mother, a Black graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1950s. As a Black person in academia, “you always have to be twice, three times as good,” he said. “There are going to be people, particularly if they have any inkling that the person of color is not the most qualified, who will label them a ‘DEI hire,’ like they tried to label her,"" Kimbrough said. “If you want to lead an institution like (Harvard) … there are going to be people who are looking to disqualify you.” The allegations against Gay initially came from conservative activists, some who stayed anonymous, who looked for the kinds of duplicated sentences undergraduate students are trained to avoid, even with citation. In dozens of instances first published by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, Gay’s work includes long stretches of prose that mirror language from other published works. A review ordered by Harvard acknowledged she duplicated the language without using quotation marks. Harvard previously said Gay updated her dissertation and requested corrections from journals. Among her critics in conservative circles and academia, the findings are clear evidence that Gay, as the top academic at the pinnacle of U.S. higher education, is unfit to serve. Her defenders say it isn’t so clear-cut. In highly specialized fields, scholars often use similar language to describe the same concepts, said Davarian Baldwin, a historian at Trinity College who writes about race and higher education. Gay clearly made mistakes, he said, but with the spread of software designed to detect plagiarism, it wouldn’t be hard to find similar overlap in works by other presidents and professors. The tool becomes dangerous, he added, when it “falls into the hands of those who argue that academia in general is a cesspool of incompetence and bad actors.” John Pelissero, a former interim college president who now works for the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, said instances of plagiarism deserve to be evaluated individually and that it’s not always so cut and dried. “You’re looking for whether there was intentionality to mislead or inappropriately borrow other people’s ideas in your work,” Pelissero said. “Or was there an honest mistake?” Without commenting on the merits of the allegations against Gay, President Irene Mulvey of the American Association of University Professors said she fears plagiarism investigations could be “weaponized” to pursue a political agenda. “There is a right-wing political attack on higher education right now, which feels like an existential threat to the academic freedom that has made American higher education the envy of the world,” Mulvey said. She worries Gay’s departure will put a new strain on college presidents. In addition to their work courting donors, policymakers and alumni, presidents are supposed to protect faculty from interference so they can research unimpeded. “For presidents to be taken down like this, it does not bode well for academic freedom,” she said. “I think it’ll chill the climate for academic freedom. And it may make university presidents less likely to speak out against this inappropriate interference for fear of losing their jobs or being targeted.” ____ Balingit reported from Sacramento. ____ The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The suit, obtained Tuesday by multiple media outlets, was filed at the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles by two women identified only as Jane Does. The women accused Lythgoe of sexual assault/battery, sexual harassment, negligence, gender violence and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiffs were reportedly contestants on “All American Girl,” a single-season ABC reality show from 2003 that Lythgoe produced. The lawsuit notes that filming for the show occurred in Los Angeles between January and May 2003, during which time Lythgoe ― reportedly referred in the filing as “John Roe N.L.” ― allegedly made unwanted “sexual advances” after a wrap party. The plaintiffs say Lythgoe took an “unusual interest” in one of them and “insisted” that she “ride in his car to go back to the studio where everyone else was going” for an afterparty. The other woman allegedly followed “to ensure her colleague was not left alone.” The former “Idol” producer allegedly took the women to his home and pulled his sweater over one of the women’s heads, “attempting to kiss her and pushing her body close to his.” He allegedly pinned the other woman against a grand piano when his first advance was rejected. Lythgoe is alleged to have “pushed himself against [the second woman’s] body, and forced his mouth and tongue onto her despite her numerous statements telling him not to and attempts to pull her face away from his.” Lythgoe also allegedly groped the women on the set of the show. Representatives for Lythgoe did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Abdul, who was one of the original “Idol” judges from 2002 to 2009, claimed in her own lawsuit last week that Lythgoe sexually assaulted her during the show’s early seasons and once more during her 2013-2016 tenure on “Dance.” Lythgoe denied her claims. “To say that I am shocked and saddened by the allegations made against me by Paula Abdul is a wild understatement,” he said in a statement. “For more than two decades, Paula and I have interacted as dear — and entirely platonic — friends and colleagues.” “While Paula’s history of erratic behavior is well known, I can’t pretend to understand exactly why she would file a lawsuit that she must know is untrue,” Lythgoe went on. “But I can promise that I will fight this appalling smear with everything I have.” Abdul sued prior to Sunday’s expiration of the Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act, which permits civil suits on claims that would otherwise be dismissed due to the statute of limitations. However, Tuesday’s plaintiffs filed suit after the expiration of the Accountability Act, which means they may have waited too long under California’s standard 10-year statute of limitations.

The Rage Against the Machine guitarist responded Tuesday on social media to a segment that saw pundits decry Green Day’s performance on New Year’s Eve after the “American Idiot” band changed their lyrics to slam former President Donald Trump’s “MAGA agenda.” The original 2004 song famously had frontman Billie Joe Armstrong slam the “redneck agenda” of former President George W. Bush and his invasion of Iraq. Fox Business pundit Cheryl Casone appeared not to mind the track — until it was changed to diss Trump. “The original song was actually a post-9/11 song because the band at the time was upset about what was happening overseas in the Iraq War and all that,” she said. “It’s probably their biggest hit, but now, to change it, to continue to make it political, you’re just alienating people.” Morello responded to the clip on Twitter, formerly X, with 3 simple words: “Is that so?” That sentiment was echoed by countless users who not only found the pearl-clutching on Fox hilarious, but utterly hypocritical. The conservative network has, after all, previously platformed right-wing artists like Ted Nugent and Kid Rock for their own hateful rhetoric. “This same network gets analysis from Fabio and Paulie D,” wrote one user on X. “The song was already (very unambiguously) about how much a republican and his supporters suck, I feel like I’m taking crazy pills,” wrote another about the “American Idiot” track. “Did they think it was a song about a random idiot going on adventures?” Is that so? https://t.co/S41zMFqpGn Others were confused by another Fox Business pundit arguing that Armstrong is no longer “raging against the machine,” when Green Day is a separate band entirely. That ignorance was presumably spurred by an X post from Elon Musk, who owns the social media platform. “Green Day goes from raging against the machine to milquetoastedly raging for it,” he wrote Monday. Morello, who graduated from Harvard University with a political science major, has been a lifelong activist — who performed at Occupy Wall Street events in the U.S. and Europe and co-founded the Axis of Justice nonprofit organization in his spare time. Rage Against the Machine has consistently shared their political views in song lyrics and performances. During their 2022 tour, the band displayed the message “Abort the Supreme Court” following the fall of Roe v. Wade and pledged to donate to reproductive rights organizations. Other users joined Morello in criticizing the pundits for appearing more concerned with song lyrics instead of actual issues affecting Americans. Nobody wants to hear from musicians. For more, turn to Ted Nugent. pic.twitter.com/mN3ZKlhaCP ""Don't listen to Tom Morello who has a political science degree from Harvard, instead listen to DJ Pauly D from the Jersey shore & Wrestler Tyrus."" - Fox News probably pic.twitter.com/UK4ubpTYpd Conservatives really aren't very big fans of free speech. Isn't Kid Rock a staple on Fox? pic.twitter.com/xabLXGtNrc I’ll just drop this right here pic.twitter.com/ccvHe385q1 This same network literally spent six months raging against Bud Light because Kid Rock shot up some cases of beer. https://t.co/cNuVifGHUq We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday repeated his criticism of the Israeli government’s military approach in Gaza, calling on his fellow lawmakers to reject the Biden administration’s request for billions in military aid for Israel. The Biden administration has asked Congress to approve an additional support package for U.S. allies, including Israel, which Sanders described as “unconditional military aid” for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to continue with their brutal war. “Enough is enough,” Sanders said in a statement. “Congress must reject that funding. The taxpayers of the United States must no longer be complicit in destroying the lives of innocent men, women, and children in Gaza.” The war has so far killed over 22,300 people in Gaza, according to local officials, and displaced 85% of the territory’s population. Sanders said the issue at hand “is not complicated,” noting that while Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and nearly 240 were taken hostage initiated the current conflict, Israel’s war has led to “catastrophic” results on the ground for Palestinians. “While we recognize that Hamas’ barbaric terrorist attack began this war, we must also recognize that Israel’s military response has been grossly disproportionate, immoral, and in violation of international law,” Sanders said. He added that is important for Americans to keep in mind that Israel is fighting mostly “with U.S. bombs, artillery shells, and other forms of weaponry.” Last month, Sanders wrote a letter to President Joe Biden, saying it would be inappropriate to provide funding for Israel beyond what’s needed for “defensive systems that will protect Israeli civilians against incoming missile and rockets attacks.” He also urged Biden to support U.N. efforts to stop the suffering on the ground. The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution to provide more aid for Gazans on Dec. 22 amid U.S. resistance that led to the weakening of the proposal. The U.S. abstained from the vote. The U.S. had previously vetoed a resolution calling for a humanitarian cease-fire in the besieged territory. Sanders has also introduced a resolution to investigate Israel’s indiscriminate bombing in Gaza. Meanwhile, as the fighting continues, Israel is thought to be behind a blast in Beirut that killed Saleh Arouri, a top Hamas political leader Tuesday, prompting fears that the conflict could spread across the region. Israel has not commented on the strike. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/russia-accidentally-bombs-village-ukraine-border_n_65955356e4b0bf73e177efaf,Russia Accidentally Bombs A Russian Village Near Ukraine Border,kate nicholson,1/3/2024,"Russian troops appear to have unintentionally dropped a bomb on a Russian village near the Ukrainian border, according to reports. In a statement shared by the state media TASS, Russia’s Defense Ministry said: “At around 9 a.m. on January 2, while an Air Force plane was flying over the village of Petropavlovka in the Voronezh Region, there was an emergency release of aviation munitions.” Voronezh borders the Ukrainian region of Kharkiv, an area Moscow illegally annexed and claimed as part of Russia in September 2022, although it continues to be a battleground. Petropavlovka itself is less than 150 km (93.2 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The statement said that no one was killed or injured, but at least six privately owned buildings were impacted. It added: “An investigation is underway into the circumstances of the incident. “A commission is working on-site to assess the nature of the damage and assist in the restoration of buildings.” Social media showed a large crater in the village, with multiple buildings destroyed. The local governor, Aleksander Gusev, said: “I tasked my colleagues in the Voronezh region government to swiftly address issues concerning compensation payments and the construction of new housing. “Our commitment is to ensure no one is overlooked.” Gusev has said the authorities will assess the damage done and pay out compensation. According to the Kyiv Post, local residents complained an entire street had been destroyed. The incident came as Russia has been attacking Ukraine with renewed intensity recently. One Ukrainian MP said the last few days could be the “biggest attack” on Kyiv since the war began in February 2022. This barrage came after the Russian city of Belgorod was targeted by Ukraine, a move Moscow has described as a “terrorist attack.” The Russian forces also accidentally bombed Belgorod, which is around 40km (about 25 miles) from the Ukraine border, in April last year. In a statement released at the time, the Russian defense ministry admitted one of its warplanes had “accidentally discharged aircraft ordnance” — meaning it had mistakenly dropped a weapon. No one was killed in the incident, according to officials. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-ml-iran_n_659555b7e4b0f27b6e35e54d,"Iran Says At Least 95 People Killed, 211 Wounded In Blasts At Ceremony Honoring Slain General",jon gambrell,1/3/2024,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two bombs exploded and killed at least 95 people Wednesday at a commemoration for a prominent Iranian general slain by the U.S. in a 2020 drone strike, Iranian officials said, as the Middle East remains on edge over Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. No one immediately claimed responsibility for what appeared to be the deadliest militant attack to target Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran’s leaders vowed to punish those responsible for the blasts, which wounded at least 211 people. The blasts were minutes apart and shook the city of Kerman, about 820 kilometers (510 miles) southeast of the capital, Tehran. The second blast sprayed shrapnel into a screaming crowd fleeing the first explosion. An earlier death toll of 103 was revised lower after officials realized that some names had been repeated on a list of victims, Iran’s health minister, Bahram Einollahi, told state TV. Many of the wounded were in critical condition, however, so the death toll could rise. The gathering marked the fourth anniversary of the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guard’s elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq. The explosions occurred near his grave site as long lines of people gathered for the event. Iranian state television and officials described the attacks as bombings, without immediately giving clear details of what happened. The attacks came a day after a deputy head of the Palestinian militant group Hamas was killed in a suspected Israeli strike in Beirut. The first bomb Wednesday was detonated around 3 p.m., and the other went off some 20 minutes later, the Iranian interior minister, Ahmad Vahidi, told state television. He said the second blast killed and wounded the most people. Images and video shared on social media appeared to correspond with the accounts of officials, who said the first blast happened about 700 meters (765 yards) from Soleimani’s grave in the Kerman Martyrs Cemetery near a parking lot. The crowd then rushed west along Shohada Street, where the second blast struck about 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) from the grave. A delayed second explosion is often used by militants to inflict more casualties by targeting emergency personnel responding to an attack. Iranian state TV and state-run IRNA news agency quoted emergency officials for the casualty figures. Authorities said Thursday would be a national day of mourning. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the attackers will face “a harsh response,” though he didn’t name any possible suspect. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi added: “Undoubtedly, the perpetrators and leaders of this cowardly act will soon be identified and punished.” Iran has multiple foes who could be behind the assault, including exile groups, militant organizations and state actors. While Israel has carried out attacks in Iran over its nuclear program, it has conducted targeted assassinations, not mass casualty bombings. A U.S. State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, said American officials had “no reason” to believe Israel was involved in Wednesday’s attack in Iran. Sunni extremist groups including the Islamic State group have conducted large-scale attacks in the past that killed civilians in Shiite-majority Iran, though not in relatively peaceful Kerman. Iran also has seen mass protests in recent years, including those over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in 2022. The country also has been targeted by exile groups in attacks dating back to the turmoil surrounding its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran itself has been arming militant groups over the decades, including Hamas, the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels. As Israel wages its devastating war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks that killed 1,200 people, both Hezbollah and the Houthis have launched attacks targeting Israel that they say come on behalf of the Palestinians. Israel is suspected of launching the attack Tuesday that killed a deputy head of Hamas in Beirut, but that attack caused limited casualties in a densely populated neighborhood of the Lebanese capital. Last week, a suspected Israeli strike killed a Revolutionary Guard commander in Syria. A Houthi spokesman, Mohammed Abdel-Salam, sought to link the bombings to Iran’s “support for the resistance forces in Palestine and Lebanon,” though he did not specifically blame anyone for the attack. In Beirut, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah called the people who died in the attacks “martyrs who died on the same road, cause and battle that was led by” Soleimani. The government of neighboring Iraq expressed condolences to the victims, and the European Union issued a statement offering “its solidarity with the Iranian people.” Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s regional military activities and is hailed as a national icon among supporters of Iran’s theocracy. He also helped secure Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government after the 2011 Arab Spring protests against him turned into a civil, and later a regional, war that still rages today. Soleimani had been relatively unknown in Iran until the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. His popularity and mystique grew after American officials called for his killing over his help in arming militants with penetrating roadside bombs that killed and maimed U.S. troops. A decade and a half later, Soleimani had become Iran’s most recognizable battlefield commander. He ignored calls to enter politics but grew as powerful, if not more so, than its civilian leadership. Ultimately, a drone strike launched by the Trump administration killed the general, part of escalating incidents that followed America’s 2018 unilateral withdrawal from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Soleimani’s death has drawn large processions in the past. At his funeral in 2020, a stampede broke out in Kerman and at least 56 people were killed and more than 200 were injured as thousands thronged the procession. Until Wednesday, the deadliest attack to strike Iran since the revolution was the 1981 truck bombing of the Islamic Republican Party’s headquarters in Tehran. That attack killed at least 72 people, including the party’s leader, four government ministers, eight deputy ministers and 23 parliament members. In 1978 just ahead of the revolution, an intentionally set fire at the Cinema Rex in Abadan killed hundreds of people. ___ Associated Press writers Amir Vahdat and Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran; Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey; Bassem Mroue in Beirut; and Jack Jeffery and Emma Burrows in London contributed to this report.

The accident occurred Tuesday evening when the Japan Airlines flight 516 plane landed on one of Haneda’s four runways after the coast guard aircraft — a Bombardier Dash-8 — had also entered, preparing to take off. An orange fireball erupted from both aircraft as the JAL plane continued down the runway covered in flames while spewing gray smoke. Within 20 minutes, all 379 passengers and crew members slid down emergency chutes and survived. The pilot of the coast guard plane, which exploded, evacuated with injuries but five crew members were killed. The Transport Ministry released a transcript of air traffic control communication of about 4 minutes and 27 seconds just before the crash. It showed no clear takeoff approval for the coast guard plane. According to the text, the Tokyo air control gave the JAL Airbus A350 permission to land on Runway C, noting that there is a departing plane, with the JAL pilot repeating the action. The coast guard plane said it was taxiing to the same runway, and the traffic control instructs it to proceed to the stop line ahead of the runway. The controller noted the coast guard gets the departure priority, and the pilot said he was moving to the stop line. Their communication ends there. Two minutes later, there was a three-second pause, apparently indicating the time of the collision. Police began a separate probe into possible professional negligence. Tokyo police said that investigators examined the debris on the runway and were conducting interviews. The JAL plane had flown from Shin Chitose airport near the northern city of Sapporo, and the coast guard Bombardier was preparing to depart for Niigata to deliver relief supplies to the central regions hit by powerful earthquakes on Monday that killed more than 60 people. On Wednesday, six experts from the Japan Transport Safety Board examined what remained of the aircraft, the board said. TV footage showed the severely damaged A350′s wings among the charred, broken parts of fuselage. The smaller coast guard plane resembled a mound of rubble. Investigators plan to interview the pilots, officials as well as air traffic control officials to find out how the two planes simultaneously ended up on the runway, JTSB said. The two sides had different understandings of their permission to use the runway. JAL Managing Executive Officer Tadayuki Tsutsumi told a news conference late Tuesday that the A350 was making a “normal entry and landing” on the runway. Another JAL executive, Noriyuki Aoki, said the flight had received permission to land. Air traffic officials gave the JAL airliner permission to land while telling the coast guard pilot to wait before entering the runway, the Transport Ministry transcript showed. But according to an NHK television report, the coast guard pilot said he was given permission to take off. The coast guard said officials were verifying that claim. All passengers and crew members left their baggage and slid down the escape chutes within 20 minutes of the landing as smoke filled the cabin of the burning aircraft — an outcome praised by aviation experts. Videos posted by passengers showed people covering their mouths with handkerchiefs as they ducked down and moved toward the exits. Some passengers told news media they felt safe only after reaching a grassy area beyond the tarmac. “The entire cabin was filled with smoke within a few minutes. We threw ourselves down on the floor. Then the emergency doors were opened and we threw ourselves at them,” Swedish passenger Anton Deibe, 17, told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet. “The smoke in the cabin stung like hell.” The fire is likely to be seen as a key test case for airplane fuselages made from carbon-composite fibers — featured on the A350 and the Boeing 787 — instead of conventional aluminum skins. “This is the most catastrophic composite-airplane fire that I can think of. On the other hand, that fuselage protected (passengers) from a really horrific fire — it did not burn through for some period of time and let everybody get out,” safety consultant John Cox said. Haneda’s three other runways reopened late Tuesday, but about 140 flights had been canceled Wednesday alone due to the closure of the runway, transport officials said. The airport was packed Wednesday as many holidaymakers wrapped up their New Year travel, including those who who survived the fire and spent the night at the airport or at nearby hotels, trying to change their flights. Haneda is the busier of the two major airports serving the Japanese capital, with many international flights, and is favored by business travelers due to its proximity to central parts of the city. Tuesday’s accident was the first severe damage to an Airbus A350, among the industry’s newest large passenger planes. It entered commercial service in 2015. Airbus said in a statement it was sending specialists to help Japanese and French officials investigating the accident, and that the plane was delivered to Japan Airlines in late 2021.

The Fox News host announced on his radio show Tuesday he had moved to the Sunshine State after years of railing against Democrat-led states and cities and threatening to move from New York. “We are now beginning our first broadcast from my new home, and that is in the free state of Florida,” Hannity declared on his iHeartRadio show. “I am out. I am done. I am finished in New York.” He celebrated that he would finally have “representatives in the state that I’m living in that share my values,” citing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott. On “Hannity” Tuesday evening, he explained his motivations to Fox News viewers. “Like so many Americans, I left New York for good, and am now in the state with, let’s see: warmer weather, law and order, better education, more freedom, better quality of life and guess what? No state income tax,” he said. Hannity had lived on Long Island, and routinely broadcasted from his home studio there. He would go to Fox News’ Manhattan headquarters to host live studio audiences. For the wealthy, Florida, which does not levy a state income tax, has long been viewed as a tax haven. The state has also shifted increasingly to the right in recent years, becoming a hotbed for conservative policies under the “anti-woke” Gov. DeSantis. The next four years will change America forever.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Curtis announced his campaign to a TV station after saying last fall he had decided not to run. After people asked him to reconsider, he decided he could carry over his work representing Utah but with a bigger platform, Curtis told KSL-TV. Curtis has served eastern Utah's Third District since 2017. He was previously mayor of Provo, Utah, for seven years and for a time was a county-level Democratic Party official. Brent Orrin Hatch also announced his candidacy Tuesday. Hatch is one of six children of the late Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, who retired after 42 years in office in 2019 and died in 2022. Brent Hatch is a trial lawyer who is treasurer and past director of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal organization that advocates interpreting the U.S. Constitution according to the context in which it was written. He was an associate White House counsel under President George H.W. Bush and a Utah delegate to the 2004 Republican National Convention. He described himself as “not a professional politician” in a statement through his campaign. ""I have worked for over 33 years here in Utah as a lawyer protecting the rights of individuals and companies. But I still have an insider’s knowledge of the highest levels of government,"" he said in the statement. Romney, 76, announced in September he won't seek a second term in the Senate, saying it was time for younger leaders to step in. Romney also served as governor of Massachusetts and was the 2012 Republican nominee for president. Romney is among several Republicans who opposed former President Donald Trump and have been voted out or not sought re-election. The next four years will change America forever.

The strike was widely blamed on Israel but it’s implications for the war remain unclear. Israeli officials have not commented on the strike Tuesday that killed Saleh Arouri, the most senior Hamas member slain since the war in Gaza erupted nearly three months ago. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said “we are on high readiness for any scenario.” Hamas' Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into southern Israel killed around 1,200 people, and some 240 others were taken hostage. Israel’s air, ground and sea assault in Gaza has killed more than 22,100 people, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. Israel's campaign has driven some 85% of Gaza’s population from their homes, forcing hundreds of thousands of people into overcrowded shelters or teeming tent camps in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless bombed. A quarter of Gaza’s population face starvation, according to the United Nations, as Israeli restrictions and heavy fighting hinder aid delivery. Currently: — A Hamas official killed in a Beirut strike had been on Israel’s hit list for years. — US intel confident militant groups used largest Gaza hospital in campaign against Israel: AP source. — South Africa’s genocide case against Israel sets up a high-stakes legal battle at the UN’s top court. — Zvi Zamir, ex-Mossad chief who warned of impending 1973 Mideast war, dies at 98. — Find more of AP's coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war. Here's what's happening in the war: BERLIN – Germany has joined in strong criticism of two Israeli ministers’ calls for Palestinians to be resettled outside Gaza. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Sebastian Fischer said Wednesday that Berlin, a close ally of Israel, rejects the comments by Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir “in the strongest terms” and that “they are neither useful nor helpful.” He underlined the position of Germany and its Group of Seven allies that “there must be no expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, there must be no territorial reduction of the Gaza Strip.” He added that “from our point of view, a two-state solution remains the only sustainable model for Israelis and Palestinians to live together peacefully.” PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron has warned Israel against contemplating a forced displacement of Gaza residents. In a phone call on Tuesday with Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s War Cabinet, Macron “argued that statements relating to the forced displacement of Gazans were unacceptable and contradicted the two-state solution which constitutes the only viable solution for a return to peace and security for all,” the president’s office said in an overnight readout of the phone call. Macron also warned against the risk of spreading conflict, saying it is “essential to avoid any escalatory attitude, particularly in Lebanon,” the statement said. “France will continue to pass these messages to all actors involved directly or indirectly in the area,” it added. WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has spoken out against the comments of two far-right Israeli ministers who recently called for Palestinians to be resettled outside of Gaza. In a statement Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller called Israeli Ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir’s comments “inflammatory and irresponsible.” On Sunday, Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, said Israel should “encourage migration” from Gaza and re-establish Jewish settlements in the territory, where it withdrew settlers and soldiers in 2005. Ben Gvir has made similar comments about resettling Palestinians. Miller said Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have “repeatedly” told the U.S. leaders that “such statements do not reflect the policy of the Israeli government.” “Gaza is Palestinian land and will remain Palestinian land, with Hamas no longer in control of its future and with no terror groups able to threaten Israel,” Miller said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/child-friend-bad-influence-parent_l_65943800e4b0912833adfd96,What To Do When Your Child’s Friend Is A Bad Influence On Them,marie holmes,1/3/2024,"Our children learn their first lessons in right and wrong from us, their parents. We impart our values by telling them what to do and not to do, and, more powerfully, by example. How they see us treating others is the way that our children tend to treat people in their own lives. But as kids enter school and start to spend less time under our direct supervision, the center of their universe shifts away from parents. The thoughts and opinions of their peers increasingly exert a pull on them as they make their way toward adolescence. All of this is healthy and normal, but it can be tricky for parents trying to figure out their role. What should we do if one peer in particular seems to be wielding a negative influence? How should we bring this up with our children, while maintaining respect for their independence and encouraging them to solve problems on their own? Here, two experts share tips for parents who are navigating this situation. Even if they’re not telling you everything that goes on during their day, you know your kid. If you feel like something is “off,” then that’s worth paying attention to. “You might notice a change in your child’s attitude, behavior or personality,” pediatric psychologist Ann-Louise Lockhart told HuffPost. “You might also see changes in how they approach school, grades, academics and their future goals,” Lockhart said. “Their appearance, interests or hobbies might be impacted as well. They might also be less interested in prior friendships, and act negatively around friends and family.” Of course, your child’s friendships will ebb and flow, and you can’t — and shouldn’t — try to stay on top of every little shift. It’s important that your child has an opportunity to learn how to navigate conflict and changes in their relationships with peers. “Friendships are dynamic and while one day things may seem rocky, another day they may be great,” Aliza Pressman, a psychologist and the author of “The 5 Principles of Parenting,” explained to HuffPost. “If we are invested in daily changes, it would be unsustainable and potentially hovering,” she said. However, if you notice that your child’s mood shifts or they behave differently around one particular friend, that’s something worth further examination. We tend to think of a friend’s bad influence as involving substance abuse, but there are other ways that kids can bring each other down. “Some other negative influences include the way they speak to adults in their lives (teachers, parents, grandparents, coaches), as well as peers and siblings,” Lockhart said. “This can include making more negative, insulting or judgmental statements. It can include making fun of other people’s appearance or trying to shame or embarrass them in front of others.” Changes like these are worth paying attention to, but you don’t want to open the conversation by telling your child that you think a friend is a bad influence on them. To gain a better understanding of the situation, it’s important that you are able to listen, without judgment, to what your child tells you about their friendship. They may need you to simply act as a sounding board rather than give advice. “Err on the side of giving silent space for your kid to talk to you, and hold off on questions until you can honestly seem agenda-free,” Pressman advised. “Most of the time, school-aged and certainly middle school and older kids do not need us to intervene unless they are being bullied or bullying someone,” she said. Pressman also suggested that parents ask directly, “Do you think you want me to help out with this, or do you feel like you want to vent to me but not have me say anything?” Kids can often lead themselves to a solution. It may take nothing more than gentle eye contact and a few well-timed nods from you, or a couple of phrases to encourage them to keep going, such as “What makes you say that?” and “Tell me more.” You may have a few words in mind to describe your child’s friend, but keep anything that bears a judgment out of your conversation with your child. Instead, stick to the facts. What have you noticed? How is your child different? Lockhart suggested that you say something like “I notice you’ve been spending a lot of time with X. ... I’m concerned about how you seem to have changed since you’ve been spending more time together. I notice you spend more time in your room, exclude your sister from things you used to like doing together, and your grades have dropped.” When you withhold your own judgment, it gives your child an opportunity to respond without getting defensive of their own actions or their friend. This increases the odds that they’ll see something in a new light as a result of your conversation. Again, it’s important to set your own opinions aside and signal that you are truly open to changing your opinion based on what your child tells you. “Try asking with curiosity and making observations with neutrality, versus lecturing and sounding judgmental,” Pressman advised. One strategy to facilitate this is to start phrases with the words “I wonder.” For example, Pressman offered, “I wonder how you are feeling about Sally. I noticed you both have been bickering a lot lately.” Observations phrased this way “allow our kids to think about how they feel and come up with some observations and solutions with us,” she said. Lockhart emphasized the need to figure out what it is that your child is gaining from this friendship. “Find out why your child likes this friend,” she said. “Look for themes. Does this friend help your child feel included, accepted, noticed or popular? Notice what your child gets out of this friendship they felt was missing from their life before.” It’s crucial to have this information as you support your child in their problem-solving. Basic questions about your child’s relationship with the friend can help you understand their dynamic. Lockhart suggested these: “What do you like about your friend? What do you have in common? What do you like doing together?” After having these conversations with your kid and expressing your concerns about their changed mood or behavior, it’s important that you stand back and let them handle the next steps on their own. “This gives your child the opportunity to learn how to critically think about the people in their lives, how to practice good judgment and decision-making skills, and then follow through,” Lockhart said. “It’s tough as a parent to watch your child struggle, but it’s a very important future life skill.” She suggested that parents say something supportive but nonprescriptive, such as “This friendship seems very important to you. I’ve expressed my thoughts on it and how I feel like it’s affecting you. I encourage you to look at the pros and cons of this friendship. I’m here to support you through it. I’m here for you.” It can be incredibly tempting to say judgmental things about another child or their parent, but you should keep these thoughts to yourself, or perhaps vent them to a therapist or trusted friend. You can’t ever know the whole story regarding any other child or parent, Lockhart said. Rather than judging, she suggested that you “empathize with others, understand they are impacted by multiple life circumstances, and then stay in your lane.” Your focus should be on your own child and giving them support as they manage the situation. If you suspect that your child may be getting bullied, or bullying others, then you absolutely do need to step in. “In general, if someone in a socially powerful position is persistently and intentionally cruel and enlists others, it’s time to intervene,” Pressman said. This might involve contacting another child’s parents or reaching out to a teacher, school counselor or coach for help managing the situation. In the same way that you just know when something is amiss with your kid, you will also know things have become dire “when you feel like you’re losing your child,” Lockhart explained. In such a case, present your actions as a way to protect your child rather than a prohibition on the friendship. “You’re too important to me to lose you to an unhealthy friendship,” Lockhart suggested saying. “That’s the true message,” she said. “It’s not that you’re ruining their life by intervening, but you care and love them too much to watch them be negatively impacted.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-moderate-alcohol-intake-impacts-your-health-as-you-age_l_65942a00e4b0f27b6e355dbb,So THAT'S Why Drinking Alcohol Makes You Feel Worse As You Get Older,leigh weingus,1/3/2024,"“Drink in moderation” is advice we hear often, but as most people can attest to after a booze-filled holiday season, it isn’t easy to stick to. When we can stick to moderate drinking, however, we usually feel pretty good about ourselves. According to the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, moderate drinking is defined as no more than two drinks per day for men, and no more than one drink per day for women. That means if we have a glass of wine after work every day, we’re not doing much harm to our bodies and brains, right? That depends. Dr. Elizabeth Landsverk, a geriatrician and dementia expert, tells HuffPost that the way alcohol impacts the body will vary based on your age. If your 2024 goals include plans to drink in moderation, here’s what she wants you to know. Your 20s, Landsverk says, are a resilient time for the body — which is probably why hangovers aren’t nearly as bad during that decade. “The liver and brain have the most resilience during that time,” she said. “The frontal lobes (reasoning, and judgment) are not quite developed. One is more likely to be open to drinking more or taking more risks, and this can set habits that will cause problems down the line.” You probably won’t notice a huge difference as you head into your 30s as long as you’re drinking moderately, but it’s important to keep your overall health in mind. “Ask yourself: How is your health otherwise? Obesity, which is epidemic in America, increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver,” Landsverk said. “Alcohol increases the risk of liver disease and scarring (cirrhosis). As a geriatrician, I would say a glass or two a week is fine. Some doctors say one drink a day is fine, but it is also neurotoxic and that can catch up with you.” In your 40s, more health risks begin to pop up, Landsverk explains. “Obesity, diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol all increase the risk for heart attacks, strokes and small stroke dementia,” she said. If you’re living with any of these conditions, even a small amount of alcohol can further increase your risk of events like heart attacks or strokes, so keep that in mind. Once you hit your 50s, Landsverk says, even moderate drinking can wreak havoc on the body. “Alcohol, besides the vascular damage and dementia risks, increases the risk of breast cancer, esophageal cancer and liver cancer (after disease),” she said. Because cancer risk drastically increases as we age, adding any amount of alcohol into the mix will only further increase that risk. “Plus, as we age, good sleep is more elusive,” Landsverk added. “Substances like caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol all hinder sleep” In your 60s, you’ll likely begin to feel the effects of moderate drinking on your body. “I can speak from experience: This is the age when tolerance may decrease dramatically,” Landsverk said. “I am healthy. I can ski or swim a mile, but a glass of wine makes me feel ill and slow the next day.” This, she says, is because older people are more likely to lose the enzyme to metabolize alcohol (alcohol dehydrogenase). “At this point, I can tolerate about one glass a week,” Landsverk noted. “If I had it daily, I would feel sick with just one glass a day. Older people have less reserve in the brain, liver and kidneys. The damage to the brain from even one glass a day is worse [when you’re over 60].” Landsverk suggests that you think of alcoholic beverages like candy bars. “They’re nice with some meals, but they can increase your weight and blood sugar, and over decades adds to cancer risk and chronic illnesses that can lead to poor health.” If you want to stay as healthy as possible and feel your best as you age, do you have to give up alcohol completely? No, Landsverk emphasizes, and it’s important to remember to remember that other factors influence the impact alcohol has on your health and well-being, such as if you’re living with a disease like obesity or hypertension. If you’re older and in generally good health, you shouldn’t worry too much about the occasional alcoholic beverage. That’s certainly the case for Landsverk. “I have decided that a glass of wine with a nice meal is worth it,” she said. “But not every night.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

She was clad in a voluminous brilliant blue caftan topped off with a green cardigan — but what really sparked a shopping urge were her semi-opaque, cobalt blue tights. Not everyone may feel totally comfortable sporting head-to-toe color like Peck, but the idea of adding a bright spot to an outfit in the form of colorful hosiery felt like something readily achievable. A post shared by Meredith Peck (@sparkandpepper) “Colored tights can be a fun way to add a pop of color to an otherwise neutral outfit,” Peck told HuffPost in an email, encouraging the mixing and matching of standout colors like blues, reds and hot pinks. “You don’t have to spend a lot of money to experiment with color and stand out while expressing your personality.” When looking for colorful opaque tights, pay attention to the denier — which, as the hosiery brand Swedish Stockings explains, is another word for the weight or thickness of your stockings. According to multiple brands and outlets, something around 40 deniers and up will offer a more opaque look. Peck’s best advice for trying out colorful hosiery? “Don’t take it too seriously and have fun with it!” In the spirit of enjoyment, we’re rounded up nine pairs of opaque and semi-opaque tights to jazz up your winter outfits.

If you’re anywhere north of 50, it’s likely those days are over. You may have already noticed how lipstick tends to run into even the finest lines around your mouth, leaving you with a smeary mess that can’t be blotted away with tissues. Fortunately, there are smart, savvy makeup artists who have shared their expertise with us. They offered some insight on why our lipstick seems to suddenly turn on us. Michelle Wong, the cosmetic chemist behind the popular site Lab Muffin, said: “As you get older, your skin tends to thin and develop more lines and furrows, which act as ‘channels’ for lipstick, which has pigments that are slightly soluble in the product’s oils.”’ Is there an official name for this new indignity? “It’s called lipstick ‘feathering,’ because instead of a sharp, crisp line around the lips, it can look like a feather around the edges — a bit soft and never defined,” explained makeup artist Mila Thomas. After all those years of aiming for moist, glossy lips, you’re going to need to transition away from those types of products. “Oily, liquid lip products are more prone to feathering,” Wong said. “Lip glosses applied on top of lipsticks are common culprits.” Makeup artist Jamie Greenberg said that matte products might be a better fit for an older cosmetics user. “Anything too wet, glossy or thick will make the problem worse,” she said. Thomas explained the reason why: “If the formula is too wet, it will more easily bleed into the skin beyond the lip line.” There are techniques to avoid out-of-control pigment from spreading all over your face. But you’ll need to do a little pre-work before applying your favorite lippy. It’s going to take some trial and error as you experiment with products and application methods. “I know it’s super-annoying, but there’s a technique out there for everyone,” said Jeanine Lobell, makeup artist and founder of the Neen cosmetics brand. “It can help to exfoliate the lips daily, and to use lip balm each day to keep lips smooth,” Thomas said. Greenberg suggested using a lip scrub on and above the lips, too. If you want to do even more to set your lips up for success, she suggested using a nighttime lip mask. Now that you’re exfoliated, balmed and masked, here’s how to apply lipstick so it stays where you put it. Start with a mattifier/filler. “Put it on the lip line, going on the skin and in the outer corners,” Lobell said. Apply lip-filling primer to smooth skin and create a barrier between your lipstick and any natural oils. Brush on lip stain for a long-lasting color base. Outline: Greenberg recommended lining lips with a flesh-toned concealer or lip pencil to create a barrier between the lipstick and the fine lines around your lips. Lobell outlined the process she uses: “Fill in the lip line, overdrawing very slightly. It’s very important not to draw all the way to the outer corner, because stopping a little short of the lip line is more flattering. Once you’ve applied liner, even if your lip color migrates, it will be held in place by the liner.” Brush on lipstick: Greenburg uses a lip brush instead of applying the lipstick directly. “Brush out from the pout of your lips outwards,” she advised. Blot: Thomas said, “Take a tissue and split it apart so it’s only one-ply. After you apply one coat of lipstick, lightly blot lips with the tissue.” Add another coat: “The two-coat layering technique, with blotting in between, will make the color more long-lasting and help it stay in place,” Greenberg explained, Finally, a bit of powder: “Dab the entire lip area with a bit of translucent powder and you should be ready to go,” Greenberg said. “Use a more matte long-wear color for better control,” Lobell said. “A matte lipstick that’s full-coverage with a smudge-resistant finish is going to ‘travel’ less than other formulas.” Still craving a bit of shine? “Keep gloss away from the edges of your lips, and apply it sparingly,” Wong said. “If you need your gloss, keep it more centered on the lips when you apply it, tap lips together, and allow the extra to make it evenly shiny,” Lobell said. “If you love a creamy formula, tap the lips with blotting paper after you apply it.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/frequent-urination-age_l_6570a580e4b0a10def8b2a11,So THAT'S Why You Have To Pee More Frequently As You Get Older,casey clark,1/3/2024,"Do you find yourself constantly running to the bathroom? It may seem like you have to pee every hour (or maybe every other hour). Depending on who you ask, this might not be viewed as a problem but merely a symptom of aging. And it’s true: A host of changes happen to your body as you get older, including bladder issues. While urinary incontinence affects people differently ― especially with age ― there are a few explanations for why you may experience this. We asked gynecologists, urologists and pelvic floor therapists to delve into the common reasons you have to pee more frequently as you get older. Here’s what to know: According to the North American Menopause Society, estrogen levels tend to decrease when people enter the early stages of menopause, also known as perimenopause. “Estrogen is an integral hormone for maintaining bladder wall strength,” said Dr. Monica Grover, an OB-GYN and chief medical officer at VSPOT. “As it declines, the tissues supporting the bladder wall start to become weak and stiff, thus increasing the frequency to urinate.” You may want to talk with your doctor about getting your estrogen levels checked if you think this could be part of the problem. Signs of decreased estrogen, particularly as a result of menopause, may include breast tenderness, frequent urinary tract infections and bone loss. Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when one or more of the pelvic organs (bladder, bowels, uterus) are not optimally supported by the pelvic floor muscles and ligaments. “If your bladder prolapses, it can sag into your front vaginal wall where residual urine can hang out after your pee,” said Sara Reardon, board-certified pelvic physical therapist and founder of The Vagina Whisperer. “Therefore you feel like you don’t empty completely and shortly after peeing, you may feel like you have to go again.” While you’ll want to talk with your doctor about ways to strengthen your pelvic floor, kegel exercises can be helpful. According to the Urology Care Foundation, about 10 in 25 women and 3 in 25 men will have symptoms of a urinary tract infection during their lifetime. “As women age and progress through menopause, the diminished estrogen reserves change vaginal tissue to become more dry as well as the vaginal pH,” Grover said. “As a result, women do not experience the typical telltale signs of a UTI ― such as pain ― but will most likely experience frequent urination.” Have you ever thought to yourself, “I feel like my bladder has gotten smaller”? That actually does happen as you age. “The amount of urine it takes for someone to get the urge to go is less with aging and the amount of urine the bladder can hold is less,” Reardon said. “Often this is why aging women get diagnosed with Overactive Bladder because the bladder becomes more sensitive and shrinks.” In particular, the elastic tissue becomes stiffer and the bladder becomes less stretchy, which tends to cause more frequent urination. Constipation is more common with aging and it actually can lead to more urinary urgency. “If the colon and rectum are full of poop, this actually can put pressure on your bladder, causing it to feel like you have more urgency to pee,” Reardon said. Addressing constipation with exercise, dietary fiber, hydration and proper pooping mechanics can actually help your bladder urgency. As you age, the likelihood of having chronic illnesses and taking multiple medications increases. “Certain medical conditions like diabetes or heart disease can lead to increased urine production,” said Dr. Anat Sapan, board certified OB-GYN and menopause expert. “Similarly, many medications, such as diuretics commonly used for high blood pressure, can increase urinary frequency.” If you’re the type of person who drinks a cup of coffee (or two) and likes to drink, whether that’s a glass of wine or beer, then that might be the reason you have to pee so much. “Caffeine and alcohol are both bladder irritants and diuretics, which increase your body’s tendency to excrete water through urine,” said Dr. Andrew Y. Sun, board-certified urologist and chief medical adviser for Marius Pharmaceuticals. “Limiting the consumption of coffee, soda, wine, cocktails — even chocolate — can help reduce the need to pee frequently.” As men age, the prostate naturally increases in size, squeezing the urethra so that instead of peeing through a fire hose, you’re peeing through a cocktail straw instead. “If the prostate gets tight, then the bladder has to work extra hard to pump the urine out through this tighter opening,” Sun said. “Over time, because the bladder is ‘working out’ so much, it becomes thicker and more spastic, which can cause overactive bladder and frequency of urination.” Treatments for this problem include medication to relax and shrink the prostate or surgical procedures to open it up. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Type 2 diabetes most often develops in people over age 45. A common symptom of Type 2 diabetes is frequent urination, which might explain the need to pee more as you get older. “Generally there’s a build up of glucose in the blood which forces the kidneys to work harder to filter and absorb the extra sugar,” said Dr. Erica Montes, a physician and an adviser for pH-D Feminine Health. “However, when the kidneys can’t keep up, the extra sugar goes into the urine which could lead to more frequent urination.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

On his primetime show Tuesday, Jesse Watters said he had recently received a “delightful reading” from a fortune teller at a dinner party. “And when I asked her about Trump, she said there’d be a grave injustice this fall, and we may not even have an election,” he said. He introduced Paula Roberts, “The English Psychic,” to give a second opinion on what’s in store for Trump. Roberts, whose website describes her as a psychic, clairvoyant and seer, pulled an ominous-looking tarot card from her deck. “Uh oh,” Watters said. “I mean, I do recognize that I’m at Fox TV,” she prefaced her reading. “A sense of loss,” she predicted. “A sense of loss, but it’s very specific,” she continued stammering, ”no, let me move on.” “It’s as if he may be thinking more about what he’s lost and not still taking full advantage of what he still has,” she concluded. Watters replied: “That’s a great interpretation, Paula.” This “English psychic” on Fox News had an ominous prophecy about Trump in 2024:“Uh oh…I do recognize that I’m at Fox TV. A sense of loss.” pic.twitter.com/youmR7rk2U Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has continued to peddle lies that the 2020 election was rigged against him, and has been laying the groundwork to make the same complaints should he lose this year. Facing four criminal indictments, he has cast the prosecutions as politically motivated attempts at election interference. Watters also asked Roberts for a reading on President Joe Biden. “Lots and lots and lots and lots of money,” she said. Laughing, Watters asked, “from China?” ostensibly alluding to Republican allegations about Biden’s involvement with his family’s foreign business dealings.

The tattoo design — a hand heart on Hamlin’s neck with a heart monitor line enclosed inside — was shared in an Instagram post by Miami-based tattoo artist Alexander Brenes on Tuesday. “1 year later still locked inn 🫶,” the caption read, a likely reference to Hamlin’s life-threatening medical incident last January. A post shared by Alexander Brenes (@chinkaliftattoos) The 25-year old athlete collapsed during the first quarter of the Bills vs. Cincinnati Bengals football game at Paycor Stadium in Ohio last year. After being revived on the field by medical personnel, the athlete was transported to the hospital. He remained in critical condition in the intensive care unit, where he made remarkable strides toward recovery. “When you put real love out into the world, it comes back to you 3x’s as much,” he wrote in an Instagram post that week in response to the supportive messages he had received. “The Love has been overwhelming, but I’m thankful for every single person that prayed for me and reached out.” The Bills safety was discharged from the hospital the following week and, with his doctor’s clearance, made his return to the field in August.

On a Tuesday episode of “The Pat McAfee Show” on YouTube, the injured Jets player talked with the co-hosts, sports analysts Pat McAfee and A.J. Hawk, about a court document revealing the names of dozens of associates and victims of Epstein that is expected to be released this week. “There’s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, who are really hoping that list doesn’t come out,” Rodgers said. Rodgers also talked about the list (but not Kimmel) on a February 2023 episode of “The Pat McAfee Show,” which led Kimmel to play a clip of the discussion on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” calling Rodgers a “tin foil hatter” and adding it “might be time to revisit that concussion protocol, Aaron.” McAfee brought up Kimmel’s previous jab at Rodgers on the Tuesday show. “Jimmy mocked him for it, and Aaron has not forgotten about it,” McAfee said. Rodgers added: “I’ll tell you what, if that list comes out, I will definitely be popping some sort of bottle.” Kimmel clapped back on X (formerly Twitter) later Tuesday. “Dear Aasshole: for the record, I’ve not met, flown with, visited, or had any contact whatsoever with Epstein nor will you find my name on any ‘list’ other than the clearly-phony nonsense that soft-brained wackos like yourself can’t seem to distinguish from reality,” Kimmel said. “Your reckless words put my family in danger. Keep it up and we will debate the facts further in court.” Dear Aasshole: for the record, I’ve not met, flown with, visited, or had any contact whatsoever with Epstein, nor will you find my name on any “list” other than the clearly-phony nonsense that soft-brained wackos like yourself can’t seem to distinguish from reality.

The list, in which the names had been redacted, is from a civil lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced for her role in helping Epstein abuse teen girls. Epstein died by suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan in August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to traffic minors for sex.

In a split decision on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta dismissed the wrongful death and negligence civil counts of the lawsuit filed last January by Sandra Garza, the longtime partner of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick. The judge decided that Garza, who was Sicknick’s fiancée, lacked the standing to file such claims since she wasn’t his spouse and didn’t fit the legal definition of a domestic partner, NBC News reported. Sicknick died shortly after the 2021 Capitol riot, where he had collapsed while defending the Capitol building and was transported to the hospital. A medical examiner confirmed that he died of natural causes after having multiple strokes. According to the Department of Justice, video footage from the riot showed two rioters, Julian Elie Khater and George Pierre Tanios, assaulting police officers including Sicknick by spraying a substance in their faces. The two men were arrested and charged with assaulting U.S. Capitol officers, among other charges, though neither of them were charged with Sicknick’s death, CBS News reported. Khater, who admitted to spraying Sicknick, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to more than six years in prison. Tanios admitted to purchasing the substance in the spray and pleaded guilty to lesser charges, and was also sentenced to serve time. In her lawsuit last year, Garza alleged wrongful death, conspiracy to violate civil rights and assault, among other claims against Trump, Khater and Tanios, and sought at least $10 million in damages from them. While the wrongful death and civil negligence counts have been dismissed, the judge has allowed Garza’s other claims against Trump to proceed under D.C.’s Survival Act, which allows an individual’s legal representative to pursue legal action on behalf of them after their death. (Garza is the representative of Sicknick’s estate). “We are pleased to see that our lawsuit in pursuit of justice for the late Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died in the aftermath of the January 6th insurrection, has been permitted to continue. We are now considering our next step options, to include deposing former President Trump,” Mark Zaid, an attorney for Garza, said in a statement on Thursday, according to CBS News.

According to police, Zhuang was found “alive but very cold and scared” inside a tent with nothing but a heat blanket and sleeping bag to keep him warm and a limited supply of food and water. Police said Zhuang’s host family in Riverdale, in the Ogden area, told detectives they heard him in the house on Thursday morning and were unaware he had gone missing. Zhuang’s family in China gave detectives a photo of what appeared to be their son being held captive and in danger, police said. Zhuang’s family told investigators they transferred $80,000 to bank accounts in China after receiving several threats from the alleged kidnappers. A joint investigation with Riverdale police, the FBI, the U.S. embassy in China and Chinese officials found that Zhuang was possibly a victim of a criminal trend known as cyber-kidnapping. Surveillance footage and bank records revealed that Zhuang had purchased camping equipment on Dec. 20, police said. His bank records and phone location indicated he visited the Brigham City Canyon area, about 25 miles north of Ogden, where police suspected Zhuang was setting up camp. Police said they feared he would freeze overnight. Zhuang was found inside a tent in a wooded area along with several phones believed to have been used to carry out the cyber-kidnapping, police said. “Relieved” to have been found, Zhuang asked officers for a “warm cheeseburger” and to speak to his family in China to let them know he was safe, police said. According to police, Zhuang’s case mirrors other cyber-kidnapping cases in the U.S. that have targeted exchange students. Police said extortionists will contact foreign students, tell them to isolate themselves and convince them to take photos to make it appear they are being held captive. “The victims comply out of fear that their families will be harmed if they don’t comply with the cyber-kidnappers,” police said. The criminals convince the victim to send the photos to their family in a demand for a ransom. They may also monitor their victim through a video call, such as FaceTime or Skype, and then send the photos and voice recordings to convince the family their loved one is in danger, police said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/federal-appeals-abortion-mothers-life-texas_n_6594bd16e4b0f27b6e35b69b,"In Texas Case, Federal Appeals Panel Says Emergency Care Abortions Not Required By 1986 Law",kevin mc gill,1/2/2024,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The Biden administration cannot use a 1986 emergency care law to require doctors in Texas hospitals to provide abortions for women whose lives are at risk due to pregnancy, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. It’s one of numerous cases involving abortion restrictions that have played out in state and federal courts after the U.S. Supreme Court ended abortion rights in 2022. The administration issued guidance that year saying hospitals “must” provide abortion services if there’s a risk to the mother’s life, citing the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment for anyone who arrives at the emergency room. Texas state courts have also brought separate cases about when abortion must be allowed there, despite bans on it under most circumstances. The Texas Supreme Court ruled last month against a woman who asked for permission to abort a fetus with a fatal diagnosis. The same court heard arguments in November on behalf of women who were denied abortions despite serious risks to their health if they continued their pregnancies; the justices have not ruled on that case. Abortion opponents have challenged the emergency care law guidance in multiple jurisdictions. In Texas, the state joined abortion opponents in a lawsuit to stop the guidance from taking effect and won at the district court level. The Biden administration appealed to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. But the appeal was rejected in Tuesday’s ruling by a unanimous three-judge panel. The ruling said the guidance cannot be used to require emergency care abortions in Texas or by members of two anti-abortion groups that filed suit — the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists and the Christian Medical & Dental Associations. The California-based 9th Circuit has allowed use of the guidance to continue in an Idaho case, which is pending at the U.S. Supreme Court. Opponents of the guidance said Texas law already allows abortions to save the life of the mother, but that the federal guidance went too far, calling for abortions when an emergency condition is not present and eliminating obligations to treat the unborn child. The 5th Circuit panel sided with Texas. The opinion said language in the 1986 emergency care law requires hospitals to stabilize the pregnant woman and her fetus.

Abasolo, who starred in Season 13 of the popular reality dating show, “The Bachelorette,” alongside Lindsay, cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their break up. Abasolo, 43, filed a petition for divorce on Tuesday in Los Angeles County court, according to CNN. He is also reportedly requesting spousal support and for Lindsay to pay his legal fees. The pair got engaged during the show’s 2017 finale in Spain and tied the knot two years later at a destination wedding in Cancun. Lindsay and Abasolo don’t share any children together. Abasolo also spoke out about the divorce in a statement on Instagram. “After more than 4 years of marriage, Rachel and I have made the difficult decision to part ways and start anew,” Abasolo wrote. “I’m a family man, but sometimes loving yourself and your partner means you must let go.” Last month during an appearance on Nick Viall’s podcast, “The Viall Files,” Lindsay opened up about how the two have been living “totally different lives” due to their hectic work schedules (Lindsay is a podcaster and TV personality; Abasolo is a chiropractor). “Bryan is a sole practitioner [and] he leaves the house at 8. He comes home at 9 o’clock, 9:30 [at night] sometimes. It’s just him by himself,” Lindsay explained.

On Sunday, the reality star shared an Instagram video showing off the massive faux-snow-covered yard at her $60 million mansion outside Los Angeles, filled with holiday lights and a seemingly endless number of evergreen trees. Social media users wasted no time blasting the opulent display, which Kardashian described simply as a “winter wonderland.” Flooding the post’s comments section, followers accused the Skims founder of flaunting her wealth. “All that money you spent on that bull crap you could help people that really need it,” one user wrote. Another complained: “This is called too much money and you don’t know what to do with it all. I can give you some ideas.” “With the money that was spent with this spectacle could you not have perhaps toned it down just a smudge and donated a few million dollars to 100 poor families,” a third person said. “Kim, people are dying,” another user added, nodding to big sister Kourtney Kardashian’s viral quote from “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” The “American Horror Story” star’s video comes after the mom of four hosted her family’s annual Christmas Eve party last month. Kardashian made headlines when eagle-eyed fans noticed that she was missing from a recent Christmas-themed Instagram video starring siblings Kourtney Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner, as well as mom Kris Jenner. “We couldn’t find kimberly,” Kylie Jenner playfully captioned the video — which, ironically, was filmed in Kim Kardashian’s house.

In a two-page letter to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Habash, who is Palestinian American, outlined his reasons for leaving. “[T]he actions of the Biden-Harris Administration have put millions of innocent lives in danger, most immediately for the 2.3 million Palestinian civilians living in Gaza who remain under continuous assault and ethnic cleansing by the Israeli government. Therefore, I must resign,” he said. Here is my resignation letter in it’s entirety. My words: pic.twitter.com/xv9oVn94Vt In the letter, Habash described himself as a descendent of Palestinian Christians who lived through the violent 1948 mass relocation effort to create the Israeli state. “My grandparents, aunts, and uncles walked over 35 miles, from Yaffa to Lydda to eventually Ramallah, just to survive. For 75 years, my relatives have never been allowed to return to their familial homes,” he said. The U.S. has continued to supply Israel with resources to aid its offensive in the tiny Gaza Strip since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants. Last month, Biden said his commitment to Israel is “unshakeable,” while warning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel is losing global support. “Millions of Palestinians have faced decades of occupation, ethnic cleansing, and apartheid, and the Biden Administration’s passive acceptance of this status quo is wholly out of line with democratic values,” Habash said, adding that U.S. military support has led to the deaths of children, journalists and medical professionals, “violat[ing] our moral obligation as stewards of our country’s tax dollars.” He also criticized the Israeli government’s claim that it aims only to destroy Hamas rather than all of Gaza. According to the Hamas-run health authority in Gaza, more than 22,000 people have been killed since the current conflict began. In the letter, Habash also encouraged the Education Department to protect students’ right to protest the war, noting how “alarming” the violence against Palestinian and Muslim Americans has been due to the conflict.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/katt-williams-cedric-the-entertainer-accused-stealing-joke_n_6596fc43e4b0912833af5703,Katt Williams Blasts Cedric The Entertainer Over Alleged Stolen Joke,kimberley richards,1/4/2024,"Katt Williams slammed fellow comedian Cedric the Entertainer this week in a fiery interview on the “Club Shay Shay” podcast. In the podcast episode, released Wednesday, the “Friday After Next” actor pulled no punches when he doubled down on a previous accusation that Cedric stole one of his best jokes, telling host Shannon Sharpe that Cedric later tried to “rewrite history.” Cedric (born Cedric Kyles) had denied stealing the joke from Williams during an appearance on “Club Shay Shay” in 2022. But Williams insisted in Wednesday’s episode that Cedric did lift his joke. “He thought that I was just a no-name comedian, and that he could take this joke and nobody would know,” Williams said. “The issue was that I had already done this particular joke on BET’s ‘ComicView’ twice.” Williams has claimed that Cedric copied a bit that he used during a 1998 appearance on BET’s stand-up comedy series “ComicView.” Williams accused the “Barbershop” actor of performing the alleged stolen joke in the 2000 film “The Original Kings of Comedy.” Clips of both comedians performing their jokes have made the rounds on X, the former Twitter. “This is not just some random joke, this is my very best joke, and it’s my last joke and it’s my closing joke,” Williams said. “1998, I’m doing this joke, it’s on ‘ComicView.’ Cedric comes to the Comedy Store, he watches me in the audience, he comes backstage, he tells me what a great job I did and how much he loves the joke.” He continued: “Two years later he’s doing that as his last joke on the ‘Kings of Comedy’ and he’s doing it verbatim. He’s just changed my car into a spaceship.” Williams claimed that Cedric and his longtime friend, comedian and TV host Steve Harvey, had already apologized for the alleged stolen joke. “I gave him a pass, for a decade,” Williams said. He argued that he’s only speaking out now because Cedric denied stealing the joke in 2022. Cedric, for his part, told Sharpe in 2022 that Williams’ accusation was “ridiculous” and “some internet shit.” He then claimed that the timeline of when both comedians told their jokes didn’t square with Williams’ claims. A representative for Cedric did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Williams’ most recent interview. However, the “Johnson Family Vacation” actor responded to some of Williams’ claims in the comments section of a “Club Shay Shay” Instagram post on Wednesday. “Revisionist History, regardless of whatever [Williams’] opinion, My career can’t be reduced to One Joke Katt Williams claims as his,” Cedric wrote. “I been over 40 movies, my specials and brand speaks volumes for [who] I am. The ppl I have put on including ‘Katt in the Hat.’ At the Gibson Amphitheater.” “And all that tough talk! Is corny af,” he later wrote in a follow-up comment. “I’m grown ass man. And none of that shit gonna go like you think. You do you and I got this over here.” Elsewhere in his appearance on “Club Shay Shay,” Williams criticized the comedic skills of Harvey, Rickey Smiley, Tyler Perry, Kevin Hart and Michael Blackson — and leveled a slew of other insults and claims. On Thursday, Hart responded to Williams’ interview in a social media post promoting his new film “Lift.” Williams had accused Hart of being an “industry plant,” suggesting that the “Night School” actor took shortcuts to reach such success in his career.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/vili-fualaau-may-december-reaction_n_65970134e4b0bf73e178c7f5,Mary Kay Letourneau's Ex Shreds 'May December' Movie: 'I'm Offended',curtis m. wong,1/4/2024,"Vili Fualaau might have been the inspiration for one of the characters in “May December,” but he probably won’t be rooting for the film this awards season. In a Hollywood Reporter interview published Thursday, Fualaau confirmed that he’d seen the movie, a fictionalized take on his real-life experiences in the 1990s and 2000s. But Fualaau said that he was angered at having never been contacted by director Todd Haynes, screenwriter Samy Burch or actor Charles Melton, who portrays the Fualaau-like character. “I’m still alive and well,” he told THR. “If they had reached out to me, we could have worked together on a masterpiece. Instead, they chose to do a ripoff of my original story.” He added, “I’m offended by the entire project and the lack of respect given to me — who lived through a real story and is still living it.” Released in November, “May December” is loosely based on the case of Seattle-area teacher Mary Kay Letourneau, who in 1997 pleaded guilty to the second-degree child rape of Fualaau, a former student in her sixth-grade class. The couple raised two children and were married in 2005, shortly after Letourneau was released from a seven-year stint in prison. The two split in 2017 but remained close until Letourneau’s death in 2020 at age 58. “May December” changes many of the specifics of the case, including locations, professions and names. The film follows Elizabeth Berry (played by Natalie Portman), a television actor who is gearing up to portray Gracie Atherton-Yoo (Julianne Moore) in a biopic. Unlike Letourneau, Gracie isn’t a teacher, but rather a former pet shop owner living in relative seclusion with her much younger husband, Joe Yoo (Melton), and their children after getting out of prison. Joe is said to have been a 13-year-old seventh grader when he and Grace begin a sexual relationship, later marrying his abuser. “May December” has received widespread praise from critics, with Moore and Portman considered to be front-runners for this year’s Academy Awards. Melton, best known for his portrayal of Reggie Mantle on “Riverdale,” has also been singled out for his performance, which received a Golden Globe nomination. Despite the obvious parallels, the creative team behind “May December” has said the movie was never intended as a faithful look at Letourneau’s case. “It wasn’t the same details — I certainly don’t want anyone to assume that we’re trying to say all these conversations happened behind closed doors,” Burch said at the film’s Los Angeles premiere. “This was just a jumping off point and a way that something like this made sense to me emotionally.” Speaking to HuffPost in November, Haynes noted: “The stroke of genius in the script is how she [Burch] separates the story from the tabloid event of Gracie meeting Joe, which happened 20-some years in the past. It’s really about this outsider coming into a well-fortified community, a neighborhood, a family that’s built up so many barriers to survive that kind of an event.” In his Hollywood Reporter chat, Fualaau, now 40, said that he wouldn’t be opposed to seeing his story adapted for the big screen again in the future ― albeit by a different creative team. “I love movies — good movies,” he told the outlet. “I admire ones that capture the essence and complications of real-life events. You know, movies that allow you to see or realize something new every time you watch them. Those kinds of writers and directors — someone who can do that — would be perfect to work with, because my story is not nearly as simple as this movie [portrays].” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jeffrey-epstein-documents-unsealed_n_65974084e4b0f27b6e36d43c,More Jeffrey Epstein Documents Unsealed,larry neumeister,1/4/2024,"NEW YORK (AP) — A new batch of unsealed documents pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of teenage girls was released Thursday, adding several hundred pages to the fountain of information detailing how the financier leveraged connections to the rich, powerful and famous to recruit his victims and cover up his crimes. The 19 documents, or about 300 pages, were half as many as the over 40 documents released Wednesday. The documents so far — with more to come — were sprinkled with names of celebrities and politicians who socialized with Epstein or worked with him in the years before he was publicly accused nearly two decades ago of paying underage girls for sex. Most of those names were familiar to anyone who has followed the scandal closely, including the criminal trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was Epstein’s former girlfriend, household manager and chief recruiter of young, vulnerable females. It was during Maxwell’s criminal trial two years ago that Epstein’s victims, some of whom aspired to be models or artists, described how he dropped the names of his famous and influential friends to suggest that he was the victims’ ticket to reaching their dreams. Maxwell, 62, was convicted of sex trafficking charges and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. The roughly 250 documents being unsealed, starting this week, in one of the lawsuits against Maxwell mostly rehash what has long been known about a man who traveled in elite circles until his July 2019 sex-trafficking arrest left him so cornered that he took his own life in jail. But they have included a few fresh details about a pyramid of abuse that grew over three decades and damaged dozens of teenage girls and young women. Among the famous people in Epstein’s orbit before he was exposed as a sexual predator were former Presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, singer Michael Jackson and magician David Copperfield, according to the accounts of his victims and other witnesses quoted in newly released documents. None of those men were accused of wrongdoing. There were also repetitions of well-known stories about Britain’s Prince Andrew. He was sued by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre, who said she had sexual encounters with the royal when she was 17. The prince, who denied the allegations, settled the lawsuit in 2022. The court documents being released now are related to a 2015 lawsuit that Giuffre brought against Maxwell. Thousands of pages of documents in that lawsuit had been made public previously, but some sections had been blacked out because of privacy concerns. U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska ordered last month that those redactions be lifted, mostly because names in the documents had already been made public through news coverage or through other court proceedings. Among the more interesting documents released Wednesday was the May 2016 deposition of Johanna Sjoberg, who worked as a masseuse in Epstein’s household. Sjoberg said she once met Michael Jackson at Epstein’s Palm Beach, Florida, home, but that nothing untoward happened with the late pop icon. Epstein also had homes in Manhattan, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands. She also described an April 2001 trip to New York in which she said Prince Andrew touched her breast while they posed for a photo at Epstein’s Manhattan town house. Clinton previously said through a spokesperson that although he traveled on Epstein’s jet several times, he never visited his homes, had no knowledge of his crimes, and hadn’t spoken to him since his conviction. Trump has also said he once thought Epstein was a “terrific guy,” but that they later had a falling-out. Sjoberg also testified that she once went to a dinner at one of Epstein’s homes that was also attended by magician David Copperfield. She said Copperfield did magic tricks before asking if she was aware “that girls were getting paid to find other girls.” One allegation against Epstein and Maxwell was that some girls he paid for sexual acts later recruited other victims. Sjoberg said Copperfield didn’t get more specific about what he meant. A Copperfield publicist didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The newly released records also include many references to Jean-Luc Brunel, a French modeling agent who was close to Epstein and who killed himself in a Paris jail in 2022 while awaiting trial on charges that he raped underage girls. Giuffre was among the women who accused Brunel of sexual abuse. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Juvenal Antero, 24, was identified as the victim of a fatal shooting after two people “forced their way” into his family’s apartment, Dallas police said in a press release. According to the release, police responded to reports of a shooting at around 2:40 p.m. They found Antero had been shot and took him to a local hospital, where he died from his injuries. Police said the suspects left the home following the break-in. In an email to HuffPost on Thursday, a police spokesperson said there had been no update in Antero’s case. Antero’s wife, Elizabel Cardenas, described the incident in an interview with ABC affiliate WFAA, saying she and their 4-year-old son were home at the time. Cardenas told the outlet the two individuals knocked on their door asking for a plunger before forcing their way into the home. “I’m slamming the door on his hand, and I’m holding the door with all the strength that I could pull,” Cardenas said. According to Cardenas, Antero grabbed his gun and jumped in front of their 4-year-old to protect him, but was shot. “We were his everything. We were all that mattered to him,” Cardenas said. Cardenas told NBC affiliate KXAS-TV she is 11 weeks pregnant, and that her husband was excited to see sonogram images and hear the unborn child’s heartbeat at an upcoming appointment.

Chris Christie (R) admitted in a new presidential campaign ad that endorsing former President Donald Trump in 2016 was a mistake on his part. “I have an admission to make. Eight years ago when I decided to endorse Donald Trump for president, I did it because he was winning, and I did it because I thought I could make him a better candidate and a better president,” Christie said in the 66-second ad released Thursday. “Well, I was wrong, I made a mistake.” After he dropped out of the 2016 presidential race, Christie supported Trump and briefly led his presidential transition team. Last year, Christie was asked about his judgment in regard to endorsing Trump in an interview with Vanity Fair. “I’m not perfect. I can be wrong sometimes. I think everybody can,” he said. Unlike some of the other GOP presidential candidates, Christie has consistently criticized Trump both before and during his 2024 campaign. While Trump is facing a myriad of legal issues, including numerous criminal cases and disqualification from ballots in two states, he is still leading the Republican 2024 primary polls with an average of 61.8%, according to FiveThirtyEight. Trailing behind him are Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (12.1%), Nikki Haley (11.2%), Vivek Ramaswamy (4.8%), Christie (3.4%) and Asa Hutchinson (0.8%). Elsewhere in the ad, Christie addressed Trump’s lead in the polls. “Now, we’re confronted with the very same choice again,” he said. “Donald Trump is ahead in the polls, so everyone says, ‘Anyone who’s behind him should drop out, and we should make our choice Donald Trump versus Joe Biden.’ Well, Joe Biden has had the wrong policies, and Donald Trump will sell the soul of this country. Neither choice is acceptable to me, and it shouldn’t be acceptable to you.” The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/glynis-johns-dead-at-100_n_65972230e4b0912833af6db4,'Mary Poppins' Star Glynis Johns Dies At 100,mark kennedy,1/4/2024,"NEW YORK (AP) — Glynis Johns, a Tony Award-winning stage and screen star who played the mother opposite Julie Andrews in the classic movie “Mary Poppins” and introduced the world to the bittersweet standard-to-be “Send in the Clowns” by Stephen Sondheim, has died. She was 100. Mitch Clem, her manager, said she died Thursday at an assisted living home in Los Angeles of natural causes. “Today’s a sad day for Hollywood,” Clem said. “She is the last of the last of old Hollywood.” Johns was known to be a perfectionist about her profession — precise, analytical and opinionated. The roles she took had to be multi-faceted. Anything less was giving less than her all. “As far as I’m concerned, I’m not interested in playing the role on only one level,” she told The Associated Press in 1990. “The whole point of first-class acting is to make a reality of it. To be real. And I have to make sense of it in my own mind in order to be real."" Johns’ greatest triumph was playing Desiree Armfeldt in “A Little Night Music,” for which she won a Tony in 1973. Sondheim wrote the show’s hit song “Send in the Clowns” to suit her distinctive husky voice, but she lost the part in the 1977 film version to Elizabeth Taylor. “I’ve had other songs written for me, but nothing like that,” Johns told the AP in 1990. “It’s the greatest gift I’ve ever been given in the theater.” Others who followed Johns in singing Sondheim’s most popular song include Frank Sinatra, Judy Collins, Barbra Streisand, Sarah Vaughan and Olivia Newton-John. It also appeared in season two of “Yellowjackets” in 2023, sung by Elijah Wood. Back when it was being conceived, “A Little Night Music” had gone into rehearsal with some of the book and score unfinished, including a solo song for Johns. Director Hal Prince suggested she and co-star Len Cariou improvise a scene or two to give book writer Hugh Wheeler some ideas. “Hal said ‘Why don’t you just say what you feel,”’ she recalled to the AP. “When Len and I did that, Hal got on the phone to Steve Sondheim and said, ‘I think you’d better get in a cab and get round here and watch what they’re doing because you are going to get the idea for Glynis’ solo.”’ Johns was the fourth generation of an English theatrical family. Her father, Mervyn Johns, had a long career as a character actor and her mother was a pianist. She was born in Pretoria, South Africa, because her parents were visiting the area on tour at the time of her birth. Johns was a dancer at 12 and an actor at 14 in London’s West End. Her breakthrough role was as the amorous mermaid in the title of the 1948 hit comedy “Miranda.” “I was quite an athlete, my muscles were strong from dancing, so the tail was just fine; I swam like a porpoise,” she told Newsday in 1998. In 1960’s “The Sundowners,” with Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum, she was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar. (She lost out to Shirley Jones in “Elmer Gantry.”) Other highlights include playing the mother in “Mary Poppins,” the movie that introduced Julie Andrews and where she sang the rousing tune “Sister Suffragette.” She also starred in the 1989 Broadway revival of “The Circle,” W. Somerset Maugham’s romantic comedy about love, marriage and fidelity, opposite Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger. “I’ve retired many times. My personal life has come before my work. The theater is just part of my life. It probably uses my highest sense of intelligence, so therefore I have to come back to it, to realize that I’ve got the talent. I’m not as good doing anything else,” she told the AP. To prepare for “A Coffin in Egypt,” Horton Foote’s 1998 play about a grand dame reminiscing about her life on and off a ranch on the Texas prairie, she asked the Texas-born Foote to record a short tape of himself reading some lines and used it as her coach. In a 1991 revival of “A Little Night Music” in Los Angeles, she played Madame Armfeldt, the mother of Desiree, the part she had created. In 1963, she starred in her own TV sitcom “Glynis.” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/taylor-swift-2009-interview-travis-kelce_n_6596df12e4b0912833af3a52,Fans Think A 2009 Taylor Swift Interview Proves Travis Kelce Is Perfect For Her,marco margaritoff,1/4/2024,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s romance was written in the stars — or at least in Glamour magazine. One observant fan spotted as much this week after flipping through a 2009 issue featuring Swift on the cover. In the Glamour article, the singer-songwriter described her ideal partner. Swifties were stunned when those words seemed to perfectly match the man she’s dating today. “I think it’s more a question of confidence,” Swift, 19 at the time, told Glamour. “I wouldn’t want to be with a pushover who would let me make all the plans and have all the control,” she continued. “It’s really natural for me to go into planning mode, but I’d rather be with someone who has his own voice and passion and ambition.” Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, is arguably the farthest thing from a pushover, since his job involves regularly blocking tackles for his quarterback. As for having his own voice ― well, Kelce does host a weekly podcast with his brother. Swift also said in the Glamour interview that it can put strain on a romantic relationship when one person is a professional entertainer and the other isn’t. After “interviews all day” and being “on stage every night,” Swift told the magazine, she “can only give someone what’s left.” “It’s always going to be long-distance, even if I date the boy who lives next door to me in Nashville,” she added. “I’ll be flying to see him and flying him places to see me. It feels like it would involve more scheduling, and I already deal with a lot of scheduling in my life.” Swift told the outlet she “would probably stop thinking that way” if only she “met somebody who was worth it.” Fast forward to 2024, and the singer has not only flown out to Kansas City, New York and Boston to see Kelce play, but seen him return the favor. What about that “question of confidence” Swift emphasized? Kelce arguably answered it months before they hard-launched their relationship in October. He not only tried to give her his number at an “Eras Tour” concert in July, but spoke about the attempt on his podcast. “Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” Swift recently told Time magazine, which named her its Person of the Year for 2023. “We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to know each other.” Swifties are naturally overwhelmed at how prescient the singer’s old interview has proven. found this magazine with taylor on the cover from 2009 and this is what she said about being in a relationship back then omg some of it still applies pic.twitter.com/fqGaVxHEP7 Not her describing Trav, 15 years back 😭 https://t.co/iCgIeHSHl6 It still applies today, I wonder if some of her views and mindsets have changed, but I'm calling this pure manifestation 🥹 https://t.co/qcIo6oZ4fE i am not gonna say it but I am thinking it https://t.co/f7JSbrVYDD We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/perry-iowa-school-shooting-dead-injured_n_65971d7ee4b0bf73e178d83d,"Teen Shooter Kills 1, Injures 5 At Small-Town Iowa School, Police Say","nicholas riccardi , hannah fingerhut",1/4/2024,"PERRY, Iowa (AP) — A sixth grader was killed and five other people were wounded by a 17-year-old suspect in a shooting Thursday at a small-town Iowa high school, authorities in Perry, Iowa, said. The suspect died of what investigators believe is a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and at least one of the victims is a school administrator, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity. Perry has about 8,000 residents and is about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Des Moines, on the edge of the state capital’s metropolitan area. It is home to a large pork-processing plant, and low-slung, single story homes spread among trees now shorn of their leaves by winter. The high school and middle school are connected, sitting on the east edge of town. High school senior Ava Augustus said she was in a counselor’s office, waiting for hers to arrive, when she heard three shots. She and other people barricaded the door, preparing to throw things if necessary, with a window being too small for an escape. “And then we hear ‘He’s down. You can go out,’” Augustus said through tears. ”And I run and you can just see glass everywhere, blood on the floor. I get to my car and they’re taking a girl out of the auditorium who had been shot in her leg.” Three gunshot victims were taken by ambulance to Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines, a spokesperson for its health system said. Some other patients were transported to a second hospital in Des Moines, a spokesperson for MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center confirmed, declining to comment on the number of patients or their statuses. Vigils were planned Thursday evening at a park and a local church. A post on the high school’s Facebook page said it would be closed Friday, with counseling services planned at the public library Friday and Saturday. In Washington, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland was briefed on the shooting. FBI agents from the Omaha-Des Moines office are assisting with the investigation led by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. The shooting occurred in the backdrop of Iowa’s first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses. GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy had a campaign event scheduled in Perry at 9 a.m. about 1 1/2 miles (2.4 kilometers) from the high school but canceled it to have a prayer and intimate discussion with area residents. Mass shootings across the U.S. have long brought calls for stricter gun laws from gun safety advocates, and Thursday’s did within hours. But that idea has been a non-starter for many Republicans, particularly in rural, GOP-leaning states like Iowa. As of July 2021, Iowa does not require a permit to purchase a handgun or carry a firearm in public, though it mandates a background check for a person buying a handgun without a permit. Ramaswamy said the shooting is a sign of a “psychological sickness” in the country. In Des Moines, GOP rival and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said that gun violence “is more of a local and state issue” in an interview with the Des Moines Register and NBC News. The high school in Perry is part of the 1,785-student Perry Community School District. The town is more diverse than Iowa as a whole, with census figures showing that 31% of the residents are Hispanic, compared to less than 7% for the state. Those figures also show that nearly 19% of the town’s residents were born outside the U.S. An active shooter was reported at 7:37 a.m. Thursday and officers arrived seven minutes later, Dallas County Sheriff Adam Infante said. Emergency vehicles surrounded the middle and high school. Zander Shelley, 15, was in a hallway when he heard gunshots and dashed into a classroom, according to his father, Kevin Shelley. Zander was grazed twice and hid in the classroom before texting his father at 7:36 a.m. Kevin Shelley, who drives a garbage truck, told his boss he had to run. “It was the most scared I’ve been in my entire life,” he said. Rachael Kares, an 18-year-old senior, was wrapping up jazz band practice when she and her bandmates heard what she described as four gunshots, spaced apart. “We all just jumped,” Kares said. “My band teacher looked at us and yelled, ‘Run!’ So we ran.” Kares and many others from the school ran out past the football field, as she heard people yelling, “Get out! Get out!” She said she heard additional shots as she ran, but didn’t know how many. She was more concerned about getting home to her 3-year-old son. “At that moment I didn’t care about anything except getting out because I had to get home with my son,” she said. Erica Jolliff said that her daughter, a ninth grader, reported getting rushed from the school grounds at 7:45 am. Distraught, Jolliff was still looking for her son Amir, a sixth grader, one hour later. “I just want to know that he’s safe and OK,” Jolliff said. “They won’t tell me nothing.” ___ Fingerhut reported from Sioux City, Iowa.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), the House’s third-ranking Republican, announced Thursday on social media that she had withdrawn her endorsement of Craig Riedel, a GOP former state representative running for Congress from Ohio. “I was very disappointed in his inappropriate comments regarding President Trump,” Stefanik said. “As we begin 2024, my focus is on ensuring we nominate the strongest candidates on the ballot who are committed to electing President Trump this November and expanding our House GOP Majority.” Riedel’s crime? He said he wouldn’t endorse Trump and suggested his habit of insulting people is not presidential. “I think he is arrogant. I don’t like the way he calls people names. I just don’t think that’s very becoming of a president,” Riedel said in an audio recording posted by right-wing activist Charlie Kirk last month. Stefanik’s un-endorsement is the latest signal of the Republican Party’s complete and total loyalty to Donald Trump, even as he faces a slew of criminal indictments, including for his efforts to steal the 2020 election and incite the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Within an hour of the recording going online, Riedel announced he would, in fact, endorse Trump and claimed that a “trickster” aligned with Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had goaded him into making anti-Trump statements. But the damage had been done. Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio) immediately rescinded his Riedel endorsement, and days later Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) announced he would support Riedel’s opponent in the Republican primary, J.R. Majewski. Some Republicans had previously hoped Riedel would beat Majewski in the GOP primary because Riedel would likely be a stronger candidate in the general election. Majewski failed to unseat Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) in 2022 after it came out that Majewski had lied about his military service. Majewski suggested this week that Riedel was the bigger fraud, saying on social media that Riedel had “presented himself as a Trump supporter and accepted hundred of thousands in campaign cash knowing he was a closet never-Trumper.” The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/harvard-university-president-claudine-gay-nyt-oped_n_6596f78de4b0bf73e178b9d8,Harvard President Warns Of A ‘Broader War’ Against ‘Pillars Of American Society’,sanjana karanth,1/4/2024,"Claudine Gay ― the Harvard University president who announced her resignation this week amid a right-wing campaign accusing her of antisemitism and plagiarism ― said Thursday that her ouster is part of a “broader war” to undermine public faith in the “pillars of American society” like academia. Gay, who was Harvard’s first Black president and also serves as a professor of government and African American studies, penned an op-ed in The New York Times two days after she sent a letter to the Harvard community announcing she would step down as president and remain part of the faculty. “For weeks, both I and the institution to which I’ve devoted my professional life have been under attack,” she wrote in the Times. “My character and intelligence have been impugned. My commitment to fighting antisemitism has been questioned. My inbox has been flooded with invective, including death threats. I’ve been called the N-word more times than I care to count.” “My hope is that by stepping down I will deny demagogues the opportunity to further weaponize my presidency in their campaign to undermine the ideals animating Harvard since its founding: excellence, openness, independence, truth,” she continued. Gay’s resignation came after weeks of pressure on the university to punish the president for not directly answering a question from Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) about whether calls on campus for the genocide of Jewish students ― or even the use of controversial pro-Palestinian expressions like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” ― would violate Harvard’s rules. Gay, along with two other university presidents, said in a congressional hearing that the acceptability of any on-campus speech regarding the violence in Gaza would depend on the context. The remarks by the various presidents drew an immediate firestorm of criticism. In her op-ed, Gay acknowledged that she has “made mistakes,” citing her initial response to the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants against Israel. She wrote that during the congressional hearing, she should have condemned antisemitic behavior more forcefully. The Harvard Corporation, the school’s governing board, supported Gay during the controversy by saying she was defending the university’s academic freedom. More recently, Gay ― who was president for less than a year ― came under fire after right-wing voices accused her of plagiarizing other scholars in her own peer-reviewed academic writings on the significance of people from marginalized communities holding office in American politics. According to Gay, her research found that “when historically marginalized communities gain a meaningful voice in the halls of power, it signals an open door where before many saw only barriers,” resulting in a strengthened democracy. Harvard acknowledged some instances of inadequate citation in Gay’s work, but said that she quickly corrected them. Gay said the process of correcting duplications was “consistent with how I have seen similar faculty cases handled at Harvard.” “I have never misrepresented my research findings, nor have I ever claimed credit for the research of others,” she wrote on Thursday. “Moreover, the citation errors should not obscure a fundamental truth: I proudly stand by my work and its impact on the field.” The resignation makes Gay’s tenure the shortest of any Harvard president, and comes at a time when academic institutions increasingly face threats of censorship from mostly right-wing figures who seek to stifle speech from people who come from marginalized backgrounds. “It is not lost on me that I make an ideal canvas for projecting every anxiety about the generational and demographic changes unfolding on American campuses: a Black woman selected to lead a storied institution,” Gay wrote. She urged the public to be “more skeptical than ever of the loudest and most extreme voices in our culture.” The outgoing president also said that the campaign to push her out of her role was “merely a single skirmish in a broader war to unravel public faith in pillars of American society.” “Campaigns of this kind often start with attacks on education and expertise, because these are the tools that best equip communities to see through propaganda,” she wrote. “But such campaigns don’t end there. Trusted institutions of all types ― from public health agencies to news organizations ― will continue to fall victim to coordinated attempts to undermine their legitimacy and ruin their leaders’ credibility.” The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/vivek-ramaswamy-time-running-out_n_6596f832e4b0912833af4fb0,Vivek Ramaswamy Is Running Out Of Time,daniel marans,1/4/2024,"Biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy had a rough holiday season. Around Christmas, Ramaswamy stopped advertising on television. The famously (or maybe infamously) aggressive debate-stage gladiator will not qualify for the final televised debate before the Iowa caucuses. And in line with Ramaswamy’s late-in-the-game embrace of right-wing conspiracy theories, his campaign’s idea of a last-minute coup is landing the endorsement of former U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, a far-right lawmaker whose history of racist remarks led to his defeat in a Republican primary in 2020. “He’s a very intelligent podcaster,” said Will Ritter, a Republican television ad maker, referencing Ramaswamy’s prolific podcasting as a candidate. “He should stick to podcasting.” David Kochel, a longtime Iowa Republican strategist who advised Jeb Bush’s 2016 campaign, put it slightly differently. “He’s the Ted Talk candidate,” he said. For a brief moment over the summer, Ramaswamy’s outsider background, intelligence, and Donald Trump-like penchant for provocation had him nipping at the heels of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. His dominant performance in the inaugural debate prompted national interest in his candidacy from conservative voters ― because of, rather than in spite of, the revulsion he inspired among liberals. But a host of factors have converged to reduce Ramaswamy’s chances of success to somewhere in the “slim-to-none” range. He is now in fourth place in polls of the Iowa caucuses with an average of 6% support. In New Hampshire, which Ramaswamy’s campaign expected to be more favorable for his bid, the candidate is polling slightly lower on average. Ramaswamy’s campaign maintains that the polls fail to capture the depth of the entrepreneur’s support since so much of the excitement he generates is among first-time caucus-goers not targeted by public surveys. “Vivek is attracting new voters to the party who resonate with his message — from libertarians to independents to young people who are excited to vote in their first election for him, he is creating a broad coalition that will shock the system,” said Zachery Henry, a Ramaswamy campaign spokesperson. Henry also rejected the idea that the campaign’s drawdown on television, where it had spent $4.7 million to date, was tantamount to throwing in the towel. He claimed that the campaign has increased its paid communication spending outside of TV, which it sees as a more efficient use of cash. “We are focused on bringing out the voters we’ve identified,” Henry said. “And the best way to reach them is using addressable advertising, mail, text, live calls, and knock on doors to communicate with our voters on Vivek’s vision for America, making sure they have a plan to caucus, and then turning them out.” The campaign does not rule out returning to the television airwaves in the final week before the Jan. 15 caucus. A new infusion of cash will make that possible. Ramaswamy has spent $26 million of his own money on his candidacy, according to the campaign. Axios reported that he has since sold $33 million in stock to invest significant new sums into the campaign. “From libertarians to independents to young people who are excited to vote in their first election for him, he is creating a broad coalition that will shock the system.” But it’s unlikely that new money can succeed where the old money fell short. And while every outsider candidate promises to win by reshaping the electorate, few have pulled it off ― not least someone with a polling deficit as large as Ramaswamy’s. What is instead more plausible is that Ramaswamy could not convert the initial novelty of his bid into sustained support. Ramaswamy’s approach has been inconsistent, relying on a flood-the-zone strategy with media appearances and debate performances, which ultimately failed to make a compelling enough case for his candidacy. After a pugilistic opening round on the debate stage, Ramaswamy pivoted to the role of peacemaker in the second debate, calling on his fellow candidates to be more respectful to one another. The shift in tone raised questions about his authenticity. “The fact that he was two completely different people between the first debate and the second debate gave people the impression that he’s a performer,” Kochel said. “I think he just comes across as a phony.” In his third and fourth debate performances, Ramaswamy was a prizefighter once more, but often in ways that seemed counterproductive. Time and again, he aired his contempt for former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley with gleeful put-downs that failed to stall her rise in the polls. In November, when Ramaswamy accused Haley of hypocrisy for allowing her daughter to use TikTok while she called for banning it, Haley shot back, “You’re just scum.” Ritter likened Ramaswamy’s short-lived popularity to other fad candidacies, like businessman Herman Cain’s in 2012. “People who might be a little bored of the primary gave him a chance,” Ritter said. “But he continued to embarrass himself by being zany in the debates.” Now Ramaswamy appears to be closing his campaign by embracing the right wing’s more outlandish conspiracy theories. In the most recent Republican debate in December, Ramaswamy declared himself the sole candidate willing to argue that the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, “does now look like an inside job.” He has accompanied his appeals to right-wing paranoia with tirades against the media and the “establishment” that have met with applause from audiences of likely Iowa caucus-goers, who continue to turn out for his events across the state. But Ramaswamy’s appeal with a segment of the GOP grassroots has failed to generate an uptick in the polls. That disparity underscores the main obstacle for Ramaswamy: Trump, the man he is most often compared with. With Trump in the GOP’s populist lane, there was precious little room for anyone else. “If you like Vivek’s message, you’re already voting for Trump,” Kochel said. “If Trump looked wounded like he wasn’t going to be able to get the nomination, Vivek might get another look. But Trump is leading by 30 points, so why throw away your vote?” Indeed, trying to be Trump while also trying to beat Trump has put Ramaswamy in an awkward place messaging-wise. His latest argument for why he would be a better president than Trump is that he is less bloodied by the political and legal attacks to which Trump has been subject. “They’ve got four different wars they’ve waged on this man,” he told NBC News’s Dasha Burns on Wednesday as part of the “Closing Arguments: Iowa” interview series. “At the end of the day, if we need a commander-in-chief who is going to lead us to victory, I think that our base needs to choose the general who is not yet wounded in that war.” One advantage of Ramaswamy’s youthful ― and more libertarian ― brand of Trumpian nationalism is that however he fares in Iowa and New Hampshire, he will almost assuredly emerge unscathed with the party’s core base of Trump loyalists and alternative media consumers. In lieu of next Wednesday’s CNN debate, he will hold a live audience event in Des Moines with conspiratorial right-wing radio host Tim Pool. “The Steve King endorsement is maybe a sign that he’s not really running for president, but he’s maybe running to be the next Alex Jones or Nick Fuentes or something that I don’t quite understand,” Kochel said. Ramaswamy’s campaign and allies maintain that he is still well-positioned to defy the polls by turning out first-time caucusgoers who are less likely to respond to polling and watch television. One such booster is former Iowa Secretary of State Matt Schultz, who backed the two previous Republican winners of the Iowa caucuses: then-Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum in 2012 and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016. He sees an excitement for Ramaswamy at campaign stops that reminds him of the late-moving momentum for Santorum. The next four years will change America forever.

Ladapo has challenged coronavirus mandates and vaccines since his controversial appointment by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in late 2021. In a letter to Ladapo last month, the FDA broke down his claims while calling his concerns that DNA fragments could enter a cell’s nucleus “quite implausible.” Peter Marks, the director of the FDA’s center for biologics evaluation and research, cited animal studies with mRNA technology over the last decade that he said show no evidence of genotoxicity, which damages genetic information in a cell and causes cell mutations. He also cited ongoing surveillance of more than 1 billion doses of mRNA coronavirus vaccines that have been administered to humans globally, with “nothing to indicate harm to the genome, such as increased rates of cancers.” The next four years will change America forever.

Which is why I don’t get why he does this stuff,” he said while highlighting the 8,000-plus Floridians who died from the coronavirus last year.

Of course, you also don’t want to be fussing with your old, semi-broken snowblower that takes forever to turn on, runs on smelly gas and is too cumbersome to use. To help you stay safe and shoveled-out this winter, we rounded up some highly rated easy-to-use electric snow blowers in a variety of sizes. Whether you’re plowing a large plot or just need to dig out a little walkway, these reviewer-loved machines are here to save you some major time, sweat and tears. Every option has a slew of reviews saying that it’s physically easy to move around, a low-maintenance appliance, or both. Most are cordless and run on reusable batteries, but some need to be plugged in. For the latter, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute says to ensure you’re using an outdoor extension cord that’s long enough to safely plow your area without you tripping or running over the cord. OPEI also suggests grabbing a snow blower clean-out tool to ensure you are never, ever reaching into your snow blower, even when it’s completely turned off. We hope you find an option that works for you and your household to keep spirits bright, even as the snow falls.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-jack-smith-trial-contempt_n_6596e5cae4b0912833af42ca,"Trump Asks Court To Find Jack Smith In Contempt, In Further Bid To Delay Jan. 6 Trial",paul blumenthal,1/4/2024,"Former President Donald Trump asked the district court judge overseeing his trial for his actions leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, to hold special counsel Jack Smith in contempt of court, according to a filing submitted on Thursday. Trump’s filing claims that Smith, who is prosecuting the former president in a D.C. federal court, is in violation of a stay order put in place by Judge Tanya Chutkan after the prosecutor submitted new pretrial filings during the ongoing stay period. The stay order was put in place after Trump appealed a previous decision by Chutkan rejecting Trump’s assertion of absolute immunity from criminal prosecution. That appeal will be heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals on Jan. 9. Smith’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The argument Trump puts forward in his filing is that Smith’s motions are filled with “partisan rhetoric” that “mirrors the Biden Administration’s dishonest talking points.” Since Trump is relieved of having to respond by the stay order, “the prosecutors seek to weaponize the Stay to spread political propaganda.” Like many Trump-related legal motions, this filing is likely little more than a bid to buy time. Since his multiple indictments for trying to steal the 2020 election and illegally taking classified documents, Trump has engaged in a legal battle to delay his trials as much as possible, since he would become immune from prosecution, and even have the power to dismiss federal charges, if he were to win the 2024 election and take office again. Trump faces four charges in the trial, including conspiracy to defraud the country by lying about election fraud, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding for planning to derail the counting of electoral votes on Jan. 6, obstruction of an official proceeding for the attempt to do so, and conspiracy against rights for his efforts to threaten people’s right to vote. It’s one of four separate legal battles the former president is facing: two related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, one regarding his alleged mishandling of classified documents, and one relating to his 2016 hush money payment to a porn star. The request that Smith be held in contempt revolves around the prosecutor’s continued filing of pretrial motions during the stay period where Trump is relieved of the “burdens of litigation.” That relief means that Trump need not respond to motions filed by the prosecution until the appeal is concluded. The prosecution’s continued motions, Trump argues, place an ongoing burden of litigation on him, in contravention of the stay order. The next four years will change America forever.

Log in to hide these messages. The pretrial filings Trump accuses Smith of improperly submitting are known as motions in limine, which state what evidence or arguments should be held inadmissible during the trial. The court previously ordered Smith to file these motions by Jan. 9, which is also the date Trump’s appeal is slated to be heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Smith’s motions aim to hold that filing deadline, which Chutkan said may still stand, depending on the appeal verdict, in her stay order. With Trump asking the court to rule that the prosecution’s motions be withdrawn, and that they be forbidden from submitting any more filings until the stay is lifted, the contempt request can be seen as Trump’s effort to tie up Smith’s motions and further delay the trial if he loses his appeal.

On Wednesday, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) said in a statement shared on X, formerly Twitter, that he was “proud to endorse” Trump for president. A day earlier, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) endorsed Trump in a similar statement on X. Both men had thrown their hats in the ring during the chaotic House speaker race last year. In a lengthy Truth Social blast at the time, Trump called Emmer a “RINO,” an acronym for “Republican in name only,” and said voting for him would be a “tragic mistake.” Emmer voted to certify the 2020 election results, which Trump has falsely claimed were rigged. When Scalise was up against Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) for the job, Trump endorsed Jordan and cited Scalise’s cancer diagnosis as a concern. “I never cease to be amazed at how willing these people are to sacrifice their honor and their dignity to worship this man and keep a job,” Conway said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Thursday. “It’s not worth being a member of Congress if you have to kowtow to a psychopath like this,” he added. Psaki, who served as President Joe Biden’s first White House press secretary, said the lawmakers look pathetic and spineless. “Their dignity is looking, you know, is being questioned here for good reason,” she said. “It’s sad and pathetic, and it’s an addiction to Donald Trump by the core of the Republican Party,” she added. Trump leads the GOP presidential pack by a significant margin, even though he has been criminally indicted four times on dozens of felony counts. Nonetheless, few elected Republicans have been willing to criticize him, and even his presidential rivals are reluctant to go after him.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/michael-fanone-2024-message-voters_n_65957bcbe4b0f27b6e35ff9c,Michael Fanone Has A Grave Warning For Voters,josephine harvey,1/4/2024,"Former D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone believes the 2024 election will be the most consequential of his lifetime. “The future of our democracy is at stake,” he told HuffPost this week, when asked what he’d like to say to voters. “Ultimately, you, the American voter, will be the last line of defense when it comes to preserving democracy as we know it and ensuring the peaceful transfer of power. And it’s that serious.” “I’ve been of voting age for many, many years, and every year it seems that we’re told by politicians that this election is ‘unlike any other,’” he continued. “But I’m nobody, just some average American, and I’m telling you that this election is like no other.” Fanone, who sustained a heart attack and traumatic brain injury after he was beaten and electroshocked by supporters of then-President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, spoke to HuffPost ahead of the third anniversary of the Capitol riot. He said that in a lot of ways, he’s come to terms with his experience that day, and resolved much of his trauma. But he’s infuriated by Republicans’ ongoing whitewashing and lies about what took place. “Imagine the most traumatic, or a traumatic event in your life, that reaches the level of attention that January 6 garnered,” he said. “I mean, it was an international story. And spending three years trying to convince people that it actually fucking happened.” “It’s frustrating,” he said. “It’s angering. It’s perplexing.” A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released this week found that in the years since a December 2021 survey, the number of Republicans who believed President Joe Biden’s election was legitimate had dropped from 39% to 31%. It also showed Republicans becoming less likely to believe that Jan. 6 rioters were mostly violent, and more likely to absolve Trump of responsibility for the attack. Alarmingly, a quarter of respondents said they believed the conspiracy theory, promoted by multiple prominent Republicans, that the FBI organized the insurrection. Fanone told HuffPost that lies “are the source of Donald Trump’s stranglehold over his supporters.” “Without those lies, I think that you would start to see his support erode,” he said. “But there’s the whole idea that the election, the 2020 election was stolen, not just from Trump, as he says, but from his voters. That really is the source of his power.” Trump is by far the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. But even if he weren’t, Fanone said he would have “a very difficult time” voting for any Republican candidate, “unless the party itself is willing to acknowledge the role that it played” in making the Capitol attack possible and subsequently whitewashing it. Fanone said he voted for Trump in 2016, but now believes that “Republicans have become the party of insurrection.” In Fanone’s view, Trump’s Republican rivals have largely hesitated to speak out against the quadruply indicted former president because they’re afraid of him and his political power. “I think it’s disgraceful,” Fanone said. “I think that any of those candidates who are unwilling to call out Donald Trump and MAGA for what it is don’t deserve to run for office.” Facing 91 felony counts, including two indictments connected to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, Trump has only intensified his election fraud lies, and has lain the groundwork to contest this year’s results should he lose. He has also leaned increasingly into authoritarian rhetoric and reportedly plans to implement an even more extreme agenda should he win a second term, including by using the Justice Department to exact revenge on political opponents. Fanone said his own priorities boil down to protecting democracy in 2024. “For me, the single most important issue is democracy,” he said. “And I see President Joe Biden as our best defender of democracy.” He said he doesn’t have much planned to mark the date on Saturday. “I don’t think about my experience on January 6 on the anniversaries,” he said. “I just think about where we are as a country and how far we have to go.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pooping-wrong-better-tips-tricks_l_6581a8dce4b01d1b95353964,Want To Poop Better? Your Dog Might Have The Answer.,am i doing it wrong?,1/4/2024,"Thanks to processed foods, stress, less-than-stellar microbiomes and a slew of other factors, attaining the perfect poop is a challenge for many people. Because so many of us want to be doing it better, there are countless books, websites and TikTok videos offering advice on how to level up in the bathroom. But the key to going number two like a pro might actually be the furry friend snoozing on the couch next to you. “I always say, look at dogs: Your dogs poop beautifully,” Dr. Evan Goldstein, a nationally renowned anal surgeon and the CEO and founder of Bespoke Surgical, told us — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, co-hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — when we recently chatted with him. “It’s the diet, and [dogs] go when they actually need to ― not like ‘I need to go to work, so I need to force it.’” Dogs also squat when they defecate, which Goldstein said was another important component of a healthy pooping routine. “Have you ever seen a baby with a diaper that just stands but kind of squats? That’s kind of the positioning [that’s best for pooping],” Goldstein said. “[Squatting] is really putting all of the pressure away. It’s dispersing pressure as much as possible, so that now, everything is opening to give the capacity so you can evacuate [your poop] and be comfortable with it. If you’re pushing and pushing and red in the face ― don’t do that! And then you have to look at diet and what you’re eating, and fiber and motility agents.” Deciding on a pooping position is a personal choice, Goldstein noted, adding that people sometimes opt to prop their legs up on a stack of books or use a Squatty Potty-style toilet stool. “Some people put their arms up ... like on a roller coaster, because it straightens the colon, it changes the angle for people,” he said. One other reason Goldstein praised dogs’ approach to pooping? “They don’t need to clean [after they go] — at least for the most part,” he said. He noted that “the preferred method of wiping is not wiping,” as the use of toilet paper and too much rubbing can harm the thin, delicate skin around the anus. Instead, Goldstein recommended using a bidet or cleaning in the shower, and then gently patting the area dry. If you’re going to wipe, he recommended a gentle swipe or two while sitting down on the toilet, and then finishing wiping — or, more ideally, “blotting” — in a partly squatting, partly standing position, which he said keeps pressure off the area. Ultimately, Goldstein said, “think of pooping as ‘less is always more.’ We don’t want to be going a bazillion times a day. We want to wipe less. We want to create an environment where it’s like ‘drop and leave.’” Just like our dogs. Goldstein also chatted with us about what an ideal poop looks like (spoiler alert: your dog is your role model here too), why he wants wet wipes banned, and much more: After you’ve had a listen above or wherever you get your podcasts, subscribe to “Am I Doing It Wrong?” so you don’t miss a single episode, including our investigations of the ins and outs of tipping, how to score the best deals on airline tickets, apologizing, vanquishing your credit card debt, finding love online, online shopping, overcoming anxiety, making a big life change and getting a tattoo.

The “Transformers” star, who was reportedly confirmed Sunday by Bishop Robert Barron, was celebrated Tuesday in a Facebook post by the Capuchin Franciscans’ Western American Province. LaBeouf was shown smiling alongside robed friars, who were “overjoyed” at his decision. “We are thrilled to share that our dear friend Shia LaBeouf has fully entered the Church this past weekend through the sacrament of confirmation! The Capuchin Franciscan friars are overjoyed to welcome him into the fold and witness his deep commitment to his faith journey,” the post said. Elsewhere, the post went on to say that LaBeouf’s decision to join the church “is a testament to his sincere desire to grow in his relationship with God and live out the Gospel values.” “As Capuchin Franciscans, we believe in the transformative power of faith and the incredible impact it can have on one’s life. We are humbled and grateful to walk alongside Shia as he takes this important step in his spiritual journey.” LaBeouf was born to a Christian father and Jewish mother; he was both baptized as a child and had a bar mitzvah at 13. In a 2022 interview, LaBeouf told Bishop Barron his Jewish faith “felt fake” because he never properly “invested” in it and was largely committed to the teachings because his grandmother wanted him to. He reportedly converted to Catholicism after starring in the titular role of Abel Ferrara’s 2020 film, “Padre Pio.” The eponymous Capuchin friar, who is venerated as a saint, was purportedly marked by stigmata. LaBeouf’s confirmation sponsor, Brother Alexander Rodriguez, told the Catholic News Agency on Wednesday that the actor plans to become a deacon “sometime in the future.” Rodriguez, who starred as a friar in “Pio” and helped LaBeouf prepare for playing the Italian priest, said LaBeouf was inspired during production. “He just spontaneously said, ‘I want to become a deacon,’ and he still feels that way,” Rodriguez said. In May 2023, LaBeouf told ChurchPOP he was enrolled in the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults and had seven months left to be confirmed into the church. His conversion in 2022, meanwhile, notably arrived after a string of harrowing allegations against him. LaBeouf was accused in late 2020 by his ex-girlfriend, FKA Twigs, of “relentless abuse” that allegedly included sexual battery, assault and emotional distress. The actor told The New York Times at the time that he has “no excuses” for his alcoholism, “only rationalizations.” “I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years,” he said. LaBeouf’s trial is scheduled for Oct. 14, 2024. Need help? Visit RAINN’s National Sexual Assault Online Hotline or the National Sexual Violence Resource Center’s website.

Had a talk with the kids at dinner about New Year’s resolutions but I guess the 6yo doesn’t quite grasp the concept because she went around the table and told each of us what SHE thinks WE should do better and…..you guys I think she might be onto something. 😆 Kids New Year’s resolution?Make dad build a new bed 😂😂Thanks kid… that’s not how this works [January 1st]My wife's resolution to yell at the kids less takes a very bad turn. Anonymously I asked kids (aged 6) to write new years resolutions. Here are some favorites...""Eat more butter""""Build a mud hut""""Learn to drive""""Try my hardest at everything but not maths""""Make a new language""""Invent Google"" for 2024 i've made a resolution to be the parent i always thought i'd be before i had kids. the first step will be getting rid of the kids. A mom’s New Year resolutions:Less pants, more leggings, and a heck of a lot more pajamas. Taught my son about New Year’s resolutions. He resolved to be a giraffe. I thought about setting a New Years Resolution to never yell at our kids.But I changed it to losing 50 pounds, training a baby elephant to read Shakespeare, and running a 100 mile ultramarathon while wearing a Donald Duck costume.Because I want the goal to be attainable. Me: [Explained New Year’s resolution to Kid #1] Have one?Kid #1: Yes, to do better at math-Me: Wow! Wasn’t expecting that.Kid #1: So I can go to college, buy a big house & be my OWN BOSS & do what I WANT. My toddler’s New Years resolution is to push every button, beep every beep, and make me lose the last shreds of sanity, patience, and scalp hair that’s left to me.Happy New Year my ass. New Years Resolutions last week: Drink less, Get fit, Spend more time with my kids.New Years Resolutions this week: Spend less time drinking around my fit kids. My 8yo told me her New Year’s resolution is not to step on anthills if anyone needs a lesson in realistic goal-setting. Went shopping and asked my 4 year old if he could please make it an easy trip and he replied “I WILL NEVER MAKE IT EASY!” so I guess his New Year’s resolution is to get into resistance training. Me: My new years resolution in 2020? I'm gonna try and be more patient and understandin-Kid: my spaghetti touched my cornMe:Kid: I need new spaghettiMe:Kid: and cornMe: 2021 will be a new me on the bus.kid 1: my new years resolution is to be less annoying kid 2: good luck with that kid 1: yeah, it’s gonna be a toughie. same, tbh. Today I told Jack that his New Year's resolution should be to not kick daddy in the face quite so often.He laughed.So I'm not feeling hopeful with that one.#NewYearsResolutions Discussing New Year’s resolutions with the kids and my 4-year-old’s resolution is “face painting.” I believe in her. If my kids made New Year’s resolutions they’d look something like this: Convince mom to turn off screen time Annoy siblings more often Ask for money at least twice a weekConvince mom that roblox is educational Eat more chicken nuggets Ask WHY in a whiny voice everyday We’re testing out an early New Year’s celebration for the kids, changed the clocks to 3 hours ahead. Wish us luck, because nothing says “New Year’s Resolution” quite like beginning 2024 with a lie. My husband asked if I had a new year’s resolution and I told him it was to not yell at the kids and then we both fell about laughing HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/baby-names-2024-popular-trends_l_6578df82e4b0881b7918dde3,9 Baby Name Trends To Look Out For This Year,caroline bologna,1/4/2024,"Although classics like James, Charlotte and William have dominated the baby name popularity lists in recent years, American parents are finding inspiration from a variety of sources. Indeed, certain sounds, meanings, aesthetic qualities and even pop culture moments can play a role in the names people choose for their children in a given time period. “Long ago are the days of choosing a generic name simply because ‘it sounded good,’” baby name consultant Taylor Humphrey told HuffPost. “In my business, I witness such intentionality around the process of choosing a name that deeply resonates with both parents.” To get a sense of what’s resonating with people these days, HuffPost asked naming experts to share some of the themes they think will influence parents’ baby name choices this year. We’ve rounded up nine interesting trends below. “I believe we will see more names with the very chic ’O-’ending,” Humphrey said. She noted that this is especially true with names for boys like Mateo, Enzo, Milo and Thiago. The vowel sound ending offers something a little more playful and unexpected next to so many names that end in consonants. Other popular O-enders due for increased (or continued) popularity in 2024 include Hugo, Apollo, Arlo, Leo, Cosmo, Theo, Margot, Cleo and Santiago. “Maverick ranks in the boys’ Top 50,” said Abby Sandel, creator of the baby name blog Appellation Mountain. “Legend isn’t far behind, and names like Legacy are climbing, too. Parents name for meaning, but it’s less about old-school religious virtues, like Modesty or Prudence. Instead, we’re opting for Wilder and Rowdy ― high-energy names that suggest adventure.” She also highlighted “thoughtful” names like Knowledge and Wisdom. “And when we do opt for something spiritual, it’s likely to be a symbolic word name, like Shepherd, Chosen, or Psalm,” Sandel added. “One specific trend we expect to gain more ground is girl names for boys,” said baby naming expert and Nameberry editor-in-chief Sophie Kihm. “Celebrities like Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, with their son Wren, and Rhianna, with her son Riot Rose, are leading the charge. A combination of increasingly progressive societal views on gender identity and appreciation for softness and symbolism is behind this trend.” Sandel echoed this theory, observing that the list of Top 1,000 names for girls has become a solid place to look for naming inspiration for boys. “For ages, conventional wisdom held that names would fall in use for boys if they caught on for girls,” she noted. “That’s just not true anymore. Names like Eden, Sutton, and Murphy made the girls’ Top 1,000 first, before becoming stylish for boys, too. Now Wren and Scout are set to be the newest crossovers from the girls’ list.” “Antique names continue to grow, along with very modern names,” said Sherri Suzanne, a baby name consultant and the founder of My Name for Life. “However, the most desired names in my practice remain familiar-but-underused classics ― names that are known but never achieved great popularity or have waned in popularity over time. It may explain why names from the mid-to-late 20th century may be reappearing sooner than expected.” She listed Scott, Kelly, Linda and Eileen as examples that have been popping up again lately. Heidi Prunkl, a name consultant and founder of Baby Name Sunday, has also taken note of vintage names that carry a sense of familiarity without feeling overused. “Definitely we will see more ‘old man’ names for boys like Monty, Ralph and Willis,” she said. “A generation grew up answering to Hailey, Kaylee, and Kylie; Kayla, Kaitlyn, and Brooklynn,” Sandel said. “The urge to mix and match to create new names remains strong, but here’s the twist for the 2020s: the first element is a nature name. We’ve seen Emberlynn and Lakelyn, Wrenlee and Oaklie.” She believes Dovelyn, Riverlynn, and Rainlee have potential to join those increasingly popular options in this category as well. “Names like Sunday and Waverly that just happen to look like elaborations of Sun and Wave might be the biggest winners of this trend,” Sandel added. “Parents are crossing borders in the name world more and more,” Suzanne said. “Non-English names are growing, partly the result of changing demographics but also as a way to expand the palette of available names.” Don’t be afraid to look into your family’s cultural heritage or popular picks around the world as you consider name options. “I’ve noticed a delightful preference for names that carry both sophistication and versatility, ensuring they gracefully evolve with each child,” said name consultant Lilia E. Corrigan of Heartbabynames. “A unique charm is becoming increasingly sought after, as families aim to bestow names that radiate a distinctive and individualistic ‘main character’ quality. This upcoming year seems to embrace names that not only captivate with style but also resonate with deeper, personal meaning ― a trend that brings both comfort and excitement to the baby naming journey.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Many parents are making efforts to harness the power names often carry. “Names can evoke a certain feeling, and they can convey a specific aesthetic awareness,” Humphrey said. “As ‘-core’ aesthetics become more ingrained in the fabric of how we describe our personal style, I believe we’ll see more parents opting for baby names that symbolize and communicate their values and vision.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

And Tiny Accused Of Drugging, Raping Air Force Veteran In Los Angeles Hotel Room",marco margaritoff,1/4/2024,"Grammy-winning rapper T.I. and his wife Tiny are being accused of sexual assault. The lawsuit was filed anonymously Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court by a woman who alleges they drugged her at a nightclub in 2005 and raped her in their hotel room. The couple, whose real names are Clifford and Tameka Harris, released a statement addressing the complaint and denying the accusations. “On the heels of positivity, negativity always rears its ugly head,” the couple told People in a statement Wednesday. “This plaintiff has been threatening to file this lawsuit for THREE years. For THREE years, we have emphatically and categorically denied these allegations.” They continued, “For THREE years we have maintained our innocence and refused to pay these extortionate demands for things we didn’t do. For THREE years, we’ve maintained the same position while the claims in this story have changed time and time again.” In court documents obtained Wednesday by multiple media outlets, the woman was identified only as Jane Doe. She accused the couple of sexual battery, battery, sexual assault, negligence, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The complaint arrived several years after a woman in Las Vegas and another in Los Angeles filed a police report accusing the couple of sexual assault. The latter filing stated the incident occurred in 2005, seemingly suggesting a connection to Tuesday’s lawsuit. The plaintiff alleged in her complaint that she was in her early 20s and serving in the U.S. Air Force when she met the celebrity couple. Doe claimed she was introduced to them in the VIP section of a nightclub in Los Angeles by a man named Caviar. Tiny gave her a drink before the trio returned to the couple’s hotel room with two other women, who left before Tiny took Doe’s clothing, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiff alleged she was “extremely shocked and uncomfortable” when T.I. and Tiny joined her in the shower. Doe claimed she felt “extremely dizzy and lightheaded” when ― after T.I. allegedly told her Tiny would bathe them both ― Doe was “signaled” to get into bed with T.I. The rapper allegedly ordered her in bed to rub oil on his back. Doe claims Tiny was later straddling her back and “pinning” her down as T.I. allegedly “proceeded to slide his toes into [Doe’s] vagina.” She purportedly told him, “No” before he left to get a condom, as Tiny allegedly continued “grinding on” and “massaging” her rear. Doe said in the complaint that she wound up vomiting as she “grew increasingly sicker and felt extremely ill by the assault.” She then crashed on the couch, “naked, dazed, sickened and weak,” and woke up in the morning with vaginal “itching and burning,” according to the lawsuit. The complaint was filed under California’s Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act, which permits civil suits on claims that would otherwise be dismissed due to the statute of limitations. Meanwhile, T.I. and his wife appear steadfast in their innocence. They said in their statement, “Our position is clear… We are innocent of these fake claims, we will not be shaken down, and we look forward to our day in court.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

In a lengthy Instagram post, the pop star dismissed rumors that she’s in the studio after Page Six, and The Sun recently reported that she’s been working on her first project since her 2016 album “Glory.” “Just so we’re clear most of the news is trash !!!” Spears wrote on Wednesday. “They keep saying I’m turning to random people to do a new album … I will never return to the music industry !!!” The singer pointed to her interest in songwriting, noting that she writes “for fun” or other people. “For those of you who have read my book, there’s loads that you don’t know about me … I’ve written over 20 songs for other people the past two years !!!” said Spears, who revealed that she wrote a song days after releasing her memoir “The Woman in Me” last year. “I’m a ghostwriter and I honestly enjoy it that way !!!” she added. Spears also dismissed rumors that her book was released “ILLEGALLY” without her approval. The caption was included alongside a photo of artist Guido Reni’s painting “Salome Bearing the Head of St. John the Baptist.” A post shared by Maria River Red (@britneyspears) Spears’ recent music output includes her song “Hold Me Closer” with Elton John, a 2022 track that marked her first release since the end of her conservatorship the year prior, as well as her collaboration with Will.i.am titled “Mind Your Business” which dropped last year. In her memoir, the singer has also reflected on her love for her album “Glory.” “I worked hard on those songs, which gave me confidence,” wrote Spears of the project, which Billboard noted came after two albums she wasn’t “pleased with.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/golden-bachelor-singles-biggest-misconception_n_65946f32e4b0912833ae16c4,I Study Single People For A Living. 'The Golden Bachelor' Got This 1 Thing Totally Wrong.,bella de paulo,1/4/2024,"Thursday night, on live TV, Gerry Turner, the “Golden Bachelor,” will marry Theresa Nist. I’m happy for anyone whose dreams have come true. But I’m sad too. And mad. “The Bachelor” franchise shamelessly promotes the conventional wisdom that true happiness is a prize bestowed only upon those in committed romantic relationships, and that single people, in contrast, are stuck leading lesser, sadder lives. That’s not just untrue, it is harmful. I’m a social scientist and I’ve been studying single people for decades. I’ve found that more single people than most of us ever imagined are happy and flourishing, and they are happy and flourishing because they are single — not in spite of it. Throughout their adult lives, they keep getting happier and happier with their single lives. I call them “single at heart.” I’m one of them and I just wrote a book about us. In Bachelor Nation, people like us are unfathomable. We got erased, and Gerry, Theresa, all the other women who vied for his affections, and everyone who watched the show was deprived of an appreciation for the meaningfulness, fulfillment, psychological richness and joy that the single at heart experience. “The Golden Bachelor” peddles a romantic fantasy that takes that great, big, open-hearted experience that is love and stuffs it into the box called romance. It diminishes all the other profound experiences of love in our life. The single at heart don’t buy that. We have more expansive notions of love. Taking in the show, we would have recognized and appreciated a truly inspiring love story, one that should have been the envy of everyone on “The Golden Bachelor” and everyone watching it — the 60-year friendship between two contestants, Ellen and her friend Roberta. When Ellen emerged from the limo that first night, it was Roberta she called out to even before she greeted Gerry. In one of the early episodes, Ellen said, “I haven’t felt special in a very long time.” Joan, another contestant, remarked, wistfully, “As you get older, you become more invisible,” and said she was grateful to have felt seen by Gerry. Faith was thankful to feel heard. She said that Gerry listened to her and that was something she wanted. Ellen, though, was supremely special to Roberta. If Joan has a close, longtime friend, she likely feels “seen” by that friend, and probably felt even more so as their friendship deepened. The people in Faith’s life we met during the home visit seemed to listen to her with care and love. But all of these women had internalized the romantic fantasy that insists that if you don’t feel special to a romantic partner or seen or listened to by a romantic partner, then you are not special or seen or listened to at all. They’ve been robbed. Of course, romantic relationships are different from friendships. Apart from friends with benefits, our friends will not quench our desires for sexual intimacy. But by thinking about our friendships in terms of what they do not offer, we miss out on what they do. A nine-year study of nearly 6,000 adults showed that over time, the single people who were not looking for a romantic partner valued their friendships more, and as those friendships became more fulfilling, their single lives did too. The dynamic was just the opposite for the single people who wished they were coupled. Over time, they valued their friends less, invested in them less, and then felt even more driven to find a romantic partner. “Alone” was a dirty word on “The Golden Bachelor.” Theresa told Gerry, “I don’t want to be alone.” Then she repeated it. Gerry agreed, adding, “It sucks to be alone.” But neither Theresa nor Gerry was alone. They both have people in their lives whom they love and who love them. The romantic fantasy erased those profoundly significant connections. In romantic fantasyland, no matter how many caring and loving people you have in your life, if you do not have a romantic partner, you are alone. That’s a stingy view of human connection. The single at heart do not feel alone in the world. And we are not afraid of spending time alone. In fact, we cherish our solitude. That’s one of our superpowers. It protects us from feeling lonely, it got us through the worst of the pandemic, and it prepares us for later life. In old age, we will continue to value, rather than fear, the time we have to ourselves. The single at heart are savorers, who notice and appreciate sensual experiences. In response to the question of what makes her happy, one of the women who shared her story in my “Single at Heart” book said, “I love the blue of the blue jay at the feeder right now. I love how Yo-Yo Ma recovered when his cello slipped while he was playing it. I love the sound of whip-poor-wills. I love the spiders in my kitchen, the birds at my feeders, my cats sleeping under their blankets.” What a difference from Gerry’s inability to appreciate nature’s spectacular displays without a romantic partner: “OK, it’s a beautiful sunset,” he said during one episode, “and you walk inside and you go, like, who’s here? Well, who do I share it with?” The romantic fantasy has robbed him of some of the true joys of life. The romantic fantasy is soul-sucking when it persuades people that they really are incomplete without a romantic partner. Leslie told Gerry, “You make me feel whole.” And Gerry, talking about Theresa, said, “She could be the person who completes me and I could be the person who completes her.” What if the women of “The Golden Bachelor” did not feel incomplete without a man and instead lived their single lives fully and joyfully? Maybe Theresa would not have waited for Gerry to come along before she learned Italian and went to Italy. Maybe she would have gone with friends or relatives, or on her own. One of the single at heart women I interviewed saved up enough money to take a year off and travel the world. It was a deeply meaningful experience. The single at heart do not split the tasks of everyday life with a spouse, and that can add to their competence. For example, one of the single at heart women I talked to said, “Because I live alone, I have acquired an arsenal of diverse skills. I can handle basic carpentry, electrical and plumbing repair, cooking, sewing, landscaping and financial planning.” Another was renovating her home with an eye toward living safely and comfortably as she grew older — she was just 33. The romantic fantasy may be at its cruelest when it robs people of hope. Gerry told Theresa that he wanted “hope that I will have someone to enjoy the rest of my life with,” adding, “that hope is huge.” Theresa concurred. “That’s what you need to wake up each morning,” she said. I think it would be different if they appreciated what single life has to offer. One of the single at heart women who shared her story said, “The longer I’m single, the more I love it. I can’t imagine life any other way.” Another said that her single life “just gets sweeter.” In their personal stories, they were giving expression to what the large-scale surveys had already shown: that single people just keep getting more and more satisfied with their single lives, especially if they are embracing their single lives rather than fleeing them.

I don’t want to diminish the significance of the quest of the women (and man) of “The Golden Bachelor.” I understand that they may feel unhappy if they never again find romantic love, and that’s valid. I just wish they could muster a bit of resistance to the romantic fantasy that deprives them of the joy and fulfillment they could be experiencing in their single lives and belittles the love they already have. That way, they could all have hope. Bella DePaulo (Ph.D., Harvard University) has always been single and always will be.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-view-whoopi-goldberg-kate-cox-texas-abortion_n_65965f63e4b0f27b6e365381,‘Shame On You’: Whoopi Goldberg Scorches GOP Following Texas Abortion Rulings,ben blanchet,1/4/2024,"Whoopi Goldberg went after Republicans in an impassioned defense of abortion rights on Wednesday. “The View” co-host weighed in on a federal appeals court ruling that doctors in Texas hospitals aren’t obligated to provide emergency abortions after the Biden administration, in 2022, cited a 1986 law as they offered guidance to hospitals that they “must” provide abortions if the mother’s life is at risk. “So, they’re OK with forced childbirth even if it kills someone, ’cause they’re so pro-life. What about all that?” said Goldberg, who has previously defended abortion rights on the program. The federal appeals court’s decision comes a month after the Texas Supreme Court blocked a judge’s ruling that allowed Kate Cox ― a woman with a potentially life-threatening pregnancy ― to get an emergency abortion in the state. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), in a letter sent to three hospitals, threatened to prosecute any doctors who helped perform the abortion for Cox, Reuters reported. Cox ultimately fled Texas to have an emergency abortion. Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin called the federal appeals court’s ruling “draconian and backwards” while co-host Sunny Hostin predicted the decision would make its way to higher courts. “And I am not a proponent of abortion, but they got this wrong,” Hostin said. Goldberg later made a plea for abortion rights as she referred to Cox’s life being “in danger” as a result of the post-Roe rulings on abortions in Texas. “For me, it feels like this is just a power play. You want to make sure that you have control over somebody’s body, whether it kills ’em or not. And you don’t care whether it kills ’em. You don’t care that you are tearing this woman up,” Goldberg said. “She didn’t want to have an abortion. She wanted a baby, the baby is not viable. She doesn’t want to go through this. And yet you are sitting there, allowing this torture to happen. That’s what’s wrong ― is you are torturing someone and you know it.

And the reason that it has is maybe you haven’t put it to bed yet,” host Harris Faulkner said to the Republican presidential hopeful. The Fox News host pointed to criticism from Black conservatives and asked Haley, “What have you learned?” Haley claimed, “What I should have said immediately was that the Civil War was about slavery. But I just assumed that that was a given.” She brought up the fact that, when she was governor of South Carolina, she authorized the removal of the Confederate flag from statehouse grounds in 2015 after a racist mass shooting that killed nine Black churchgoers in Charleston. (She had been reluctant to address the issue for years prior, however, and had previously defended the flag). “Really, the media is the only one that has talked about this issue,” Haley added of her slavery omission. Harris pointed out, “No, that’s actually not true.” Haley went on, insisting that “not one person on the ground in New Hampshire or Iowa are talking about it. I’ve done multiple town halls.” That also isn’t true. The day after the incident, a voter asked Haley a question, offering her an opportunity to “redeem yourself after last night’s slavery thing.” Nikki Haley on her viral Civil War/slavery response: “Really, the media is the only one that has talked about this issue.”Fox News’ @HARRISFAULKNER: “No, that’s actually not true.”Haley: “Not one person on the ground in New Hampshire or Iowa are talking about it.” pic.twitter.com/lMbYQROwNH That morning, following fierce backlash overnight, Haley had backpedaled, telling a New Hampshire radio station the Civil War was obviously about slavery. She also claimed the person who asked the question was a “Democrat plant.” Faulker acknowledged the “plant” accusation but suggested it was irrelevant, noting that Haley declined to cite slavery as the cause of the war even when prompted by the voter. “Whatever,” Faulkner said. “It’s a question put to you, and on a re-ask, ‘what would you have me say about slavery’ was your answer.” Haley said it was a mistake and her campaign was moving on. “I should have said slavery,” she said. “I didn’t do it. I immediately the very next day came out said, ‘I was wrong.’ I’ll do that.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/covid-hospitals-masks-winter-viruses_n_65968c30e4b0f27b6e3667db,More Hospitals Require Masks As Flu And COVID-19 Cases Surge,mike stobbe,1/4/2024,"NEW YORK (AP) — More U.S. hospitals are requiring masks and limiting visitors as health officials face an expected but still nasty post-holiday spike in flu, COVID-19 and other illnesses. While many experts say this season likely won’t prove to be as deadly as some other recent winters, it still could mean hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and many thousands of deaths across the country. New York City last week instituted a mask mandate for the city’s 11 public hospitals. Similar measures were ordered last week at some hospitals in Los Angeles and Massachusetts. Some hospitals reinstated masking rules for employees months ago, in anticipation of a seasonal rush of sick people. Flu and COVID-19 infections have been increasing for weeks, with high levels of flu-like illness reported in 31 states just before Christmas. Updated national numbers are to be released Friday, but health officials predict infections will grow in many states well into January. “What we’re seeing right now, in the first week of January, is really an acceleration — of flu cases, in particular,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is some good news. Flu and COVID-19 cases may peak by the end of the month and then drop, Cohen said. Though the flu has been skyrocketing, this year’s cases are being caused by a strain that usually doesn’t cause as many deaths and hospitalizations as some other versions. What’s more, signs suggest current flu vaccines are well-matched to the strain. “I don’t think it’s going to be overwhelming,” said Dr. William Schaffner, Vanderbilt University infectious diseases expert. He deemed the current season “moderately severe.” The CDC is pointing the public to an agency website where people can look up their county, which can help them make decisions about whether to wear masks or take other precautions. Cohen urged people to get vaccinated and to seek treatment for flu and COVID-19. Vaccinations are down this year, officials say. About 44% of U.S. adults had gotten flu shots by Dec. 23, according to the most recently available CDC vaccination survey data. Only about 19% of U.S. adults were reported to have received an updated COVID-19 shot as of early December. COVID-19 cases are causing more severe disease than the flu but have been rising less dramatically. Health officials are keeping an eye on JN.1, a new version of the ever-evolving coronavirus. The omicron variant was first detected in the U.S. in September and just before Christmas accounted for an estimated 44% of COVID-19 cases. The JN.1 variant may spread easier or be better at evading our immune systems, but there is no evidence that it causes more severe disease than other recent variants, health officials say. Current evidence indicates vaccines and antiviral medications work against it. The CDC also has reported disappointing vaccination rates against another seasonal bug, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. That is a common cause of mild cold-like symptoms, but it can be dangerous for infants and older people. RSV cases rose in the fall but appear to have plateaued and are even going down in some places, according to the latest data. At Hillsdale Hospital in southern Michigan, a 65% increase in respiratory illness activity in late December triggered a limitation to visitors in the birthing center. Only a spouse, a support person and grandparents can visit. They all must wear a mask and not show symptoms of sickness. The restriction is common for the hospital around this time of year, said Dr. Nichole Ellis, a pediatrician who is the hospital’s medical chief of staff. But it’s more difficult this season, she added. “In the past, we would have one … disease that we were tracking or monitoring at one time,” Ellis said. “But now, babies and children will have multiple diseases at the same time. It’s not that they just have RSV … but they’re getting RSV and COVID at the same time, or influenza and RSV at the same time because all of the diseases are prevalent in our community.” ___ Kenya Hunter in Atlanta contributed. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/habits-raise-dementia-risk_l_6595a041e4b0912833aeb922,6 Seemingly Harmless Habits That May Increase Your Risk Of Dementia,sydney wingfield,1/4/2024,"Dementia is the loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other abilities that require thinking. It is often caused by Alzheimer’s disease, and mainly affects those 65 and older. Unfortunately, dementia can be severe enough that it interferes with daily life, and those who have dementia often require additional care. “Dementia is a group of conditions characterized by impairment of at least two brain functions, such as judgment and memory loss,” explained Blair Steel, a psychologist at Carrara Treatment, Wellness & Spa. “Symptoms of dementia include forgetfulness, limited social skills and impairment in thinking that interferes with daily functioning.” So what causes dementia? Your age, family history, race and ethnicity, heart health and history of a traumatic brain injury are all factors that increase your risk of developing the condition. But another big category is lifestyle habits. So while you can’t control your genetics, there are a few seemingly harmless behaviors you may be doing that can increase your risk. Read on to learn more about them below: Exercising ― aerobic exercise, especially ― can help reduce cognitive impairment and dementia risk. Long-term, regular exercise can affect your brain and your overall health in a positive way, especially if you’re nearing 60. Getting your body moving daily is something you can do to decrease your risk of dementia. Steel said “being inactive does a number on the brain.” Just like other muscles, a good thing to remember is, “If you don’t use it, you lose it.” Social health plays a role in the development of dementia; an active and socially integrated lifestyle can protect against the disease. Stimulating the brain with social interaction is important for everyone, especially as they age. Though, in the age of social media, socializing has become a broader term. “We spend a lot of hours on social media, however this likely does not stimulate the brain’s experience of connection as much as socializing in person,” Steel explained. Poor social health can overstimulate the body’s stress response through increased levels of the stress hormone cortisol, raise blood pressure and decrease blood flow to vital organs amongst other health issues. Sleep disturbances and dementia are two common and significant health problems in older adults. (Let’s face it, sleep tends to be put on the back burner.) Whether due to family obligations, work or staying up late on your phone or watching TV, there’s always something in the way of adequate sleep. Unfortunately, sleep patterns in earlier life may contribute to later problems. If you’re having trouble sleeping, or not sleeping at all, sleep deprivation could increase your dementia risk. “Avoid screens and light after a certain hour and try to not reach for your phone if your sleep is interrupted,” Steel suggested. Try unplugging at least 30 minutes before bed. According to the Alzheimer’s Society, stress is linked to dementia because when you’re stressed and cortisol is released, it can create problems with your memory. The negative effects of stress, particularly chronic stress, on the brain can lead to cognitive decline due to prolonged elevations of cortisol — which plays an important role in how your body responds to stress. Working to reduce your stress through healthy habits can be key to mitigating this risk. Exercise, creative activities or hobbies, spending time with loved ones, meditation, watching a good show or reading a good book can all help you relax. Additionally, “try to be flexible with your reactions and avoid the ‘my way or the highway’ mentality, which can be common in older adults,” Steel said. The Alzheimer’s Society also says there’s a specific type of alcohol-related dementia that is considered alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD). This is due to the damage of the brain caused by drinking too much alcohol on a regular basis, usually over many years. Those with this type of dementia may have issues like cooking a meal, remembering things, thinking things through, and even struggle with more complex tasks like managing finances. Research shows a diet high in ultra-processed foods can increase dementia risk in adults. While no one’s diet is perfect, ensuring that the majority of the time you are sticking with well-balanced, healthy meals can be extremely beneficial.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. On a recent car trip, I found what is possibly the largest Target I’ve ever seen. I stopped just to use the bathroom, but was quickly sucked into a beauty and body section. I’m not a makeup guy, but I’m a lifelong sucker for a versatile body or hair product that’s easy to use and smells really good. At first, I spotted a travel-size Sun Bum leave-in hair conditioning spray, which like all Sun Bum products, smelled beachy and amazing. But $20 for a tiny bottle felt a little steep. I could see myself spritzing it twice, then dropping it by mistake into a dark crevice of my car, never to be seen again. I was craving a cheaper but still good-smelling hair mist when I saw it: a green beacon from childhood perched on the shelf. It was Suave Kids’ Silly Apple detangling spray, with the timeless label confirming it’s “tear-free.” It cost under $10 for more than double the size of the Sun Bum. I immediately grabbed one. A ’90s baby, the unmistakable green apple scent instantly transported me back to summer camp and swim lessons and going to sleep with wet hair. I so clearly remember my parents and babysitter using this in my thick hair to help with tangles and knots as they brushed it out, and it felt sweet and nostalgic to use it again. (In my day, there was a purple octopus on the bottle, which sadly has been replaced with some sort of green cartoon lion.) I looked forward to using this after a much-needed shower when I read the label and learned I can use it on dry hair, too. As it’s technically also a leave-in conditioner, the spray helps with flyaways and styling, while keeping hair super soft. It’s not a hair spray, so it has no hold, but that also means it’s not sticky and leaves no residue. The non-aerosol spray dispenser is easy to use and lets me get the product exactly where you want it. Whether you spray it on wet or dry hair, you don’t feel it on your hair the way you do with a texture spray or dry shampoos. It just simply lets you get a brush, comb or your fingers through hair easily, while giving a little extra shine and smoothness. I have low-maintenance hair and the hygiene habits of a teenage boy, so I don’t need much from a product other than it smelling good and helping with tangles. Yet even for folks who do have an intensive hair ritual, I would suggest this budget-friendly timeless throwback for its scent and help with knots and tangles. Many reviews are from adults who use it for themselves, saying that it works on curls and that it performs better than even salon-grade products. Some even mention this product helping them with severe matting and knotting when postpartum depression made hair maintenance challenging. And again, I feel compelled to mention the smell: It’s super fresh and fruity without being too sticky sweet or overwhelming and it just makes you feel good. I’ve been laughing to myself and calling it my new perfume, though the fragrance only lasts for about an hour or so after you spray it on your hair. I recently mentioned my purchase to a child-free friend, and to my surprise, she said she keeps some in her house for herself as well. I’m telling you, the smell is a must. The softness and detangling is just extra. Here are some reviews from others adults who love this “kid” product, too: “I absolutely love this stuff! I’m a grown man in my mid 20’s, and I used to use this stuff back in the early 00’s. Back when’s there was an apple octopus on the bottle! This stuff is affordable and STILL SMELLS THE SAME years later! It still works as well too!! I used to use another detangler spray, but they recently changed the formula for the worse and sometimes it’s insanely priced at certain beauty stores! I decided to back to the reliable detangler that was of my childhood! I can buy this anywhere, it still smells great, is super effective, and it’s usually at a great price point! I know the bottle says “kids” but this stuff is great no matter your age. It’s reliable and has been for well over 15+ years! Seriously buy this!” — Carl W, via Target “This product works for KIDS and ADULTS! I have thick hair and this product helped my hair get untangled!” — Kay, via Target “Okay, so I read the previous review about the lady who has hair depression, and I’m the same way. I had postpartum depression where I would just let myself go and not brush my hair. THIS. IS. MAGIC. A must have!!! Works great for kids too, but works amazing for adults as well! I’m now currently pregnant with #2 and now my hair is starting to become really curly and knotty, and it can comb through my curls with ease! It also makes my curls more noticeable and healthy looking. Everyone has been giving me compliments about how good my hair looks and “what perfume are you wearing” - y’all, it’s the dang suave detangler ! WHO KNEW?! and it’s like three bucks. A hair MUST HAVE!!! :)” — nltakacs, via Target “Great smell, easy to use nozzle, but most importantly great detangler. And between myself and my kids we have short to very long hair.” — Hemmyhere “This product is not just for kids !! Even as an adult I struggle with my hair getting tangled. This is only product I have found that helps detangle my hair !! Been using it since I was kid. Although , the bottle has changed from the octopus to the lion the Apple sent is still my favorite and smells amazing. Can’t rave about this product enough!” — EmilyB2723, via Target “I am an adult and I have been using this since I was a kid for about 15 years and I absolutely love it! I have tried other products. But I always come back to this one for the wonderful apple smell and because it is great at detangling without leaving oiliness. All around great product and not just for kids.” — Val, via Target By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wait-is-oat-milk-bad-for-you-nutritionists-have-thoughts_l_65942ae5e4b0912833adf6fb,"Wait, Is Oat Milk Bad For You Now? Nutritionists Have Thoughts.",julie kendrick,1/4/2024,"After years in the “health halo” spotlight, some consumers are starting to question whether oat milk is all it’s cracked up to be. In the grocery aisle and in line at the coffee shop, folks are wondering if soy, almond, rice pea — or even regular old cow’s milk — are better options. Most of us aren’t even sure how they manage to milk those tiny flakes of oats. Happily, nutritionists are here to clear up the confusion. “Oat milk is created by milling whole oats, adding water and enzymes and filtering the liquid from the solids in a centrifuge,” explained registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) Vicki Shanta Retelny. “Oat milk must be fortified with calcium, iron, vitamin A and vitamin D to make it nutritionally comparable to cow’s milk.” Even with so many other options, some nutritionists remain fans. “My favorite plant milk happens to be oat milk,” said RDN Andrea Mathis. “I love its naturally creamy texture and how it adds a great source of fiber to my smoothie recipes.” Texture is one benefit, and ecology is another. “One of the big draws of oat milk is that it appears to be more environmentally sustainable than some other types of plant-based beverages, requiring less water and producing less waste,” said registered dietitian (RD) and naturopathic doctor Jennifer Salib Huber. RDN Tamar Samuels noted that oat milk is also popular for what it doesn’t have — nuts or dairy. If you’re avoiding gluten, you need to tread carefully around oat milk. “While oats are naturally gluten-free, they have a higher risk of cross-contamination, because they are typically processed in facilities that manufacture gluten-containing products,” Samuels said. “If weight loss is your goal, you might want to consider decreasing high-calorie, low-protein beverages, like large oat milk lattes,” she added. “And if you’re managing high blood sugar, you should also be mindful, since many oat milk products have more added sugar and oils compared to other milk alternatives.” RD Marissa Meshulam told us: “While oat milk is delicious, unfortunately it’s not the most nutritious option. Oats are a highly sprayed pesticide crop, so if you are drinking it, I highly recommend organic. From a nutrition standpoint, one cup of oat milk provides the same amount of carbohydrates as a slice of bread, about 15 grams. And then when oats are processed into oat milk, the starches in oats are broken down to simple sugars.” To make oat milk creamy, many manufacturers add in canola oil or other oils, she added. “A splash in a cold brew when you get coffee is no big deal, but an oat milk latte every morning is not my favorite option,” she said. RDN Sharon Palmer noted that oat milk typically has a lower protein content (about two to three grams) compared to dairy milk or soy milk. “Oat milk also tends to be higher in calories and carbohydrates compared to other plant-based milks like almond and soy milk,” Samuels said. “For example, one cup of oat milk has about 100 to 150 calories and 16 to 20 grams of carbohydrates, compared to almond milk, which ranges from 45 from 100 calories per cup, and one gram of carbohydrates.” RD Barbara Ruhs offered this brand breakdown: “Silk, Chobani and Oatly, which are the leading brands, all have 120 calories per eight-ounce serving, with fewer than three grams of protein and 15 to 18 grams of carbohydrates. Planet Oat has 90 calories and similar levels of protein and carbohydrates.” If you’re shopping for new types of plant milk, consider this advice from Retelny: “Just because something is plant-based, that doesn’t mean it’s healthy or nourishing,” she said. RDN Jill Nussinow agreed: “Many people think that plant milks are better for them, which might not be the case.” Many of the nutritionists we spoke with favored soy over oats. “Soy milk is the most nutrient-dense of the plant milks,” explained Palmer. “I prefer soy milk because it has the best nutritional profile,” Ruhs said. “The other thing unique to soy is that it’s the most significant source of isoflavones — a flavonoid that is special to soy that has a multitude of health benefits, especially for women,” Ruhs said. “They help with perimenopause and menopausal symptoms, have anti-inflammatory properties and are beneficial for heart and neurological health.” Retelny agreed: “If I were to choose a plant milk, it would be soy milk, since it’s like cow’s milk from a nutritional standpoint and it contains those beneficial phytoestrogens.” “I use soy milk more frequently, because it’s the most affordable plant milk, especially Trader Joe’s organic unsweetened soy milk,” Nussinow said. “It has [a high] amount of protein, and it contains only soybeans and water.” RDN Chelsey Amer said: “While I’m a fan of dairy milk, my favorite milk alternative is Ripple plant-based milk, which is made with pea protein. It contains a similar nutrition profile to dairy milk. It’s a great dairy-free alternative for kids who need the nutrients in milk, like protein and calcium, but can’t tolerate dairy.” “I’m a fan of nut milk blends and coconut milk,” Meshulam said. “These tend to be lower in carbs and provide some fat, which not only makes them creamier, but helps with blood sugar stabilization.” Her two favorite brands are Malk and Three Trees. “Both use organic, simple ingredients and are less watered-down than other brands, so you get that creaminess in the mouthfeel.” When it comes to coconut milk, Samuels offered this caution: “If you have or are at risk for heart disease, be mindful of your coconut milk intake, as it can increase your LDL cholesterol.” While we’re out looking for the next new thing in nutrition, some nutritionists suggested more traditional options. “I think old-fashioned cow’s milk is going to be more in demand in the future, since it’s a readily available commodity that, in many regards, is the standard of optimal nutritional value when compared to plant milks,” Ruhs said. “It naturally contains eight grams of protein per serving. And there’s also a2 Milk, which contains more of the type of milk protein that makes it easier to digest.” “If you suffer from bloating and gas, be especially mindful of ingredients like gums and carrageenan, which may increase these symptoms,” Samuels said. “If you use plant milks as a regular part of your diet, like in cereal and smoothies, make sure it’s nutrient-rich,” advised Palmer. “It should provide a significant source of protein, about seven grams, and about 30% of the vitamin D calcium requirement for the day, which is particularly important for children.” Noting that people will continue to demand transparency about ingredients and how products are made, RD Sara Haas said that she seeks out ingredient lists that match her preferences: “I always look for no flavoring, no gums, no additives and no sugar.” Palmer suggested finding a fave and sticking with it: “Since there are so many products available, do some research to find a plant milk that works for you. Then you won’t always have to read labels each time you shop.” “For most adults, milk of any kind should be considered a beverage instead of a primary source of nutrition,” Huber said. “This means that taste preference and any other values-based considerations can be factored into the decision, not just nutrition.” “Taste and affordability are two big factors when choosing a plant-based milk,” Ruhs said. “Even if one option has superior nutritional benefits, if you’re not going to drink it, it’s not giving you any benefits.” She also said that it might be wise to keep a few different kinds on hand. “I like dairy milk in my morning coffee, but I keep soy milk in the fridge to use in smoothies and baking applications. Every once in a while, if I’m eating freshly baked cookies, I prefer dairy milk, too.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

It’s an elevated take on a casual and popular crossbody style that covers all the necessary bases: It’s roomy, looks fabulous with a range of aesthetics and can be dressed up or down. But don’t get me started on the $2,550 price point, which has sent me searching for more affordable options in both leather and vegan leather fabrications. A huge part of the bag’s appeal lies in its ubiquitous shape. Also commonly referred to as a sling, crescent or half-moon bag, the banana bag is as convenient as it gets. It’s a low-effort chic silhouette that’s ideal for everyday use, and I find it’s more versatile than a boxy handbag. Last summer, Uniqlo’s breezy nylon version of the shoulder bag went viral on TikTok, making it the most coveted purchase of the season. Below, I’ve rounded up the best takes on this must-have popular bag style. Made in sleek and soft sumptuous leather or faux leather in a range of sizes and price points, they all capture the effortless vibe of the Row’s popular-but-pricey version.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chemex-pour-over-coffee-maker_l_658d034ee4b03057f5cc55bc,Chemex Is The Classic Pour-Over Coffee Maker That Experts Love,tessa flores,1/4/2024,"HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. In a caffeinated world filled to the brim with automated coffee makers and fancy brewing gizmos, sometimes the simplest of tools are the way to go — especially tools with a time-honored reputation endorsed by coffee aficionados and everyday coffee-lovers alike. The Chemex pour-over coffee maker is one well-regarded brewer and carafe that has utilized a classic and beautifully functioning manual design for decades and is recommended by Jordan G.L. Hardin, director of food and beverage at Alfred Coffee, and Sumi Ali, co-founder of Yes Plz Coffee. Referenced by Hardin as a “perennial” choice for pour-over coffee preparation, the Chemex can be used to nurture enhanced and nuanced flavors from every type of roast, and is not just for coffee, either, but also for teas. First made in 1941 by a German chemist, its minimalist design has remained virtually untouched and is even in the permanent collection of the The Museum of Modern Art. It’s made from a non-porous borosilicate glass that won’t absorb odors or residues, is dishwasher-safe and can be refrigerated for storing and reheating leftover coffee, without the coffee’s losing flavor. This means it can be a great option for making cold brew. This space-conscious coffee maker, which comes in a few different capacity options, features a designated pour spout to create the proper air channel and a beautiful wooden collar to make the Chemex safe to hold even when contents are hot. It also conveniently uses compostable natural paper filters that the brand claims ensure uniform extraction and remove undesirable elements from grounds. Hardin explained a bit about how the pour-over brewing process works: “The paper filter goes in, hot water gets heated in a kettle (I always recommend the gooseneck Fellow Stagg EKG) and is poured over the ground coffee. From there, it’s really about pouring technique; how long you ‘bloom’ the coffee (release the gases), what pouring pattern you’re using, [how] quickly you pour and how much water, etc.” He said that there are several videos available to help users learn more about this method and how to customize a perfect-tasting brew. This isn’t the first time we’ve sung Chemex’s praises. In 2013, former HuffPost reporter and self-proclaimed “coffee nerd” Rebecca Orchant wrote about her personal experience with the display-worthy vessel. According to Orchant, a daily coffee drinker who, until that point, had exclusively used a French press, the Chemex was even less complicated to use, and made a delicious, almost flawless cup of coffee every time. “Because you are pouring hot water over the grounds, coffee from a Chemex can never be over-brewed,” Orchant wrote, adding that one of the things she loves most about the brewing system is how clean it is. “With a French press, the mesh collects microscopic coffee grounds on each use. With a Chemex, you lift the grounds out with the filter, so they never even touch the carafe, which makes it an absolute breeze to clean,” she said. If you feel like you’ve been missing out on the Chemex and all its effortless and artful functionality, make up for lost time and grab yourself one from any of the above retailers in a variety of sizes. Promising Amazon reviews: “We use our Chemex pour over pitcher every single day. While there are many pour over options available out there, this one suits our needs perfectly. The glass is well-tempered and can withstand some accidental bumps and clinks without chipping. The wood wrap is also essential to not burn your hands when holding and pouring. Cleaning is fairly simple. We use a gentle sponge to scrub inside the base and swirl some warm water and dish soap in the rinse. There’s been no issues with residue or staining. We use the Chemex filters with this and we always get a perfect tasting cup of coffee. Granted, this does take a little longer than a traditional coffee or automatic maker, but it’s worth the taste difference. We grind our own beans and use fresh water from our home filtration system. The result is smooth, high quality, delicious coffee. If there’s some leftover, I will place a tea towel over the top to keep it warm. My partner was never a big coffee drinker, but he has now become a pro at making this too and enjoys it just as much as I do. This pitcher will pay you back over and over for the initial cost and is worth every cent for the investment.” — A Singing Wolf ″Although it was designed in 1941, Chemex coffee pots remain the simplest, most easy to use coffee maker on the market. And the high-quality Chemex filters allow you to ‘espresso’ grind without tears or grounds in the pot... I like my coffee strong and I like the fine grind that creates all the flavor I’m looking for as the water quickly passes through the grounds. The improvement in coffee flavor is incredible. Strong, smooth and no bitterness. It’s easy to clean, once a week I put a couple tablespoons of vinegar in and fill it with hot water to let it soak. That helps remove any kind of coffee residue. About once a month I shake a little bit of Bon Ami into the bottom of the pot, add water, add a paper towel and use a wooden spoon to swirl off any build up. It’s an easy, two-minute operation and the results are like new, and sparkling! Easy to wipe the exterior to a sparkle too!” — Catherine Metzger, Founder, Food for the Ages (This review was edited for length. Read the full review.) “I am a huge coffee snob. I am a self professed coffee lover and I drink my coffee black, so I know good coffee. This is the best way I have found yet to make a cup of coffee. I have tried the Nespresso, the automated pour over system, and drip coffee, but this Chemex reduces the bitterness and leaves you with smooth coffee. I love it! I also love that there is never any build up. You never have to descale it. You can just hand wash it. I put mine in the dishwasher after removing the wooden neck piece and it did just fine! I love love love it! would order again 10/10.” — Alyssa By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

At the beach and my husband has made friends with the family next to us so now I have to file for divorce I opened up emotionally to my husband and told him how long it’s been since the check engine light turned on. When your wife says ""When you have a minute"" it's wise to drop whatever you're doing and immediately have a minute. My husband says he doesn’t know when it became his job to make the coffee. I don’t know when it became his job either, but I’m glad he agrees it’s his job. My husband had a rogue sneeze that woke the baby but he pulled his back in the process so I feel like that’s a fair trade I called my parents and after a minute my husband took my phone from me and started chatting with them and they were so excited about it and it’s weird to be married to the son I never was.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-palestinian-americans-in-gaza_n_6596881ee4b0f27b6e366665,Mother And Uncle Of U.S. Serviceman Rescued From Gaza In Secret Operation,"ellen knickmeyer , matthew lee",1/4/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The mother and American uncle of a U.S. service member were safe outside of Gaza after being rescued from the fighting in a secret operation coordinated by the U.S., Israel, Egypt and others, a U.S. official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. It is the only known operation of its kind to extract American citizens and their close family members during the months of devastating ground fighting and Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. The vast majority of people who have made it out of northern and central Gaza through the Rafah crossing into Egypt fled south in the initial weeks of the war. An escape from the heart of the Palestinian territory through intense combat has become far more perilous and difficult since. Zahra Sckak, 44, made it out of Gaza on New Year’s Eve, along with her brother-in-law, Farid Sukaik, an American citizen, a U.S. official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to confirm the rescue, which had been kept quiet for security reasons. Sckak’s husband, Abedalla Sckak, was shot earlier in the Israel-Hamas war as the family fled from a building hit by an airstrike. He died days later. One of her three American sons, Spec. Ragi A. Sckak, 24, serves as an infantryman in the U.S. military. The extraction involved the Israeli military and local Israeli officials who oversee Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the U.S. official said. There was no indication that American officials were on the ground in Gaza. “The United States played solely a liaison and coordinating role between the Sckak family and the governments of Israel and Egypt,” the official said. A family member and U.S.-based lawyers and advocates working on the family’s behalf had described Sckak and Sukaik as pinned down in a building surrounded by combatants, with little or no food and with only water from sewers to drink. There were few immediate details of the on-the-ground operation. It took place after extended appeals from Sckak’s family and U.S.-based citizens groups for help from Congress members and the Biden administration. The State Department has said some 300 American citizens, legal permanent residents and their immediate family members remain in Gaza, at risk from ground fighting, airstrikes and widening starvation and thirst in the besieged territory. With no known official U.S. presence on the ground, those still left in the territory face a dangerous and sometimes impossible trip to Egypt’s border crossing out of Gaza, and a bureaucratic struggle for U.S., Egyptian and Israeli approval to get themselves, their parents and young children out of Gaza. —- Associated Press writer Tara Copp contributed.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/no-labels-democrat-bipartisan-ticket-trump_n_659468afe4b0912833ae154c,No Labels: We May Not Put A Democrat On Our Bipartisan Ticket In 2024,jennifer bendery,1/4/2024,"No Labels, the centrist political group planning to offer a bipartisan “unity ticket” for the 2024 presidential election, may not actually have a Democrat on its ticket, one of its top leaders said in a video recording of a recent event that was obtained by HuffPost. “One of the things we’ve also gotten asked about is there’s, of course, Republicans, Democrats, there’s also independents and their presence on the ticket,” Ryan Clancy, chief strategist for No Labels, said in a Dec. 20 Zoom event titled “Common Sense Talks With Ryan Clancy.” “And what if it’s a Republican and an independent? I think that’s certainly possible,” he said. Clancy was responding to an attendee who raised a concern shared by many Democrats as No Labels prepares to launch a third-party presidential candidate: They will function as a spoiler, taking Democratic and independent votes away from President Joe Biden and boosting presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. It’s clearly a touchy subject for the group, which for much of the past year has been fending off growing fears that it would tilt the election to Trump. “We’re not spoiling anything,” former Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat who joined No Labels last year to coordinate efforts to get on state ballots, told The Guardian on Saturday. Nixon said at the Zoom event that the group has so far secured a slot for a No Labels presidential candidate on 12 of the 50 state ballots. “Right now we’re on our way to moving forward,” he told event attendees. “And we will.” But Clancy’s squishiness over which party or parties will even be on its ticket certainly suggests that No Labels is scrambling to figure out what, exactly, it will ultimately offer the American electorate. This comes after the group announced in November that it was abandoning its in-person presidential convention, originally set to kick off after Super Tuesday in March, and instead is opting to carry out its candidate selection process virtually, giving itself more time to sort itself out. And amid this vague sense of movement, it was clear from the December Zoom event that even No Labels’ supporters and financial backers are worried they’ll end up helping Trump. Many of the questions that Clancy fielded were related to making sure that No Labels doesn’t give Trump an advantage in November. One attendee, Will from Alabama, said for him it was “absolutely the number one priority in 2024” that Trump not get reelected. Another attendee, Paula, said she’d “been a long supporter of No Labels” but looking at the group’s plans for a bipartisan ticket, she was “having trouble trying to figure out how this is going to not reelect Trump.” When an attendee named Martha asked Clancy about the idea of No Labels ditching its bipartisan “unity ticket” and instead putting up two center-right candidates to ensure that the group doesn’t pull more votes from Biden than Trump ― she proposed two Republicans, Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley ― Clancy said that was a “great question” and a “really interesting point that we should consider.” “We might end up with two independents on it in the end,” he added. Another No Labels official on the call straight-up confessed that he is nervous about the group being a spoiler for Trump. “Love everybody at No Labels,” said John Leonard, the treasurer for No Labels in Raleigh, North Carolina. “But I support what Will and Paula were saying earlier.... I really worry about the prospect of Biden losing support and Donald Trump being inadvertently elected in the Electoral College.” Asked why No Labels wouldn’t include a Democrat on its bipartisan “unity ticket,” Clancy told HuffPost on Wednesday that the group has always been open to other options. “Nothing has changed,” Clancy said in a statement. “No Labels has said from the beginning our intent is to offer our ballot line to a unity ticket featuring a Democrat and a Republican,” he said. “But we’ll be open to an independent being on the ticket if we think that gives the ticket the best chance to win.” But it sure looks like No Labels has moved its goalposts since it first touted its third-party ticket as an “insurance policy” if Biden and Trump end up being the 2024 nominees, in light of both being generally unpopular. The group has gone from promising a “unity ticket” with no commitment to which party would be at the top, to telling donors it would pick a Republican for president and presumably a Democrat for vice president to now opening the door to a Republican leading the ticket with an independent for vice president, or even two independents on the ticket. No Labels casts itself as nonpartisan and does not typically reveal its donors. But it has received significant funding from a prominent GOP megadonor, Harlan Crow, who also helped the group bring in more than two dozen other donors, according to the New Republic. Possible candidates for the group to back include former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), retiring Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and even former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang. Romney has ruled out joining the group’s ticket. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Ron DeSantis over his approach toward Republican rival and former President Donald Trump on Wednesday. “Why haven’t you gone directly after him?” asked the man, who pointed to the GOP presidential candidate’s poll numbers compared to Trump. “What do you mean by going directly after?” replied DeSantis. “In my viewpoint, you’re going pretty soft on him ―,” the man added. “I’ve articulated all the differences time and time again on the campaign trail,” interjected DeSantis before claiming the media wants GOP candidates to “smear him personally,” before adding, “That’s just not how I roll.” The man, in response, declared that Trump would have won the 2020 presidential election by “a landslide” if he had “kept his mouth shut” while he was president. “He’s been his own worst enemy, there’s no question about that,” DeSantis replied. The man noted Trump’s insults toward former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). “I mean, those are talking points that I would use. I mean the guy has no class in a lot of different ways,” the man said. You can watch the exchange in the clip below from The Washington Post’s Hannah Knowles.

I mean, is that the problem?” Garcia asked of the GOP field. The Florida governor, who once steered clear of attacking Trump, has taken an occasional swipe at the former president in recent months.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/13-year-old-beats-original-nintendo-tetris_n_65963475e4b0f27b6e364521,Game On: 13-Year-Old Becomes First To Beat 'Unbeatable' Tetris,david hamilton,1/3/2024,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The falling-block video game Tetris has met its match in 13-year-old Willis Gibson, who has become the first player to officially “beat” the original Nintendo version of the game — by breaking it. Technically, Willis — aka “blue scuti” in the gaming world — made it to what gamers call a “kill screen,” a point where the Tetris code glitches, crashing the game. That might not sound like much of a victory to anyone thinking that only high scores count, but it’s a highly coveted achievement in the world of video games, where records involve pushing hardware and software to their limits. And beyond. It’s also a very big deal for players of Tetris, which many had long considered unbeatable. That’s partly because the game doesn’t have a scripted ending; those four-block shapes just keep falling no matter how good you get at stacking them into disappearing rows. Top players continued to find ways to extend their winning streaks by staying in the game to reach higher and higher levels, but in the end, the game beat them all. Until, that is, Willis managed on Dec. 21 to trigger a kill screen on Level 157, which the gaming world takes as a victory over the game — something along the lines of pushing the software past its own limits. 13 year old Willis Gibson aka Blue Scuti became the first recorded person to beat Tetris causing the game to freeze after reaching level 157 pic.twitter.com/uRt3KOasTh The makers of Tetris agree. “Congratulations to ‘blue scuti’ for achieving this extraordinary accomplishment, a feat that defies all preconceived limits of this legendary game,” Tetris CEO Maya Rogers said in a statement. Rogers noted that Tetris will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year and called Willis’ victory a “monumental achievement.” It’s been a very long road. Early on, “the Tetris scene people didn’t even know how to get to these higher levels,” said David Macdonald, a gaming YouTuber who has chronicled the gaming industry for years. “They were just stuck in the 20s and 30s because they just didn’t know techniques to get any further.” Level 29 posed an especially tough roadblock because the blocks began falling more quickly than the in-game controller could respond. Eventually players found ways to make progress, as Macdonald chronicled in his detailed video on Willis victory. In 2011, one got to Level 30 using a technique called “hypertapping,” in which a player could rhythmically vibrate their fingers to move the game controller faster than the game’s built-in speed. That technique took players to level 35 by 2018, after which they hit a wall. The next big thing came in 2020 when a gamer combined a multifinger technique originally used on arcade video games with a finger positioned on the bottom of the controller to push it against another finger on the top. Called “rolling,” this much speedier approach helped one player reach Level 95 in 2022. Then other obstacles arose. Because the original Tetris developers had never counted on players pushing the game’s limits so aggressively, bizarre quirks began to crop up at higher levels. One particularly difficult issue arose with the game’s color palette, which traditionally cycled through 10 easily distinguished patterns. Starting at level 138, though, random color combinations began to appear — some of which made it much harder to distinguish the blocks from the game’s black background. Two particularly devilish patterns — one a dim combination of dark blues and greens later dubbed “Dusk,” the other composed of black, gray and white blocks called “Charcoal” — proved taxing for players. When combined with the strain of increasingly longer games, which could run 40 minutes or more, progress slowed again. It took a Tetris-playing AI program dubbed StackRabbit to break that logjam by helping map out just where players might happen across a glitch resulting in a kill screen, and finally beat the game. StackRabbit, which managed to make it all the way to Level 237 before crashing the game, ran on a modified version of Tetris, so its achievements aren’t strictly comparable to those of human players. And its findings weren’t immediately applicable to the human-played game, either. But its runs clearly demonstrated that game-ending glitches could be triggered by very specific events, such as which block pieces were in play or how many lines a player cleared at once. That let human players take over the task of mapping all possible scenarios that could cause such crashes in the original game. These typically resulted when the game’s decade-old code lost its place and began reading its next instructions from the wrong location, generally resulting in garbage input. A massive effort spurred by StackRabbit’s experience eventually led to the compilation of a large spreadsheet that detailed which game levels and which specific conditions were most likely to lead to a crash.

According to KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, defendant Deobra Redden, 30, was in the middle of being sentenced at about 11 a.m. by Clark County District Judge Mary Kay Holthus for attempted battery with bodily harm when he attacked the judge. In a video from the courtroom, Redden is seen leaping over the bench and lunging at Holthus. The judge tried to take cover but was struck down by Redden when he landed on top of her. A few people were seen in the video coming forward to help as two men tackled Redden and pulled him away. Just before the attack, Holthus had denied probation for Redden, The New York Times reported. When his lawyer asked the judge to sentence him to probation, Holthus responded, “I appreciate that, but I think it’s time he get a taste of something else.” “I just can’t with that history,” she added. Redden, who had been before Holthus before, served a year in prison in 2021 for domestic battery and was granted parole in 2022, KLAS reported. He had also served time in 2015 after being sentenced to a minimum of 19 months for attempted theft, according to The New York Times. A court spokesperson confirmed that Holthus, 62, was injured in the attack and that her condition was being monitored, according to The New York Times. A court marshal was also taken to the hospital after being injured and was believed to be in stable condition late Wednesday. “We commend the heroic acts of her staff, law enforcement, and all others who subdued the defendant,” the 8th Judicial District Court said in a statement, according to the Times. “The court remains committed to a safe and secure courthouse and courtrooms.

Taya Grimes of Hartford, Wisconsin, was identified by family as one of the victims of a car crash at about 1 a.m. in Auburn, according to WISN-TV in Milwaukee, citing the Fond du Lac County Sheriff’s Office. According to the ABC affiliate, deputies said Grimes was driving four friends home when she crashed into a ditch and she and three of her friends were thrown from the car. Deputies suspect that the crash was alcohol-related, but her mother, Laurie Blake, told WISN on Tuesday that her daughter would never drive drunk. “I know my daughter was extremely against drunk driving. She was very much against it,” Blake told the TV station. According to Fox affiliate WITI-TV, deputies said Grimes was then struck by a car driven by a 19-year-old man she knew and who was driving alongside them. Deputies accused the driver of leaving the scene and continuing to drive while his car dragged Grimes for nearly three miles. Grimes’ mother told WISN that she hoped her daughter was not conscious when the car struck her. “How do you not know you’re dragging somebody? How do you not know? I mean it seems almost sinister to me,” Blake told the ABC station. Blake added that her daughter’s boyfriend came to her home to tell her about the accident. “He said that there were bodies all over the road and he was desperately trying to find my daughter. He looked in ditches, he looked in the field, he couldn’t find her,” Blake said. The four passengers from her car were taken to the hospital, including a 17-year-old who was listed in critical condition. According to WITI, the 19-year-old driver was taken into custody “on suspicion of hit-and-run resulting in death.” In a statement to HuffPost on Wednesday, the Fond du Lac County Sheriff’s Office said it had received numerous calls about the incident and was working closely with the district attorney’s office.

During a Tuesday night episode of ESPN’s “Pat McAfee Show” on YouTube, Rodgers made comments implying that Kimmel would be affected by the list of names associated with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that were released Wednesday. “There’s a lot of people, including Jimmy Kimmel, who are really hoping that list doesn’t come out,” Rodgers said in conversation with McAfee and his co-host, A.J. Hawk. An outraged Kimmel fired back at the Jets player in a post on X (formerly Twitter) where he threatened to pursue legal action. “Dear Aasshole: for the record, I’ve not met, flown with, visited, or had any contact whatsoever with Epstein nor will you find my name on any ‘list’ other than the clearly-phony nonsense that soft-brained wackos like yourself can’t seem to distinguish from reality,” Kimmel said. “Your reckless words put my family in danger. Keep it up and we will debate the facts further in court.” During his program on Wednesday, McAfee addressed the comments made on Tuesday’s episode and responded to Kimmel’s reaction, explaining that he understood why the talk show host was upset. “I can see exactly why Jimmy Kimmel felt the way he felt, especially with his position. But I think Aaron was just trying to talk shit,” McAfee said. “We obviously don’t like the fact that we’re associated with anything negative ever. We like our show to be an uplifting one, a happy one, a fun one,” he said. “Because we talk shit and try to make light of everything, some things obviously people get very pissed off about, especially when they are serious allegations, so we apologize for being a part of it. Can’t wait to hear what Aaron has to say about it.” Rodgers has not publicly responded to Kimmel’s threat to sue. ESPN faced backlash over the controversy, Business Insider reported, though it is unclear whether the sports channel is looking into what occurred on the show on Tuesday. In an episode on Wednesday, McAfee went on to say that he hopes Kimmel and Rodgers can settle the issue through conversation rather than a lawsuit and “move along.” The next four years will change America forever.

On Tuesday, the “Pretty Little Liars” alum, 34, celebrated two years of sobriety in a heartfelt post on social media. Hale illustrated with a chart on Instagram that it’s been 24 months, 731 days and 17,523 hours since she’s been booze free. She also posted a quote by novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald which says, in part, that “it’s never too late, or in my case too early, to be whoever you want to be. There’s no time limit.” Hale had said in a November episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast that her earliest memory of drinking was on a vacation when she was 12. “This continues to be the greatest gift I’ve given myself. I remain so grateful for another year of growth, growing pains, lessons, joys, and self realizations,” Hale said in Tuesday’s Instagram post. She added: “To be able to show up as myself and to be greeted with such warmth and acceptance is something I do not take for granted ♥️.” “The interactions, conversations, and moments of vulnerability from people I know, people I used to know, from people I’ve hurt, from people who’ve hurt me, from strangers and even people on the internet have given my life so much color and meaning,” the “Bless Myself” singer continued. After expressing gratitude for all the people she emotionally “connected” with last year, Hale delivered a dose of encouragement to people who are “struggling.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/johnson-schumer-immigration-government-shutdown_n_6595e823e4b0bf73e1784344,The Next Government Shutdown Is Going To Be About Immigration,jonathan nicholson,1/3/2024,"Dueling pronouncements by the leaders of the House and Senate Wednesday showed how Congress could be sleepwalking into a partial government shutdown later this month. At a much-hyped appearance at the Texas border with Mexico, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said House Republicans wanted their entire immigration restriction bill passed, even as, back in Washington, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Senate majority leader, said that wasn’t going to happen. As the leaders’ first public remarks in the new year, they highlighted another emerging round of political chicken after Congress avoided possible shutdowns in October and November. In October, Democrats were willing to jettison needed military aid for Ukraine for a temporary funding bill, while in November, House Republicans coming off a bruising intraparty fight over who should be speaker, let Democrats carry a bill to fund the government. “We want to get the border closed and secured first, and we want to make sure we reduce non-defense discretionary spending,” Johnson told reporters at a press conference in Texas. While Johnson said there had been negotiations almost every day through holiday break, he also said in response to a separate question that House Republicans weren’t interested in seeing only portions of their immigration bill, H.R. 2, passed. “H.R. 2 is the necessary ingredient. Why? Because it has provisions that fix each of these problems and these provisions work together,” he said. In Washington, where a small group of senators and White House officials continue to try to negotiate a supplemental spending bill that would include border provisions as well as aid to Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region, Schumer warned House Republicans against overreach. If the House “clings” to H.R. 2, Schumer told reporters, “We’re not going to get a deal” on the supplemental spending bill. He also made it clear his strategy is to get an agreement with Senate Republicans he hopes the House GOP will accept. “We want to get the Senate to come to an agreement first,” he said. While the supplemental bill with international military aid is a separate negotiation than the annual spending bills that need to be passed by Jan. 19, a delay in getting to agreement on the first could lead to the talks getting combined as the government edges nearer to a shutdown. There is an appetite among House Republicans to shut down the government as at least a sign of seriousness about stopping illegal immigration. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), a member of the rightwing House Freedom Caucus, posted on social media, “Congress must refuse to fund this corrupt administration unless the border is restored. #HR2.” The agencies funded only through Jan. 19 include the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Energy, Transportation, Treasury, as well as Housing and Urban Development. In wrapping up his answer about whether House Republicans were willing to vote to shut down the government if there were no border changes, Johnson reiterated they want a secure border and to cut spending outside of the Pentagon.

In court documents obtained by the New York Post and publicized Tuesday, Clarkson claims that Blackstock once told her she wasn’t “sexy” enough to join the NBC talent competition series. Blackstock ― who, for years, acted as Clarkson’s manager ― also allegedly told her that her public persona was “too similar” to that of another “Voice” coach, country musician Blake Shelton, and that NBC executives were “looking for a more sex symbol type” like the singer Rihanna. The Post also reports that, when asked about the discussion in court, Clarkson told her lawyer Ed McPherson: “Well, a wife doesn’t forget a time she gets told she’s not a sex symbol, so that stays.” Clarkson went on to join “The Voice” for Season 14 in 2018 and continued with the show through its 21st season in 2021. She returned for Season 23, which wrapped in May of last year. Blackstock hasn’t commented publicly on the Post’s story. In November, however, a California labor commissioner ordered him to pay Clarkson more than $2.6 million over unlawful business deals he made on his ex-wife’s behalf. Clarkson split from Blackstock in 2020 after seven years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in 2022. They share a daughter, River Rose, 9, and a son, Remington Alexander, 7. Clarkson initially had to pay Blackstock $115,000 a month in spousal support, but those payments reportedly came to an end this month. The “American Idol” veteran and talk show host also alluded to the demise of her marriage on her 10th studio album, “Chemistry,” released last year. In an interview with People published Wednesday, Clarkson opened up about her use of songwriting as a “healthy outlet” for her grief.

On Tuesday, the Food Network star posted a makeup-free “PSA” video on Instagram to address those who mocked her gray hair and use of filters. “I’m filming with no filter today because some of y’all get really bent out of shape when I choose to use a filter, which I’ve told you about,” she said. “Sometimes I use a filter, and sometimes I don’t. Most of the time, I do use a filter because this is me with no makeup, and this is no filter.” The 63-year-old went on to shut down the social media users who accused her of wearing wigs in her posts. “Can you get me a wig without flipping gray roots then, please? Because I’m tired of getting my roots done every two weeks,” she said as she lowered her head to give viewers a closer look at her hair. Despite the negative comments, the “Kid’s Baking Championship” host didn’t hesitate to acknowledge the people who have been “really kind” and “sweet” to her on social media. “Thank goodness 99.9% of you are like, really kind, sweet people and don’t give a flying flip whether I have roots or I put a filter on,” she said. Bertinelli’s followers stuck up for her in the comments section amid the remarks about her looks, including “Saved by the Bell” actor Tiffani Thiessen. Thiessen told Bertinelli “don’t give that any energy friend,” before adding, “It ain’t worth it. I literally erase and ignore that noise. Did that for my sanity a long time ago.” In July last year, Bertinelli posted a video on TikTok discussing her personal experiences with a certain controversial cosmetic practice — Botox. “I have tried Botox ... and I hated it,” she said after someone made a snarky comment on social media accusing her of getting the cosmetic injections. She then shared a photo of herself with Botox taken six years ago, before saying that it “sort of changed the shape of my eyebrows.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jeffrey-epstein-names-list_n_658af932e4b03e698a144678,Jeffrey Epstein's Associates Identified In Newly Unsealed Court Docs,ryan grenoble,1/3/2024,"Court documents concerning Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged victims and associates were released Wednesday following years of public speculation about who the disgraced financier and accused sex trafficker may have involved in his schemes. The newly unsealed court documents are part of a now-settled civil suit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who accused Epstein and his partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, of coercing her to have sex with Epstein and others when she was 16. The documents include depositions, emails and other legal filings. The documents released Wednesday are the first 40 of more than 200 that will be unsealed in coming days. While many bold-faced names appear in the documents, not all of the people named are accused of misconduct. And all of the men accused by Giuffre and others in depositions of acting illegally have denied any wrongdoing. In a 2016 deposition included in the filings, Giuffre says Maxwell directed her to have sex with Prince Andrew, billionaire Glenn Dubin, model scout Jean-Luc Brunel and artificial intelligence researcher Marvin Minsky. Giuffre also said Maxwell directed her to give a “massage” to former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson. Several names in Giuffre’s deposition remain redacted. In an email to Maxwell included in the documents, Epstein tells her to “issue a reward” to any friends or family members of Giuffre’s who would be willing to discredit her accusations. One document alleges that Epstein forced an underage girl, whose identify remains sealed, to have sex with former Donald Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz on numerous occasions. It also states that Epstein trafficked her “for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders.” Other famous people mentioned in the documents are not necessarily implicated in Epstein’s lurid crimes, but were referenced in the unsealed depositions conducted as part of Giuffre’s civil suit. One such document alleges that Epstein once told Johanna Sjoberg, one of his accusers, that former President Bill Clinton “likes them young, referring to girls.” In another, Maxwell says that Clinton flew on Epstein’s private plane but couldn’t confirm how many times. Clinton previously denied allegations of visiting Epstein’s properties and having knowledge of his crimes. Sjoberg also identifies magician David Copperfield as a friend of Epstein’s and said he asked her if she was “aware that girls were getting paid to find other girls.” She also said she overheard Epstein on the phone saying he needed to “find some girls” in Hawaii for celebrity hairstylist Frédéric Fekkai. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered the identifying documents to be made public last month, allowing a 14-day grace period for anyone named in them to appeal their inclusion. Two people who requested to keep their names sealed, known only as Doe 107 and Doe 110, would not be immediately named, Preska said in a court order Wednesday. Doe 107 was granted an extension of time, until Jan. 22, to make a case that revealing her name would cause her physical harm. Doe 110’s plea remained under review by the court, Preska said. “The Court will render its determination on the documents relating to Does 107 and 110 in due course,” Preska said. The judge had previously said that names would be redacted if it was determined that their release would “disclose sensitive information regarding an alleged minor victim of sexual abuse who has not spoken publicly and who has maintained his or her privacy.” Giuffre ― formerly known as Virginia Roberts ― met Maxwell when she was working at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in 2000. In a 2020 interview with CBS News, Giuffre said “very well-known” people could be incriminated should Maxwell cooperate with prosecutors, including Britain’s Prince Andrew, whom Giuffre has accused of rape. Prince Andrew settled a sexual abuse lawsuit brought by Giuffre last year but has denied the allegations. Epstein died in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for similar crimes.

The agency had announced its preorder sale Wednesday in a news release. The coins — a $5 gold, $1 silver and half-dollar clad — display portraits of Tubman at different points in her life. Varying in price, they can be bought individually or together in a three-coin proof set, which costs $836.25. The Harriet Tubman Commemorative Coin Program “recognizes the bicentennial of Harriet Tubman’s birth and her lifework that spans beyond liberation,” according to the Mint website. “Reflected in the unique designs of gold, silver, and half-dollar coins – this collection showcases significant periods in her pursuit of social justice and represents a different era of Harriet Tubman’s extraordinary life,” the site states. Born into slavery in the early 1820s, Tubman eventually escaped and played a pivotal role in helping rescue other African Americans through the underground railroad. She also aided in the recruitment of Black soldiers for the Union Army during the Civil War and served as a spy. The Tubman coins have been in the works for years. In 2020, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) proposed the idea with the introduction of the Harriet Tubman Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act. “Harriet Tubman was a woman of incredible courage who remains a symbol of the strength and leadership in periods of overwhelming hardship,” he said in a statement at the time. “As a crucial conductor in the underground railroad, she created a beacon of hope for slaves who fled from the undignified cruelty of human bondage. In wartime, she tended to the wounded who fought the just war for emancipation.” After passing Congress, the legislation was signed by President Joe Biden in August 2022. Designs for the Tubman coins were first released in July. They are expected to begin shipping early next month, according to the Mint. Meanwhile, efforts to redesign the $20 bill with a portrait of Tubman in place of President Andrew Jackson are on hold because of technical delays. A new design for the bill is set for 2030.

The plane’s owner and pilot, identified as Robert Sachs, reportedly died as well. Oliver was 51 years old. His daughter Madita was 10 and Annik was 12. The Royal St. Vincent and the Grenadines Police Force said in a statement that the accident occurred off the coast of Bequia. Oliver, who was born Christian Klepser in West Germany, was bound for St. Lucia with his kids in a single-engine aircraft that took off from J.F. Mitchell Airport on Bequia. Locals told The St. Vincent Times on Thursday that the plane made a sputtering noise upon takeoff. Island resident Danroy Joseph likened it to “when a vehicle is struggling — you know, stalling, struggling for power to go up a hill.” “Moments after taking off, the aircraft experienced difficulties and plummeted into the ocean,” police said in a Facebook statement Thursday. “Fishermen and divers from Paget Farm went to the scene of the incident in their boats to render assistance.” The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Coast Guard led rescue efforts. All four passengers were retrieved from the plane and ocean but were later pronounced dead. The crash occurred three days after Oliver celebrated New Year’s Eve with a post on Instagram. “The bodies were transported to St. Vincent on board the Coast Guard vessel and were taken to the Kingstown Mortuary, where post-mortem examinations are expected to be carried out to ascertain the cause of death,” police added in their statement. “I cried cried, it was our first and last film together, I loved working with him so much … He was so. nice, worked so hard and [was] such a brave actor and a beautiful gentle person,” Bai Ling, Oliver’s co-star in the upcoming film “Forever Hold Your Peace,” wrote on Instagram. She said she last saw Oliver on Dec. 20, as they wrapped up shooting on the film. Oliver had curated an impressive acting résumé. He starred as a detective for two years on the popular German TV series “Alarm für Cobra 11” before making the leap to Hollywood features. Oliver not only starred opposite George Clooney and Cate Blanchett in Steven Soderbergh’s “The Good German” (2006), but he also played opposite Tom Cruise in “Valkyrie” (2008) and under the direction of the Wachowskis in “Speed Racer” that same year.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/elijah-mcclain-randy-roedema-sentenced_n_65988494e4b0f9f6621cb9b0,Ex-Colorado Cop Who Killed Elijah McClain Gets 14 Months In Jail,colleen slevin,1/5/2024,"DENVER (AP) — A judge sentenced an ex-Colorado police officer to 14 months in jail for his role in the death of Elijah McClain after hearing the young Black man’s mother on Friday call the officer a “bully with a badge” who will always have blood on his hands. The officer, Randy Roedema, was the most senior law enforcement member charged in McClain’s death and was the only one found guilty. He was the most senior officer who initially responded to the scene. A jury convicted him in October of criminally negligent homicide, which is a felony, and third-degree assault, which is a misdemeanor. The 23-year-old’s killing received little attention at the time of his death, but gained renewed interest the following year as mass protests swept the nation over the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. McClain’s death became a rallying cry for critics of racial injustice in policing. In a separate trial, two paramedics were recently convicted for injecting McClain with an overdose of the sedative ketamine after police put him in a neck hold. Sentencing will come later this year for the paramedics, who had been trained to use ketamine to treat “ excited delirium ” — a disputed condition some say is unscientific, rooted in racism, and used to justify excessive force. Before the judge handed down the sentence, McClain’s mother Sheneen McClain raged against Roedema after he expressed remorse but stopped short of apologizing. “Randy Roedema stole my son’s life,” she said, “All the belated apologies in the world can’t remove my son’s blood from Randy Roedema’s hands.” Protecting the community was “the furthest thing from his mind” the night the was stopped walking home from the store, she said. Roedema also spoke at the hearing, as well as his sister and former military colleagues — he was a U.S. Marine who was wounded in Iraq. “I want the McClain family to know the sadness I feel about Elijah being gone. He was young,” Roedema said. Roedema suggested Friday that first responders get more training in how to deal with such situations that led to McClain being given an overdose. “Ultimately the situation has caused a lot of pain and we are faced with the choice of how to deal with it,” Roedema said. McClain was stopped by police after a 911 caller reported that he looked suspicious. Another officer put his hands on McClain within seconds, beginning a struggle and restraint that lasted about 20 minutes before paramedics injected him with the ketamine. Experts say the sedative ultimately killed McClain, who was already weakened from struggling to breath while being pinned down after inhaling vomit into this lungs. For Roedema, criminally negligent homicide, defined as killing someone by failing to recognize a substantial risk to their life, carried a punishment of probation up to three years in prison. The assault conviction was punishable by probation up to two years in jail. Judge Mark Warner, a former prosecutor who has been a judge for nearly 20 years, had to determine a fair sentence by weighing how this homicide case compares to others he has seen in his career, said former district attorney George Brauchler. A first conviction can lead to a sentence of probation, but the judge must also consider that Roedema was a uniformed police officer, given special authority and respect by society, and a jury convicted him of taking a life, Brauchler said. “I don’t know how that person gets to go home that night” on probation, said Brauchler, who prosecuted the 2012 Aurora theater shooting case. “I think that would be very tough.” Roedema helped hold McClain down while paramedics administered the ketamine. He was often visible in the body camera footage shown over and over to jurors, and could be heard directing others how to restrain him. The same jury that convicted Roedema acquitted former officer Jason Rosenblatt, whose lawyers stressed that he wasn’t close to McClain when the ketamine was injected. A different jury acquitted officer Nathan Woodyard a few weeks later, after he testified that he put McClain in a neck hold, briefly rendering him unconscious. Woodyard testified that he feared for his life after Roedema said McClain had grabbed for one of their guns. Prosecutors say the gun grab never happened. Aurora Fire Rescue paramedics Jeremy Cooper and Peter Cichuniec were convicted last month. Cichuniec, the senior officer, was found guilty of the most serious charge faced by any of the first responders: felony second-degree assault. It carries a mandatory prison sentence of between five and 16 years in prison. In a statement after those final verdicts, McClain’s mother said having three out of the five defendants convicted was not justice, merely “a very small acknowledgment of accountability in the justice system.” “There were at least 20 individuals there the night my son was alive and talking before he was brutally murdered. Aurora Colorado Police Department and Fire Department kept everyone else on their payroll because both of those departments lack humanity, refusing to admit their inhumane protocols,” she said. The paramedics’ verdicts came a day after after a jury in Washington state cleared three police officers of all criminal charges in the 2020 death of Manuel Ellis, a Black man who was shocked with a stun gun, beaten and restrained face-down as he pleaded for breath.

Candace McCoy, professor emerita at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, doesn’t see the recent acquittals there or in Colorado as a sign that the push for police reform is waning. Instead, she said it’s a reflection of how hard it is convict police officers of crimes because jurors tend to give them the benefit of the doubt for how they act in emergencies. While it was rare to prosecute cases against law enforcement in the past, the fact that more of them are being pursued now is not enough to create police reform, she said. “The way to change and reform the police is to change the culture and the departments, and individual prosecutions will not do that,” McCoy said.

Joseph Edward Walker, 30, and Judy Bribiescas, 39, were charged with first-degree manslaughter in the death of their daughter, who was found overdosed in a motel room in Kennewick, Washington, reports CBS affiliate KEPR, citing court documents. Surveillance footage cited in the court documents showed Bribiescas walking into the motel room in Kennewick with their 8-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter on Dec. 27. A spokesperson for the Kennewik Police Department told HuffPost that Walker was living with Bribiescas and her two children at the time of the incident, which violated a no-contact court order she had with him. According to court documents, the couple’s son told investigators that his parents were in the bathroom, and police believe they were using drugs at the time. Authorities believe the 4-year-old swallowed the fentanyl pills while her parents were in the bathroom and overdosed, according to the document. Surveillance footage allegedly showed Walker later handing the 4-year-old’s body to Bribiescas before fleeing the scene in his car. Kennewick police responded to a report regarding a 4-year-old who had stopped breathing. When they arrived, they attempted life-saving measures, police said in a statement. They said the 4-year-old was taken to to a local hospital, where she died. According to the court documents, the girl had swallowed at least two fentanyl pills, and doctors found another pill stuck in her nose. A Kennewick police spokesperson told HuffPost that the girl ingested “rainbow fentanyl” pills, which are colorful pills that look like candy. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has claimed the product is intentionally aimed at children, but drug experts say that is likely untrue. Bribiescas was arrested following the incident, and Walker was arrested Thursday in Richland, Washington, police said. Need help with substance use disorder or mental health issues?

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-willing-to-sacrifice-democracy-biden-declares_n_65986798e4b075f4cfd25237,"Trump 'Willing To Sacrifice Democracy,' Biden Declares In Forceful Speech",kevin robillard,1/5/2024,"President Joe Biden tore into former President Donald Trump in a speech Friday, describing his likely Republican opponent as a wannabe authoritarian who is willing to destroy a quarter-millennium of American democracy to hold on to power. “As we begin this election year, we must be clear: Democracy is on the ballot,” Biden said at Montgomery County Community College outside of Philadelphia. “Your freedom is on the ballot.” Though Biden has repeatedly delivered speeches warning about the threat the Trump-led Republican Party poses to democratic institutions, Friday’s speech was noteworthy for the sheer number of direct attacks on Trump, whom he has tried to avoid focusing on for the first half of his presidency. He noted the former president’s recent use of rhetoric echoing Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and his expressed desire for “revenge,” and he suggested Trump was not only a threat to Americans’ voting rights but also their broader freedoms. He called his predecessor “sick” for laughing about the October 2022 attack on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul. “Donald Trump’s campaign is about him, not America, not you,” Biden said. “Donald Trump’s campaign is obsessed with the past, not the future. He’s willing to sacrifice our democracy to put himself in power.” Though the speech’s timing may seem obvious (it was scheduled for Saturday, the third anniversary of the U.S. Capitol attack, but was moved up because of an approaching winter storm), the location was also important. Biden contrasted the sacrifices made by Gen. George Washington’s troops at nearby Valley Forge and Washington’s decision two decades later to allow for a peaceful presidential transfer of power to Trump’s own refusal to accept his reelection defeat. “Donald Trump exhausted every legal avenue available to him to overturn the election. Every one,” Biden said. “But the legal path just took Trump back to the truth: that I had won the election and he was a loser.” Trump’s campaign responded to Biden’s speech by claiming the “radical left Democrats” are the ones who pose a threat to democracy, arguing that the multiple investigations of Trump’s role in the insurrection, his handling of classified documents and his hush-money payments to a porn star were all part of a liberal plot to bring him down. “The bottom line today is that Joe Biden has given up on running an issues-based campaign for 2024,” Jason Miller, a top adviser to Trump, wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “Rather than help those suffering from Bidenomics or our porous southern border, Biden plans on weaponizing government against his leading political opponent.” Biden delivered the speech even as faith in American democracy, battered by Trump’s authoritarianism, years of congressional dysfunction and decades of growing economic inequality, was at all-time lows. A recent poll from Gallup found just 28% of Americans were satisfied with the way democracy was working in the United States, a record low. Many Democrats have been eager for Biden to begin defining the 2024 race as a referendum on the choice between himself and Trump, hoping the contrast will remind voters of Trump’s deficiencies and lift Biden’s weak approval ratings. (The two men are essentially tied in public polling.) Biden’s campaign has said it hopes rhetorically raising the stakes of the election will engage tuned-out voting blocs that have drifted away from the president.

The speech comes as Biden’s reelection message shifts from trying to sell “Bidenomics” ― a slogan that ended up being derided by Democrats and doing little to concretely improve the president’s image ― and toward a focus on Trump and the threat his authoritarian tendencies pose to the country. The campaign released a television ad touching on similar themes earlier this week. “I refuse to believe that in 2024, we Americans will choose to walk away from what has made us the greatest nation in the history of the world: freedom, liberty,” Biden said. “Democracy is still a sacred cause.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/supreme-court-idaho-abortion_n_65987e59e4b075f4cfd25fc1,SCOTUS Allows Idaho To Enforce Its Strict Abortion Ban During Legal Fight,mark sherman,1/5/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, while a legal fight continues. The justices said they would hear arguments in April and put on hold a lower court ruling that had blocked the Idaho law in hospital emergencies, based on a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration. Hospitals that receive Medicare funds are required by a federal law to provide emergency care, potentially including abortion, no matter if there’s a state law banning abortion, the administration argued. The legal fight followed the court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to severely restrict or ban abortion. The Biden administration issued guidance about the law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, two weeks after the high court ruling in 2022. The Democratic administration sued Idaho a month later. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Idaho agreed with the administration. But in a separate case in Texas, a judge sided with the state. Idaho makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion. But the administration argues EMTALA requires health care providers to perform abortions for emergency room patients when needed to treat an emergency medical condition, even if doing so might conflict with a state’s abortion restrictions. Those conditions include severe bleeding, preeclampsia and certain pregnancy-related infections. “For certain medical emergencies, abortion care is the necessary stabilizing treatment,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in an administration filing at the Supreme Court. The state argued that the administration was misusing a law intended to prevent hospitals from dumping patients and imposing “a federal abortion mandate” on states. “EMTALA says nothing about abortion,” Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador told the court in a brief. Just Tuesday, the federal appeals court in New Orleans came to the same conclusion as Labrador. A three-judge panel ruled that the administration cannot use EMTALA to require hospitals in Texas to provide abortions for women whose lives are at risk due to pregnancy. Two of the three judges are appointees of President Donald Trump, and the other was appointed by another Republican president, George W. Bush. The next four years will change America forever.

Hendrix wrote that adopting the Biden administration’s view would force physicians to place the health of the pregnant person over that of the fetus or embryo even though EMTALA “is silent as to abortion.” After Winmill, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, issued his ruling, Idaho lawmakers won an order allowing the law to be fully enforced from an all-Republican, Trump-appointed panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But a larger contingent of 9th Circuit judges threw out the panel’s ruling and set arguments in the case for late January.

Earlier this week, Stanley, the company behind the TikTok-famous vacuum-insulated tumblers, released its limited edition Valentine’s Day collaboration cups with Starbucks, to unbelievable fanfare. The cups, sold exclusively at Target stores, had some people camping outside their local stores to secure the goods. Videos posted on TikTok show parched fans racing through the aisles of Target to get to the 40-ounce water bottles. A video on TMZ shows a man desperately jumping over the counter at a Target’s Starbucks to steal a box of the tumblers, which run for $45 apiece. (Water is essential, people, but a Stanley cup is not!) The new Stanley cups, which come in Cosmo Pink and Target Red, are already up on resale sites like eBay and listed at prices up to $300 ― not surprising given the fact that a rep for Starbucks confirmed that the cup will not be restocked. Confused by the hoopla over a water bottle? Understandable. Below, we unpack why seemingly everyone and their mother are trying to get their hands on the cup. The hype over the Stanley Cup among millennial and Gen Z women (and more recently, Gen Alpha preteens) began on social media, specifically on TikTok. There, users sing the praises of all things Stanley and show off the myriad accessories they’ve bought to upgrade their tumblers: this whole stanley thing is really starting to feel like a cult bc why would you need all that for a tumbler? pic.twitter.com/m3X1PPxytL The fandom around water bottles coincides with the “WaterTok” trend, in which people share how they turn their H2O into “spa water” or “birthday cake water” with different powders and ingredients. Hydro Flask, Yeti and cooler brands like Frank Green have their well-hydrated fans, too, but they’re nothing compared to the Stanley evangelists. “Let’s talk about the Stanley cup and what makes it so life changing,” one TikTokker intoned in her video. “I get it, you probably don’t want another cup but you need this cup.” As of now, “Stanley Cup” — the tumbler, not the trophy awarded to the winner of the National Hockey League championship — has over 52.7 million views on TikTok. That’s a pretty impressive youth following for a brand that’s over 100 years old. “When I was 11, I asked for dolls. Today’s 11-year-olds asked for Stanley tumblers,” Casey Lewis, a youth consumer trends analyst who writes the newsletter After School, told Business Insider recently. “Seeing Gen Alpha kids sobbing over water bottles is pretty surprising.” Ashlee LeSueur, a co-founder of the Buy Guide, an online shopping blog and Instagram account, was an early adopter of the Stanley Quencher back in 2017. “Of all the insulated cups... this is the one. Just trust,” LeSueur and her team wrote in 2017, raving about its ability to keep beverages cold, its straw, its handle and its ability to be tossed in the dishwasher. A post shared by THE BUY GUIDE (@thebuyguide) A viral story in November about how a Stanley tumbler was the only item that survived a car fire (with ice still inside, no less) cemented Stanley’s “unbreakable” reputation. Given the brand’s image ― and the love for all things pink post-“Barbie” movie ― LeSuer isn’t surprised the new pink-hued edition is selling out. “The consumers have made it abundantly clear that color is king,” she told HuffPost. “And the craze around the Stanley Quencher isn’t new! Even in 2021 Stanley’s website had a 30,000-person waitlist for restock notifications on the cup.” The Furby-esque frenzy around the Stanley cup is clearly the scarcity model at work: The idea that something is rare or limited edition works wonders on buyers. The fact that the Stanley cup presents affordable scarcity tips those “I’ve gotta have it” feelings over the edge, said Katie Thomas, the lead of the Consumer Institute at Kearney, a global management consulting firm. “While the scarcity model is often associated with luxury, that’s exactly the reason it’s also appealing in the mainstream ― it allows consumers to feel like they are getting something special that not everyone has, without being priced out,” she said. It taps into the emotions of consumers, Thomas said, “from the excitement leading up to the release, to the personal victory and gratification if and when the product is acquired.” For those last minute costume needs. 🎃#spirithalloween #halloweencostume #stanleytumbler #stanleyquencher pic.twitter.com/CqDXZ6itwW Hannah Shamji is a consumer insights researcher who helps marketers and founders make smarter decisions by understanding their customers. The way she sees it, people aren’t buying a Stanley mug. They’re buying into the Stanley club. “You don’t stampede in Target for a tumbler,” she said. “What [people] are buying is [a sense of] belonging. People want to be in the know or fit in.” It’s a status move, Shamji said, and that’s not a bad thing: “Status is a really powerful driver of purchase behavior, because it tugs on a very fundamental human need: to belong.” It’s why so many people are commenting or posting about the Stanley cup online, too, she said. They want to be a part of the conversation and join the hype. “Even though fans can sing its praises, people are not buying a Stanley cup because of its features and functionality,” she said. That’s not why the cup sold out in minutes, Shamji explained, or why people buy multiple colors when you really only necessitate one water bottle. “I saw one woman on TikTok with a cup in every color: The full rainbow of Stanleys,” she said. “She’s not buying on need or because the Stanley is objectively better than the Yeti. It’s not a logical or calculated purchase decision. It’s a feeling-based one.” The cup is a social currency, Shamji said, a flex, just like a large collection of Beanie Babies (of all things) were years ago. Will the excitement over Stanley tumblers last? Lewis, the youth consumer trends analyst, told Business Insider she thinks there’s nowhere to go but down from here for Stanley. “When young kids and tweens adopt a trend or product, teens and older Gen Z distance themselves,” she said. Affordable products that also signal social status from being cool or “in the know” often take off in the marketplace, but therein lies the downside: No one wants what everyone has. “The risk for a brand like Stanley is that it might become ubiquitous and is therefore no longer a symbol for one-upping in one’s social network,” said Steve Westberg, an associate psychology professor at the University of Southern California with expertise in consumer psychology. “There’s also the inherent factor that not everyone needs a cup like this and those who do probably don’t need more than one, so the total market volume has a limit,” he added. Westberg told HuffPost he thinks the water bottles will see a sales decline when the social factor no longer drives sales, but that they’ll still merit shelf space “just based on just being a darn good cup.” From Furby to Tickle Me Elmo to Beanie Babies, there will always be products that people gravitate toward and collect. It’s not entirely explainable why, said Thomas: Sometimes it’s just the scarcity in and of itself and the visibility of the product. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Oral arguments are scheduled to commence Feb. 8. The court’s decision Friday to take up the case follows a Colorado Supreme Court ruling in December that Trump is ineligible for office because he violated the 14th Amendment, which states that anyone who took an oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution but then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against the nation must be barred from state or federal office. That decision cited Trump’s role in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He’s been charged with four federal crimes over the attempted coup to remain in the White House despite losing the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden, and the trial is scheduled to start in March. Following the Colorado ruling, Trump’s attorneys asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review and overturn the state-level decision before the state nominating process begins this month. “We welcome a fair hearing at the Supreme Court to argue against the bad-faith, election-interfering, voter-suppressing, Democrat-backed and Biden-led, 14th Amendment abusing decision to remove President Trump’s name from the 2024 ballot in the state of Colorado,” Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement Friday. “We are confident that the fair-minded Supreme Court will unanimously affirm the civil rights of President Trump, and the voting rights of all Americans in a ruling that will squash all of the remaining ballot challenge hoaxes once and for all,” Cheung added. Just over a week after the Colorado decision, Maine’s secretary of state said Trump’s alleged 14th Amendment violations had precluded him from appearing on ballots in her state as well.

The renowned composer recently sat down with The Telegraph and, as co-creator of “The Phantom of the Opera,” was naturally asked if any of the theaters he owns are haunted. Webber denied as much, before making an intriguing claim about his home in London. “I did have a house in Eaton Square which had a poltergeist,” he told the outlet in an interview Tuesday. “It would do things like take theatre scripts and put them in a neat pile in some obscure room. In the end we had to get a priest to come and bless it, and it left.” This purportedly organized ghost starkly contrasts a traditional poltergeist, which remain unproven but are nonetheless known for their mischief, violence and noise. The term itself translates directly from German to “rapping” or “thudding” ghost. Webber’s home is notably situated in Belgravia, a central neighborhood developed in the 19th century by Marquess of Westminster, Robert Grosvenor. From those noble roots sprang some of the best schools and most expensive homes in the world. While Webber has yet to encounter a ghost directly, some of his famous peers have claimed to. Sir Patrick Stewart alleged in 2009 that he witnessed an apparition while performing “Waiting for Godot” with Sir Ian McKellen onstage in central London. “I have been witnessing stuff since I was 12 years old,” Stewart recently told USA Today. “And it has stayed with me throughout my life. I have sometimes quite intense feelings and nighttime experiences and occasionally I witness things.” “Why would I invent it? Because I always feel slightly foolish when I talk about this.” And Webber isn’t the first of his crew to be baffled by the unseen. Even Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who produced “Phantom,” recently admitted to feeling something strange at a nearby theater. “On the opening night of ‘Miss Saigon’ in 1989 … I walked onto the vast stage and stood with [designer] John Napier,” he told The Telegraph. “As we gazed into the beautiful empty auditorium, we felt a chill and heard some slight sounds above our heads in the grid.” “In less than a minute, it was gone, but we both felt some presence,” he continued. “Later the theatre’s old manager George Hoare told me: ‘That was the Man in Grey. He always turns up if you’re going to have a big hit!’” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Past residents of Eaton Square include former prime minister Neville Chamberlain, his foreign secretary Lord Halifax and actor Vivien Leigh.

According to deputies, Crystal LeBlanc went to Butler’s home that night to speak to her husband, who was inside, and the two engaged in a heated argument. Butler then approached the pair at the doorway, allegedly armed with a gun. She fired a shot and Graig LeBlanc put his hand in front of the weapon in an attempt to disarm her, deputies said. The bullet shot through the chief’s hand and struck his wife in the arm, the release stated. While the chief and his wife admitted themselves into a local hospital, Butler allegedly cleaned up the crime scene in an attempt to cover up the evidence before calling authorities. In his letter published on Wednesday, Graig LeBlanc said “infidelity” on his part led to the alleged incident. “Infidelity is a breach of not only the personal commitments I made but also the professional standards we all expect from those in public service,” the police chief wrote. It’s unclear whether “infidelity” referred to an affair with Butler. The police chief said he is initiating an internal review within the police department and committed to restoring the community trust. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/other-jan-6-tapes-show-trauma_n_65983871e4b0bfe5ff63172e,The Other Jan. 6 Tapes: Newly Obtained Videos Show Trauma Of Attack For House Democrats,jonathan nicholson,1/5/2024,"One House member texted his wife what he feared was a final goodbye. One recalled the look of pure hatred in the attackers’ eyes. Another would never forget the whine of a hundred gas masks, all operating at once. For some House Democrats who were in the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and experienced the insurrection from a unique vantage point — being the target of the attack — those were the memories that stood out shortly afterward. Prior to Jan. 6, the U.S. Capitol had not been sacked since the War of 1812. But on that day, a pro-Donald Trump mob, many of whom marched to the Capitol directly from his speech urging them to “fight like hell,” clashed with police, broke into the building, and chased lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence into hiding. The riot lasted for hours, with the mob arriving at the Capitol shortly before 1 p.m. and police clearing the building around 6 p.m. Five people died. While the attack inspired bipartisan revulsion at the time, that consensus has eroded ahead of its three-year anniversary Saturday. Now, some on the right say too much has been made of the violence, pointing to protesters who walked into the Capitol well after the first groups of attackers. But newly obtained video interviews of House Democrats who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 show vividly how traumatic that day was. As mini time capsules, they include a level of detail and rawness that will be hard to replicate as Jan. 6 recedes further into the past. The videos were the brainchild of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). As early as Feb. 2, 2021, she urged her fellow House Democrats to record their Jan. 6 memories, for “an accurate personal record and for the healing process for our Congress and, indeed, Country.” Twenty-one Democratic members did so and HuffPost obtained several of them for the following account. The half-hour interviews were conducted in the Capitol by staff from the House historian’s office. Most were given in March 2021, with one in May and another in January 2022. They have remained largely, if not completely, unseen since they were conducted. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) was first elected in 1996 and had been through the ceremonial certification process before. On the morning of Jan. 6, he said he expected some hemming and hawing as opponents made objections to some states’ electoral ballots for Joe Biden, but not much more. “I surely didn’t expect an insurrection,” he said. As a former Marine, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) was just the opposite. He had been tracking violent rhetoric online. “I knew there was going to be fireworks,” he said. Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.), a freshman member for whom Jan. 6 was only her fourth day on the job, said she thought it would be a long day and night. But she also brought to work a bottle of champagne she planned to open later with fellow freshman Rep. Nikema Williams (D-Ga.), to mark Democrats’ upset sweep the night before of two Senate seats from Georgia. “I was also in a very festive mood, wanting to celebrate what we had just done in Georgia,” she said. By the time the House began to discuss the first challenge to certification, an objection to Arizona’s electoral votes at about 1:20 p.m., attackers had already breached the bike rack fencing around the Capitol and had begun facing off with officers on the west side of the building. Inside, though, most members were unaware of the situation. Several recalled being puzzled by texts or messages from family members and staff asking if they were OK. The idea that members wouldn’t be safe in the U.S. Capitol, in the House chamber, seemed absurd. “If I respond that I’m on the floor, that means both I’m working and that I’m in a very safe location. It’s not a place that I would think would be, that there could be, a problem,” Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas) said. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), in the audience gallery one floor above and overlooking the House floor, left the room with then-Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) to check the situation for himself after one of his daughters sent him TV footage. They asked a Capitol Police officer if they were prepared. “She said, ‘Gentlemen, we’re in the United States Capitol. This is the safest building in the country. And darn right, we’re prepared.’ Ten minutes later, we were back in the chamber and the speaker and the majority leader were removed,” he said. Prior to the leaders’ removal, there had been other signs of trouble. Jacobs, sitting in the House gallery for the first time, said she didn’t understand a phone alert saying the nearby Madison Building, which is a block from Capitol, had been evacuated. “I was so new that I didn’t know what that meant,” she said. A little bit more than 50 minutes into the session, McGovern was asked by a Pelosi staffer if he could sub in for her in the speaker’s chair if she needed him to. He agreed and she thanked him as she left. “She left her phone on the table, so I expected her to be right back,” he said. But Pelosi, along with Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) had been whisked off the floor by security. The abrupt departure of the House leaders from the floor was when the gravity of the situation dawned on many members. “I remember they took Steny Hoyer so aggressively he couldn’t even bring his papers. He tried to grab his papers as they were escorting him from the chamber and he couldn’t reach them,” Allred said. Any remaining doubts were quickly dispelled by the House going into recess — and the announcement that insurrectionists were in the Rotunda, just a minute’s walk from the floor, and that Capitol Police had deployed tear gas. Security officers locked the doors to the chamber and began barricading them with furniture. Members were asked to don gas masks that were stored under the chairs. But hardly any of them knew how to use them and just getting them out of the sealed packaging was frustratingly difficult. “We couldn’t open the damn thing,” said Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.). “It’s like that paper that film used to come in but very heavy, metal. And we’re frantic. We think we’re going to die and we can’t open the damn thing.” Gallego said the order to put on gas masks was when people started freaking out. As a veteran, he explained how to put them on and urged his colleagues to keep calm once they got them on. “You could put on a hood or a gas mask and if you’re hyperventilating, you’re basically just producing more carbon dioxide than you are actually taking in oxygen and you can pass out,” he said. That’s when Phillips heard the whizzing sound he said he would never forget, as members put on their hoods, which included small fans inside. “When about a hundred of them are being used at the same time, it sounds like a siren,” he said. “It’s one of those sounds that you never quite forget. That’s what I remember more than anything else, the collective sound of the masks.” Allred said the locking of the doors and the barricade brought home that lawmakers might have to make their last stand in the chamber. “At that point, I thought that we may not have a way out,” he said. He thought about his 23-month old son and his wife, who was seven and a half months pregnant at the time. Expecting he wouldn’t be back before bedtime, he’d told his son that morning he would see him the next day. “I texted my wife, ‘Whatever happens, I love you,’ because I thought that might be the last thing I say to her,” Allred said. He took off his suit coat, ordinarily a breach of floor protocol, and talked with Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) and Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) about what they might have to do to defend themselves. Two female lawmakers, then-Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) said they’d stick behind Allred, who had been listed at 6’1” and 242 lbs. during his days as an NFL linebacker. “I’ll do my best,” he told them. Around that time, attackers began pounding on the north side door of the chamber, the one the president walks through to go down the chamber’s center aisle when he gives a State of the Union address. “And it’s at that point that I started thinking about semi-automatic weapons and a mass shooting,” said Kuster. “I didn’t know if they had weapons, but I definitely didn’t know if they didn’t.” Kuster’s voice began to break as she recalled the day and she gently wiped a tear from her right eye. “I remember thinking to myself, ‘You have to think rational thoughts, don’t get frantic, just make good decisions. This is life or death.’” Kuster said she grabbed Jacobs, in her “crazy tall high heels,” and pulled her to the floor with her so they would be less visible if the attackers breached the chamber. They crouched and made their way across the gallery to the other side of the chamber. An officer led them out of the gallery to an elevator but once in, they worried where it would go. What if the doors opened and there was the mob? The officer reassured them. “He was just so incredible. He stood up like this and said, ‘Ma’am, I am here to protect you,’ and he just blocked the door,” Kuster said. Before Kuster and Jacobs left the gallery, the members and staff on the House floor were evacuated out of a door that opened into the Speaker’s Lobby, a large anteroom right outside the chamber. A combination door and glass partition sealed the lobby from the attackers. It was a break in that glass partition that Ashli Babbitt tried to climb through when she was fatally shot, only a few feet away from a door that opened directly into the chamber. Hearing the shot, Jacobs said she thought it was a flash-bang grenade. “I remember sitting and thinking to myself, ‘Those doors are going to open and there’s going to be someone with a machine gun, and we’re all done for.’ And trying to think of what I needed to send my team, so that they could at least do something good with that death,” she said. “I have been in pretty tough places. I worked [for] the State Department, the U.N., armed conflict. And it was definitely the closest I ever felt to feeling like I was going to die.” McGovern and Gallego recollected trying to ensure no one was being left behind as the floor was evacuated, making them among the last to leave. As they entered the lobby, McGovern said he felt a surge of anger as looked to his left to see the attackers trying to break the glass. “These people were breaking things, in this historic building. What the hell is wrong with you people?” he recalled thinking. “What I was really thinking was I wanted to turn and give them the middle finger and utter something that I don’t want to repeat here.” The look in their eyes was what he said stayed with him. “They seemed, like, manic, or it was like they were almost possessed in terms of just this anger. If looks could say, ‘I hate you,’ that’s the way I felt they looked at me,” he said. Gallego said he had a personal reason as well for wanting to do all he could to save his fellow members. He said he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from combat. “One of the things I’ve always regretted, from my time in the war, were when I think [about] things I should have done that could have had better outcomes. I always carry that weight with me,” he said. He then paused as his eyes began to well up. “So that day, I just knew that whatever I was going to do, I was not going to carry regrets again like that,” he said. Allred said as he left the floor he saw a staffer grabbing the decorative inkwells on the speaker’s podium and another taking the ceremonial House mace, the two oldest objects in the House. The inkwells date from 1819 and the mace from 1841, replacing the one the British burned in 1814. “It was like something out of the French Revolution or something, grabbing these kind of priceless heirlooms of our democracy and trying to preserve them from the mob.” According to the report by the congressional committee that investigated Jan. 6, the House leaders had been removed at about 2:25 p.m., a little over an hour after the session had started. The floor had been evacuated by 2:38 p.m. and the members in the gallery, who had to wait longer to get out, were gone by 3 p.m. The lawmakers and staff and even some reporters were led through the Capitol grounds’ network of tunnels to a safe room in one of the three House office buildings. But that room had big windows, and members complained it didn’t feel very safe, so they were quickly relocated to a large room in another building. But they weren’t out of the woods. There were still fears of attackers in the office buildings as well, and members worried their hiding place might be discovered. While there was broad, bipartisan support for going back into session to finish the electoral vote counting as quickly as possible, there was also talk of simply continuing the count in the room, Jacobs and Gallego said. Gallego wasn’t sure they should have even left the House floor. “We should have not shown we had fear and stayed there and continued to vote,” he said. But as time passed with no signs of danger, lawmakers began to settle in. Many members took to their phones to call friends and loved ones to let them know they were all right, even if they weren’t sure they could say that. “I thought that being taken hostage would have been the best-case scenario. I didn’t share that with my family at the time, of course,” Phillips said. By the time the building and grounds had been cleared by police pushing the attackers back, a job finished around 6 p.m., the stress had begun to wear. Kuster said she turned around to notice a Republican lawmaker next to her was not wearing a COVID mask. She offered him one from her stock of extras in her purse. “There’s a lot of people in this room, you shouldn’t be without a mask,” she told him. “And he just looked at me. He declined and he said to me, ‘I can’t breathe.’” “And I thought, ‘I can’t believe you just used those words,’” she said. The phrase had been a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement that reemerged in the summer of 2020, and which many Republicans had rejected. When lawmakers returned to the chamber at 8 p.m. after about five hours away, it was a mess. The windows of the doors had been broken and glass was strewn everywhere. One member said a faint smell of tear gas could still be made out. Democrats had assumed that because there was near-unanimity on returning to the floor as soon as possible and finishing the count, Republicans would also give up on their state-specific vote challenges. When that turned out not to be the case and objectors spoke up to dispute Pennsylvania’s results, tempers flared. “People who I know and who I knew were frightened for their lives when we were in the secure location got up and made an objection. I think 140-some odd voted to object, and that was shocking to us. That was hard to take,” Kuster said. At 3:32 a.m., the final objections had been dealt with and Biden was officially declared the 2020 winner. Jacobs, who returned to the chamber because “I didn’t want it to become this big scary place I was afraid to go to,” said she had expected more fanfare. “I’ll be honest, it was a bit anticlimactic,” she said. With three years’ hindsight, some of the takeaways in the interviews sound startlingly prescient, from lingering feelings of betrayal to uncertainty about what would be the impact of the attack. “I’m still pissed at a lot of them,” McGovern said of his Republican colleagues. “All these weeks later, I really have a hard time looking at them. I mean, I don’t want to get into an elevator with them. I’m afraid I will say something that I will regret.” Jacobs said her past in international affairs showed her the importance of there being consequences for attacks like Jan. 6. “Having worked in a lot of countries that have been torn apart by violence, how your political leaders act in the wake of that violence is one of the most important things,” she said. She added it was important Trump had been impeached — even though he was not ultimately convicted — for his actions in allegedly inciting the attack. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nuscale-layoffs-nuclear-power_n_65985ac5e4b075f4cfd24dba,Mass Layoffs At Pioneering Nuclear Startup,alexander c. kaufman,1/5/2024,"Almost exactly one year ago, NuScale Power made history as the first of a new generation of nuclear energy startups to win regulatory approval of its reactor design ― just in time for the Biden administration to begin pumping billions of federal dollars into turning around the nation’s atomic energy industry. But as mounting costs and the cancellation of its landmark first power plant have burned through shrinking cash reserves, the Oregon-based company is laying off nearly a third of its workforce. At a virtual all-hands meeting Friday afternoon, the company announced the job cuts to remaining employees. HuffPost reviewed the audio of the meeting. Two sources with direct knowledge of NuScale’s plans confirmed the details of the layoffs. By Friday evening, NuScale’s stock price had plunged more than 8% as investors sold off shares. NuScale did not respond to a call, an email or a text message seeking comment. In a press release issued Monday, the company confirmed it had laid off 154 individual employees, or 28% of its full-time staff. Sources told HuffPost on Friday the cuts affected as much as 40% of the total workforce. The spokesperson who sent HuffPost the announcement Monday morning did not respond to an email asking how many part-time workers and contractors the firm has let go. Surging construction costs are imperiling clean energy across the country. In just the past two months, developers have pulled the plug on major offshore wind farms in New Jersey and New York after state officials refused to let companies rebid for contracts at a higher rate. But the financial headwinds are taking an especially acute toll on nuclear power. It takes more than a decade to build a reactor, and the only new ones under construction in the U.S. and Europe went billions of dollars over budget in the past two decades. Many in the atomic energy industry are betting that small modular reactors ― shrunken down, lower-power units with a uniform design ― can make it cheaper and easier to build new nuclear plants through assembly-line repetition. The U.S. government is banking on that strategy to meet its climate goals. The Biden administration spearheaded a pledge to triple atomic energy production worldwide in the next three decades at the United Nations’ climate summit in Dubai last month, enlisting dozens of partner nations in Europe, Asia and Africa. The two infrastructure-spending laws that President Joe Biden signed in recent years earmark billions in spending to develop new reactors and keep existing plants open. And new bills in Congress to speed up U.S. nuclear deployments and sell more American reactors abroad are virtually all bipartisan, with progressives and right-wing Republicans alike expressing support for atomic energy. But the U.S. trails rivals like China and Russia in deploying new types of reactors, including those based on technologies that scientists working for the federal government first developed. Until November, NuScale appeared on track to debut the nation’s first atomic energy station powered with small modular reactors. But the project to build a dozen reactors in the Idaho desert, and sell the electricity to ratepayers across the Western U.S. through a Utah state-owned utility, was abandoned as rising interest rates made it harder for NuScale to woo investors willing to bet on something as risky a first-of-its-kind nuclear plant. The cancellation of the so-called Carbon Free Power Project “was a surprise to pretty much everyone,” a former NuScale engineer, who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating future employers, said after losing his job. The company had become far less transparent since its stock market debut, the former employee said, noting that the press release announcing the power plant’s cancellation claimed that NuScale and its partners “mutually” decided to call it quits. “As much as NuScale might publicly say it was a mutual decision,” the employee said, “I bet they’d say laying us off was a mutual decision to part ways, too.” In 2022, NuScale went public via a SPAC deal, a type of merger that became a popular way for debt-laden startups to pay back venture capitalists with a swifter-than-usual initial public offering on the stock market. In its latest quarterly earnings, NuScale reported just under $200 million in cash reserves, nearly 40% of which was tied up in restricted accounts. On a call with analysts in November, Ramsey Hamady, NuScale’s chief financial officer, said the firm expected to “take in about $50 million worth of cash from customers from work that we do.” But the firm spent more than that in the previous three-month cycle ― a function, the executive said, of how project costs fluctuate regularly. “This isn’t just a fixed-expense business. There’s variable expense, and there’s a lot of discretionary spending,” Hamady said. “We spend more as we have contracts, and we pull in our spending as contracts either get pushed out or delayed or whether we want to focus more on discretionary spend or nondiscretionary spend.” While severance payments would add roughly $3 million in this quarter’s operating losses, the company said Monday the job cuts would save up to $60 million.

NuScale, which has four other projects proposed in the U.S. and tentative deals in at least eight other countries, isn’t the only nuclear startup navigating choppy waters. In October, Maryland-based X-energy, which is working with the federal government to develop a next-generation reactor using gas instead of water for cooling, cut part of its workforce and scrapped plans to go public. In September, California-based Oklo appeared to lose a more than $100 million contract to build its its liquid-metal-cooled “micro-reactors” at an Air Force base in Alaska, as the independent Northern Journal newsletter first reported. But the Defense Department said in a statement that the deal was never finalized, and that the bureaucratic change that took place in the fall and appeared to revoke Oklo’s contract was a misunderstood procedural technicality. Oklo said it’s on track with plans to start selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Nor are the nuclear industry’s high-tech newcomers the only ones with issues. The U.S. utilities that operate the world’s largest fleet of traditional reactors balked last month at the Biden administration’s proposed regulations for making clean hydrogen fuel. Constellation, the country’s top nuclear operator, said the rules rendered existing reactors ineligible for a lucrative tax credit for making hydrogen with carbon-free electricity, and threatened to sue the administration. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago triggered an energy shock as European democracies scrambled to find alternatives to buying natural gas from Moscow. The constant need to replenish pipelines using a fuel with a wildly fluctuating price put a new premium on nuclear energy’s steady 24-hour output without needing refueling for two years or more. To boot, nuclear reactors don’t produce planet-heating emissions, and they generate orders of magnitude more electricity, more frequently and on less land, than solar panels or wind turbines. Yet as the U.S. and its allies sanctioned the oil and gas exports funding Russia’s war chest, the Kremlin’s state-owned nuclear company, Rosatom, has remained immune, since American and European reactors depend on fuel that it enriches. Russia is building most of the new reactors in the works in places like Bangladesh, Egypt and Turkey, and just signed a new deal for more in India. China, meanwhile, is constructing more reactors at home than nearly all the world combined, and built four large-scale reactors using the leading new American design before the U.S. could complete its first. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

In December, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to ban Russian uranium imports. While it’s unlikely to become law, the U.S. last year finally took the first step toward supplying its own nuclear fuel again. At an industrial site in Ohio this past autumn, the private company that succeeded what was once the U.S. government’s in-house nuclear fuel enricher began producing the American-made alternative to a special kind of uranium fuel that companies like Oklo need. In just the last few months, three new uranium mines have entered into production in Arizona and Utah. There’s a clear demand. The price of uranium eclipsed $91 per pound this week for the first time since the 2011 Fukushima disaster.",0.114846221,0.256340631

Trump stood trial in 2023 on civil charges that he, his sons Donald Trump, Jr. and Eric Trump and two other associates engaged in decades of financial fraud by inflating his net worth to obtain more favorable loans to operate in the real estate industry. New York Judge Arthur Engoron ruled on Sept. 26 that Trump had committed fraud before the trial began. Closing arguments in the trial are set to be held on Jan. 11. The brief filed by James lays out the punishment she is seeking for Trump, his sons and their associates once the trial is over. Trump should be permanently barred from working in the state of New York’s real estate industry, while his sons should face five-year bans on “participating in the real estate industry in New York State or serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or other legal entity,” according to the brief. In addition, Trump and his corporate entities should face a disgorgement of $370 million to recoup the money he saved in interest payments thanks to his fraudulent activity. Previously, James had recommended the court fine Trump at least $250 million. Trump is estimated to be worth $3.1 billion, according to Bloomberg. The recommendation of a $370 million disgorgement comes from an estimate that Trump saved $168 million in interest payments by committing fraud in his application for a loan to purchase 40 Wall Street, $139 million in profits for selling the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., $60 million in profits from the sale of the Ferry Point golf club and $2.5 million in bonuses paid to accomplices. A ban on participating in the New York real estate industry would be extremely damaging to Trump’s business empire. The court could also strip Trump of four of his signature properties in New York City, including Trump Tower, which would significantly lower his net worth.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/south-asian-artists-solidarity-palestinians_n_6595c74ae4b0f27b6e362d9a,These South Asian Artists Want Palestinian Liberation — And They’re Not Being Quiet About It,alisha sahay,1/5/2024,"Refaat Alareer seemed resigned to his fate when he wrote “If I Must Die,” the last poem he would publish, on Nov. 1. “If I must die / you must live / to tell my story,” the first lines read. The renowned Palestinian professor, activist and poet was killed along with his family just a month later in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza. Alareer was one of more than 22,000 Palestinians who have been killed by Israeli forces since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel, when militants killed 1,200 people and took 240 hostages. The violence toward both civilians and combatants rages on, with far more dire repercussions for the Palestinians. Those who remain in Gaza face agonizing existences. The Israeli government has blocked resources entering the region, resulting in starvation. They’ve also imposed communications blackouts and forcibly displaced 90% of Palestinians from their homes. Horrifying evidence of war crimes has emerged in recent months. Journalists and storytellers on the ground in Gaza, such as Bisan Owda and Motaz Azaiza, have been using social media to document these atrocities for the world to see. As news spreads, allies outside the Palestinian territories have been expressing their solidarity as well. “For Refaat, we must be louder than ever and make sure the focus returns to what is actually happening in real time to those on the ground,” Canadian poet Rupi Kaur wrote in a tribute to Alareer on Instagram. “Because theirs are the lives we can still save.” Kaur, whose family is from the Punjab state of India, is one of several South Asian artists using their platforms to raise awareness. Other South Asians, including poets, writers, comedians and painters, have called for a permanent end to the violence, setting up fundraisers toward humanitarian efforts and more. Their voices and work are more important than ever, especially in encouraging others in the community to speak up, since many remain hesitant to “choose a side.” There are myriad reasons behind this. Some are cultural, like fear of career repercussions, pressures of the model minority myth and internalized Islamophobia. But regardless of the reasoning, it’s critical for South Asians globally to dismantle biases that prevent us from speaking up. The silence makes us complicit. Artists have always been at the forefront of social and political issues, centering liberation and creating spaces for audiences to engage with them. As it becomes more vital to recognize Palestinians’ decades-long resistance to oppression, these South Asian artists are using their crafts — in addition to boycotting, calling representatives, engaging in protests and more — to help us process it. These writers, visual artists and literary virtuosos are masters of blending culture and activism, and they exemplify just how art is a reflection of our humanity. Whether you’re into Kaur and her poetry or not, there’s no denying that the 31-year-old’s work has always focused on the resilience of humanity. And she continues to embed that ethos in her advocacy. During the last few months, she has been writing poems, sharing updates and imploring her 4.6 million Instagram followers to take action. Perhaps most notably, she shared that she declined an invitation to the White House’s annual Diwali party days after the House of Representatives passed a resolution to fund $14.5 billion in military aid to Israel. “When a government’s actions dehumanize people anywhere, it is our moral imperative to call for Justice,” she wrote. “Demand a humanitarian ceasefire. Sign petitions. Attend protests. Boycott. Call your reps and say — stop the genocide.” No Nazar’s mission to unite communities and cultures through music might seem simple, but the DJ collective wields an unmatched artistry that expands its listeners’ worldviews sonically. It meshes South Asian sounds with genres from Afrobeats to baile funk. For Bianca Maieli, 34, and Omar Ahmed, 29, the troupe’s co-founders, it was crucial to use their music and platform to show solidarity with Palestinians. The group hosted two fundraiser DJ sets in November, one in Los Angeles and one in New York City, spotlighting a roster of Palestinian music and sounds. Part of the proceeds from the shows went to Palestine Legal, a nonprofit that protects those in the U.S. who have been targeted for speaking out for the Palestinians. The decision to host the events wasn’t easy. They grappled with the idea of hosting events while a humanitarian crisis looms. “It was challenging to follow through hosting the show because of all the emotions I was feeling — rage, sadness, guilt,” Ahmed said. “The question of ‘Why are we doing this?’ kept coming up in my head.” After conversations, they decided to go through with it, with the intention of creating a physical space for people to engage with the cause and connect with others who share their feelings. “Dance and music are linked so much to protest and politics,” Maieli said. “So we wanted to approach it from that lens in the most respectful way possible while using our artistry to hopefully make a change, if not bring awareness or uplift the community.” “People don’t realize that their single voice, combined with a billion other single voices, make up a massive collective consciousness,” Ahmed said. Everything about visual artist Babneet Paul Lakhesar, 30, is unapologetic: her work, bold and bright portraits of femininity, and her advocacy, firmly rooted in her belief in humanity. Embracing solidarity with Palestinians, then, was instinctive. As a Punjabi Sikh, Lakhesar, also known as Babbu the Painter, understood the pains and plights of Palestinians, with generations of her family and community afflicted by both the India and Pakistan Partition violence and the 1984 Sikh genocide. The artist released a #FreePalestine art series: vases patterned with the black-and-white keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian solidarity, as well as prints and stickers depicting a young girl wearing a keffiyeh with fireworks in her eyes. “The whole idea behind the painting was there’s a young woman who’s looking up, and the sky is not going to be bombed one day,” Lakhesar said. Lakhesar isn’t concerned about how her audience responds to her activism and work. “I am on a path where I want to be authentic to who I am,” she says. “And if that does not resonate with you, then maybe I’m not the artist that you’re looking for.” You may have seen Abby Govindan, 26, going viral on X (formerly Twitter) every other day for her very real and hilarious observations on the world. True to her signature honesty and outspokenness, the comedian has been vocal about her support for Palestinians over the years. Govindan says she personally chooses to not make jokes about Israel or the Palestinians because she doesn’t have the lived experience. But she’s a firm believer that “the onus should be on the rest of us to show the oppressors that we outnumber them.” In October, Govindan hosted a sold-out fundraiser comedy event in New York City with fellow comedian Mohanad Elshieky. Part of the proceeds went to the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, which provides medical and humanitarian aid to children in the Palestinian territories and in the Middle East at large. “People in NYC are so hungry for a political safe space where we can commiserate (and even make jokes about!) our desire for a Free Palestine far away from the islamophobia and anti-semitism that is so rife in many many other comedy spaces,” she wrote on Instagram. Govindan says she’s lost brand deals and followers because of her stance, but that if it means upholding her belief system and demanding a foundational level of humanity and empathy for the oppressed, it’s worth it. “I would much rather be on the right side of history than staying silent out of fear of alienating anyone,” she said. For Batool, who asked not to be identified by her full name in this story, protesting the treatment of Palestinians was no question. From a young age, the creative writer and poet has been instilled with a passion for bettering humanity, through her faith and identity as an American Pakistani Shia Muslim and through her family. Her father leads a nonprofit that provides humanitarian aid and health care across the globe. “It is important to me to stand up for those who are facing injustices because my poetry is rooted in my identities,” she said. “My religion and my culture provide me with the toolbox; poetry, to speak up and teach me the necessity to advocate and protest.” Writing is both how Batool processes the harrowing images coming from Gaza and how she calls for an end to the violence. She also looks to Palestinian poets and essayists — Alareer, Mosab Abu Toha, Hiba Abu Nada, Hala Alyan and others — to rekindle her advocacy for Palestinians. “I am protesting because it is the right thing to do, because I am human, because there is no other option,” the writer said. “Humanity exists in each heart that beats for change, in each cry that echoes the calls for a cease-fire and a permanent, peaceful solution.” The worlds that Hazem Asif, 30, illustrates are fantastical and retro — and those qualities are what makes him a powerful artist and activist. His work acknowledges solemn political and social realities while visualizing a vibrant optimism for a just future. On Palestine, his work dreams of its liberation. “With my artworks, I hope to express my voice and frustrations towards the silent dominant world powers and oppressors,” he said. “I perceive art not just to craft beauty but as a peace-driven instrument capable of sparking change, inspiring and educating the new generation to advocate for what is just.” Asif’s influence is global; his illustrations have been used on protest posters and shared widely across social media. He has also collaborated with Palestinian American apparel brand Paliroots, with proceeds going toward humanitarian aid in Gaza.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cnn-jan-6-republicans-deny-reality_n_6598271fe4b0bfe5ff6310be,CNN Host Skewers Republicans With Their Own Words In Segment On Jan. 6 Reality,josephine harvey,1/5/2024,"CNN anchor Phil Mattingly on Friday dedicated a biting segment to the reality of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. “Tomorrow will mark three years since thousands of Americans, lied to by the president of the United States and their elected representatives, perpetrated an assault on the building that has come to symbolize democracy across the globe, and the men and women who work on its grounds,” he said on “CNN This Morning.” “That’s not an opinion. It’s not an interpretation. It’s not one side of a debate. It is an unequivocal, demonstrable fact.” Mattingly called out a recent Associated Press article contrasting how the insurrection is described by President Joe Biden and predecessor Donald Trump, whose followers overran the Capitol. “One attack, two interpretations: Biden and Trump both make the Jan. 6 riot a political rallying cry,” read the story’s headline. “There aren’t, in fact, two interpretations,” Mattingly said. “There is what happened, and then there are lies.” To illustrate his point, the CNN anchor played clips of Republican lawmakers describing the Jan. 6 attack “in their own words, on or shortly after that day.” For example, now-former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) had detailed how rioters overwhelmed law enforcement at the Capitol. “They scaled walls,” McCarthy, then the House minority leader, said in an audio recording. “They brought ropes. They were scaling the scaffolding. They overtook the place.” “That was Kevin McCarthy a week after the attack,” Mattingly said. “He’s currently unemployed, but he was once the House speaker and did more than any other Republican to halt the party’s break from Trump after Jan. 6.” Tomorrow will mark 3 years since the assault on the U.S. Capitol – but there are many who still deny the reality of the violence that unfolded that day. @Phil_Mattingly breaks down the truth about January 6th. pic.twitter.com/onbKKEH3VH A separate clip showed Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) in February 2021, insisting, “You’re not going to get anything but condemnation from me for what happened with those criminals at the Capitol on Jan. 6.” Mattingly also read aloud a text message that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) had sent during the assault. “I was just told there’s an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol,” she wrote to Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff at the time. “Please tell the President to calm people,” she added. “This isn’t the way to solve anything.” McCarthy, Hawley and Greene have since endorsed Trump’s 2024 bid for the White House. But, as Mattingly noted, what they had each described “was the reality of that day.” In the years following the riot, Republicans have sought to downplay and whitewash the violence carried out by the mob seeking to overturn the 2020 results. Trump, the leading candidate in the GOP presidential race, faces a federal indictment in connection to his attempted coup, as well as three other criminal cases. He has pleaded not guilty.

Among Americans identifying as Republican, the number who believe that Biden’s election victory was legitimate has fallen since 2021, according to a poll released this week. It also found that fewer Republicans believe Jan. 6 was “mostly violent” and that fewer think Trump bears responsibility for the attack. The Washington Post-University of Maryland poll further revealed that a quarter of Americans believe the FBI instigated the riot — a conspiracy theory that some prominent Republican lawmakers have also embraced.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nra-ceo-wayne-lapierre-resignation_n_659851cee4b075f4cfd24b09,NRA Head Wayne LaPierre Stepping Down From Gun Rights Group,nina golgowski,1/5/2024,"National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre announced Friday that he is stepping down from the gun rights lobbying group, with the timing coming days before the start of a civil trial against him and other NRA executives. “With pride in all that we have accomplished, I am announcing my resignation from the NRA,” LaPierre, who became the group’s CEO and executive vice president in 1991, said in a statement in which he also vowed to “never stop supporting the NRA.” The 74-year-old reportedly cited health reasons as the motivation behind his departure, which will take effect Jan. 31 and leave Andrew Arulanandam, the head of general operations, as interim CEO. But LaPierre’s departure also lines up with a civil trial against him and other NRA insiders named in a lawsuit by New York State Attorney General Letitia James. Jury selection has already begun in the trial, which is expected to begin Monday. James has accused LaPierre and other current and former NRA executives of misusing millions of dollars in donations to the nonprofit organization in a 2020 lawsuit that seeks to dissolve the group. LaPierre has denied wrongdoing. On Friday, James called LaPierre’s resignation “an important victory in our case” and said it “validates our claims against him.” “All charities in New York state must adhere to the rule of law, and my office will not tolerate gross mismanagement or top executives funneling millions into their own pockets. Our case will move ahead, and we look forward to proving the facts in court,” she said in a statement. The NRA acknowledged the start of the civil trial next week in its statement on LaPierre’s resignation while arguing that its board of directors has taken steps to right internal wrongs. The board “has undertaken significant efforts to perform a self-evaluation, recommended termination of disgraced ‘insiders’ and vendors who allegedly abused the Association, and accepted reimbursement, with interest, for alleged excess benefit transactions from LaPierre, as reported in public tax filings,” the NRA said, while also thanking LaPierre for his leadership.

The organization’s membership and donations have significantly dropped in recent years as allegations of internal mismanagement and corruption emerged and gun violence surged across the nation. The group attempted to file for bankruptcy in 2021, but the request was dismissed by a federal judge in Texas who ruled that the organization was trying to use bankruptcy to evade James’ lawsuit in New York. The NRA’s attorneys said it was trying to incorporate in Texas and avoid a political attack by James, who is a Democrat.

The uncanny resemblance between Vida and her mother, supermodel Camila Alves, came to wide attention Thursday, when McConaughey shared two rare photos on Instagram to celebrate the teenager’s birthday, leaving social media users both dazed and confused. “To Vida, who never passed a flower she didn’t pick, Happy Birthday,” McConaughey wrote in the caption, noting that Vida’s actual birthday was Wednesday. “A day late because my mobile device flew out of my pocket on the roller coaster loop at her birthday yesterday!” The photos show Vida in a field of tall grass under an overcast sky, and elsewhere gazing off at a backlit mountain on the horizon. The post has garnered more than 130,000 likes. While McConaughey was focused on the teen’s birthday, fans’ minds were elsewhere entirely. “God does she look like her mama,” wrote one person on Instagram. “Camilla’s mini me,” noted another. “Her mom’s twin,” someone else agreed. “‘Vida’ is Portuguese for ‘life’ and that’s what God gave us this morning,” McConaughey reportedly wrote on his now-defunct blog after his daughter was born in 2010. “Camila’s recovering wonderfully and we are both truly honored to welcome this little lady into our family.” Alves, who has graced the covers of publications like Men’s Vogue, Ocean Drive and People, reportedly met McConaughey at a Los Angeles bar in 2006.

The state’s Division of Elections reported that the petition to put abortion on the ballot has received 911,029 verified signatures, as of Friday morning. The state requires 891,523 signatures for an amendment — a big hurdle in Florida, which has seen some of the most high-profile abortion battles since the Supreme Court repealed federal protections in 2022. The amendment seeks to guarantee access to abortion care up to fetal viability, which is usually around 24 weeks. Although hitting the threshold is a big milestone, the state Supreme Court ― known to lean conservative ― still has to sign off on the wording of the proposed ballot initiative. “No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider,” the amendment states. As of now, the amendment clarifies that it would not change the state’s current law that requires parental consent for a minor to obtain an abortion. Abortion rights advocates celebrated the win on Friday, knowing it’s a critical step in a highly contentious abortion battle that’s been ongoing in the state. “The fact that we only launched our campaign only eight months ago and we’ve already reached our petition goal speaks to the unprecedented support and momentum there is to get politicians out of our private lives and health care decisions,” Lauren Brenzel, campaign director of Floridians Protecting Freedom, said during a Friday afternoon press conference. Floridians Protecting Freedom is a coalition of statewide organizations, including Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and Women’s Voices of Southwest Florida, that’s sponsoring the amendment. “Most initiative campaigns never make it this far,” Brenzel added. “The ones that do usually spend far more or take much longer to qualify, which is why we’re so confident that voters will approve our amendment once they’re given a chance to vote.” The Florida Supreme Court has scheduled a Feb. 7 hearing on the ballot proposal. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody and other anti-choice advocates are fighting the initiative, claiming that the amendment is misleading — a tactic used by Republicans in several other states that have since passed pro-choice ballot initiatives. Moody has filed briefs arguing that the term “viability” is ambiguous. Helene Barthelemay, an attorney defending the petition in the upcoming arguments before the Florida Supreme Court, refuted that the term is ambiguous, pointing out that the proposed amendment uses the same definition of viability as the state of Florida and the federal government. “It’s clear to us that the attorney general’s position is a disingenuous argument by a politician desperate to block Floridians from voting on this amendment,” Barthelemay told reporters on Friday. “It’s ironic because the reason this amendment has such strong support is precisely because Floridians don’t want this kind of political interference in their private lives and their personal decisions.” “The truth is voters know what viability means and they will see right through this effort to silence their voice and vote to approve this amendment in November.” Florida currently has a 15-week abortion ban in effect, which was championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), an extreme abortion opponent. DeSantis, who is also in the running to be the Republican presidential candidate, signed a six-week abortion ban into law last year, but it will not go into effect until the state Supreme Court rules on a challenge to the current 15-week restriction.

Pro-choice amendments have won out in every state where abortion was on the ballot since 2022, including in red and purple states like Kentucky and Ohio. “Signatures came from everyone and everywhere, proving once again this is not a Republican or Democratic issue — it’s about freedom, healthcare, and safety,” state Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book tweeted on Friday. “No woman and no doctor should fear imprisonment over abortion care.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) for what organizers claimed would be a small book signing abruptly canceled it Thursday after learning the gathering was actually meant to commemorate the third anniversary of the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Westgate Resorts’ Kissimmee, Florida, location said the Osceola Republican Party made no mention of Jan. 6 when they pitched the event, instead describing it as a book signing for Greene’s memoir. “Please be advised that Westgate was not made aware of the purpose of this event when we were approached to host a book signing,” the resort said in a statement. “This event has been cancelled and is no longer taking place at our resort.” Despite the cancellation, the Osceola County Republican Party was still selling tickets to the event as of Friday morning. The tiered tickets range in price from $45 to $1,000, with “Super VIPs” at the highest level receiving “a special private briefing on J6 and DC in a closed-door session.” Osceola County Republican Party chair Mark Cross told The Hill Friday he was unaware Westgate had dropped them. Cross said he believed Democrats were ultimately to blame for “calling people and lying about the purpose of the event.” Asked by NBC News about the cancellation during a campaign event for former President Donald Trump in Iowa, Greene called the question “stupid” and told the outlet, “I really don’t understand the point of your question.

In fact, the Roborock Q5 was just named Wirecutter’s top robot vacuum of 2024; testers noted its competitor-besting suction abilities, easy customization options, quiet performance and impressive laser-assisted organized navigation. “The Q5 cleaned better than any other smart robot at its price,” Wirecutter’s testers reported. What more could you even want, besides a discount? Right now, the Q5 is 40% off at both Amazon and Walmart, making it a truly great time to buy. And for an additional $140, you can grab the also-on-sale upgrade Q5+ model that comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold up to seven weeks’ worth of debris. I have the predecessor model of this vacuum, and there’s truly nothing I don’t love about it: Roborock’s multi-level mapping is great, the app is so intuitive and easy to use, and there’s truly nothing better than sitting on the couch and telling your vacuum to go clean your bedroom (and that’s all you have to do). You can even circle a specific spot on the map to quickly clean up spills, watch your vacuum on the map as it goes to work, or tell it to avoid certain areas during a given cleaning. The Q5 can last up to 180 minutes on a single charge, and like any robot vacuum worth its salt, will dock to recharge if necessary before resuming whatever job you’ve given it to do. Check out some promising reviews from Amazon and Walmart, and grab one for yourself while you can save up to $300. “I reviewed 30 Robotic Vacuum in three different product reviews. Roborock Q5 Robotic Vacuum was in the top. I purchased the Roborock Q5, which is their basic model, and I was not disappointed. This is a must have Robotic Vacuum for all baby boomers including myself at 70 years old. The robot maps off the area and cleans within the perimeters not missing a thing. It captures dog hair and dust like no one‘s business. I cannot tell you how wonderful it really is. A must have!” — Martha at Walmart “After researching various similar vacuums I settled on the Q5. We dint have pets or excessive dirt so it gives us great bang for the buck. We’ve never had a robotic vacuum before and TOTALLY LOVE this thing. It creates an incredibly detailed map that easy to edit and break down into specific areas. The app is easy to use and it’s fun to watch it clean every inch that it can access. And it learns to be more efficient. You can create maps for multiple floors and just plop it onto a new floor and it’ll clean it all and go back to the starting point. You can watch it track around the map and see everywhere it cleaned. So impressed we bought a second one because our upstairs is split by a single step. So each Q5 will cover 2 different floors. You can run it remotely and have it kick in while you’re not even home. Set a schedule or vacuum on demand. Either full cleans or selected rooms. It’s so satisfying to watch a move while the little guy is doing his thing upstairs. Even under the beds and chairs where you never vacuum yourself. Oh, and it moves from hardwood to carpet nicely but to do have to remove loose cords and loose small mats otherwise it can get bound up. For $260 it’s a no-brainer. I just hope that we get good life out of it but we’ll have to see how that goes. This will definitely help your marriage and how can you put a price on that?!” — CMG at Amazon “The features this vacuum cleaner has for the price can’t be beat. We love it. App is super easy to use. Charges quickly. Large dust bin. Deep cleans and has several settings for that. Nice vacuum lines on the carpet and uses Lidar lasers for accurate cleaning. Couldn’t be more happy.” — Tomter at Walmart By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Colorado’s Supreme Court ruled last month that Trump could not legally appear on state primary ballots due to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Trump appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this week. At least four of the nine justices must agree for the case to be added to the court’s docket. The group of voters who sued to keep Trump off the ballot also asked the high court to weigh in, as did the Colorado Republican Party. Led by Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), the ranking member of the House judiciary committee’s subcommittee on the federal courts, the House lawmakers reminded Thomas about the Supreme Court’s new code of conduct, which was agreed upon by the justices amid public pressure to assure their impartiality — in large part due to a string of alarming reports about Thomas’ own conduct. The two-month-old code specifically states that justices should disqualify themselves in situations where their spouse has “a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding.” Thomas’ wife, conservative activist Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, has campaigned fervently to keep Trump in office by pushing disproven claims about election fraud. Her for-profit consultancy firm “is clearly aligned with Mr. Trump’s interests,” the House Democrats wrote. Ginni Thomas even helped plan and attended Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, rally before the crowd turned their sights on the U.S. Capitol. It was this violent event that the Colorado Supreme Court deemed an insurrection, disqualifying Trump from appearing on the ballot. “It is unthinkable that you could be impartial in deciding whether an event your wife personally organized qualifies as an ‘insurrection’ that would prevent someone from holding the office of President,” the lawmakers wrote Thursday. “You have a financial stake in the outcome of this case, which disqualifies you from any involvement in it,” they told Thomas. Last month, congressional Democrats similarly urged the justice to recuse himself from decisions involving Trump’s claim of immunity from federal prosecution.

The Supreme Court denied a request from federal prosecutors to settle Trump’s immunity argument extra quickly, but the order did not attach names to the decision. On social media, Johnson got right to the point. “I’ll say it once again,” he wrote on the platform formerly known as Twitter. “If SCOTUS wants to show the American people that it’s two-month-old Code of Conduct is worth more than the paper it is written on, Thomas must do the honorable thing and RECUSE himself ― immunity & ballot cases.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-bidens-attention-deficit_n_65981ff9e4b0912833afd144,Joe Biden’s Attention Deficit,kevin robillard,1/5/2024,"Joe Biden has an attention problem. The president and his team have never aimed to dominate the news cycle in the style of his predecessor and likely 2024 challenger, Donald Trump. They’ve often been happy to take a policy win — taking Social Security cuts off the board in debt limit talks, for instance — over keeping a weapon in hand to hammer the GOP with. Other times, they’ve been happy to let an increasingly authoritarian and chaotic GOP alienate the electorate without interference. Biden generally avoids one-on-one interviews, which his team views as providing little upside but containing high risk for gaffes. As Biden opens the calendar year of his reelection, the downsides of this strategy may be coming into view: The president, who is essentially tied with Trump nationally and often trails the Republican in polls of key swing states, has left little to no impression with less-engaged voting blocs, including young people, voters who didn’t cast ballots in the 2022 midterm election and Black and Latino voters without a college degree — all groups which, at the moment, are giving Biden less support than they did four years ago. The result is a blank slate of a presidency, according to interviews with multiple Democratic strategists. Voters, they say, have minimal knowledge of Biden’s accomplishments and even less of a sense of his plans, hopes and aspirations for the country. Evan Roth Smith, a partner at the Democratic consulting firm Slingshot Strategies, noted Biden’s working-class “Scranton Joe” persona, built over five decades in politics, has essentially disappeared. “His entire persona has basically been whitewashed,” said Smith, who serves as the lead pollster for Blueprint, which aims to provide messaging advice to Democrats ahead of the 2024 election. “We have a tabula rasa president right now. He’s just being defined by whatever pops in the news cycle.” The latest iteration of The New York Times/Siena College poll, the preeminent driver of Democratic anxiety since its inception, sums up the issue quite well: Biden led by six percentage points among people who cast ballots in the 2022 midterms, but was losing among those who did not vote in the midterms by a whopping 22 percentage points. The result? Biden is winning among likely voters by a 47% to 45% margin, but trails among registered voters by a 46% to 44% margin. Those margins are obviously surmountable, and Trump remains just as unpopular with the electorate as Biden. But for Biden to win over more voters and cement his support, his campaign will need to actually get the electorate to pay attention to his popular-on-paper policy accomplishments on everything from gun control to climate change, which has so far eluded the White House and his political operation. The first element of Biden’s plan will begin on Friday and Monday, when he will deliver a pair of speeches aimed at raising the stakes of the election. His speech in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, on Friday will focus on President Donald Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, and one on Monday at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Columbia, South Carolina, the site of a 2015 mass shooting committed by a white supremacist. “This election will determine the future of American democracy and every American’s fundamental freedoms,” Michael Tyler, the campaign’s communications director, said on a call with reporters earlier this week. Another official, deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks, added: “By the time voters are thinking about the election more, our campaign will be in full swing.” The campaign is already spending tens of millions of dollars on television ads they hope will at least provide insights into how to reach these voters, who live in an ultra-fragmented media environment where they can avoid most political messaging — and usually don’t believe the political messages that do make it through. “The voters who haven’t tuned in yet are more tuned out than anyone in this conversation can possibly conceive of. Politics does not enter their list of interests at all,” a senior Biden campaign official, who requested anonymity to speak frankly about campaign strategy, told HuffPost. “They are super not paying attention yet.” The campaign’s plan for reaching these often unreachable voters is being tested now in Arizona and Wisconsin, where they are running relational organizing pilots built around giving volunteers the ability to persuade their friends and family to back Biden and turn out to vote. The Arizona project is focused on Latino voters, while the Wisconsin operation is focused on young people and Black voters. It’s clear those volunteers will have a lot of work to do — and potentially a lot to work with. In late 2023, two groups on the opposite ends of the Democratic Party’s ideological divides — the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and Blueprint, which is backed by centrist megadonor Reid Hoffman — released polling showing essentially the same thing: Voters know very little about many of Biden’s most theoretically popular accomplishments. For instance, Biden’s fight against so-called “junk fees” attached to airline and concert tickets, checking accounts and hotel reservations is extremely popular with a cost-conscious public, with PCCC finding 85% of likely 2024 voters support his push to ban or limit them. But only 16% of likely voters had “heard a lot from President Biden” on the issue. Similar gaps existed on lowering the cost of insulin, giving Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices and even on high-profile Biden victories like the bipartisan infrastructure package. Of course, the groups took their recommendations in different directions: Blueprint encouraged Biden to brush aside intra-party politics and embrace policy achievements that would alienate many liberals: increasing oil production to all-time highs and cracking down on undocumented immigrants attempting to claim asylum after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. PCCC, on the other hand, was trying to find a message the entire party could jointly deliver, and recommended a message focused on increasing taxes on the wealthy and protecting or expanding Social Security. Still, Democrats and the Biden campaign can’t simply assume voters will naturally learn only the most popular things Biden has done — after all, the Trump campaign will soon be spending millions attacking Biden rather than former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. And to blame the deficit entirely on a lack of attention paid by voters is perhaps too flattering to both liberal sensibilities and the Biden administration’s accomplishments.

The committees will meet on Wednesday to consider a report recommending a contempt of Congress resolution against President Joe Biden’s son, lawmakers said Friday. “Hunter Biden blatantly defied two lawful subpoenas when he did not appear for his December deposition,” the judiciary committee said in a statement posted to X, formerly Twitter. “The President’s son doesn’t get special treatment,” said House oversight chair James Comer (R-Ky.) in a separate online posting. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the ranking member of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, said the committees’ actions against a private citizen, who has agreed to testify, are unwarranted and without precedent. Biden “has offered to testify in public, under oath, and on a day of the Committee’s choosing,” Raskin said in a statement that dismissed the Republicans’ inquiry as lacking credibility. “Chairman Comer does not want Hunter Biden to testify in public, just as he has refused to publicly release over a dozen interview transcripts, because he wants to keep up the carefully curated distortions, blatant lies, and laughable conspiracy theories that have marked this investigation,” Raskin said. “The facts and the evidence all show no wrongdoing and no impeachable offense by President Biden.” Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden’s attorney, also dismissed the investigation as a deceptive political game. “It’s clear the Republican Chairmen aren’t interested in getting the facts or they would allow Hunter to testify publicly,” Lowell said in a statement responding to Friday’s announcement. “House Republicans continue to play politics by seeking an unprecedented contempt motion against someone who has from the first request offered to answer all their proper questions. What are they afraid of?” Hunter Biden was called for questioning about his business dealings by House Republicans who have alleged ― without offering supporting evidence ― that his father benefited from his foreign business deals. He said he would answer lawmakers’ questions, but only if in a public hearing. “There is no fairness or decency in what these Republicans are doing. They have lied over and over about every aspect of my personal and professional life, so much so that their lies have become the false facts believed by too many people,” Hunter Biden said in public remarks last month. The investigation by the two committees, where Republicans hold majorities, is part of a longstanding GOP effort to impeach Joe Biden. The next four years will change America forever.

Worrell was convicted in May on charges of assault, civil disorder and obstruction of an official proceeding. On Thursday, he apologized to D.C. District Judge Royce Lamberth for his actions, while his defense attorney argued for leniency due to Worrell’s health issues. “Nearly three years ago today, I made some choices I sincerely regret,” Worrell told the judge, according to CBS News. “Please forgive me and have mercy on me.” Worrell, who was a member of the “Hurricane Coast” chapter of the Proud Boys in Florida, used a bottle of pepper spray on police officers during the riot, prosecutors said. He was arrested two months later. Following his conviction last year, Worrell was allowed to await his sentencing on house arrest after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He cut off his ankle monitor four days before his sentencing in August and went on the lam for six weeks. It was only when he tried to covertly return to his home in Naples the following month that he was caught by FBI agents who were staked outside, prosecutors said. Rather than surrendering quietly, authorities said, Worrell faked a drug overdose inside his home. Agents found him apparently unresponsive with an opioid prescription medication in his hand. He was taken to a hospital and received five days of medical care and 24-hour police surveillance before being released. “The entire time, Worrell knew he was fine,” prosecutors said in a memorandum filed last week, where they asked the court to increase the sentencing it had planned to impose. Before Worrell’s escape, prosecutors had asked the court to sentence him to 14 years. The next four years will change America forever.

Dunn was one of the few officers who testified before the House Jan. 6 select committee about the racist slurs he endured during the Jan. 6 attack. He released a book last year, “Standing My Ground,” detailing his experience, and has received both the Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Citizens Medal for serving during the insurrection. Dunn, 40, announced his candidacy in a video Friday, on the eve of the third anniversary of the Capitol riot. “On Jan. 6th, 2021, I did my duty as a police officer and as an American and defended our nation’s Capitol from violent insurrectionists,” he said in a statement. “Today, I’m running for Congress because the forces that spurred that violent attack are still at work and as a patriotic American, it is my duty to defend our democracy.” Dunn, who stepped down late last year as a Capitol police officer after 15 years, is running in the crowded primary to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes, whose district encompasses Howard County and parts of Anne Arundel and Carroll counties, all west of Baltimore. The winner of the primary is the favorite to clinch the heavily Democratic seat. The former officer’s announcement video features a reenactment of Jan. 6 with a MAGA flag in the background. Dunn said he’s running in political opposition to Trump to prevent another Jan. 6-like attack from ever happening. “We can’t ever let this happen again, and you’ve heard it from Trump himself: He is hellbent on finishing what he started this day,” Dunn says. “I believe every one of us has a role to play in this fight.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jordan-fisher-hadestown-broadway_n_6593677be4b0bf73e1770816,Jordan Fisher Is Having One Hell Of A Good Time In ‘Hadestown’,curtis m. wong,1/5/2024,"After a “very tumultuous and transitional” 2023, Jordan Fisher is thrilled to be venturing into hell ― a theatrical version of it, that is ― eight times a week. The Alabama-born actor and singer rose to prominence on the Disney Channel more than a decade ago and has since continued his success streak in films like “To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You” and as a recording artist. Along the way, he’s found ways to highlight his love of musical theater both onstage and television. This winter, he’s delivering a dynamite performance in Broadway’s “Hadestown,” now playing at New York’s Walter Kerr Theatre. Written by Anaïs Mitchell, “Hadestown” is a musical reimagining of the Greek tragedy of Orpheus (played by Fisher) and Eurydice (Solea Pfeiffer). Their love story is intertwined with that of Hades (Phillip Boykin) and Persephone (Betty Who), the king and queen of the underworld. After Eurydice is lured into the underworld by Hades’ promises of safety and security, Orpheus sets out on a mission to rescue his beloved. But you won’t find any togas or laurel wreaths in “Hadestown,” which won eight Tony Awards after its 2019 Broadway premiere and remains a hot ticket. The show is staged in a steam-punk, fantastical version of New Orleans, while its score is a sweeping mix of jazz, blues and rock. As a self-professed “mythology nerd,” Fisher first became familiar with “Hadestown” by way of the musical’s 2010 concept album. Once he saw original cast member Reeve Carney portray Orpheus on Broadway, he knew it was “instantly something I wanted to be a part of.” And though his Broadway résumé includes “Hamilton” and “Dear Evan Hansen,” Fisher said “Hadestown” feels “unlike so much of the theater I know and love” in a number of critical ways. “I love Greek mythology, Norse mythology, and I read all of it that I can get my hands on,” Fisher told HuffPost in an interview. “I love the music, love the story, love the storytelling, love how it’s so honest right from the rip and leaves you with a hug. It’s the most complete storytelling experience I’ve had on a Broadway stage.” Catch a clip of Fisher performing “Wait For Me” from “Hadestown” below. As Orpheus, Fisher also plays guitar throughout much of the show — granting him a rare opportunity to infuse his performance with his well-honed skills as a pop-rock musician. “I got to know Orpheus by researching and listening and watching and reading, and taking elements of my own personal journey and incorporating them into [the role],” he said. “Being able to be in the band and play with the band — all of that was something that grabbed my heart. The musicians who are onstage with me aren’t really theater people. They’re touring, gigging musicians that love this craft from a different angle.” Prior to joining the “Hadestown” cast in late November, Fisher was at a personal and professional crossroads. Last spring, he starred as Anthony Hope in the Josh Groban-led revival of “Sweeney Todd,” becoming the first Black actor to play the role on Broadway. He exited the show after about three months due to a number of projects he had in the works, which were then halted by the Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes. He said he ended up using the unexpected downtime to get shoulder surgery. Behind the scenes, Fisher and his wife, Ellie, were navigating the challenges of first-time parenthood after relocating from Florida to New York early in 2023 with their 1-year-old son, Riley. “The moment Riley was born, everything else shrunk,” he explained. “The art changed, the creativity changed, perspective shifted. We had a lot of personal revelatory experiences that helped shape what we know we want as a family moving forward. My purpose is completely different. It’s fresh and new and exciting — and that is to love, to bring support, to take care of the family.” Last month, Fisher got the chance to meld his creative passion with his duties as a dad by following in the footsteps of stars like Neil Patrick Harris and Lin-Manuel Miranda as a narrator for Walt Disney World’s Candlelight Processional holiday event. “Neil said to me, ‘Jordan, this is what you have to do when you get married and have kids,’ so that, for years, has been my dream,” he said. “I’m a very proud Disney adult — I grew up loving the parks, loving everything that Disney brought to my childhood. It helped mold my imagination and love of the arts.” Festive excursions to the happiest place on Earth aside, Fisher is grateful to be putting down roots with his family in New York and expects live theater to become a bigger focus of his career moving forward.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/andrew-weissmann-trump-contempt-jack-smith_n_6597f4dbe4b0f27b6e370fd2,Ex-Prosecutor Thinks Trump's Contempt Motion Says Something About His Legal Team,josephine harvey,1/5/2024,"Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor, suggested Donald Trump’s attorneys have no control over their client and are simply pandering to the MAGA base after they asked a judge to hold special counsel Jack Smith in contempt of court. Trump’s attorneys submitted a filing on Thursday arguing that Smith, the prosecutor overseeing Trump’s federal election subversion case, has violated a stay order put in place by Judge Tanya Chutkan because he submitted pretrial filings during the ongoing pause. Chutkan put the case’s legal proceedings on hold last month while Trump pursues an appeals process on the assertion that he is immune from prosecution. “I think that this is a real sign of the lawyers not being able to say no to their client,” Weissmann told MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell on Thursday. “As somebody in the legal profession, it is disappointing.” Weissmann explained that the stay is in place largely to protect the defense, so Trump’s team doesn’t need to act until the appeal is resolved. He also suggested that Smith’s team was, if anything, being helpful by continuing to meet their deadlines, and noted that there’s no requirement for Trump’s team to look at the material. “They continued filing things and gave discovery to the defense. Usually that’s not something that the defense complains about. They want discovery,” he said. Trump’s team argued in the filing that Smith’s motions contain “partisan rhetoric” and prosecutors are trying to “weaponize the stay to spread political propaganda.” According to Weissmann, the idea that this issue would become the subject of a contempt motion says two things about Trump’s lawyers: “A, that they have no control over their client. B, they’re writing this for an audience unrelated to the court, meaning for sort of the MAGA base.” “And it’s really not how you litigate,” he added. Trump’s team have repeatedly leaned on performative antics and delay tactics in response to the four prosecutions against him, two of which he could quash if he wins his bid for a second presidency.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-employers-add-robust-216000-jobs-in-sign-of-resilient-job-market_n_659808c6e4b0f27b6e371ce6,"U.S. Employers Add Robust 216,000 Jobs In Sign Of Resilient Job Market",paul wiseman,1/5/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s employers added a robust 216,000 jobs last month, the latest sign that the American job market remains resilient even in the face of sharply higher interest rates. Friday’s report from the Labor Department showed that December’s job gain exceeded the 173,000 that were added in November. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7% — the 23rd straight month that joblessness has remained below 4%. The latest data reflect an economy and a job market that are decelerating back to pre-pandemic norms. Hiring remains steady, and while employers are posting fewer openings, they are not laying off many workers. Despite the low unemployment and cooling inflation, polls show that many Americans are dissatisfied with the economy. That disconnect, which will likely be an issue in the 2024 elections, has puzzled economists and political analysts. A key factor, though, is the public’s exasperation with higher prices. Though inflation has been falling more or less steadily for a year and a half, prices are still 17% higher than they were before the inflation surge began. Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of hard times ahead after the central bank began jacking up interest rates in the spring of 2022 to attack high inflation. Most economists predicted that the much higher borrowing costs that resulted would cause a recession, with layoffs and rising unemployment, in 2023. Yet the recession never arrived, and none appears to be on the horizon. The nation’s labor market, though cooler than in the sizzling-hot years of 2022 and 2023, is still cranking out enough jobs to keep the unemployment rate near historic lows. The resilience of the job market has been matched by the durability of the overall economy. Far from collapsing into a recession, the U.S. gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — grew at a vigorous 4.9% annual pace from July through September. Strong consumer spending and business investment drove much of the expansion. At the same time, average hourly pay has outpaced inflation over the past year, leaving Americans with more money to spend. Indeed, as they did for much of 2023, consumers, a huge engine for U.S. economic growth, hit the stores in November, shopped online, went out to restaurants or traveled. Since March 2022, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times, lifting it to a 22-year high of about 5.4%. Those higher rates have made borrowing costlier for companies and households, but they are on their way toward achieving their goal: Conquering inflation. Consumer prices were up 3.1% in November from a year earlier, down drastically from a four-decade high 9.1% in June 2022. The Fed is so satisfied with the progress so far that it hasn’t raised rates since July and has signaled that it expects to make three rate cuts this year. Beyond a hard hit to the housing market, higher rates haven’t exerted much damage across the broader economy. Many industry sectors, including healthcare and government, have proved relatively resistant to higher interest rates. The next four years will change America forever.

But under the current circumstances, with inflation still above the Fed’s 2% annual target, a more moderate pace of hiring is seen as just what the economy needs. Lower demand for workers tends to ease the pressure on employers to raise pay to keep or attract workers and to pass on their higher labor costs to customers by raising prices.

Kennedy Jr. ahead of Election Day this November. “The West Wing” actor took to social media on Thursday after The Daily Mail and other outlets reported he was among the “celebrities and ‘well-wishers’” attending a “mutli-million dollar” fundraiser for the conspiracy theorist known for his anti-vaccine views. The fundraiser, set to celebrate Kennedy’s 70th birthday, has entry options between $2,500 for a guest and $50,000 for a table of 10. “I do not endorse RFK Jr nor will I be attending his party,” wrote Sheen in an Instagram Stories update. “I whole heartedly support @joebiden and the Democratic ticket for 2024.” Fellow “West Wing” co-stars Bradley Whitford, Joshua Malina and Mary McCormack also hopped on X (formerly Twitter) to go to bat for the actor, who once played President Jed Bartlet on the show. Whitford, who played Bartlet’s White House deputy chief of staff in the series, said he was issuing a statement on Sheen’s behalf: There’s a story going around saying that Martin Sheen is supporting @RobertKennedyJr for president. The story is incorrect. Martin asked us to post this on his behalf. “I wholeheartedly support President Joe Biden and the democratic ticket in 2024.Sincerely,Martin Sheen” The report from The Daily Mail cited information “released” on social media by event organizers, although it’s unclear where the publication got the details. Fox News Digital, in a report published prior to The Daily Mail, cited sources that told the outlet that Sheen would attend and introduce the candidate at the event. Sheen’s posts come after Dionne Warwick slammed reports that she was attending the fundraiser. The Daily Mail report was shared on the Kennedy campaign website and also by a super PAC ― American Values ― that supports the candidate. “I don’t know anything about this event. I did not agree to it and I certainly won’t be there,” Warwick wrote on X. “This is absolutely ridiculous. If you are going to lie on my name, at least lie about something cool. ‘Revealed: Dionne collaborates with Rihanna on new album…’” A representative for Andrea Bocelli ― who was linked to the Kennedy fundraiser, as well, in reports by The Daily Mail and Fox News Digital ― told Rolling Stone magazine that claims he’d perform at the event were “inaccurate.” This is absolutely ridiculous. If you are going to lie on my name, at least lie about something cool.“Revealed: Dionne collaborates with Rihanna on new album…” pic.twitter.com/Fve7W3Ikhl The Kennedy campaign, in a statement to Deadline, noted that the campaign “doesn’t have anything to do with” organizing the upcoming fundraiser. “The campaign has no knowledge of who is attending and can’t confirm or deny anyone’s participation, either as entertainment or as a guest,” the campaign said. A spokesperson for the Kennedy-supporting PAC Fighting 4 One America also told Deadline that it never received confirmation that Sheen would be at the fundraiser.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/postpartum-hemorrhage-retained-tissue-lifesaving_n_65809e54e4b0e142c0bed3d8,I Almost Died Giving Birth — Twice. This Is The Lifesaving Knowledge I Wish I'd Had.,lisa mc carty,1/5/2024,"After I almost bled out during the delivery of my first child due to postpartum hemorrhage, or PPH, I had nightmares about it happening again. One week after giving birth to my second, my fears came true. I developed a pulling pain in my abdomen and called my doctor. Instinctively, I knew it was another retained placenta. The World Health Organization recently released a road map to address PPH, the leading cause of death for women in childbirth globally. According to WHO, around 70,000 women die from PPH every year. During the delivery of my first child, the doctor spent over 45 minutes trying to manually remove my placenta from my uterine wall. It ended up taking too long and I was losing too much blood, so I received an emergency dilation and curettage, or D&C. I returned to my hospital room after the surgery — shaking from adrenaline, pain medication, and the shock of losing so much blood — with my husband and baby by my side. I had survived — barely. When I became pregnant with my second child, my doctors assured me that I didn’t need to worry about the same complications happening again. They said things like “you’re overthinking it” and “we have you covered if we run into any trouble.” Though I trusted my doctors, I also trusted my intuition. With my first delivery, I knew it was not normal for the doctor to be visibly frustrated when removing the placental tissue from my uterus. I always wondered: Why did it take so long for them to decide to do a D&C? This wasn’t just anxiety-based fear. I had done my own research, and I knew that as a woman who had experienced PPH, I had a higher likelihood of having the complication again. My fear manifested itself in panic attacks, along with nightmares about dying from bleeding out on the delivery table. I had many therapy sessions about it, and ruminated over it for days at a time. My therapist attempted to rationalize away my fear, but the intrusive thoughts continued to incessantly creep into my mind. I hoped that my providers were right and my anxiety was wrong. When I finally faced the delivery of my second child, my son came out, but the placenta did not. Once again, the doctor spent a long time removing the tissue, and parts of the placenta were extracted like puzzle pieces, one by one. My husband and I looked at each other as my anxiety increased by the minute. I asked the doctor if she got it all and she replied, “Yes, I think it’s all here?” Uneasy with her response, I requested an ultrasound to confirm. She wheeled forward the dated-looking machine and placed the wand on me, as a grainy black-and-white image appeared. She squinted while examining the screen and said, “It looks OK.” I glanced at my husband and felt unsure. But still heavily medicated and numb — and going against what my body was screaming at me — I let it go. One week after delivering my son, the nightmares I had about experiencing another medical emergency due to PPH began to unfold. I called my doctor’s office with sudden acute abdominal pain. The nurse told me, “It could just be bladder retention,” but I insisted that I go in for another ultrasound. After the imaging was done, my provider came into the exam room, sat down in her chair and looked up at me. “We found retained tissue in your uterus,” she said. My anxiety suddenly rose in my chest until it took over everything and it was all I could feel. It turned out that I had been right to be worried. I was terrified. We discussed the options — either taking a drug like misoprostol to force my body to shed the tissue on its own, or doing a D&C. I chose the latter, as I knew the sooner that all of the retained tissue was removed, the less likely it was that I would end up with an infection. I hoped the procedure would be quick and go smoothly, as I wanted to get home to my newborn. That night, just before they took me back to the operating room, the nurse reviewed the protocol, which is now ingrained in my memory. “It will be a routine surgery,” she told me. “You will go to sleep. We will remove the remaining tissue. You will wake in recovery and then go home later this evening.” I texted my husband that I loved him, and then everything went black. Hours later, I woke up in excruciating pain. I cried out to the nurse who was leaning over me: “It hurts! What happened!?” I was groggy from sleep medication, but I knew I felt worse than I had after delivering a child. “Why is this happening to me?!” I loudly sobbed. The nurse put her hand on my hand and squeezed tightly. “You will be OK,” she said. I found some brief comfort in her comments, and then she pressed the pain medication button and I fell back asleep. The next time I opened my eyes, my doctor was standing at the end of my bed. “What happened?” I asked. “You hemorrhaged again,” she said. “This time you lost over a liter of blood.” I was stunned by what she was telling me. “When I went in to remove your retained placenta to take it out, you hemorrhaged,” she said. She paused and then added: “We put a balloon in your uterus to stop the bleeding. You are lucky to be alive.” I started to cry. My instinct had been right. Regardless of how experienced and well trained a doctor was, no one knew my body better than I did. My husband’s face said it all when he walked into the room. He went pale when he saw the bag of blood next to my bed draining into me. “We almost lost you ... again,” he said quietly. Twenty-four hours later, the doctor removed the device she had placed inside me, after paperwork was signed to indicate that I agreed to undergo a hysterectomy to potentially save my life if necessary. My hands gripped the sides of the bed and I prayed I wouldn’t bleed. When she was done, she gave me a look of relief and said: “I think you are going to be OK. It clotted. I don’t see any more blood.” I stayed in the hospital for two days — more time away from my newborn son — and was eventually able to stand again using a walker. When I finally made it to the bathroom on my own, I cried over the toilet, grateful that my body was healing. The hospital released me, and I cried again when my husband and my children came to pick me up to go home. If I hadn’t listened to my body and hadn’t pushed to have that second ultrasound, I could have lost my life. After experiencing two hemorrhages and facing death, I promised myself that I would tell people my story when I was ready, so that others would know what to do if it happened to them. These are my biggest takeaways related to retained tissue and PPH: Here are questions you should consider addressing with your doctor: The best thing you can do is to be informed and advocate for yourself and your health. You could end up saving your own life — just like I did. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pistorius-parole_n_6597ed70e4b0bf73e1791513,Olympian Oscar Pistorius Freed On Parole After Serving Nearly 9 Years For Girlfriend's Murder,"gerald imray, nqobile ntshangase , mogomotsi magome",1/5/2024,"PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius was released from prison on parole early Friday morning and was believed to be at his uncle’s mansion after authorities secretly moved the world-famous double-amputee athlete who killed his girlfriend at an undisclosed time to avoid the glare of news crews waiting outside the jail. South Africa's Department of Corrections announced in a two-sentence statement at around 8:30 a.m. that Pistorius had been released and was “now at home.” It gave no more details other than to confirm Pistorius' new status as “a parolee.” Pistorius, 37, served nearly nine years of his murder sentence of 13 years and five months for the fatal shooting of model and law graduate Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day 2013. He became eligible for early release from prison having served at least half his sentence and was approved for parole in November. Department of Corrections spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo told The Associated Press that Pistorius was processed according to procedure: taken from the Atteridgeville Correctional Center prison in the South African capital, Pretoria, to a parole office before being released to his family. Nxumalo declined to say what time Pistorius was released and where he was. “I can only tell you he was released this morning,” Nxumalo said. Pistorius was expected to initially live at his uncle’s home in an upscale Pretoria suburb after his release. A police van was outside that house and a police officer was seen coming out later Friday. The officer declined to comment to reporters. Three black private security vehicles were also parked in front of the mansion. The Department of Corrections said ahead of Pistorius’ release that it would not publicize his parole time and he was not going to be “paraded” so as to keep him away from the media that has trailed him since he shot Steenkamp multiple times through a toilet door at his Pretoria villa more than a decade ago. Pistorius will live under strict parole conditions until the remainder of his murder sentence expires in December 2029. Steenkamp’s mother, June Steenkamp, said in a statement that she had accepted Pistorius’ parole as part of South African law. “Has there been justice for Reeva? Has Oscar served enough time? There can never be justice if your loved one is never coming back, and no amount of time served will bring Reeva back,” June Steenkamp said. “We who remain behind are the ones serving a life sentence.” “With the release of Oscar Pistorius on parole, my only desire is that I will be allowed to live my last years in peace with my focus remaining on the Reeva Rebecca Steenkamp Foundation, to continue Reeva’s legacy.” The Department of Corrections has emphasized that the champion Paralympic sprinter's release — like every other offender on parole — does not mean that he has served his time. Some of Pistorius’ parole conditions include restrictions on when he’s allowed to leave his home, a ban on consuming alcohol, and orders that he must attend programs on anger management and on violence against women. He must also perform community service. Pistorius will also have to regularly meet with parole officials and will be subjected to unannounced visits by authorities. He is not allowed to leave the Waterkloof district without permission and is banned from speaking to the media until the end of his sentence. He could be sent back to jail if he is in breach of any of his parole conditions. South Africa does not use tags or bracelets on paroled offenders so Pistorius will not wear any monitoring device, Department of Corrections officials said. But he will be constantly monitored by a department official and will have to inform the official of any major changes in his life, such as if he wants to get a job or move to another house. Pistorius has maintained that he shot 29-year-old Steenkamp by mistake. He testified that he believed Steenkamp was a dangerous intruder hiding in his bathroom and shot four times through the door with his licensed 9 mm pistol in self-defense. Prosecutors said he killed his girlfriend intentionally during a late-night argument. Steenkamp’s family did not oppose his parole application in November, although June Steenkamp said in a victim statement submitted to the parole board then that she didn’t believe Pistorius had been fully rehabilitated and was still lying about the killing. Before the killing, Pistorius was seen as an inspiring role model after having had both of his legs amputated below the knee as a baby because of a congenital condition. He became a champion sprinter on his carbon-fiber running blades and made history by competing at the 2012 London Olympics. His murder trial destroyed his image. He was accused of being prone to angry outbursts and acting recklessly with guns, while witnesses testified about various altercations he had with others, including an argument in which he allegedly threatened to break a man’s legs. Pistorius was first convicted of culpable homicide — a charge comparable to manslaughter — and sentenced to five years in prison for killing Steenkamp. After appeals by prosecutors, he was ultimately found guilty of murder and had his sentence increased, although that judgment by the Supreme Court of Appeal still didn’t definitively rule that he knew it was Steenkamp behind the bathroom door. Pistorius was first sent to prison in 2014, released on house arrest in 2015 during an appeal, and then sent back to prison in 2016. He was initially incarcerated at the maximum security Kgosi Mampuru II Prison in Pretoria but was moved to Atteridgeville early in his sentence because it's better suited to holding disabled prisoners. Reaction to Pistorius’ parole has been muted in South Africa, a stark contrast to the first days and months after Steenkamp’s killing, which sparked angry protests outside of Pistorius’ court hearings calling for him to receive a long prison sentence. There is no death penalty in South Africa. “He has ticked all the necessary boxes,” said Themba Masango, secretary general of Not In My Name International, a group that campaigns against violence against women. “And we can only wish and hope Oscar Pistorius will come out a better human being.” “We tend to forget that there is a possibility where somebody can be rehabilitated.” ___ Imray reported from Cape Town, South Africa. ___ More AP coverage of Oscar Pistorius: https://apnews.com/hub/oscar-pistorius By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) slammed his own party on Thursday, bemoaning its lack of accomplishments in 2023. “In my opinion, we have nothing to go out there and campaign on, Chris. It’s embarrassing,” Biggs told Newsmax host Chris Salcedo. “The Republican party and the Congress of the Majority has zero accomplishments,” Salcedo agreed. Biggs made the remark after he was asked about the House Republican majority’s “complete failures” to pass 12 annual spending bills on time. “How many of those 12 bills have been completed?” Salcedo asked. “None. None have been completed,” Biggs replied. “There’ve been a few of them. Seven I think have been sent to the Senate from the House. The Senate has not taken up a single one of those bills.” The exchange came at the end of a segment in which the two men railed against the Biden administration, congressional Democrats and their spending agenda and policies on border security and immigration. Biggs was one of eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy from his House speakership in October, throwing the deeply divided caucus into disarray for weeks as they scrambled to unite around a new leader.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biggest-grandparenting-mistakes_l_6596d35be4b0912833af31ef,The 5 Biggest Mistakes That Grandparents Make,marie holmes,1/5/2024,"We tend to think of grandparenting as easy and filled with joy compared to the long slog of parenting your own children. And it’s true that being a grandparent may allow you to participate in fun and festive occasions without having to sacrifice your financial security or uninterrupted sleep. But there are a number of ways that being a grandparent can cause stress as well as amplify any tension with your adult children. If you’re hoping to nourish strong relationships and minimize conflict with your grandchildren and their parents, here are a few missteps experts suggest you avoid, as well as what you can do to repair the damage when you do something you regret. It’s considered typical grandparent behavior to shower grandchildren with gifts, but gift giving can become a source of tension if you and the child’s parents don’t agree on what constitutes an appropriate gift. “Sometimes grandparents can get into trouble because they buy things for their grandchildren that their parents may not approve of, are too expensive or too excessive in nature,” Christopher Hansen, a licensed counselor in San Antonio, told HuffPost. A good way to avoid this is to clear any purchases, or a plan for purchases, with parents beforehand. For example, “Grandma is taking you to the zoo. You can look in the gift shop at the end of the visit and pick out one small stuffy for her to buy you.” This clarifies expectations for everyone and lets the parent know that you respect their authority, which helps cultivate trust. Complications from gift giving frequently arise when it comes to financial gifts. With the cost of child care taking an average of 27% of families’ earnings, it’s common for grandparents to either step in as child care providers or contribute to costs such as day care and tuition. But financial gifts can result in hard feelings if the money is used in a way you didn’t intend. “Clarify whether there are any expectations that accompany the gift,” Robin Kay Stilwell, a licensed marriage and family therapist, told HuffPost. “Is it a gift for the adult or child to use as they see fit, or do you have expectations regarding how you want it to be spent?” added Stilwell, who has practices in Washington, D.C., and Florida, and is a grandmother herself. Again, the best way to prevent issues from cropping up is through clear communication beforehand. You might agree, for example, to pay 50% of a child’s preschool tuition for two years with the understanding that you won’t be able to continue with similar amounts once the child enters kindergarten. Dropping by unannounced, Stilwell said, is a definite no. Doing so “sends a message that your convenience takes priority regardless of the disruption to the flow of the family unit. It is particularly difficult during dinner time, homework time or bedtime.” You also want to show understanding for how tightly packed parents’ schedules are. “Many times, grandparents forget that their children have lives with work and other commitments and don’t always have time nor want to have the time to have grandparents over because they simply are tired and are living their own lives,” Hansen said. This can sometimes mean that you don’t visit as often or for as long as you would like — but remember that the quality of the time you spend with your grandkids is more important than the quantity. Do your part by showing up and honoring any commitments you make to them. Parents’ “primary loyalty needs to shift to their family of creation,” Stilwell explained. “It can be a challenge to see them as adults with their own lives, making decisions that are disappointing to you but work for them. Avoid framing this as disloyal.” Of course, you want parents to respect your schedule as well — particularly if you’re one of their child care providers. If you’ll be providing child care regularly, it can help to set a schedule. Likewise, you’ll want to let parents know about any ongoing commitments as well as your ability (and willingness) to “drop everything” to care for grandchildren if the parents are in a pinch. “If a grandparent acts as a caregiver without clear parameters or expectations, resentment can develop,” Stilwell said. It can be a challenge to keep quiet if you see parents making what seem to be clear mistakes, but make sure that if you do raise concerns you maintain respect for their authority. “The grandparents often have a different approach to parenting that may be contrary to how the kids are raising the grandkids. It may also be different from how they parented the now-grown children. Both the parents and grandparents can be judgmental and critical of the others’ style. This can create a wedge in the relationship with the grandkids,” Stilwell said. You may feel disrespected if parents seem to dismiss your many years of experience, but at the end of the day, they have to make decisions that feel best for their family. “Sometimes grandparents take for granted that their children’s belief system and the way they want to raise their children matches what they did, and many times that’s simply not the case. Communicating and finding out how they feel about certain subjects and other things regarding their child goes a long way toward ensuring grandparents don’t overstep,” Hansen said. When it comes to things like household rules and discipline, it’s helpful to have these discussions beforehand. Clear expectations can prevent conflict later on. Extra caution is warranted with in-law relationships, particularly in cases of divorce. “A good rule of thumb is to avoid criticizing your child’s spouse or partner, directly or indirectly, even if they are the ones to vent or initiate negative comments,” Stilwell said. “Circumventing the authority and wishes of the parents,” Hansen said, is “another area where grandparents get into trouble.” Whether the issue is gift giving or household rules, “if the adult children feel that their parenting ‘rules’ or schedules are ignored or undermined, it can bleed into other aspects of the relationship, including their trust,” Stilwell said. If you want to be part of your grandchildren’s lives, it will need to be on terms that both you and their parents agree to. “Talking with one another is always the best way to gain an understanding of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable,” Hansen said. The stronger your relationship and communication with your adult child, the less likely you are to run into conflicts over care of your grandchildren. “Communicating and finding out how they feel about certain subjects and other things regarding their child goes a long way toward ensuring grandparents don’t overstep,” Hansen said. Of course, caring for kids can be complicated, often requiring you to make many decisions in rapid succession. It’s inevitable that at some point you will do something counter to parents’ wishes. How you handle this will set the tone for your relationship moving forward. “A sincere apology,” Hansen said, is an excellent place to start. “Making amends to your grandchildren or children is not a sign of weakness and demonstrates for both that even grandparents make mistakes and are human.” As with any repair work, you’ll want to acknowledge the other person’s feelings, take responsibility for your actions and offer a pledge — and perhaps a plan — for not repeating the mistake in the future. You might say, for example, “Next time I will set a timer to remind all of us when it’s time to turn off the iPad.” Though you may not feel that your actions were a mistake, “You can acknowledge that your intentions were positive and that you will work on respecting who they are and what they need from you,” Stilwell explained.

Despite the Justice Department pressing charges against more than 1,000 people linked to the insurrection, former President Donald Trump and other Republicans seem to espouse more and more false conspiracy theories about the riot and stoke the same election fraud lies that laid the foundation for the ransacking of the Capitol. In its immediate aftermath, prominent Republicans criticized Trump and held him responsible. Now, that’s almost hard to believe; many have since recanted and endorsed his 2024 presidential bid. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released this week found that the number of Republicans who believe Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election has dropped from 39% in 2021 to 31%, while 34% of Republicans believe the FBI was somehow in on the insurrection. No one has been more involved in defending Jan. 6 participants than Trump himself. He has suggested pardoning rioters if he becomes president again. He has also aided those facing criminal prosecution by appearing at fundraisers for a nonprofit group that financially supported them, and he has vowed to stop Jan. 6-related investigations if he returns to the presidency. A major focus of Trump’s reelection campaign is to rewrite the history of that day, calling it “beautiful” and claiming that rioters had “love in their heart.” At a November rally, Trump called people imprisoned over the attack “hostages,” and even honored them by playing a rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” that was recorded by Jan. 6 defendants. Five people died during or immediately after the Capitol attack, and four police officers who’d been in the fray later died by suicide. More than 140 officers were injured. Nevertheless, Trump isn’t alone in seeking to excuse, downplay or use conspiracies to explain away the day’s horrific events. At a December GOP presidential debate, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy echoed the far-right conspiracy theory that FBI agents were behind Jan. 6. “Why am I the only person on this stage at least who can say that Jan. 6 now does look like it was an inside job?” he asked. Meanwhile, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley — now seen as Trump’s foremost-but-still-distant rival for the presidential nomination, apparently overtaking Florida. Gov. Ron DeSantis (who called the attack a “protest” but not an attempt to overthrow the government) — has broken with Trump over how history will judge Jan. 6. “It was not a beautiful day; it was a terrible day,” Haley said on the campaign trail in Iowa last year. “And we don’t ever want that to happen again.” Yet Haley still told a 9-year-old recently that she would pardon Trump if he’s convicted of criminal charges, which include three conspiracy counts involving his effort to overturn the 2020 election, because it wouldn’t be in the country’s best interest to have “an 80-year-old man sitting in jail.” Among GOP candidates vying for the Senate, prominent election denier Kari Lake has been the outspoken supporter of Jan. 6 rioters, characterizing those prosecuted for their actions that day as “political prisoners.” Lake’s campaign in Arizona hasn’t officially been endorsed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, but several top Republican senators are backing her, including a member of Senate GOP leadership, which could help her land in the upper chamber of Congress next year. In the House, Trump has now been endorsed by around 100 hundred GOP lawmakers, including every member of party leadership, despite his role in seeking to subvert the 2020 election results. Many House Republicans also continue to fan conspiracies about the insurrection. At several times last year, they questioned Justice Department officials about how many FBI agents or informants might have been in the crowd at the Capitol. At one hearing, Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) introduced an entirely new conspiracy theory that “ghost buses” offloaded dozens of FBI informants in Washington before the attack. (FBI Director Christopher Wray has repeatedly rejected the suggestion that the agency somehow orchestrated the riot.) The most prominent piece of evidence that supposedly supported the “fedsurrection” conspiracy theory — the fact that Jan. 6 rioter Ray Epps, who conspiracists falsely claimed was a federal agent, had not been prosecuted — went up in smoke last year when the Justice Department hit Epps with charges, strongly suggesting that he wasn’t the federal asset he’d been made out to be. But lawmakers like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Troy Nehls (R-Texas) told HuffPost that their suspicions about Epps had only strengthened. Greene recently gushed about meeting Jacob Chansley, the horned Capitol rioter better known as the QAnon Shaman. A photo she shared online shows the far-right duo — the type of pairing that could even end up gracing the stage at a future Trump GOP nominating convention later this year. But the most jarring Republican statement in support of the fedsurrection theory didn’t come from a backbencher, but from new House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), in his November announcement that Republicans would make public thousands of hours of surveillance video from the Capitol attack. In the announcement, he said that the footage would be released so people could “see for themselves what happened that day, rather than having to rely upon the interpretation of a small group of government officials,” insinuating that the conventional understanding of events — that a mob of Trump supporters ransacked the building — resulted from disinformation. But Johnson gave the game away when he later said that Republicans would censor rioters’ faces to avoid potential prosecution, as amateur internet detectives have previously helped identify participants and sent tips to the FBI. “We have to blur some of the faces of persons who participated in the events of that day because we don’t want them to be retaliated against and to be charged,” Johnson said. The GOP’s efforts to whitewash the harrowing Jan. 6 attack is confounding to many of those who protected Congress on that day, including former D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, a Republican who was assaulted by Trump supporters on the steps of the Capitol. “Imagine the most traumatic, or a traumatic event in your life, that reaches the level of attention that January 6 garnered,” Fanone told HuffPost this week. “I mean, it was an international story. And spending three years trying to convince people that it actually fucking happened,” he said. The next four years will change America forever.

According to mental health experts, its worth can hardly be overstated. “Journaling is amazing. It can help lower depression and anxiety by helping reframe our thoughts,” therapist David Ibrahim, who runs Los Angeles-based trauma therapy clinic Glendale Counseling Services, told HuffPost by email. “Researching shows that [journaling] 15 minutes a day can improve mental health. “[I find that] many people come to therapy and have no clue what are they feeling or needing,” he added. “If we don’t know what we’re feeling or needing, how do we function in relationships? Or even understand the emotions and needs of others? So journaling is a way into intimacy with the self, allows us to hear our own voice [and] develop a relationship with ourselves.” Journaling can also increase your communication skills and help with distress tolerance, so you can better cope with difficulties that arise in your life, said Yara Mawad, a Los Angeles-based therapist, by email. Plus, folks may enjoy the process of recording their daily lives so they can reflect at a later time. “If you are a person who appreciates documentation and find it helpful to look back at certain points in your life to remind yourself where you were and how you were feeling in those moments, journaling can give you the experience of being able to visually see how far you have come from then to now,” Mawad wrote. The main takeaway? “Being intentional and reflective at least once in your day is a small change that can make a big difference in various areas of your life,” said Mawad. “Be open to trying new things and different kinds of journaling!” Below, we’ve rounded up some great journals based on recommendations by Mawad and Ibrahim, including options with guided prompts, journals for freeform writing or ones designed for the kid in your life.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. For better or worse, my parents had my ears pierced when I was an infant, a common practice in Latine culture. As a result, I grew up giving little thought to earrings as an accessory, opting for small studs that I could wear for months at a time without changing. It wasn’t until a few years ago that I decided, in what some might call an early mid-life crisis, to add a few more piercings and really kick my earring game into high gear. Faced with the ability to create fun “earscapes” for the first time ever, I quickly came to the realization that not all earrings are created equally, and that some are decidedly more comfortable than others. So when I came upon the “nap earring” design at Maison Miru, I knew I had to try them out. These earrings are designed with push pin-style flat backs that won’t poke or scratch your skull, even when sleeping on your side. They aren’t exactly cheap, but I regret to inform you that they’re comfier than I could have possibly imagined, and worth every penny. I opted for the Everyday Nap Earrings Trio, which includes three pairs of Maison Miru’s bestselling earrings: the Celestine Crystal nap earrings, Little Bar nap earrings and Mini Crystal Trinity nap earrings. And while you can buy these each individually starting at $75 per pair, I like being able to swap them out when the mood strikes and to have multiple options available. They’re available in silver-hued solid titanium and extra-strong PVD gold plating. As someone with sensitive skin, I was worried that the earrings would secretly be made with cheap materials that irritate my delicate lobes, but I’m pleased to report that Maison Miru uses medical-grade titanium that is safe for even the most tender skin. Getting them in takes a bit of practice, so I used this TikTok video for reference the first time, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a breeze. Many professional piercers prefer flat-back earrings to traditional backings, and I now see why. I’m pleased to report that once I swapped out regular earrings for Maison Miru’s nap earrings, my fresher piercings got significantly less sore and crusty. They’re a great option for piercings that are taking a long time to heal or are otherwise giving you a bit of trouble. I would imagine that they’re also a great option for younger children who have just recently gotten their ears pierced for the first time. But true to their name, the nap earrings’ biggest selling point is that they really do feel invisible when you sleep on your side or stomach. I like to smash into my pillow or arm and was often woken up by the triad of backings poking into my skin, but no more. You don’t even realize they are there. And as if that weren’t enough, they’re cute as can be! Maison Miru has a fairly generous selection of nap earrings to choose from, so you can pick the ones that best fit your own aesthetic. I have my eyes on the Good Luck nap earrings trio next! Take a look at a few raves from happy customers, then pick up a few for yourself. The design is a total game-changer when it comes to earring comfort, and you can feel good knowing you don’t have to sacrifice style for substance. Promising reviews: “I love them !! Took a min to get in as they are so tiny. But once in they look incredible 🤩” — Allie C. “I never knew I was missing out on...I have extremely sensitive ears (allergic to multiple metals). I also constantly keep my earrings in. The only ones that don’t give my trouble are the diamond earrings I got when I got married. All the others corrode and mess up my ears- to the point I started just wearing the little plastic backings they sell earrings with so they don’t slip off the card they’re on. The idea of being able to keep them in constantly was so appealing to me. My husband (who also has metal allergies) told me to just get them finally, after staring at them forever. After a few weeks, I’m in love and already eyeing more (and more piercings!). You literally forget they are in. Just make sure you put them in somewhere there are no drains- it can take a minute to get used to and I’d be devastated if I lost one down the sink 😩 (PS- Thank you for finally bringing dainty jewelry back into the mix as well- having multiple piercings, the small ones just look better and don’t overwhelm!)” — Hope W. “Beautiful earrings! I bought the everyday nap earrings trio, and love them. They are beautiful. I like the look and the quality is great!” — Mel E. “So comfortable!! I’m allergic to normal jewelry and need titanium. This set helps me mix and match to fit my style!” — Erica W. “Perfection. I work in a very corporate atmosphere AND have three piercings in my left ear and six in my right ear. This nap trio is great in my lobe piercings as well as my helix piercings. They look classy enough for work, and cute enough for brunch or cocktails with friends. And they are sooooooo comfortable - I never take them out! Fit my ears perfectly!” — Suzy M. “Comfortable and so cute.

Doctors Explain Their Endorsement,jamie davis smith,1/5/2024,"If you have trouble going number two, chances are someone will suggest downing a few cups of prune juice or eating a handful of prunes to get things going. It may sound like an old wives tale, but using prunes to relieve constipation is actually endorsed by doctors. “Prunes have been an at-home remedy for constipation for generations, and for good reason. They work,” said Dr. Nathan Wood, an instructor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Prunes are so effective at treating constipation because they have three different components that help you poop: Two types of fiber, plus fermentable sugars that each help relieve constipation differently, Wood explained. First, prunes contain soluble fibers. These “absorb water, forming a gel-like substance that softens stools, making them easier to pass,” said Dr. Alexander Jow, a gastroenterologist at Kaiser Permanente Falls Church Medical Center in Falls Church, Virginia. Second, prunes contain insoluble fiber, which “is plant material that moves through our digestive tract pretty much intact,” Wood explained. Since it “doesn’t get absorbed or completely broken down by our stomach and intestines,” it creates bulk that “helps to push things through your intestines faster,” he said. Third, prunes contain sorbitol, which is a natural fermentable sugar. “These sugars have a mild laxative effect on your digestive system by drawing water into the intestines to soften stools and stimulate bowel movements,” Jow said. Although it’s possible to get fiber and sorbitol from other foods, prunes are a uniquely good choice because “one prune contains approximately 0.7 grams of fiber, a concentrated amount for such a small fruit,” Jow said. Both prune juice and whole prunes are effective in treating constipation, Jow said. However, there are some differences to consider. Whole prunes have more fiber because the juicing process removes some. An 8-ounce serving of one cup of prune juice contains about 2.5 grams of fiber, while a serving of 10 prunes contains about 6 grams of fiber. Moreover, “whole prunes have double the amount of sorbitol in the same serving size compared to prune juice,” Jow said. Another advantage of whole prunes over prune juice is that prune juice has more sugar and calories than dried prunes. While this may not make a difference if you only consume prune juice once in a while, it can add up over time, Jow cautioned. According to Jow, the “bottom line” is that both prune juice and dried prunes will help you go. If you prefer the taste of prune juice, you will still get the laxative benefits prunes provide, but whole prunes are a healthier choice, and you won’t need as many servings to get the same amount of fiber and sorbitol. It will vary from person to person, ranging from “a few hours to a day,” Jow said. To help things along, Jow advised, “It is important to drink plenty of water while taking prunes to stay hydrated and help enhance the effectiveness of the prunes and the function of the digestive system.” The number of prunes you need to relieve constipation “varies depending on age and severity,” Jow said. To start, he suggests giving children one to two prunes or 2-4 ounces of prune juice a day. For adults, Jow recommends starting with three to five prunes or half a cup of prune juice daily or twice daily. When backed up, drinking an entire container of prune juice or down handfuls of dried prunes may be tempting. That might be especially true if the recommended amounts aren’t working for you. However, Jow urges caution. “It is possible to eat too many prunes,” leading to unwanted side effects, he said. “Excess fiber can cause gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, gas and even diarrhea. Sorbitol is a natural laxative, so consuming too large of a quantity can also cause increased bowel movements and diarrhea,” Jow explained.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/public-wifi-shopping-online_l_65944b54e4b0bf73e1777d80,The 1 Thing You Should Do Before You Shop On Public Wi-Fi,monica torres,1/5/2024,"When we’re away from home, joining a public Wi-Fi network can be a convenient way to be online when we don’t have good service or want to cut down on data usage. But should you buy stuff while using these public networks? In many cases, you should be fine. As the Federal Trade Commission explains, “Today, most websites do use encryption to protect your information. Because of the widespread use of encryption, connecting through a public Wi-Fi network is usually safe.” But sometimes these free Wi-Fi hotspots do get compromised by malware infection, fraudulent networks that have legitimate-sounding Wi-Fi names and man-in-the-middle cyberattacks. “Public Wi-Fi networks often lack robust security measures, which makes them attractive targets for hackers who can intercept sensitive data, such as credit card information,” said Michael Jabbara, the vice president and global head of fraud services for Visa. Amy Nofziger, the director of fraud victim support with AARP, said she’s experienced this kind of cyberattack firsthand. When she was on vacation in Las Vegas, she needed to pay a bag fee for her upcoming flight, and she entered her credit card information on the free Wi-Fi at the hotel. “Within 20 minutes, I started to get emails and calls from my credit card company alerting to charges being made on my card in others states. That’s how quickly it can happen,” she said. Luckily, there’s a simple way you can double-check that your online behavior is encrypted ― and you should do it any time you use public Wi-Fi. Here’s what to know: Before you buy anything online, the most important step you can take to ensure that the website you are using is secure is to check that the URL begins with https://. The “s” stands for secure, and there is typically a padlock icon in the address bar. Under this encryption, people who are logged in with you on the public Wi-Fi cannot see the contents of your communication, explained Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “They can see that you are going to this website, but they don’t know what page you’re going to and they can’t see what you’re typing in,” Galperin said. The HTTPS (hypertext transfer protocol secure) ensures that the data going from your device to the website you’re visiting is encrypted. As long as your website URL begins with “https,” Galperin said, you should be fine to make online purchases. If you want to make sure that you’re strictly only using these websites, Galperin recommended making it the default in your browser. On Safari, using an HTTPS URL is already the default. On Chrome, you can do this by going to Settings, selecting Privacy and Security, then Security, then toggling on the option for “Always use secure connections.” On Firefox, you can do this by going to Settings, then Privacy and Security and selecting Security. Then scroll to the “Always use secure connections” option. In addition to checking for the HTTPS, you can always go one step further and use your mobile data over public Wi-Fi if you need to make a purchase, which is what Jabbara and Nofziger both advise over using public Wi-Fi for purchases. “Using your cell service is typically safer than using public Wi-Fi for transactions, as it’s more difficult for hackers to intercept data over cellular networks,” Jabbara said. “The best course of action is to wait to use a secure network, but using mobile data is a great second option.” If you want to enhance your security, one of the most effective measures is to use a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN “encrypts your data and makes it much more difficult for anyone to intercept and read your information,” Jabbara said. And be mindful of what seems too good to be true. If a network lets you log on without entering a password or the network has a generic-sounding name like “Free Public Wi-Fi,” Nofziger said those are warning signs that the hotspot could be compromised. Ultimately, you don’t have to stop yourself from ever using public Wi-Fi ― just make sure that what you are visiting is encrypted and secure. “While it’s not necessary to completely avoid buying anything while on public Wi-Fi, it’s important to be aware of the risks and take appropriate precautions, like checking to see if the URL is safe or using a VPN,” Jabbara said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-worst-underwear-for-genital-health_l_65942b5be4b0f27b6e355e6f,The Best And Worst Types Of Underwear To Keep You Healthy Down There,talia ergas,1/5/2024,"Underwear is often the most overlooked article of clothing, and many of us may never give a second thought to exactly what we wear down there. However, experts agree that the underwear you choose can have positive or negative effects on the wellness of your genital area. For instance, underwear that makes you sweat more can lead to itching and yeast infections. Certain cuts of underwear, such as thongs, can increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis or other infections. Underwear that’s too tight can cause constriction, chafing and bacterial infections, and there is some evidence that it can affect fertility in men. When selecting a pair of underwear, it’s important to consider the fabric, fit and cut. And you’ll want to think about when and how often you change or go without underwear. We spoke with four experts — two OB-GYNs and two urologists — who gave us their best advice for choosing and wearing underwear. When selecting a pair of underwear, the fabric is a major consideration. “Generally speaking, the best fabrics for underwear are natural fabrics like cotton,” said Dr. Andrea Braden, a board-certified OB-GYN in Atlanta. “It really has to do with the breathability of that fabric. We do know that air circulates better with cotton underwear versus polyester. It is important for vulvar health to have good air circulation.” Other good natural options include hemp, bamboo and linen, said Dr. Suzy Lipinski, a board-certified OB-GYN at Pediatrix Medical Group in Denver. Urologists agree. Dr. Scott D. Miller, the medical director at Wellstar Urology in Atlanta, said that cotton stands out because “it is comfortable, cool, breathable, moisture-wicking and absorbent.” However, “these characteristics are dependent on the quality of the cotton fiber and various types of weaves,” he noted. And there are instances where other fabrics might do better. “During times of increased perspiration, cotton can retain too much moisture, leading to bacterial and fungal overgrowth,” Miller added. “In these cases, a better choice may be a fabric made of a combination of cotton and a synthetic fiber.” Lipinski advised against “non-breathable fabrics,” including synthetics such as nylon and satin. Additionally, “woven, rather than knit, fabrics or thick fabric can also limit how much [the fabric] breathes,” she said. Miller said pure polyester “is probably the worst fabric for underwear” and explained why. “Although it is among the lightest materials, it is neither absorbent nor very breathable,” he said. “However, its durability makes it a good addition as a small proportion of [fabric blends].” If you’re unsure of a particular fabric blend, Braden suggested that feeling the fabric can help you decide. “It should be soft and not slippery.” Even underwear that isn’t made of a natural, breathable fabric will often “have a cotton panel in the crotch area or gusset,” she added. And that’s a good thing: “That is because cotton is the most ideal fabric to be sitting in your ‘nether regions.’” The doctors generally agreed that when it comes to picking a cut of underwear, there’s no real right or wrong. Rather, it’s about what feels comfortable to you and what allows your body to breathe. “The key is a comfortable fit that is not constricting or chafing,” Lipinski said. “This means different underwear for different body types. … Ask yourself, does the underwear feel comfortable and move with you or tighten up and constrict? Does the underwear ride up or cause chafing? Even two pairs of underwear in the same cut but [from] different brands can fit differently.” Dr. Fenwa Milhouse, a board-certified urologist with Down There Urology in Chicago, said that “loose-fitting underwear has long been recommended,” adding that “tight-fitting underwear reduces air circulation and may increase local moisture down there, which can cause skin irritation and cutaneous or skin yeast infections.” Therefore, she encourages her patients to pick cuts that are “most comfortable for them.” However, there may be reason to believe that certain underwear styles are better for fertility than others. Milhouse noted that a 2018 Harvard study evaluating semen parameters from almost 700 men found that participants who primarily wore boxers had a 25% higher sperm concentration than those who did not. Still, “briefs have the advantage of better support and protection,” Miller said. “Boxers have the advantage of freedom of movement, although the extra material may cause bunching. Boxer-briefs combine the features of both, although most of these designs are form-fitting in the style of briefs.” Breathability doesn’t necessarily mean less fabric, with Lipinski noting how thong underwear tends to be tighter and more constrictive. “This doesn’t mean that you can’t ever wear it, just maybe minimize use or save for those special occasions,” she said. Also, consider your medical history. “If you are prone to infections, then you may want to avoid wearing a type of underwear that is a thong or sits very closely to the rear end,” Braden said, adding that it can increase risk for bacterial vaginosis. “The reason behind that is that you can have bacteria tracked from the rectal area forward when the fabric is lying that close to the rectum. So if you’re going through an infection or prone to infection, it is probably best to wear something like a bikini or brief, or even boy shorts.” The agreed-upon rule among the doctors interviewed is to change your underwear at least once per day to make sure things remain clean and dry and to decrease the bacteria load. “Bacteria is normal. We all have normal bacteria that lives on the vulva or in the rectal area,” Braden said. “What you don’t want is growth of bacteria coming from your clothing or your underwear.” Braden explained how wearing underwear for long periods of time can cause infections or odors because moisture mixes with the normal bacteria that’s down there. So it’s important to change your underwear as frequently as you can. Some people may even want to consider changing their underwear more than once a day. “If you are active and sweat a lot or struggle with incontinence, then you may want to change even more frequently,” Lipinski said. Although some doctors found no issue with sleeping in underwear when done properly, others felt it may be beneficial to go without. “In general, I recommend sleeping without underwear,” Milhouse said, adding that it allows your private parts to get air ventilation, decreases moisture and reduces irritation to the skin. “Even for my incontinent patients, at night I encourage them to sleep without underwear and pads and instead sleep commando on an absorbent towel or sheet,” she said. Ultimately, the decision is more about personal preference. However, it’s important to pay attention to how your body reacts. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Hanne Hoffmann, an assistant professor of animal science at Michigan State University with a background in neurobiology, recently explained to HuffPost that our moods and physiology are quite impacted by the light we receive, and that natural sunlight exposure is often associated with “an increased sense of well-being, more energy and and an overall good mood.” Clinically called light therapy, these UV-free lamps work by mimicking outside light, specifically bright white light (which is measured in luxes), to help manage symptoms of SAD. Hoffmann recommends sitting near a SAD lamp first thing in the morning for between 20 to no more than 90 minutes for five to seven days per week. I got one for my father about two years ago (you can learn more about his exact model in the list below) and he personally attests to experiencing less anxiety, sadness and more motivation since he started using it. He lives in Oregon, where sunshine is an incredibly rare sight in fall and winter. If you buy one, pay attention to its features. “A high-quality light box will provide light at 10,000 lux when the light box is placed 12 inches or more from the eyes or face and will have a UV filter to avoid the risk of retinal damage,” Hoffmann previously said, adding that if a therapy lamp doesn’t provide 10,000 lux, longer exposure might be necessary to feel the effects. You can learn more about about SAD lamps and Hoffmann’s light therapy guidance from our previous reporting, or, if you’re ready to feel the sunshine already (well, kind of), keep reading to see some options we chose.

Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. If you don't want to sacrifice form for function, then this stylish 10,000 lux shaded lamp is a great option. The rounded shape provides a nice alternative to flat-front lamps, giving off 360 degrees of light. It includes three different color temperatures, can be used with a remote control or via touch and has a USB port for charging. This Verilux Happy Light is the exact model that I gifted my father and so far, he's been incredibly pleased with its mood-boosting power. It fits perfectly on the corner of his desk and can be displayed either horizontally or vertically to best accommodate an existing space. The Happy Light delivers one straightforward setting of 10,000-lux full-spectrum light that's both UV- and flicker-free. The highest-lux light option on our list, this frame-style therapy lamp diffuses up to 15,000 lux of UV-free light, which can be adjusted to four brightness levels and three color temperatures including warm yellow and cool white. Using the touch control buttons, users can choose from four different pre-set timers starting from 15 minutes to an hour. For anyone concerned with form as much as function, this round moon-esque lamp looks great on a bedside table or desktop. It promises up to 10,000 lux of light, five brightness levels and four brightness settings, all of which can be saved using the helpful memory function. This compact and travel-ready light panel by Circadian Optics stands like a frame to deliver up to 10,000 lux of full-spectrum light and converts completely flat with the stand doubling as a cover. Users can also choose from the three different brightness settings, each one free from harmful UV. This standing lamp can extend to be a full-length floor lamp or retract to fit on desks or bedside tables, and can use either a remote control or the built-in touch-control buttons. The neck of the light is also adjustable 360 degrees and offers 10 adjustable brightness levels up to the desired 11,000 lux. There are also five color temperatures that allow this lamp to function as a soft light source when not used for therapy purposes. Featuring a curved 16-inch tilting screen on top of a height-adjustable stand, this full-spectrum 10,000-lux lamp projects light downward up to 12 inches, mimicking natural overhead daylight. It blocks 99.3% of UV light and also has a task light setting so it can be used as a standard lamp, not just for light therapy.

Ron DeSantis ripped Fox News for “never criticizing” Donald Trump just one day after an Iowa voter confronted him for his approach toward the former president. The GOP presidential candidate, in an Iowa campaign stop on Thursday, pointed to the former president’s criticism of a six-week abortion ban in Florida and noted that Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds had signed the ban into law in the Hawkeye State. He went on to question if Trump has flip-flopped on abortion, given previous remarks and claimed he “disqualified himself” for voters who believe in “the sanctity of life” before adding that people have to hold Trump accountable. “This idea that like all these conservative radio guys and Fox News people like, they will like never criticize because they’re so concerned that someone may yell at them,” DeSantis said. “Look, anyone running for office answers to you. You have every right to hold these people accountable, and you should hold him accountable when he’s taking those positions that are not consistent with the values here in northwest Iowa.” “This idea that all these conservative radio guys and Fox News people, they will never criticize because they’re so concerned that someone might yell at them.”Ron DeSantis calls out “conservative” media for their refusal to criticize Trump. pic.twitter.com/2G8BO5hTfw DeSantis, in an interview with former NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch on Thursday, also knocked the conservative network for its counterprogramming with Trump set to air during next week’s GOP primary debate hosted by CNN. “They’re basically giving him a lifeline and making it easier for him to duck the debate,” said DeSantis, who once criticized Trump for being “missing in action” on the debate stage last year. “I think all of us should be held accountable, Dana. I don’t think it’s healthy for the conservative movement to have one candidate that is not subjected to scrutiny,” he added. “But that’s kind of what it’s been, and I think, quite frankly, Fox News has bailed him out for allowing him not to debate.” ""Fox News has bailed him out"" -- Ron DeSantis rightly points out that Fox News is ""making it easier"" for Trump to ""duck"" debates with Republican candidates by counterprogramming them with Trump town halls pic.twitter.com/nRxsTvqlbF The comments arrive a day after a man in Iowa confronted DeSantis on why he hasn’t “gone directly” after Trump on the campaign trail.

I have faith in them,” Habba told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. The remarks from Habba, who brought up Trump’s concerns with the court in an interview just a day before, arrive after the former president asked SCOTUS to overturn a Colorado Supreme Court ruling that kicked him off the state’s primary ballot last month. The Colorado court ruled that Trump was ineligible to run for the presidency again, citing the 14th Amendment’s insurrection clause over his actions that led up to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Earlier this week, Trump also appealed a similar ruling from Maine’s secretary of state that removed him from the state’s 2024 GOP primary ballot. Habba, in her interview with Hannity, pointed to her faith in Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whom Trump nominated, while discussing the decisions. “You know people like Kavanaugh ― who the president fought for, who the president went through hell to get into place ― he’ll step up,” she said. “Those people will step up. Not because they’re pro-Trump but because they’re pro-law. Because they’re pro-fairness, and the law on this is very clear.” Elsewhere in the interview, Habba criticized Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, targeted in a swatting call at her home last week, for not being a lawyer and said she found “some obscure section of some statute” and applied it to the former president. Habba: I think it should be a slam dunk in the supreme court. I have faith in them. You know, people like Kavanaugh, who the president fought for, who the president went through hell to get into place. He'll step up. pic.twitter.com/gQo1h55t6N A number of critics on X (formerly Twitter) criticized Habba, including MSNBC host Katie Phang, who accused the attorney of saying “the quid pro quo part out loud.” Alina Habba saying the quid pro quo part out loud here ⤵️ https://t.co/957fZxO6jh Repeating from today's Countdown podcast:Trump's surrogates are quietly THREATENING THE JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT@AlinaHabba did this Wednesday as well https://t.co/MPbh2R1i2m Translation: “Trump believes Kavanaugh owes him.” https://t.co/SerK7ciy07 This is so stupid AND inappopriate on so many different levels, where does one begin? https://t.co/BN53ZUluiZ Imagine for a second if a lawyer for Clinton, Obama or Biden said this.

(AP) — A customer has filed a negligence lawsuit against Dunkin’, claiming he was injured by an exploding toilet at one of the coffee chain’s locations in central Florida. Paul Kerouac is seeking more than $100,000 in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Orlando, claiming he suffered “severe and long term injuries” following the explosion of a toilet in the men’s room of a Dunkin’ location in Winter Park, Florida, a year ago. After the explosion left Kerouac covered in human feces, urine and debris, he walked out of the men’s room seeking help from workers and the store’s manager, according to the lawsuit. An employee told him that they were aware of the “problem with the toilet” since there had been previous incidents, the lawsuit says, without diving into further details about the explosion. When contacted Thursday by email for more details on Kerouac’s injuries, his attorney, Scott Spradley, said he was tied up and couldn’t answer the questions until the following day. The Canton, Massachusetts-based company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ohio-trans-candidate-taken-off-ballot-dead-name_n_65971b3ce4b0912833af6bd5,A Trans Candidate Was Taken Off The Ohio Ballot For Not Using Her Dead Name,lil kalish,1/4/2024,"A transgender woman running for a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives was disqualified from the race due to a rarely enforced state law requiring her to put her “deadname” on her candidate petition. Vanessa Joy is one of four trans candidates running for state House seats to fight against Ohio’s anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. Last year, Joy submitted paperwork to run as a Democrat for House District 50, a solidly Republican area south of Akron. But on Tuesday, Stark County election officials informed Joy that she would not be eligible to run in the March 19 primary even though she had collected the necessary number of signatures. Joy had legally changed her name and birth certificate in 2022, but she was told by election officials that she failed to include her former name on the petition, which is required by a little-known state law. The 1995 Ohio law states that any person who runs for public office must include their present name and any name changes from the last five years ― and failure to do so will result in suspension from office. The law does include exceptions for candidates who change their names after marriage. Joy told News 5 Cleveland that she hadn’t known about this rule ― and it does not appear anywhere in Ohio’s 2024 candidate requirement guide. The Ohio secretary of state’s office said it was aware of Joy’s disqualification. “The law applies to everyone. It is cynical and unfair to criticize the Stark County Board of Elections for their unanimous and bipartisan decision to follow Ohio law,” Melanie Amato, the director of communications for the secretary of state, wrote in an email to HuffPost. Amato said the guide does not include every statute, including this 1995 law, but she said that candidates have a right to appeal a board’s decision in court. Officials from the Stark County Board of Elections office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For trans candidates in particular, this law carries with it the possibility of being forcibly outed even if candidates have gone through a legal name change process. “In the trans community, our dead names are dead; there’s a reason it’s dead ― that is a dead person who is gone and buried,” Joy told a reporter at News 5 Cleveland. Another transgender candidate, Bobbie Arnold, who is running for a different Ohio House seat, told Cleveland.com that she was disqualified for not putting her former name on her candidate petition. However, as of Wednesday, after her interview with the local news outlet, the Montgomery County Board of Elections website showed that Arnold’s petition was certified. It is unclear whether her candidacy will be affected by this law. “In the trans community, our dead names are dead; there’s a reason it’s dead ― that is a dead person who is gone and buried.” Joy said this law would “undoubtedly” deter trans people from running for office. Ari Faber, who is running to unseat a Republican in Belmont County, said he is being forced to run under his birth name because he hasn’t legally changed his name. “The law they are using is archaic and incredibly anti-woman and anti-LGBTQ+,” Faber told Cleveland.com. “It’s being selectively applied to target transgender candidates, and that is unacceptable.” All four of these political newcomers are fighting to represent rural areas in Ohio and to push back against the onslaught of anti-LGBTQ policies and rhetoric by the state legislature’s Republican supermajority. At the end of December, Ohio’s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, vetoed HB 68, a bill that would bar young trans people from gender-affirming care, such as puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapies, and also ban trans students from school sports. The rare Republican veto garnered outcry from Republican presidential candidates Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy and Donald Trump, who have pushed forward anti-trans rhetoric and promised, as president, that they would bar trans youth, and adults, from access to health care. Ohio’s Republican lawmakers have signaled plans to override DeWine’s veto, and the state House is convening early for a special session on Wednesday to vote on this bill.

And why should I care about her favorite things?” “But where would you put a floppy disk?” Our readers will vouch for that. We recently asked them to share the people, places and events that have elicited blank stares from the Gen Zers in their lives. See what they had to say below. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length. 1. “My 21-year-old co-worker tried to tell me “Did you know Netflix used to mail people physical DVDs?” Like, yes. I did know that. It wasn’t that long ago!” ― Hannah Knaphus 2. “As a dating coach, I sometimes explain singles classified ads to Gen Zer clients. As in, did you know that people used to meet their partners by placing ads in the newspaper ― with no pictures, no extensive profile and no algorithm?” ― Jessica Engle 3. “The idea of Blockbuster on a Friday night and rewinding the tapes on Sunday!” ― Candis Ingram 4. “Dropping someone at the airport at the gate and standing by the window til the plane pulled away. The longer you stayed, the sadder the goodbye.” ― Sapna Upadhyay 5. “She thought Enya was an herb.” — Brittany Waters 6. “Baby Jessica. In the late 1980s, this 18-month-old fell in a well and the entire country was glued to our televisions for the next 56 hours. Spoiler alert: She’s fine.” ― Nick Leighton 7. “There is a very big distinction between Michael Jackson and Michael Jordan. Even though their names are similar, you can’t just swap them out at random, especially when you say you want ‘Michael Jackson shoes’ and expect Air Jordans. You’re going to get loafers!” ― Holly Walsh 8. “My kid had a conspiracy theory that ‘Pilot’ episodes meant something suspicious. I had to explain that it’s just what we call the first episode of a series!” ― Shelby Cole Harris 9. “I had to explain to my kids that Freddie Mercury was actually famous way before the movie ‘Bohemian Rhapsody,’ as they thought he wasn’t well-known.” ― Candy Elliott 10. “My favorite incident was with my Gen Z son and his girlfriend. She had gotten a car, it was from the late ’90s. It had a tape deck in it, which they were so excited over, so I dug up a few old cassettes I had and gave them so they could try it out. I asked about it later, and they said that they didn’t fit, that it must only play the tiny cassettes. That didn’t seem right to me, so I went out to the car to check it out. They were trying to stick it in long ways ― it didn’t occur to them to try turning it the other way!” ― Hurst D. Angela 11. “Calling the weather line on the phone. Calling the movie line for show times. And calling home after basketball practice from the pay phone when it was time for Mom to pick us up. … let the phone ring three times then just hang up. She’d know it was time and you saved your money.” ― Vickie Jones Gogo 12. “Hang on to your socks! They thought that President John F. Kennedy died in an airplane crash with his wife!” ― Jane Thayer 13. “How we were all into Gregorian chants for about six months. Then they just suddenly disappeared.” ― Jamie Viebach 14. “It’s been wild trying to explain Y2K and the hysteria that surrounded it to Gen Z. Try telling someone who was practically born with a super computer in hand that our generation was practicing survival skills for when our computers would destroy the world at midnight in the year 2000. ― @maryfairyboberry 15. “I had to explain what a milkman was to my kids. My grandfather actually was a milkman. They couldn’t wrap their heads around the whole concept. I think they think I’m making it up!” ― Kathleen Collins Ward 16. “‘In Living Color.’ I even tried explaining Homey D. Clown to their blank expressions.” ― Karen Keene Parodi 17. “I’m a younger millennial, and while talking about music from 2010, I had to explain to a bunch of Gen Zers what VH1 was because they’d never heard of it.” ― Maryam Noman 18. “S&H Green Stamps! My siblings and I had so much fun licking and pasting these into the little books and then going to the store to redeem them for fun ‘free’ items with our mom. My kids were so bewildered by this… ‘Like, why?’” ―Leslie Blanchard 19. “That Jen Aniston and Brad Pitt were once married.” ― Jillian Kalbaugh 20. “I was telling a Starbucks barista I still have my red cup from when U2 did a collaboration with them. She answered me, ‘Who?’ and we went back and forth trying to explain that U2 is a band with Bono and nothing [registered]. I felt so old that day.” ― Kourtney Clara 21. “How there’d be a busy signal when dialing a phone number, like a radio station contest phone number. My kids had never heard a busy signal.” ― Laura Harris 22. “The fax machine went off in our office and scared the teen worker so bad she thought it was a bomb. After explaining what it was, we asked her if she knew what the typewriter was, and she asked if it was another fax machine.” ― Janet Stackhouse Meek 23. “In a teacher’s workshop, I made a comment that referenced Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis. [There was] dead silence. NO ONE knew who I was talking about! Retired two years later!” ― Mary Shea Rys 24. “This one broke me: Rewinding a video. I asked my oldest to ‘rewind’ a show on on-demand, and she looked at me like I had three heads.” ― Rachel Rank 25. “Dial-up internet access. The internet arrived in the mail on a CD-ROM, usually from the company AOL. You received a limited number of minutes to access the internet per CD. Wi-Fi didn’t exist; the computer used a landline to ‘call’ the internet. My sister was familiar with the notorious screechy ‘dial-up’ sounds but didn’t associate them with internet access.” ― Penney Berryman 26. “I told my kids if I married this guy we would be like the Brady Bunch, but they had no idea who the Brady Bunch is.” ― Mary Catherine Roberson 27. “Me: Getting a haircut, talking about music and telling the stylist about Janis Joplin. Her: Who’s that?’ Me: Mind blown.” ― Donna Farrell 28. “I recently responded ‘totally tubular’ and ‘gag me with a spoon’ to a ‘what are sayings that Gen Zers will never know?’ prompt on social media. To my kids’ horror, it showed up on their newsfeeds, and they accosted me in the kitchen to explain the meanings (and myself). I told them they were popular expressions during the Valley Girl days, when leg warmers, electric blue eyeliner and Hubba Bubba bubble gum tape reigned. The blank stares I got in response were in the spirit of a stereotypical Valley Girl.” ― Jodi Meltzer HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Ron DeSantis kicked off his appearance at a CNN Republican Presidential Town Hall on Thursday with a name-dropping dig at opponent Nikki Haley. During the live town hall event in Des Moines, Iowa, DeSantis walked on to the stage and handed moderator Kaitlan Collins a jersey of Iowa Hawkeyes basketball star Caitlin Clark, alluding to a recent flub from Haley in which she mixed up the two names. “We’re excited to see the Lady Hawkeyes team. What a great coach they have. Caitlin Collins is phenomenal,” the former South Carolina governor said last week at a pre-game event, clearly meaning Clark, the Des Moines Register reported. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Collins responded to Haley’s comment: “I can assure you her free-throw percentage is much better than mine.” DeSantis, whose CNN town hall preceded Haley’s, didn’t miss taking the easy shot. “I heard the other day someone say Kaitlan Collins had some basketball skills. Now, I don’t know if that was a mistake or not, but I know in Iowa they have a Caitlin Clark, so I just wanted to give you this as a memento,” DeSantis said Thursday as he unfolded the jersey and handed it to Collins. DeSantis and Haley were scheduled for back-to-back CNN town halls on Thursday evening, just more than a week before the Iowa caucuses.

The New York Film Critics Circle recently named the filmmaker best director for his movie “Oppenheimer,” and Nolan decided to use his acceptance speech as an opportunity to wax poetic about why he doesn’t care that an aerobics instructor hurt his feelings, according to Variety. Nolan explained to a room full of professional film critics that he respects their opinions of his work because of their “objectivity.” But when it comes to anyone else, not so much. To highlight this point, Nolan shared a personal anecdote. “I was on my Peloton. I’m dying. And the instructor started talking about one of my films and said, ‘Did anyone see this? That’s a couple hours of my life I’ll never get back again!’” Nolan said. “When [film critic] Rex Reed takes a shit on your film he doesn’t ask you to work out! In today’s world, where opinions are everywhere, there is a sort of idea that film criticism is being democratized, but I for one think the critical appreciation of films shouldn’t be an instinct but it should be a profession.” Although Nolan seemed to be joking while sharing this story, he may have been a bit irked by the flippant remark because he cranked it up again on his appreciation of film critics. “What we have here tonight is a group of professionals who attempt objectivity,” Nolan continued. “Obviously writing about cinema objectively is a paradox, but the aspirations of objectivity is what makes criticism vital and timeless and useful to filmmakers and the filmmaking community.” Nolan didn’t name which of his movies was hated on or the name of the hater, but Peloton has a pretty massive fanbase, and it didn’t take long for its members to dig up the evidence. According to one Reddit user, the culprit was Jenn Sherman from a 30-minute interval and arms ride from Dec. 28, 2020. The Redditor appears to be right — and 404 published video of Sherman absolutely going off on Nolan’s 2020 film, “Tenet.” In the clip, which 404 says it found on Peloton’s official Facebook group Thursday, Sherman is working out to the song “The Plan” by Travis Scott. “This song is from a soundtrack of a movie called ‘Tenet,’” Sherman says in the clip. “Anybody see this shit? Did anybody see this besides me? Because I need a manual. Someone’s got to explain this. Yeah, I’m not kidding. What the fuck was going on in that movie? Do you understand? Seriously, you need to be a neuroscientist to understand. And that’s two-and-a-half hours of my life I want back. I want it back.” So, uh, maybe Nolan has a point about film critics after all — especially when he concluded his speech by saying: We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

On Tuesday, contestant Renee Poche filed a lawsuit against both Netflix and the show’s production company, Delirium TV, claiming “unlawful employment practices” as well as “unfair competition” and “intentional infliction of emotional distress.” She wants to halt a $4 million arbitration penalty the show’s producers sought against her in November for allegedly violating a nondisclosure agreement by speaking publicly about her experiences on the show. “My experience on ‘Love Is Blind’ was traumatic,” Poche, a Texas native who works as a veterinarian, told Variety on Wednesday. “I felt like a prisoner and had no support when I let Delirium know that I didn’t feel safe.” She went on to note: “I believe Delirium is trying to silence the abuse that occurs behind the cameras and ruin me for telling the truth.” Poche’s screen time on the fifth and most recent season of “Love Is Blind” was relatively brief. However, she was matched up with ex-fiancé Carter Wall, who is described as a “walking red flag” who was “emotionally abusive on and off camera” in court documents cited by “Entertainment Tonight,” among other outlets. Though Poche said in the complaint she was “utterly terrified of Wall” and expressed her concerns to Netflix and Delirium TV officials, she claims she was “forced to spend long stretches of time alone with him.” To represent her, Poche has reportedly hired powerhouse attorneys Mark Geragos ― whose previous clients included Michael Jackson and Winona Ryder ― and Bryan Freedman. HuffPost reached out to Netflix representatives for comment on the suit but did not hear back as of Thursday night. “Love Is Blind” premiered on Netflix during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and became an instant smash. The series follows 15 men and 15 women from the same metropolitan area who are hoping to find love. Over a period of 10 days, the prospective couples go on a series of “dates” from the privacy of individual pods, where they communicate via a speaker but cannot see each other. Poche’s case isn’t the first to be filed against “Love Is Blind.” In October, it was reported that Season 5 contestant Tran Dang had come forward with sexual assault claims against Thomas Smith, her former fiancé on the show. She also claimed that she was “falsely imprisoned” by the show’s producers, who she said acted with negligence. The show’s creator, Chris Coelen, responded to Dang’s suit by emphasizing the safety measures that were taken during filming.

Thomas Ebersole, 31 was arrested Wednesday after detectives found the 16-year-old girl in his home by tracing her location after she logged on to World of Warcraft, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by HuffPost. According to the affidavit, Ebersole initially told authorities that he did not know the 16-year-old but then brought her to the door. Deputies described her as “frustrated but cooperative.” During his interview, Ebersole allegedly admitted to having a “romantic relationship” with the 16-year-old and driving thousands of miles to Ohio to pick her up, deputies said. Detectives say he told them he knew the girl’s age and planned to the hide the teen inside his home and “have her become his wife,” according to the affidavit. Ebersole told investigators he had initially contacted the girl through Discord, an instant-messaging app popular with gamers. Discord messages cited in the court document revealed that Ebersole and the 16-year-old referred to each other by pet names, including “little wolf” and “My Hot Tier DH Tank.” The two also made several romantic statements, according to the document. Ebersole left his home in Florida on Dec. 27 to pick up the teen girl, according to messages in the app cited in the document. Deputies said they observed three bruises on Ebersole’s neck, which he said were “hickies” given to him by the 16-year-old, which she confirmed. The deputies reported that they determined the “overtly sexual” act was not “normal behavior” between a child and adult. Ebersole was taken into custody on charges of traveling to meet a minor to engage in sexual activity, interfering with child custody and sheltering an unmarried minor. An NBC News report shed light on the child safety issues surrounding Discord, citing 31 cases since the app’s creation in which adults were prosecuted on charges of “kidnapping, grooming or sexual assault” that allegedly involved communicating on the platform. According to its guidelines, Discord warns users under the age of 18 to not engage in sexual conduct that puts them at risk, and it prohibits adults from soliciting sexual content from or engaging in sexual conduct with users under 18.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/adopted-orphan-natalia-grace-proof-real-age_n_65972378e4b0bf73e178d911,DNA And Dental Records Confirm Orphan Natalia Grace’s Real Age,drusilla moorhouse,1/4/2024,"The second season of a documentary series answers questions about whether a Ukrainian orphan was actually an adult pretending to be a child to fool her adoptive parents, who had persuaded a judge to change her legal age from 9 to 22 years old as they claimed she terrorized their family. DNA analysis, dental records and an endocrinologist’s evaluation are offered as evidence of Natalia Grace Barnett’s true age in “Natalia Speaks,” Investigation Discovery’s second season of its 2023 blockbuster “The Curious Case of Natalia Grace.” According to health and scientific professionals, Natalia was in fact a child in 2012 when Michael and Kristine Barnett petitioned an Indiana court to change the date on her birth certificate from 2003 to 1989. Shortly afterward, the couple moved to Canada with their three biological sons, leaving Natalia, who has a form of dwarfism, to fend for herself in apartments they rented for her in Indiana. An endocrinologist who examined Natalia in 2010 estimated her to be 9 to 11 years old. A dentist reviewing her X-rays from his 2011 examination for “Natalia Speaks” pointed out that she still had 12 baby teeth at the time, calling the results “indisputable.” Kristine Barnett, he said, left the consultation with documentation of his finding that she was 8 to 9 years old. And filmmakers were there when Natalia received the results of a recent epigenetic DNA test, which determined she is now no older than 22, making it clear she was a child when deserted by the family nearly 12 years ago. “This one little piece of paper,” Natalia said, holding up the page with the DNA results, “throws every single lie that the Barnetts have said right into the trash, with a match.” The docuseries’ first season, which aired in July, examined the bizarre claims by the Barnetts (who later divorced) that Natalia was posing as a child to hide what they alleged was a murderous intent. As Natalia points out in the second season, their accusations — that she poisoned Kristine Barnett’s coffee with cleaning fluid, pushed her into an electric fence, stood by the sleeping couple’s bed brandishing a knife and threw her brothers’ toys in the street in the hopes that the boys would get run over — parallel the story of “The Orphan,” a horror film that premiered in 2009, the year before the Barnetts adopted Natalia. It remains unclear why a probate judge would base the decision to change Natalia’s age solely on the Barnetts’ accounts and a formula based on determinations that she hadn’t grown in two years. Natalia was not at the hearing — nor was she aware it was happening, she says in the second season. Its title, “Natalia Speaks,” refers to the fact that she wasn’t heard in “The Curious Case,” outside of home videos and filmed depositions, because she was bound by a gag order.

Both Michael and Kristine Barnett were charged with neglect, but Michael Barnett was acquitted by a jury in October 2022, and charges against Kristine were later dropped. The trial court ruled that evidence about Natalia’s age and adoption could not be heard in the trial based on statute of limitation laws, but it was later released publicly by local prosecutors. Natalia hints at the possibility that she will file civil lawsuits against the Barnetts for abuse and neglect. The final episode of “Natalia Speaks” documents her adoption as an adult in June 2023 by Antwon and Cynthia Mans, a couple who had taken her in after seeing the apartment where she was living alone after the Barnetts moved to Canada. “What this adoption will do is kind of pave the way for anything you want to do legally in the future,” Natalia’s lawyer Peter Kenny said in a meeting prior to the adoption. “Because the evidence will speak for itself.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/billionaires-tax-biden_n_65971f6ce4b0912833af6d32,The Ultrawealthy Are Sitting On $8.5 Trillion In Untaxed 2022 Profits: Report,molly redden,1/4/2024,"Americans worth more than $100 million sat on a whopping $8.5 trillion in untaxed profits in 2022, a report released Wednesday found — money that may never be taxed unless Congress closes a loophole shielding the investments of the ultrarich. These centimillionaires and billionaires made up just 0.05% of all American households in 2022, according to Federal Reserve data analyzed by the progressive nonprofit Americans for Tax Fairness. But they held one-sixth of so-called unrealized capital gains in the country. Unrealized gains are the primary source of income for many elite families. Under current law, growth in the value of assets like stocks, bonds, investments, real estate or businesses is not taxable until they are “realized,” or sold. The ultrawealthy can nonetheless live off these gains by taking out low-interest loans against their exorbitant wealth. And when their fortunes become inheritances, the gains are no longer taxable. “The superrich truly live in a strange and privileged world,” said David Kass, the executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness. While most households depend on paychecks — “income that is taxed all year, every year,” Kass noted — these untaxed gains make up the largest single source of income for the ultrawealthy. “The scandal of tax-free billionaires,” Kass added, also results in billions of dollars less in tax revenue that could fund health care, housing, education and other public programs. Led by President Joe Biden, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Reps. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) and Don Beyer (D-Va.) have introduced a “Billionaires Income Tax” in both chambers of Congress. The tax would apply only to unrealized gains held by ultrawealthy households, and could generate an estimated $500 billion in new revenue over a decade. Biden has also proposed ending the loophole, known as the stepped-up basis, that erases capital gains for tax purposes when wealthy individuals pass on their fortunes as inheritance. Both plans have virtually no support among Republicans. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Since 1989, when the Federal Reserve began collecting this data, households worth more than $100 million have nearly tripled their share of the country’s unrealized gains. The disparity in how the incomes of the superrich are taxed also deepens racial divides. Of the $8.5 trillion in untaxed wealth belonging to centimillionaires and billionaires, $7.6 trillion, or almost 90%, is held by white households. That figure is six times the total wealth of all Black households in the country, and five times the total wealth of all Hispanic households.

You Can Guess What Happened.,ed mazza,4/30/2024,"Donald Trump fell asleep in court again on Tuesday despite a new push by his attorneys to keep him awake, according to a reporter on the scene. MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin, who has been in the courtroom with Trump during his trial in the Stormy Daniels hush money case, was pretty direct when asked for her observations on the former president. “Sleeping. Again,” she told the network’s Chris Jansing, adding that attorneys have “tried a number of different devices” to keep him awake amid reports he continues to nod off in court. “When there are sidebars, an attorney doesn’t leave his side anymore because leaving him alone means leaving him to potentially sleep,” she said. “He has a stack of papers with him at all times now to go through.” But they don’t seem to be working for Trump, who has reportedly dozed off multiple times as the trial progresses. “Neither of those things seem to have protected Trump from his own exhaustion today,” she said. “More than not, when I looked up to see how Trump was receiving the testimony, Trump was not receiving it at all because his eyes were closed.” ""Sleeping... I would say they've tried a number of different devices to keep Trump awake.""WATCH: @lawofruby describes Trump's behavior inside the court room today. pic.twitter.com/1JtALqtQnM During a later appearance on the network, Rubin allowed that there may be other explanations for Trump’s closed eyes. “He appears to be at rest for considerable periods of time,” she told Chris Hayes. “Every time I looked up today, particularly during the first part of the day, Donald Trump’s eyes were closed. He could’ve been meditating. He could’ve been napping. That’s not for me to say other than I think he appeared to be at rest.” Former U.S. attorney Harry Litman, who was also at the trial, put it more bluntly. “I brought binoculars,” he said. “REM, we’re talking about. Seriously. He was under.” Trump, ironically, has derisively referred to President Joe Biden as “Sleepy Joe,” a nickname that more than a few analysts have pointed out will be hard for him to use again given his tendency to snooze in court.

Carlos Yadiel Baez Nieves, 25, is facing two counts of first-degree murder for the death of Fatia Flowers, 41, and Nichole Daniels, 44, both of whom authorities believe Baez Nieves targeted because they were “vulnerable.” “Baez Nieves clearly targeted women he thought wouldn’t be missed. He murdered them and dumped them on the side of the road like trash,” Sheriff John Mina said at a press conference Monday. According to an affidavit obtained by HuffPost, Flowers was the first body discovered after deputies responded to a report on March 14 of a nude woman “found on the side of the road.” The Medical Examiner’s Office determined Flowers’ death was “suspicious in nature” after they observed neck injuries that suggested she had been strangled. Authorities returned to the scene almost a month later on April 17 to find Daniels also nude and “on the side of the road.” Medical examiners determined Daniels “displayed signs of external neck trauma” similar to Flowers. According to the affidavit, both victims were transient sex workers who resided in the general area where they were found. Witnesses told detectives they last saw Daniels with a man, who was later identified as Baez Nieves, and “described that she entered into a white Ford style pickup truck.” During the investigation, detectives were able to uncover video surveillance that showed Daniels “entering a very distinctive white Ford pickup truck the night before she was found dead.” Further investigation showed the truck belonged to Baez Nieves who was later “actively trying to sell that truck.” “No doubt to get rid of it and any evidence in the truck,” Mina said during the press conference. Baez Nieves was later arrested for driving on a suspended driver’s license, and after extensive interviewing, he “ultimately confessed” to “killing both women,” according to Mina. Mina said detectives’ vigilance may have stopped a potential serial killer. “I’m very confident because of our detectives’ relentless efforts in this case that they stopped Baez Nieves from becoming a prolific serial killer,” Mina said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trader-joes-ordered-to-pay-attorneys-fees_n_663197f4e4b0279447ac92f2,Judge Rebukes Trader Joe’s For ‘Meritless’ Trademark Lawsuit Against Workers' Union,dave jamieson,4/30/2024,"A federal judge has rebuked Trader Joe’s for filing a “meritless” trademark claim against its workers’ union and ordered the grocer to cover the union’s legal fees as a deterrent against similar litigation. The company had claimed that Trader Joe’s United, a new union representing employees at four stores, violated Trader Joe’s trademarks through its name and logo. But U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera dismissed the lawsuit in January, finding that Trader Joe’s had tried to “weaponize the legal system” against its own workers. In a new order issued Tuesday, Vera went a step further and said Trader Joe’s should have to pay more than $112,000 in attorney’s fees for the union. He wrote that the trademark claim was notable for its “lack of substantive merit,” and reiterated his belief that Trader Joe’s never would have filed it if it wasn’t battling the union in an organizing campaign. “Employers should be discouraged from bringing meritless claims against unions they are challenging at the ballot box” “Employers should be discouraged from bringing meritless claims against unions they are challenging at the ballot box,” he wrote. A Trader Joe’s spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday. Union attorney Seth Goldstein said the order should put employers who would pursue similar claims on notice. Goldstein and one other lawyer for the union will be paid by Trader Joe’s under Vera’s order. “This is a very, very good day for labor because companies are now being told that you can’t use trademark law and other types of cases to try to deter workers from organizing,” Goldstein said. “If the company wants to continue this frivolous exercise then they’re going to have to pay for it.” Trader Joe’s has appealed Vera’s dismissal of the case from January, and Goldstein said the company could pursue a stay against the order to pay the union’s attorneys fees. But such litigation could end up only increasing the company’s legal tab with union. Trader Joe’s is not the only company to pursue trademark litigation against a staff union. Medieval Times and Starbucks filed similar claims against Medieval Times Performers United and Starbucks Workers United, respectively, alleging they could dilute the brands with their names and logos. In all three cases, the unions criticized the claims as an effort to intimidate them and bog them down in costly litigation. “If the company wants to continue this frivolous exercise then they’re going to have to pay for it.” Trader Joe’s brought its lawsuit against the union last July. It claimed the goods the union was selling in its online store, such as a reusable shopping bag that says “Trader Joe’s United,” could confuse customers and lead to “significant reputational harm” for the grocer. Vera, however, found it highly unlikely that a customer would conflate the union’s merchandise with that of the grocer, noting that it could only be bought from the union’s online store. In his order Tuesday, Vera said the company’s claim that it was worried about its brand being hurt “cannot be taken seriously.” The next four years will change America forever.

On Saturday, protesters gathered at a park in St. Louis and later moved the demonstration to the Washington University campus, the St. Louis Police Department (SLMPD) told HuffPost in an email. Video footage from the demonstration captures the chaos that unfolded as police crowded around protesters and attempted to restrain them. In a video posted on X (formerly Twitter), the professor, Steve Tamari, can be seen moving closer to the chaos, trying to capture the scene on camera, when a police officer grabs his arm and pushes him back. A few other officers joined in restraining Tamari, grabbing the man, slamming him to the ground and later dragging his limp body to a police van. In a post on X, a woman who identified herself as Tamari’s wife, Sandra Tamari, shared a video of her husband being “brutally beaten” by police, noting that both of them were arrested at the student encampment. “I was arrested at the Gaza encampment at Washington University in St. Louis on [Saturday]. My husband, a 65-year old full professor at [St. Illinois University Edwardsville], was brutally beaten by police. Here is the video of his arrest,” she wrote. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the SLMPD, along with several other departments, was at the protest on Saturday. The St. Louis police told HuffPost that they did not arrest any protesters. The department also did not comment on the video of Tamari being beaten. The Washington University Police Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. According to a statement on Tuesday from Washington University Chancellor Andrew D. Martin, 100 protesters — including 23 students and at least four faculty members of the college — were arrested Saturday and are facing criminal charges for trespassing, resisting arrest and assault. Martin stated that the group that set up the encampment was in violation of the college’s policies and was asked to leave multiple times. When the group did not voluntarily leave, he said, the university decided to “peacefully remove them.” Martin claimed that the protesters were “behaving aggressively, swinging flagpoles and sticks,” “attempting to break into locked buildings or to deface property” and were repeating chants “that many in our community find threatening and antisemitic.” Some Jewish students said they felt “terrified” during the protest, NBC News reported. “To be crystal clear, we will not permit students and faculty, and we certainly will not permit outside interests, to take over Washington University property to establish encampments to promote any political or social agenda,” he wrote in the statement. “To those who plan to continue to come to campus with the intention of disrupting our education and research mission and violating our policies, please know we will respond proportionately each and every time. You will not do this here.” But in a post on X, Sandra Tamari pushed back on Martin’s characterization of the demonstration, claiming that protesters had not instigated violence or property damage and that there had been a “festival atmosphere” before police officers started making arrests. “Everything that occurred on Saturday is documented and clear for those who wish to see. [Washington University] used violence against its own students, faculty, staff and the community to maintain its complicity in genocide,” she wrote on X. The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri condemned the college’s response to the protest and the arrests in a statement on Tuesday. “In its efforts to silence students and other protesters, the university set up a direct confrontation between police officers and student activists. The escalatory tactics of law enforcement, which led to the physical breakup of the protest and arrests of more than 100 participants, chills, curtails, and restricts expression despite the university’s claims of commitment to that very principle,” the statement said.

Washington University’s demonstration on Saturday was one of several that have occurred on college campuses across the country over the past several weeks to protest Israel’s retaliatory response to an Oct. 7 surprise attack on Israel led by the Hamas militant group in Gaza, which left about 1,200 dead and more than 200 people taken hostage. So far in Israel’s military assault, more than 30,000 people in Gaza have been killed, most of the population has been displaced and famine is threatening mass starvation. Student protesters are pressing for a cease-fire and are demanding that their colleges divest from companies linked to Israel and publicly denounce the attack on Gaza as a genocide. “There was a lot of screaming of Palestinian liberation versus Jewish,” Penelope, a member of Jewish Students for Palestine, who was at the protest Saturday, told NBC News, adding that she supports Washington University students’ demands. “I truly, to my entire core, believe that we can and we must have both. To focus exclusively on Jewish safety through militarily arming Israel is something that does not fundamentally ring true to me.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Barbra Streisand is facing backlash after she left a pretty awkward comment on Melissa McCarthy’s latest Instagram post. On Monday, the actor and comedian shared a photo of herself with director Adam Shankman at a gala in Los Angeles. Everything about the photo and its caption were relatively normal — but a quick gander at the post’s comments revealed a bizarre remark from the legendary singer and “Yentl” director, who is friends with McCarthy. “Give him my regards,” Streisand said of Shankman before taking a weird pivot by asking McCarthy: “Did you take Ozempic?” The remark, which has since been deleted, was captured by the Comments by Celebs Instagram account, however. People on X, formerly Twitter, had mixed reactions to the comment. Some found it offensive while others thought maybe Babs meant to send that sentiment via DM and accidentally posted it publicly. One person even made a joke about the Streisand effect, a term the EGOT winner inspired, which describes instances in which high-profile people unintentionally draw more attention to information they’d wanted to keep quiet when they try to wipe it from the public domain. She was like: pic.twitter.com/zlx42g3MQJ It’s rude. 🤦♀️ It’s weird and strange behavior, not to mention disrespectful. She probably thought it was a DM lol Boomers on Instagram cannot be trusted 😂 This is such an auntie on FB type photo comment! 😂🤦🏾♀️ Serving the Streisand Effect in real time weird how y'all just giving her a pass. On Tuesday, Streisand responded to the fiasco in a statement posted to her social media accounts. “OMG,” she began her statement. “I went on Instagram to see the beautiful flowers I’d received for my birthday! Below them was a photo of my friend Melissa McCarthy that I sang with on my Encore album. She looked fantastic! I just wanted to pay her a compliment. I forgot the world was reading!” pic.twitter.com/WFUqosuosM McCarthy has not responded to the situation. HuffPost reached out for her comment but did not receive an immediate response. But our guess is that McCarthy is indifferent to Bab’s remark because the star of “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” doesn’t seem to subscribe to the idea that her worth as a human being is linked to her size. When Refinery29 noted to the “Bridesmaids” actor in 2019 that she appeared to have “recently lost a bunch of weight,” McCarthy shrugged off the superficial observation. “I have [lost weight], but I’ll be back again,” she said at the time. “I’ll be up, I’ll be down, probably for the rest of my life. The thing is, if that is the most interesting thing about me, I need to go have a lavender farm in Minnesota and give this up.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/drew-barrymore-kamala-harris-momala-moment_n_66315090e4b0c558f7420995,Drew Barrymore’s Interview With Kamala Harris Shows How Even Well-Meaning White People Can Be Cringey,brittany wong,5/1/2024,"On Monday, Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Drew Barrymore for an interview that’s been called “both extremely uncomfortable and hilarious at the same time” and the “cringiest thing you’ll see this week.” (We’d propose all month, but hey, we’re splitting hairs here.) The descent into awkwardness began when Barrymore asked Harris about her blended family experiences. Harris has two adult stepkids, Cole and Ella, through her marriage to Doug Emhoff. In 2019, when she was running for president and likely trying to soften her “top cop” prosecutor image, Harris wrote an essay in Elle about Cole and Ella and how they liked to call her “Momala.” Knowing about the nickname, Barrymore segued into an incredibly uncomfortable tangent. “I keep thinking in my head that we all need a mom,” Barrymore told Harris, whose body language communicated nothing so much as, “Oh God, where is this going?” With a tremble in her voice, Barrymore pressed on. “I’ve been thinking that we really all need a tremendous hug in the world right now,” she said. “But in our country, we need you to be Momala of the country.” The audience clapped at the corniness while Harris grinned and nodded along, saying, “Yeah, I mean, yeah, no, I know.” I have been cackling at this for the last 10 minutes pic.twitter.com/kH8qnYNaOM If Harris was a little taken aback, it’s not hard to see why. It’s tough to imagine a scenario where President Joe Biden, or, to use a more exact parallel, former Vice President Mike Pence, would be asked if he could “be the daddy” of our country. But it’s also not surprising that Barrymore went there. The former child star is a notorious close talker and a big-time hugger on her daytime talk show. When her guests are truly engaged with her, her emotionality works in her favor. (As a talkshow host, she can be wonderfully vulnerable and empathetic, as we’ve written about before.) However, when she ignores her guest’s body language, the awkwardness is almost unbearable. (For further proof, see her viral interview with Oprah Winfrey last year, where Winfrey was visibly annoyed by the host’s touchy-feely ways.) As the Harris clip went viral, a secondary conversation broke out on X, formerly called Twitter, with writer and cultural critic Michael Harriot posting, “Every Black person has been in this position, stuck with a well-meaning white person who SWORE they was spittin.” In the replies, people shared comical anecdotes about mostly well-meaning co-workers and acquaintances trying to connect by using “hip” slang or loudly proclaiming themselves an ally. “[My youth pastor] said, 'It's hip hop. Do it for your people.'” James Jefferson from Kansas City, Missouri, had a particularly good anecdote. Jefferson said he distinctly remembered a moment in 1990 when a youth pastor asked him to perform a rap she wrote for a church program. Aware that the song was awful and also busy with school work, Jefferson, then 17, politely told her “no.” “She then tells me, ‘This part is perfect for you. It’s hip-hop. Do it for your people,’” he told HuffPost. “I was shocked but not surprised by the statement,” he continued. “I flat-out told her that doing this silly rap song does nothing to enhance or lift up my people. She backtracked a bit, then asked me to look it over and think about it.” Even though Barrymore meant well, her comment to Harris ― delivered in a way that suggested she believed she’d pulled off something poignant ― reminded Jefferson of that youth pastor. “It triggered me. I can’t lie,” he said. “You have to be aware of the implications of certain statements and gestures, especially when you are in front of a worldwide audience. Respecting others includes respecting their culture, gender and religion.” Watching the Barrymore clip, journalist and executive producer Andrea Morehead was reminded of how routinely Black women are called everything but their first names in professional settings. “I had a white male colleague back in 1999 who’d always said, ‘Hey sister,’ with the hard ‘R’ whenever he greeted me,” she said. “It grated my soul.” Morehead said she was young, naive and willing to tolerate the guy for a while. Eventually, though, she grew tired of it and told him, “I’m not your sister. Please use my name or a simple, ‘How are you doing?’” “My feeling is, if you’re not singing the song ‘Sister Christian’ by Night Ranger to me, don’t call me sister,” Morehead joked to HuffPost. “But he was always using colloquialisms when speaking with BIPOC, so it was a thang for him.” As diversity, equity and inclusion programs come under legal attack in schools and workplaces, Morehead has a feeling these awkward scenarios will keep cropping up. “I think it’s white people’s responsibility to have the desire and curious compassion to seek knowledge and do their work to do better and be better — and put their back into it,” she said. Others heard echoes of the Black mammy trope in what Barrymore said, with one person writing on X, “Asking the first Black women VP to serve the mammy trope for America’s comfort is ASININE.” Princella D. Smith, an author and former political operative in Nashville, Tennessee, was struck by that, too. “Since the slave era, the Black woman’s worth has been tied to what she can ‘do’ for others as in a ‘service,’ and as we can see from our own professional experiences and from this clip, there is literally not a Black woman immune from it,” she told HuffPost. “We have to be someone’s mama, servant or sexual object,” she continued. “We aren’t judged by talent, work or ability. It’s, ‘What can you do for me?’ And further, if something is going awry, they run to the Black woman to fix it ― and give her none of the credit, by the way.” Jerica Lowman, a photographer who lives in California’s Bay Area, thinks this “Momala” conversation is similar to how Black women online get called “auntie” because they’re seen as “wise” or mature. When coming from a stranger, calling someone “Momala” or “auntie” is weird and inappropriately intimate, Lowman said. “It can definitely be a term of endearment, but people were recently calling the influencer Jackie Aina ‘auntie’ and she finally just rejected it,” she said. “She’s 36, and her followers are very close to her age. Why are they calling her auntie? It’s not her role to be an example for people,” Lowman continued. “If you admire her, that’s fine, but don’t put her on a pedestal she didn’t even ask to be on.” Jackie Aina wants people to stop calling her Aunty. She just wants to enjoy her youth. People of all ages been calling her Aunty for a long time and she’s ready for a new phase in her life. pic.twitter.com/5VzPovs3Xj Of course, a Black woman can be powerful and motherly. Just look at Michelle Obama, who was known as the “hugger in chief” for her affinity for hugging White House guests, said Candace Howze, a multimedia artist in North Carolina. But there are notable differences between Obama and Harris. “One of the many roles of the first lady is hostess, so greeting guests warmly is literally part of the job,” Howze said. “I think that viewing VP Harris as ‘Momala’ to the nation can undermine her authority ― not because motherhood lacks power, but because a family nickname inspires more sentimentality than esteem.” Ultimately, Howze thinks Barrymore’s comment is an unfortunate example of intent versus impact being in total misalignment. Having seen Barrymore’s show before, Dami Akinnusi Rock, a filmmaker and creative consultant, said she thinks the host was just being her usual “unfiltered Gen X” self. “[Barrymore] is amplifying our voices and recognizing the humanity in our experiences ― I do think that’s what she was attempting to do,” she added. “I think we can give each other a little grace as we undo so much conditioning.” Still, Rock said, “My initial reaction was to laugh and cringe, and it felt like Kamala was doing the same. Drew was leaning in, and Kamala was leaning back, looking like she was containing her laughter and probably wondering what was going on.” “My initial reaction was to laugh and cringe, and it felt like Kamala was doing the same.” As a Black woman, Rock said she’s often been ascribed superhuman qualities: unwavering strength, resilience and the ability to take on everything, including the emotional labor others won’t do. She’s even found herself playing into the “strong Black woman” stereotype at times. She finds the whole concept fascinating; it’s even the subject of a documentary she’s working on right now, titled “Black Women Can’t Cry.” “The problem with all this is that these tropes and microagressions can affect our mental health,” she said. “Rather than reinforcing stereotypes or expecting us to carry the weight of the world, I invite white women to continue advocating for us while also remembering our humanity.” Connecting with someone isn’t about knowing the latest slang or referencing a meme popular among Black people. There are always ways to connect more authentically than that. If you overstepped a boundary ― maybe you’ve “othered” someone or made them feel like they had to be the de facto representative for all Black people ― listen to them if they bring it up. Rather than getting defensive, take their feelings and perspective to heart, Rock said. “If you haven’t been able to resonate with my lived experience, then of course you would believe your good intentions are enough,” she said. “It’s OK not to know what to do. You don’t have to have all of the answers, and some will be mad at that, but actively listening is an action and is a good strategy.” That said, don’t depend on your Black friends to teach you what’s borderline offensive. “There’s a plethora of anti-racism books to learn what not to do or say,” Morehead said. “Although some of them and other Black-centric books are banned in Florida, there’s no excuse for white people, or anyone for that matter, to claim ignorance because ‘I didn’t know’ or ‘no one told me.’” If a white person sincerely wants to connect with a Black person or any person of color, don’t try to relate to them by fixating on their particular color or culture, Jefferson said.

If he continues to violate the terms of the gag order, Merchan warned Trump, “jail may be a necessary punishment.” Trump falsely suggested at his rally that the gag order was intended to stop him from speaking to his supporters about anything, not just the trial. “He gagged me, so I’m not even supposed to be talking to you ― because he gagged me!” the presumptive GOP nominee for president proclaimed. “I have a judge who gagged me! I’m not allowed to talk about things,” he continued. Merchan first placed Trump under the gag order in March after prosecutors pointed out his “long history of making public and inflammatory remarks” about people connected to his legal cases. The original order barred him from speaking about witnesses, prosecutors, court staff and jurors. Merchan expanded it in weeks later to include both his own family and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s family members, after Trump assailed Merchan’s daughter on social media with false attacks.

The rock star left the internet reeling last month after he posted a video of himself working out in skin-tight trousers. Social media users were left stunned and impressed by his choice of attire, which also included a mesh tank top and sunglasses. In a new interview with Variety, Kravitz, 59, explained why he doesn’t mind breaking a sweat in the look that only he could pull off. The “American Woman” crooner said he’s usually on the go, so he squeezes in his workouts wherever he can, and that often requires skipping a wardrobe change before hitting the weights. “I’m coming from somewhere or I’m going somewhere [before the gym]. And I just don’t care. I’m gonna pop in, I’ve got 45 minutes, we’re gonna hit it and I’m gonna go run to where I’m going,” he said in the article published Tuesday. “So I don’t do it for effect. I didn’t do that to be like, ‘Oh, let me be just so different and wear leather pants and glasses.’ No, it’s just me walking in off the street.” As for the fans who were wondering about the sweat factor of wearing such snug pants, Kravitz revealed that his solution is skipping the leather pants on cardio days. Thank God for today! Grateful. Never been better. There are no shortcuts so seize your day. It is all possible. Love! #Human “I’m always working out in leather pants or jeans and boots and whatever — if I’m not doing cardio,” he said. “If I’m doing cardio, obviously I’m going to wear sweats because I’m going to be sweating all over the place. But if I’m lifting weights, I don’t sweat so much.” Kravitz shut down the fitness experts who questioned the effectiveness of his workout in such an unconventional ensemble. “I know what I’m doing and my trainer knows what he’s doing. And I know my body and what my body does and what it can do and how it feels and it’s all good. I trained with elite athletes, I trained with football players, NFL and NBA stars,” he said. “I trained with MLB stars, wrestlers, boxers. I’ve played with them all. I won’t mention names, but they’re all people you would know. And they’ll tell you I train very seriously.” Kravitz also recalled the time “big athletes” made fun of him for “wearing jeans and a belt and boots” to the gym before hitting a sweat session with his trainer Dodd Romero. “It’s funny because I remember once pulling my tour bus up to the gym after getting off a leg of a tour, going to see my trainer Dodd Romero who is the guy in the [viral leather pants] video who I’ve been working with for 25-plus years, and these big athletes saw me walking in and my trainer said ‘He’s gonna work out with us,’ he shared. “And they all started laughing.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The “Hunger Games” star said he later humbled the critics after he “destroyed” them during the workout. “Because I was wearing jeans and a belt and boots and whatever shirt I was wearing, and they were like, ‘We’re gonna work out with this little rock star dude?’ Like they were making fun of me. And I destroyed them. And they didn’t see it coming.” Despite the mixed reactions over the viral video, which was shared on April 9, many of his fans praised the rock legend’s look as “the most rock n roll shit EVER” and “so Lenny.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But the former president reached new heights of incomprehensibility on Wednesday when he attempted to pronounce “infrastructure” during a campaign rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Trump was criticizing President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure package, which he signed into law in 2021, when Trump tried to say that four-syllable word. ″[It didn’t] work out too well ― $1.2 trillion for their fake infra-struck-er-sher par-,” Trump said.

Footage of the incident, captured on YouTube and Instagram by the Miami-based content creator Wavy Boats, shows the group leaving a local event called “Boca Bash” in a boat. They can be seen drinking and, later, emptying two garbage cans filled with loose trash into the water roughly a mile and a half offshore. Drone footage shows much of the debris, which includes cans, potato chip bags and plastic cups, floating on the surface as the boaters head back to the event. By Wednesday, the video had been viewed more than 350,000 times on YouTube, drawing a blistering response across social media. Watch Wavy Boats’ video below: Speaking to ABC News on Wednesday, Florida Fish and Wildlife’s public information officer Tyson Matthews said that the people in the video had been found and identified. Given that some of the boaters are believed to be minors, he did not disclose their names. “We know where the violation occurred,” Matthews said. “It’s just a matter of following through and applying the appropriate charges now.” As for what those charges may entail, he said only that the group’s actions represented “several levels of violations.” “It’s littering. It’s polluting the environment,” Matthews said. “It can cause significant damage to our marine resources.” On Tuesday, Boca Bash organizers released a statement on social media condemning the group’s actions, and applauding the people who they say assisted authorities in identifying the boaters.

The Poway Unified School District board on Tuesday voted unanimously to terminate Marian Kim Phelps after an investigation of the harassment claims. “Based on her conduct, as revealed to the Board through the investigation, the Board has lost all confidence and trust in Dr. Phelps’ ability to continue to serve as Superintendent, as well as in her ability to continue to work collaboratively with the Board as part of Poway Unified’s governance team,” Michelle O’Connor-Ratcliff, the board’s president, said in a statement. The scandal ― which some have dubbed “Clappergate” ― came to public attention in November after members of the softball team accused Phelps of threatening their graduation privileges because they didn’t cheer loudly enough for her daughter at an awards banquet. “I think that sometimes maybe lines got blurred as to her role as superintendent and her role as a parent,” Michael Roberts, a local parent, told San Diego’s NBC 7 at the time. Phelps insisted to the station that she had “never threatened any student” and ”never talked to any student about making threats about them not graduating.” “All of those accusations are completely false and fabricated,” she added. District spokesperson Christine Paik told NBC 7 that Tuesday marked Phelps’ last day on the job and that she will not be paid for the remainder of her contract since the termination was “for cause.” However, Phelps’ daughter remains a student in the district, and Paik said that there are apparently no restrictions on Phelps attending school events and activities as a parent. In addition, the district still faces a lawsuit from a softball player whom Phelps purportedly saw as a rival to her daughter. The unnamed student has claimed that an “illegitimate and biased” investigation orchestrated by Phelps kept her from playing on the softball team during her senior year.

The “Barbie” actor subtly paid tribute to his longtime partner, fellow actor Eva Mendes, during a recent interview promoting his new movie, “The Fall Guy,” due out on Friday. While speaking with UK radio station Hits Radio alongside “Fall Guy” co-star Emily Blunt in a conversation released on Monday, Gosling sported a shirt that featured the title of Mendes’ new children’s book set to release in September, “Desi, Mami, and the Never-Ending Worries.” The supportive gesture caught the eye of people on social media, including Mendes herself. On Tuesday, the “Hitch” star shared a slideshow on Instagram of various screenshots of social media users praising Gosling for wearing the shirt. “Feeling the love from my Cuban Papi!” she wrote in the post’s caption. “And loving that beautiful Mami - Emily Blunt - so mucho! Love all around!” Mendes and Gosling, who have been together for over a decade, are notoriously private about their relationship and have not confirmed or denied whether they are married (although Mendes has referred to Gosling as her “husband” before). They share two daughters, Esmeralda and Amada.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/robert-f-kennedy-jr-no-spoiler-pledge_n_6632ac55e4b0849b2ede13ee,"RFK Jr. to Biden: I'm Not The Spoiler, You're The Spoiler",daniel marans,5/1/2024,"BROOKLYN – Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. summoned reporters to downtown Brooklyn on Wednesday for what his campaign billed as a “major announcement.” Was it an endorsement? A big policy roll-out? Or maybe just news about ballot access in the Empire State? No, none of those. Instead, Kennedy unveiled an elaborate bid to troll President Joe Biden, who leads Kennedy by about 30 percentage points in nationwide polling, into dropping out of the race. Prominent Democrats have forcefully made the case that Kennedy is destined to be a “spoiler,” a candidate mathematically incapable of winning whose real impact is to take away support from legitimate contenders. So Kennedy and his campaign manager (and daughter-in-law) Amaryllis Fox Kennedy challenged Biden to a “no spoiler” pledge. The pledge would have Biden and Kennedy jointly conduct a nationwide poll of 30,000 people in all 50 states this coming October. The polls would look at a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Kennedy and former President Donald Trump, as well as Biden versus Trump. Whoever does better in that head-to-head poll, with no option of a third candidate offered to respondents, would promise to drop out of the race. Kennedy’s team is confident that he would win such a gambit because the campaign’s internal internal polling of over 26,000 voters in all 50 states, conducted by John Zogby Strategies, shows Trump easily beating Biden in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, but Trump losing to Kennedy by a narrow margin. “So the question is: Will President Biden heed the dire pleas of the [Democratic National Committee] and — as the spoiler responsible for having a Trump re-election — bow out and let Bobby beat Trump to save democracy?” Fox Kennedy asked. “Or will he hand the country back over to Donald Trump out of stubbornness?” While the Democratic National Committee has repeatedly called Kennedy a “spoiler” and a stalking horse for Trump supporters, it has not actually called for him to drop out. Kennedy further said Wednesday that he was challenging Biden to make the pledge, because his internal polling shows Trump in a strong position to win and that Trump himself is thus unlikely to be a spoiler. But, Kennedy clarified, “I’m happy to make this pledge with President Trump.” “What we all want in this election is for Americans not to feel that they have to vote out of fear … and that is only going to happen if there’s a two-way race between me and President Trump or me and President Biden,” he added. The premise behind Kennedy’s bargain ― which was announced via a Powerpoint presentation of different polling scenarios ― is that many public polls are inadequate for measuring his support because they use relatively small sample sizes and do not typically measure head-to-head matches between Kennedy and either Trump or Biden. There is indeed little, if any, public polling of a hypothetical two-candidate race with Kennedy as one of the two contenders. One of the public polls that met Kennedy’s criteria was one conducted by entertainment gossip site TMZ, which the campaign featured in the slide alongside its internal poll. But there is a dearth of two-way race polling with Kennedy because neither Biden nor Trump ― each of whom has a massive war chest and grassroots support ― have shown any signs that they plan to drop out. And the courts have so far not been receptive to states’ efforts to kick Trump off the ballot because of the various criminal cases against him at the state and federal level. Nationwide, as of Wednesday, Trump leads Biden 41.6% to 40.8% in FiveThirtyEight’s average of public polling. Kennedy has 10.3% support. Kennedy’s unusual mix of anti-establishment rhetoric, vaccine skepticism, environmental activism and opposition to U.S. funding of Ukraine has made him appealing to an ideologically varied group of disaffected voters. It is still not entirely clear whether he stands to pull more votes from Biden or from Trump, but both parties are starting to treat him as a threat. Democrats point out that one of the largest donors to Kennedy’s super PAC is Republican billionaire Tim Mellon — also a major donor to Trump. “Robert F. Kennedy Jr is a spoiler — recruited by the MAGA GOP and propped up by Trump’s largest donor,” said Matt Corridoni, a Democratic National Committee spokesperson. “His ‘Veep’-like performance today does nothing to dispel that notion. It only reinforces how deeply unserious his campaign is.” Meanwhile, Republicans have taken to highlighting Kennedy’s liberal policy positions and rhetoric from years ago, before his skepticism of the COVID-19 pandemic vaccine and public-health measures made him a folk hero on the right.

In an interview with Variety published Monday, Fox touched on the “nepotism baby” debate and said she thinks public figures choosing to keep their children out of the spotlight is “almost like a disservice.” “It’s like I have this very highly coveted thing,” the “Uncut Gems” actor and fashion icon told the publication. “I want to share that with my son. We need him to be a nepo baby, and he needs to like own it too.” She went on to note: “He can’t be like, ‘I’m not really a nepo baby,’ he needs to be like, ‘Yes I’m a nepo baby, and what?’” The term “nepotism babies,” or “nepo babies,” refers to children of actors, singers and other public figures whose professional success, typically in the realm of show business, is perceived to be a byproduct of having famous and/or wealthy parents. In 2022, New York Magazine stoked the discourse around nepo babies when it published a cover story that included “An All but Definitive Guide to the Hollywood Nepo-Verse.” Since then, the topic has drawn some memorable responses after it’s been broached in interviews with celebrity progeny such as actors Maude Apatow, the daughter of Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann, and Ben Platt, whose father is film, television and theater producer Marc Platt. Fans can look forward to seeing Valentino in Fox’s music video for “Down the Drain,” which has not yet been released. Despite her pro-nepotism stance, however, Fox told InStyle last month that she takes a pretty low-key approach to parenting her son, whom she shares with her ex, Peter Artemiev.

The former Nickelodeon star, who began acting as a child and had her first kiss on a Disney show, said on a recent episode of SiriusXM’s “Hits 1 LA With Tony Fly & Symon” that she filmed her first-ever sex scene for the new movie “Depravity” and that the whole experience was “uncomfortable.” Justice explained that she felt some trepidation because the scene was shot on the first day of filming. “I’m like: ‘Really, guys? We’re going to schedule this for the first day? Cool. Thanks for that,’” Justice said. “It is uncomfortable. ... I was actually very nervous about it and totally anxious about the entire situation. And I was like: ‘Did I make the wrong choice? I don’t know if I should do this.’” Although people may think that filming intimate scenes is “really sexy,” she said, “it’s really not. ... It’s uncomfortable, honestly, and there’s a bunch of random dudes in the room breathing and watching you.” Justice noted that she had “a lot of faith and trust” in the movie’s writer and director, Paul Tamasy, and that her unnamed co-star in the sex scene helped ease her anxiety over shooting it. “We barely knew each other because it was the first day of filming,” Justice said. “But he was a super nice guy and made me feel very safe, and was very polite and respectful. So it went well, and it’s very tasteful.” It’s unclear if the “Depravity” set had an intimacy coordinator — an expert who works with directors and actors to make sure sex scenes are filmed in a safe way. But based on the movie’s brief description on IMDb, which simply reads, “A group of roommates accidentally kill an innocent man,” it’s unclear why a sex scene was needed for this particular film. Nonetheless, many actors seem relieved to have intimacy coordinators on sets amid an industrywide push for more after the #MeToo movement took off in 2017. Actor Ewan McGregor recently emphasized the benefits of having an intimacy coordinator for the new drama series “A Gentleman in Moscow.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/land-acknowledgments-not-enough_n_66325843e4b0849b2eddd60b,Land Acknowledgments Are Not Enough,chyana marie sage,5/1/2024,"The first time I walked through the doors of Columbia University as the first Native American student to be admitted into the creative nonfiction graduate program, I felt a wave of ambivalence wash over me. I remember glancing around at all my cohort’s mostly white, eager faces — they appeared confident that they belonged there. Many of them had been prepared for this moment through the years of Ivy League degrees and decades of expectations of legacy families. On the stage of Low Library, a faculty member began the orientation address: “Columbia University School of the Arts recognizes Manhattan as part of the ancestral and traditional homeland of the Lenni-Lenape and Wappinger people.” I was glad to hear a land acknowledgment on that stage, especially because the school is named after Christopher Columbus, who is still celebrated despite colonizing, killing and enacting cultural genocide against the Indigenous people of Turtle Island. Awareness is always the first step toward bringing necessary institutional changes to combat systemic racism and barriers that prevent BIPOC students from thriving. But what exactly does a land acknowledgment do to rectify the hundreds of years of oppression? Even in the short address, the verbiage relegated the local Indigenous people to that of the past. It was as if our land was not taken from us in blood — and as if we still don’t walk among these grounds, affected. Land acknowledgments are becoming popularized in so many different spaces now, but are they simply hollow efforts from people hopping on progressive bandwagons? On the one hand, it’s absolutely necessary to vocalize the truth about the stolen land that our society and institutions are built on. But the undeniable reality is that our history still very much affects the present. So, what actions can institutions take in order to mitigate the systemic harm against Indigenous communities? Because talk is cheap unless it’s backed up by action. Some of the biggest offenders of performative land acknowledgments have been museums that house stolen Native artifacts. Earlier this year, new revisions to a federal law were implemented to require that museums have consent from lineal descendants and Native Tribes to display certain artifacts. The Museum of Natural History in New York City was one of these institutions with a land acknowledgment on its website while housing these stolen artifacts, and it has since closed two of its halls because it did not comply with the new regulations. According to the president of the museum, these exhibitions “did not respect the values, perspectives, and indeed shared humanity of Indigenous peoples.” New regulations such as these have forced important conversations between museums and Native Tribes that have been extremely beneficial. What a radical thought: that non-Native people could actually learn more about a people from members of their community directly. Real action (that would ideally come alongside every land acknowledgment) gives rights back to the communities that were stolen from and taken advantage of. Other actionable change comes from seeking knowledge about Native American history directly from the source. Almost all Native reservations have their own cultural centers and museums that can be visited, including school tours and group rates. Supporting these centers directly supports the Indigenous people and their communities. You can learn about these histories while supporting the very real communities and people that are still here. Also, Indigenous art is often exploited and appropriated — and it’s rarely supported in a meaningful way outside of the community. Take the effort to seek out projects, books and other forms of contemporary art created by Native people versus by outsiders imagining what our lives are and were like. There are Native artists and playwrights producing insightful work every day that examines the condition, struggles and joys of our lives. Another way to back up land acknowledgments is to approach inclusion in an intentional and equitable way. Since I’m often the only Indigenous person in a room, I’ll be asked to give presentations on our histories for Indigenous Peoples Month — without any kind of honorarium offered. As racial minorities, we want representation, but we also deserve to be compensated for our labor. Though land acknowledgments are a first step toward accountability for the injustices committed against the original inhabitants of this land, the next time you hear one, ask yourself: What actions are they employing to accompany these words?

The bills stand little chance of passing in the Democratic-controlled Senate, but they give GOP industry allies something to tout heading into the 2024 elections. And since several of the measures closely mirror priority actions found in Project 2025, the 920-page policy blueprint that dozens of right-wing organizations compiled to guide former President Donald Trump, it might be a preview of what’s to come next year should Trump win the election. The measures seek to dismantle several of the Biden administration’s recent actions to better conserve America’s public lands and protect wildlife, including those to limit oil drilling in large areas of Alaska and mineral development near Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Rep. Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.) portrayed the measures as safeguards against what she described as President Joe Biden’s “war” on fossil fuels and other extractive industries — rhetoric that ignores the fact that domestic oil production and natural gas exports have never been higher. “From energy in Alaska to minerals in Minnesota, the bills under this rule empower our domestic producers,” Fischbach said in a speech on the House floor. “The Biden administration is leaving America at a disadvantage while adversaries like China work to expand their global influence. We cannot let this happen. We can be both good stewards of our public lands and take advantage of the many resources they provide.” Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) called the package a “great gift” to corporations and one that ignores public support for protecting wild landscapes and would overturn decades of conservation work. The bills “fail to protect America’s blessed creation for future generations,” she said. The package of bills passed Tuesday and Wednesday include: Their passage, mostly along party lines, followed hours of fiery debate on the House floor, during which Republicans accused Democrats and the Biden administration of advancing the agenda of “radical environmentalists,” and Democrats condemned the GOP as being beholden to polluters and special interests. One of the more contentious debates centered on the bill to block the Bureau of Land Management’s new rule to boost conservation on federal lands, which confronts the agency’s long legacy of prioritizing drilling, mining and other extractive uses. Republicans painted the Biden administration rule as an unconstitutional federal “land grab” and an attack on Western communities. “This rule is a poorly concealed effort to lock up more lands to advance the Biden administration’s radical 30x30 agenda,” said Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), the chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, referring to the administration’s goal to conserve 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030. “This rule would fundamentally upend more than 50 years of land management practices across the West that rural communities have relied on for their livelihoods.” Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) repeatedly stressed that Westerman and other Republican colleagues were mischaracterizing what the rule does. “One need look no further than the plain language,” Neguse said. “The rule says that it’s putting conservation on par with these other uses. Grazing is allowed under the rule. Oil and gas development is allowed under the rule. Conservation is allowed under the rule. If my colleagues don’t want conservation considered by the [Bureau of Land Management] with respect to how these lands are managed, which is clearly what they believe, then they should just say so. Just be candid with the American people that they don’t think these lands should be managed with conservation in mind at all.” Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said the entire raft of bills “misses the mark.” “It elevates right-wing ideology over the actual needs of the American people,” he said. Ahead of the votes, the League of Conservation Voters, a progressive environmental advocacy organization, put lawmakers on notice that supporting the bills would likely factor into its forthcoming environmental scorecard for members of Congress. “These extreme bills are a gift to Big Polluters and would have devastating impacts on our country’s public lands and waters, and wildlife at the expense of the climate and our communities,” America Fitzpatrick, LCV’s conservation program director, said in a statement.

Click here to subscribe. The linchpin to a case that could — in theory — lead to former President Donald Trump seeing the inside of a jail cell stems from a scandal the American public had almost forgotten: the “Access Hollywood” tape, which emerged way back in 2016. The tape, in which Trump crudely describes groping women, is not allowed to be played at the former president’s criminal hush money trial, as New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan does not want jurors to hear the words in Trump’s own voice. But it can be described and quoted from for the jury, and it has loomed large over the case. Trump’s scandals can fill books. Over his nearly eight decades on this planet, the man has been variously accused of being a slumlord, a racist, a cheat and a rapist. But it was after he gained the powers of the presidency that interest in his misbehavior really ratcheted up, as reports of his outrageous behavior felt like they came every five minutes. From the way he picked on U.S. allies and cozied up to longtime adversaries, to the way his remarks sowed confusion and outrage while Americans dealt with the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic, to his attempt to fan the flames of insurrection on his way out of office, to his multiple criminal trials for actions during and after his presidency — the American people have had a lot to pay attention to. Now, for one of those trials to remind the public of how this lone scandal almost derailed his presidency before it even happened — well, it’s a reminder of what seems like a quainter time. First published by The Washington Post, the tape, which was recorded in 2005, became front-page news in October 2016, one month before the presidential election. It was obscene. Caught on a hot mic speaking with “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush, Trump could be heard talking about an unnamed woman who he failed to seduce. He and Bush were on a bus, going to meet an actress who would escort them onto the set of a soap opera that was expecting Trump to make a cameo. His reality show, “The Apprentice,” had become a hit since its first season aired the year before. “I did try and fuck her. She was married,” Trump tells Bush on the tape. “I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there.” Once the pair see the actress, they react: “Your girl’s hot as shit,” Bush tells Trump. “Woah!” Trump says. “Woah!” “I’ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,” Trump says. “You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait.” Then came the famous quote: “And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. … Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.” In the background, Bush is heard cackling. To many, Trump’s comments amounted to an admission that he had sexually assaulted women and was proud of it. Bush, who by the time of the tape’s release had moved on to working as a “Today” show host, was fired. Trump initially tried playing cool. “This was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago,” he said in a statement at the time. “Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course — not even close. I apologize if anyone was offended.” But soon afterward, he released a more nuanced response in the form of a video statement. Trump said his campaign trips around the U.S. had changed him, and he even appeared to take responsibility: “I said it, it was wrong and I apologize.” Things appeared dire for Trump’s campaign. Some of his fellow Republicans were calling for him to drop out of the race and let his running mate, Mike Pence, lead the ticket. Others proposed trying to remove him from the ballot, but early voting was already underway, complicating the idea. Now, Trump’s trial in New York has revealed what was allegedly going on behind the scenes. While Trump downplayed the tape in public, the pressure on his campaign in the aftermath of the “Access Hollywood” tape was so intense that it prompted him to take illegal measures, prosecutors allege. Ultimately, they say, he falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star called Stormy Daniels who claimed an affair with him. According to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and his team, Trump had his personal attorney at the time, Michael Cohen, take steps to ensure no other damaging Trump stories became public. Daniels had been trying to sell her story before the “Access Hollywood” tape surfaced, but found there was “very little interest,” her former attorney, Keith Davidson, testified this week. After the tape, however, there was suddenly “tremendous” interest in Daniels, Davidson said. It was clear to him how desperate Trump’s circumstances were in October 2016. “Trump is fucked,” Davidson wrote to Dylan Howard, the editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer, in a text read aloud in court. Davidson had worked with Howard a few months earlier to buy a similar story from ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also claimed an affair with Trump, for $150,000. He led the jurors through the process of working out a similar deal for Daniels in October 2016, although it did not go nearly as smoothly. The price for the exclusive rights to publish (or not publish) Daniels’ story was set at $130,000, which included a $10,000 payment to Davidson. While the McDougal payout was covered by American Media Inc., the parent company of the National Enquirer helmed by Trump pal David Pecker, the company was not interested in ponying up that kind of cash again. Davidson spoke at length about frenzied conversations he had with Cohen, testifying that he thought Trump’s lawyer was giving him “excuses” in order to delay the payment to Daniels until after the election, when it would matter less if it came out. Eventually, Daniels was paid, and the story only came out through reporting by The Wall Street Journal after Trump won. The next four years will change America forever.

In a statement posted online, university President Minouche Shafik said the students’ occupation of Columbia’s Hamilton Hall on Tuesday was a “drastic escalation” of the campus protests that have been ongoing for weeks. The occupation “pushed the university to the brink, creating a disruptive environment for everyone and raising safety risks to an intolerable level,” Shafik wrote. The school requested help from the New York Police Department on Tuesday night. Police, some with guns drawn, cleared Hamilton Hall with zip ties and riot shields and swept through student encampments on campus, arresting about 100 protesters. Shafik has asked police to remain on campus until May 17. “Columbia has a long and proud tradition of protest and activism on many important issues such as the Vietnam War, civil rights, and the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa,” Shafik’s statement reads. “Today’s protesters are also fighting for an important cause, for the rights of Palestinians and against the humanitarian tragedy in Gaza. They have many supporters in our community and have a right to express their views and engage in peaceful protest.” Students were protesting Israel’s attacks on Gaza, part of a military campaign that began in October after Hamas militants killed some 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 people hostage. Since then, Israeli forces have killed more than 34,000 people in Gaza, including thousands of women and children. Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur tasked with monitoring the Palestinian territories, argued in March that there are “reasonable grounds” to believe Israel’s actions amount to genocide. On Monday, Shafik said in a statement that Columbia will not divest from Israel. Some people on social media pointed out the irony of remembering past protests by Columbia students while calling the police on present-day demonstrators. The Columbia Spectator, New York, Tuesday, April 30, 1968: https://t.co/4sNEDQ38Ks pic.twitter.com/2GO9MwUdx7 On the same day in 1968, the school’s student newspaper reported that Columbia had called in nearly 1,000 police officers to contain people on campus protesting the Vietnam War.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/disunited-methodists_n_6632a788e4b0fc2b95282269,United Methodists Repeal Longstanding Ban On LGBTQ Clergy,peter smith,5/1/2024,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — United Methodist delegates repealed their church’s longstanding ban on LGBTQ clergy with no debate on Wednesday, removing a rule forbidding “self-avowed practicing homosexuals” from being ordained or appointed as ministers. Delegates voted 692-51 at their General Conference — the first such legislative gathering in five years. That overwhelming margin contrasts sharply with the decades of controversy around the issue. Past General Conferences of the United Methodist Church had steadily reinforced the ban and related penalties amid debate and protests, but many of the conservatives who had previously upheld the ban have left the denomination in recent years, and this General Conference has moved in a solidly progressive direction. Applause broke out in parts of the convention hall Wednesday after the vote. A group of observers from LGBTQ advocacy groups embraced, some in tears. “Thanks be to God,” said one. The change doesn’t mandate or even explicitly affirm LGBTQ clergy, but it means the church no longer forbids them. It’s possible that the change will mainly apply to U.S. churches, since United Methodist bodies in other countries, such as in Africa, have the right to impose the rules for their own regions. The measure takes effect immediately upon the conclusion of General Conference, scheduled for Friday. The consensus was so overwhelmingly that it was rolled into a “consent calendar,” a package of normally non-controversial measures. “It seemed like such a simple vote, but it carried so much weight and power, as 50 years of restricting the Holy Spirit’s call on people’s lives has been lifted,” said Bishop Karen Oliveto, the first openly lesbian bishop in the United Methodist Church. “People can live fully into their call without fear,” said Oliveto, of the Mountain Sky Episcopal Area, which includes Colorado, Montana, Utah and Wyoming. “The church we’ve loved has found a home for us.” Also approved was a measure that forbids district superintendents — or regional administrators — from penalizing clergy for either performing a same-sex wedding or for refraining from performing one. It also forbids superintendents from forbidding or requiring a church from hosting a same-sex wedding. That measure further removes scaffolding around the various LGBTQ bans that have been embedded in official church law and policy. On Tuesday, delegates began taking such steps. Delegates are also expected to vote soon on whether to replace existing, official Social Principles with a new document that no longer calls the “practice of homosexuality … incompatible with Christian teaching” and that now defines marriage as between “two people of faith” rather than between a man and a woman. The changes are historic in a denomination that has debated LGBTQ issues for more than half a century at its General Conferences, which typically meet every four years. On Tuesday, delegates voted to remove mandatory penalties for conducting same-sex marriages and to remove their denomination’s bans on considering LGBTQ candidates for ministry and on funding for gay-friendly ministries. About 100 LGBTQ people and allies gathered outside the Charlotte Convention Center after the vote — many with rainbow-colored scarves and umbrellas — to celebrate, pray and sing praise songs accompanied by a drum. Angie Cox, an observer at the meeting from Ohio, said she has gone before her conference’s board of ordained ministry six times but was “told no just because of the prohibition on LGBTQ clergy.” She said Wednesday’s vote “means I might be able finally to live fully into my calling.” Tracy Merrick, a delegate from Pittsburgh who has advocated for LGBTQ inclusion at several previous conferences, said with emotion that the vote enables the church to become “the denomination that many of us had envisioned for years.” At the same time, the vote follows the departure of more than 7,600 American congregations — one-quarter of all UMC congregations in the U.S. The departures took place between 2019 and 2023 — reflecting conservative dismay over the denomination not enforcing its bans on same-sex marriage and LGBTQ ordination. The disaffiliations came under a temporary window enabling congregations to keep their properties under relatively favorable terms. The conference on Wednesday voted formally to close that window, over the pleas of conservatives who wanted it extended, particularly since the original window only applied to U.S. and not international churches. “To limit its function to the United States (portion of the) United Methodist Church, that is a form of disfavor for the church in Africa,” said the Rev. Jerry Kulah, a delegate from Liberia. Dixie Brewster, a delegate from the Great Plains Conference covering Kansas and Nebraska, called for a path for her fellow conservatives to disaffiliate smoothly. “We want a place to go peacefully,” she said. “We will not be disruptive. I do love all, I love my homosexual friends. I just view the Scriptures a different way.” But others said the disaffiliation process of recent years tore apart congregations and families. “We cannot continue to center the voices of distrust,” said delegate Lonnie Chafin from Northern Illinois. Some pointed out there are other ways that congregations and entire conferences can still disaffiliate — noting that the General Conference last week approved the departure of some churches in the former Soviet Union — though others say this is overly burdensome. This week’s votes could prompt departures of some international churches, particularly in Africa, where more conservative sexual values prevail and where same-sex activity is criminalized in some countries. Last week, the conference endorsed a regionalization plan that essentially would allow the churches of the United States the same autonomy as other regions of the global church. That change — which still requires local ratification — could create a scenario where LGBTQ clergy and same-sex marriage are allowed in the United States but not in other regions. The church’s 1972 General Conference approved a statement in its non-binding Social Principles that homosexuality is “incompatible with Christian teaching” — a phrase omitted in a revision to the Social Principles that is also headed for a conference vote this week. The now-repealed ban on clergy who are “self-avowed practicing homosexuals” was originally enacted in 1984, when the conference also voted to require “fidelity in marriage and celibacy in singleness.” The denomination had until recently been the third largest in the United States, present in almost every county. But its 5.4 million U.S. membership in 2022 is expected to drop once the 2023 departures are factored in. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/harvey-weinstein-retrial-september-prosecutors_n_6632a2b2e4b0849b2ede0cf3,Harvey Weinstein Retrial Could Get Fall Start Date After Rape Conviction Tossed,ap,5/1/2024,"NEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors asked for a September retrial for Harvey Weinstein during a hearing Wednesday in Manhattan, the disgraced movie mogul’s first court appearance since his 2020 rape conviction was overturned by an appeals court last week. One of Weinstein’s accusers, Jessica Mann, is prepared to testify again, prosecutor Nicole Blumberg told the judge, suggesting locking in a date after Labor Day. Blumberg noted Mann was in the courtroom Wednesday, and said she wants everyone to know that the defendant “may have power” but “she has the truth.” “We believe in this case and will be retrying this case,” she said. Weinstein, wearing a navy blue suit, was seated in a wheelchair at the preliminary hearing. The 72-year-old, who has cardiac issues and diabetes, has been in a hospital since his return to the city jail system Friday from an upstate prison. In court, his attorney, Arthur Aidala, said he has no concern about his client’s mental abilities, describing Weinstein as “sharp as a tack. As sharp as he ever was.” Aidala said his client wants to prove his innocence: “It’s a new trial. It’s a new day.” In the New York case that is now overturned, Weinstein was convicted of rape in the third degree for an attack on aspiring actor Mann in 2013, and of forcing himself on a TV and film production assistant, Mimi Haley, in 2006. Weinstein had pleaded not guilty and maintained any sexual activity was consensual. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have. Speaking after the hearing, Haley’s lawyer, Gloria Allred, said her client still hasn’t decided whether she wants to testify at the retrial, noting that doing so at the original trial was traumatizing and painful. Haley was not in court Wednesday, Allred said. Weinstein was also convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape and is still sentenced to another 16 years in prison in California. But he remains in custody in New York, and will head back to Manhattan’s Bellevue Hospital, where he is expected to remain until his trial, Aidala said. “He’s in constant pain that he’s fighting through. He’s fighting the best he can,” the attorney said, adding that he has nevertheless been reading avidly behind bars, including biographies on Abraham Lincoln and Eleanor Roosevelt. “Harvey Weinstein was used to drinking champagne and eating caviar and now he’s at the commissary paying for potato chips and M&Ms” but is making the best of it, Aidala said.

On Tuesday, the “Funny Girl” star posted a public statement that asserted that she “just wanted to pay [McCarthy] a compliment” when she asked the “Little Mermaid” star on Instagram if she was taking Ozempic — a type 2 diabetes drug that some use off-label for weight loss. And it seems that the “Bridesmaids” star has decided to roll with the idea that this kind of question was indeed a compliment. “The takeaway — Barbra Streisand knows I exist,” McCarthy said in a fun video posted to her Instagram account Wednesday in which she’s reading a magazine with Streisand’s face on the cover. “She reached out to me and she thought I looked good! I win the day!” A post shared by Melissa McCarthy (@melissamccarthy) Not only was McCarthy’s response good-natured and funny, but it also put the bubbling conflict to rest. On Monday, the “Yentl” star asked McCarthy on Instagram: “Did you take Ozempic?” The random and seemingly rude question was posted in the comment section of McCarthy’s latest post. Streisand later deleted her comment, but the damage had already been done. Screenshots of Streisand’s bold question made their way onto other social media platforms. Some users on X, formerly Twitter, were offended by the question — but most found humor in it. Most joked that Streisand had pulled a “boomer” or “auntie” movie by posting something meant for a private DM in a public forum without realizing it. Others found it amusing that the “The Way We Were” singer was “serving the Streisand Effect in real time” — a reference to a term the EGOT winner inspired that describes instances in which high-profile people unintentionally draw more attention to information they’d wanted to keep quiet when they try to wipe it from the public domain. Streisand responded to the fiasco by posting a statement in an attempt to clarify her intentions. “OMG,” she began her statement. “I went on Instagram to see the beautiful flowers I’d received for my birthday! Below them was a photo of my friend Melissa McCarthy that I sang with on my Encore album. She looked fantastic! I just wanted to pay her a compliment.

The measure, pushed by a new political action committee called Nevadans for Fair Recovery, would set a firm 20% ceiling on lawyers’ contingency fees in all civil cases in the state. Plaintiffs are likely to hire attorneys on contingency when they can’t afford to pay an hourly rate out of pocket; an attorney then takes a cut of any judgment or settlement if a case succeeds. Backers of the proposal assert that it’s aimed at sketchy “billboard” lawyers who drive up litigation costs with dubious, slip-and-fall-type claims. But lowering the fees in civil lawsuits could make plaintiffs attorneys less likely to take certain cases — possibly freezing legitimate plaintiffs out of the justice system and saving the likes of Uber from civil liabilities. The ride-hailing company is the measure’s lead sponsor and has dumped at least $4 million into the effort so far, according to state campaign finance filings. Local news site The Nevada Independent listed it among the biggest political contributions toward a ballot initiative this year. Backers hope to get the proposal on the state’s ballot in November. “A company like Uber could hire the most expensive lawyers on earth to defend itself, but they want to hamstring the ability of ordinary people ... to get counsel.” Uber did not respond to questions from HuffPost about why capping attorneys’ contingency fees in Nevada was important to the San Francisco-based tech company and its drivers. A spokesperson for Nevadans for Fair Recovery reached out to HuffPost to insist that the initiative would benefit, not hurt, civil plaintiffs. “The measure protects plaintiffs by ensuring they receive more money when they win in court or settle a case,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Importantly, the measure does not limit the ability of plaintiffs to sue, or limit the amount defendants must pay when they are found liable.” But Deepak Gupta, a Washington, D.C.-based plaintiffs attorney and lecturer at Harvard Law School who’s fighting the proposal, said that it “would amount to the most extreme limitation on access to legal counsel in the country.” He said that the norm for contingency fees in Nevada is currently between 33% and 40%, and slashing it to 20% would make complex cases less worthwhile for attorneys to pursue. The ballot initiative language includes no exception for class action lawsuits, in which individual plaintiffs ban together in larger numbers. “A company like Uber could hire the most expensive lawyers on earth to defend itself, but they want to hamstring the ability of ordinary people who are suing companies like Uber to be able to get counsel,” Gupta said. He suspects that Uber will take the contingency fee cap to other states if it succeeds in Nevada. He acknowledged that he doesn’t know why the company is trying to pass it in the Silver State in particular. “Perhaps they chose Nevada because it’s a smaller state, and it’s cheaper and easier to get things onto the ballot,” he said. “They have to start somewhere.” He noted that since Uber no longer funnels drivers or customers into mandatory arbitration for sexual assault and harassment allegations, it must now face those claims in court. The company dropped its arbitration policy in 2018 amid the #MeToo movement, and Congress later banned the mandatory use of arbitration in sexual assault and harassment cases. Gupta and other lawyers have filed a lawsuit in federal court in Nevada seeking to keep the initiative off the ballot. The complaint was brought on behalf of an attorney trade organization called the Nevada Justice Association, as well as a group called Uber Sexual Assault Survivors for Legal Accountability, whose members are suing Uber. Dozens of lawsuits have claimed that Uber failed to protect riders from sexual assault and harassment, including by having weaker background checks for drivers than taxi companies — allegations that Uber has denied. More than 100 claims, including some originating in Nevada, have been consolidated into a federal multidistrict class action lawsuit. The complaint seeking to block the ballot measure alleges that Uber is hiding its real intent with the proposal. “As more and more sexual-assault survivors’ claims get consolidated into a nationwide case,” it states, “Uber wants to stop survivors from hiring lawyers.” Reuters legal columnist Alison Frankel recently wrote that the challenge to the ballot initiative is all but certain to end up before the Nevada Supreme Court: “A 20% fee cap in all civil litigation, even in one state, is a big deal.” Uber’s proposal has drawn the backing of the Nevada Trucking Association, a state trade group. CEO Paul Enos said in an interview that many of the group’s 500 trucking companies are weighed down by litigation costs. He hopes the proposal can deter law firms that advertise for trucking accident lawsuits. Enos said that he likes going the ballot initiative route because he doesn’t believe his group could succeed with legislation in the statehouse. “The trial lawyers are very good. They have a tremendous amount of money,” he said. Politically speaking, the trucking group has hitched its cargo to Uber on the ballot initiative. Enos said that his group has not put a dime into the effort yet, though it may further down the road. “I wish I had Uber money to spend,” he said. “The only reason we’re here is Uber has had a lot of the sustained issues we’ve had. ... We’re happy they’re doing it, and we’re very supportive of the effort.” “It’s part of this larger strategy they [Uber] have to create a legal environment in which there is very little ability to challenge them.” When Nevadans for Fair Recovery announced the ballot initiative, it pointed to the backing of the trucking group as well as the Retail Association of Nevada. But a spokesperson for the retail group said that the statement of support attributed to it was “released without permission.” “The Retail Association of Nevada will not be participating in this effort,” the group clarified. (The original press release was included in the complaint aimed at blocking the ballot measure.) The political action committee’s announcement also attributed a statement of support to a Nevada Uber driver named Emilee Rogers. Reached by phone, Rogers said that she’s been driving for Uber for three years, and that she wasn’t aware of the ballot effort until Uber reached out and asked if she would publicly support it. Last fall, a TV news station in Las Vegas aired an Uber-friendly segment that featured Rogers discussing how her Uber earnings covered her Christmas gifts. Rogers said in an interview that she can understand both sides of the debate. “If you don’t think you’re going to make enough money, why would you put your time into that?” she said of plaintiffs attorneys. “At the same time, this is people’s lives, so it doesn’t make sense to me for someone to be in an accident, lose everything and then have the lawyer take over half.” To Gupta and other Uber opponents, the Nevada ballot measure has shades of the Proposition 22 fight in 2020. Uber, Lyft and other app-based ride and delivery services collectively spent $200 million on that effort to keep their drivers classified as independent contractors in California, essentially carving them out of a broader labor law covering gig work. Both companies successfully mobilized drivers and riders through their apps to vote in favor of the measure. Veena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and a vocal Uber critic, said that many Nevada voters might not understand the contingency fee system and how it works. Making the ballot initiative about the stereotypical “ambulance chaser” is a smart play on the company’s part, she said, and she finds it alarming that it might succeed. “It’s part of this larger strategy they have to create a legal environment in which there is very little ability to challenge them,” Dubal said. “It is really insidious and antidemocratic, and undermines the ability of people who are hurt, injured, harassed or underpaid to get their day in court.” The next four years will change America forever.

In a recent appearance on iHeart’s “Table for Two with Bruce Bozzi,” the “Jurassic Park” star opened up about raising his sons Charlie, 8, and River, 6, with his wife, Emilie Livingston. Goldblum, 71, explained that he  plans to tell his children they’ll need to fend for themselves financially when they’re of age, because “you’ve got to row your own boat.” “It’s an important thing to teach kids,” Bozzi said during Tuesday’s episode. “Most people don’t.” “Right? Right?” Goldblum replied. “I mean, I’m not going to do it for you. And you’re not going to want me to do it for you.” “You’ve got to figure out how to find out what’s wanted and needed, and where that intersects with your love and passion and what you can do,” he added. “And even if it doesn’t, you might have to do that anyway.” The “Fly” actor isn’t alone in wanting his kids to stand on their own two feet. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and political commentator Anderson Cooper have also said they don’t plan to support their children financially when they get older. Goldblum, who became a father for the first time at 62, told the British outlet iNews in 2018 that he was “glad” he didn’t have kids until later in life. “I’m glad I waited,” he said at the time. “It feels great to do it right now, because all the things I’m considering are perfectly suited to the big questions and challenges of having kids, and what you want to expose them to.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/florida-6-week-abortion-ban-takes-effect_n_66327c8ee4b0fc2b9528011e,Florida’s 6-Week Abortion Ban Makes It A ‘Terrifying Time To Be A Pregnant Person’,alanna vagianos,5/1/2024,"Florida’s six-week abortion ban took effect Wednesday, essentially shutting down the last abortion safe haven in the entire Southeast region of the country. Abortion providers, clinic staff, pro-choice advocates and lawmakers along the East Coast have been preparing for this day since the Florida Supreme Court greenlighted the six-week ban in April. Despite months of preparation, physicians and staff at Planned Parenthood health centers throughout Florida were gutted. “It is truly a terrifying time to be a pregnant person in Florida — and that is the devastating reality,” Dr. Chelsea Daniels, a Florida abortion provider, said during a Wednesday morning press conference at Planned Parenthood’s Golden Glades-Miami health center. Almost all of Daniels’ patients who came to the clinic Tuesday for abortion consultations were over six weeks pregnant and will need to travel out of state if they have the resources. Daniels said she had to turn away patients Wednesday morning while she was in the clinic, just before the press conference started. Many of the patients were just days over the new abortion ban’s pregnancy limit. “I’ve spent my life and my career doing this, and I have the training to do this, and I have people who do not have the training, expertise or knowledge to do this telling me that I can’t,” she said. “More importantly, telling women that their reproductive freedoms and their bodily autonomy don’t matter, and what matters is their political aims by bad actors.” Advocates likened the restriction to a near-total ban because most people do not know they’re pregnant at six weeks. Though Florida had a 15-week abortion ban prior to Wednesday, it was still a lifeline for people seeking abortion care in the Southeast. Georgia and South Carolina have six-week abortion bans, while Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and several other states to the west have near-total bans. North Carolina has a 12-week abortion ban in effect, and providers are already at capacity, Gov. Roy Cooper (D-N.C.) said last month. The Florida ban also prohibits sending abortion pills through the mail, which means pregnant people will need two in-person appointments, 24 hours apart, to receive care before six weeks. But some online pharmacies that send abortion pills by mail said they will continue to ship to Florida for women seeking care after six weeks. Many providers in other parts of the U.S. are protected by state shield laws that allow them to ship to Florida. Additionally, pregnant people can access medication abortion through community groups or online through international services like Aid Access. Florida’s Planned Parenthood affiliates have been working with abortion funds and clinics in North Carolina, Illinois and Virginia to make the process for patients traveling out of state go as smoothly as possible. Most patients who can travel will likely go to Virginia or Illinois, since North Carolina has a 72-hour waiting period between appointments — one of the longest waiting periods in the country. “There are 84,000 patients who sought abortion care last year. There is no way that the national fabric of abortion care can take care of these women.” Despite the tireless work of reproductive rights groups from the East Coast, there will be pregnant people seeking abortions in the Southeast region of the U.S. who will not be able to get care, said Alexandra Mandado, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida. “There were 84,000 patients who sought abortion care last year. There is no way that the national fabric of abortion care can take care of these women,” she said. “When we talk about 21 states that have bans or restrictions, where are these women going to go?” Planned Parenthood clinics in Virginia have increased resources in the last few months in anticipation of Florida’s abortion ban, said Paulette McElwain, president and CEO of the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood. Clinics have added hours to their schedules, increased staff on their call lines and ramped up telehealth services for gender-affirming care and medication abortion. The VLPP also recruited more providers and nurses in four of its abortion clinics to increase the clinics’ capacity. Some clinics are also training nurse practitioners in abortion care since Virginia law allows it. Currently, Planned Parenthood’s Virginia clinics can offer same-day access to abortion care, McElwain told reporters during a Wednesday call, although she anticipates it will be harder to get an appointment the longer the Florida ban is in effect. In 2022, around 3% of the VLPP’s abortion patients were from out of state. With more states in the region enacting abortion bans, over 20% of their patients were traveling from out of state each month as of April. Yesterday, more than 30% of patients making abortion appointments at Virginia’s Planned Parenthood clinics were from out of state. “No one provider or even one state can meet the need created by Florida’s extreme ban,” McElwain said. Abortion funds in the region, many of which were already hanging by a thread, are worried they will not be able to meet the demand for care now that Florida has effectively gone dark. “Florida’s limited abortion access has functioned as a band-aid for the South. That band-aid is now being ripped off,” Jade Hurley, communications manager at the DC Abortion Fund, said in a statement. This year alone, DCAF has served 34 Floridians, and 13 of those reached out after the state Supreme Court greenlighted the six-week ban. “We still don’t have the dollars, appointments or capacity to serve everyone who will need us this summer,” Hurley said. Florida’s six-week abortion ban does have exceptions for rape, incest and victims of human trafficking, as well as for fatal fetal diagnoses and the life and health of the pregnant person. But several advocates noted that these would likely be useless in practice. “They are in the law in name only to pull the wool over voters’ eyes, making this ban seem less extreme than it really is,” Dawnyelle Singleton, manager of volunteers and community programs at Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida, said during a Wednesday press conference at Planned Parenthood’s abortion clinic in Sarasota, Florida.

Amendment 4, an abortion rights amendment, will be on the ballot in November to hopefully enshrine access to care until fetal viability, or around 24 weeks.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) in a new interview shared Wednesday. But he likely wasn’t being a Southern gentleman in the face of her loud campaign to have him axed from his post. The term is often used in the South as a condescending diss that’s delivered like honey. It can even go so far as to say someone is pathetic. Given the two lawmakers’ Deep South roots, Johnson’s taunt likely was understood by Greene. And so were the other shots he took at her. “Is she a serious lawmaker?” Blake Burman asked on The Hill on NewsNation. “I don’t think she’s proving to be, no,” Johnson said. “I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about her. I’ve got to do my job, and we do the right thing and we let the chips fall where they may. That’s my philosophy. That’s how we’re governing. We’re gonna keep the train on the tracks.” Johnson said his goal was to grow the House majority. “Descending into chaos and closing the House down and vacating the chair again” is the opposite of what Republicans want to accomplish, he said. Greene and others in the far-right flank of the House are ticked at Johnson for his deal-making with Democrats to push through Ukrainian war aid and other bipartisan measures. But Johnson is sitting more comfortably in his seat after Democratic leaders on Tuesday vowed to block any vote to oust him as speaker. At a news conference on Wednesday, Greene deferred action until next week so she could “prepare.” She theatrically presented a MUGA hat ― “Make Ukraine Great Again” ― as a symbol of the “uniparty” begat by “Uniparty Speaker” Johnson, she said.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) inadvertently reminded people on Wednesday that the initials in the slogan “MAGA” can also stand for “Make Another Gaffe Again.” The Georgia Republican was announcing plans to force a referendum on House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) next week. The motion will likely fail since Democrats announced Tuesday they would block her attempts to oust the Speaker. Although Greene acknowledged the motion won’t pass, she said forcing the vote will show voters that Democrats back Johnson, whom she claims just follows the direction of Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). At one point during her press conference she attempted a move that probably sounded great in theory: She pulled out a blue and yellow “MUGA” hat ― for “Make Ukraine Great Again,” a riff on former President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” ― and awkwardly placed it atop a poster of Johnson and Jeffries. Yes, we know, pictures or it didn’t happen. Greene was so proud of her performative hat trick that she posted video on X, formerly Twitter, with a note criticizing the “uniparty,” her term for elected officials who attempt to work together: The Uniparty hates MAGA. They don’t want to Make America Great Again. The Uniparty is MUGA. Make Ukraine Great Again. Another forever war spending hundreds of BILLIONS of your dollars brought to you by Uniparty Speaker Mike Johnson. The Uniparty hates MAGA.

Another forever war spending hundreds of BILLIONS of your dollars brought to you by Uniparty Speaker Mike Johnson. pic.twitter.com/e2MnJXQO0V Johnson doesn’t seem worried about Greene’s efforts or her hat collection. He basically responded to a reporter’s question about her with “Bless your heart,” a Southern phrase often used to politely insult people, and asking, “Is she a serious lawmaker?” Meanwhile, Greene’s “MUGA hat” stunt didn’t get the reaction she probably expected based on the reactions from users of X, formerly Twitter. For one thing, many people really liked the MUGA hats. Nice caps.

The comic and the philanthropist both seemed in good spirits as they spoke to Entertainment Tonight’s Kevin Frazier on the red carpet. “I feel great,” Mavis Leno told Frazier. The premiere of the Jerry Seinfeld-directed movie was the perfect opportunity for some entertainment, according to Jay Leno. “Thought I’d come to something fun for a change,” he joked. “Everything is so controversial. Just to come to a funny, silly movie ― it’s great. I think people will have a great time.” The Lenos’ night on the town comes as the couple are privately handling Mavis Leno’s health struggles. In January, Jay Leno filed for a conservatorship of their joint estate, citing his wife’s cognitive decline. His request was granted in April. “Mavis has been progressively losing capacity and orientation to space and time for several years,” the court filing read, noting how her “current condition renders her incapable of executing the estate plan.” Court documents also cited Mavis Leno’s neurologist, Dr. Hart Cohen, who found that she “sometimes does not know her husband, Jay, nor her date of birth.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

She’s been married to Sonny Bono and Gregg Allman, and has reportedly dated Warren Beatty, Val Kilmer and none other than Tom Cruise. When asked Wednesday on “The Jennifer Hudson Show” about her penchant for dating younger men, the 77-year-old Emmy, Grammy and Oscar winner — who is currently dating 38-year-old music executive Alexander “AE” Edwards — was honest. “I’m really shy when I’m not working and kind of shy around men, and the reason I got with young men is because men my age are older,” said Cher. “Well, now they’re all dead, but before, they were always terrified to approach me, and younger men were the only ones.” When Hudson suggested those younger suitors were “bold,” Cher agreed and added they were “raised by women like me.” Cher also admitted she once turned down Elvis Presley himself. “I was nervous and I knew of the people around him,” she told Hudson. “And it wasn’t that they were bad people, it’s just that I was kind of nervous of his reputation.” The pop icon had serious doubts when her current beau began taking their fling seriously in 2022, she told ET last year.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/college-democrats-of-america-statement-biden-gaza-campus-protest_n_663278fce4b0849b2edded55,National College Democrats Slam Biden On Gaza And Back Campus Protesters,matt shuham,5/1/2024,"The national group representing college Democrats released a statement Tuesday standing with pro-Palestinian campus protesters and criticizing President Joe Biden for his “bear hug” of what the group called “the genocidal acts of the far-right radical extremist Israeli government.” The statement, released by the College Democrats of America, illustrated a break with the Democratic Party — of which it is an official arm. It was approved by an 8-2 vote of the group’s executive board, which is made up of national leadership that has been elected by representatives of campus and state college Democrats chapters across the country. “Since the beginning of this conflict, College Democrats and students from every walk of life have had the moral clarity to see this war for what it is: destructive, genocidal, and unjust,” the CDA statement read. It commended the “bravery” of students facing arrest and disciplinary action for their protests, and condemned college administrators for those responses. Across the country, student protesters have called for an Israeli cease-fire in Gaza, and institutional transparency and divestment with regard to investments in Israeli firms, or those linked to American military aid to Israel. The statement also called for the “release of all hostages” and condemned the rise in domestic antisemitism and Islamophobia in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel and Israel’s subsequent invasion and air barrage of Gaza, saying Jewish and Muslim students had no control over the conflict. Still, it said, “it should be abundantly clear that calling for the freedom of Palestinians is not Antisemetic [sic], and neither is opposing the genocidal acts of the far-right radical extremist Israeli government.” The statement’s harshest criticism was directed at the president and his reelection campaign. The White House, according to the CDA, has pursued a “cold shoulder strategy for its own base and all Americans who want to see an end to this war.” “Each day that Democrats fail to stand united for a permanent ceasefire, two-state solution, and recognition of a Palestinian state, more and more youth find themselves disillusioned with the party,” the statement read. It earned praise from progressives across the country including Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and the former Ohio state legislator and prominent Bernie Sanders supporter Nina Turner. “The President shares the goal for an end to the violence and a just, lasting peace in the Middle East. He’s working tirelessly to that end,” Seth Schuster, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign, told HuffPost Tuesday in response to the CDA statement. And Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, told The New York Times: “President Biden continues to work around the clock to secure a deal that would release all the hostages and result in an immediate, sustained cease-fire that enables significantly more aid to reach the people of Gaza. The president has held calls with the leaders of Israel, Egypt and Qatar in the last several days to try to secure an agreement. Israel has accepted the deal and now the onus is on Hamas, which is the only obstacle to immediate relief for civilians in Gaza.” Hasan Pyarali, a senior at Wake Forest University and chairman of the CDA Muslim Caucus, helped write the statement, and told HuffPost the group was “trying to do a service to the party and the White House” by alerting them to what CDA leadership believes is a growing rift between Biden administration policy and the views of young voters. “If you keep ignoring us, keep giving us the cold shoulder, you risk losing your own base, and then in turn, the election,” he said. “Because let’s just be frank about this: They can’t win without young voters. 2020 was won in large part because of young voters. So if you neglect them and assume that they’ll come along no matter how you treat them, you’re risking the entire country. And we didn’t think that was fair or right, which is why we decided to call them out on it.” The national College Democrats group began working on the statement after Columbia University’s president, Minouche Shafik, called in police to clear a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus two weeks ago; overnight Tuesday, Shafik called in police again, this time to clear a building where protesters had set up camp after Shafik began suspending students for their protest. Both instances resulted in several dozen arrests. Pyarali cited other campus protests as inspiration as well, including at Indiana University, where police snipers were stationed above protesters. “It’s insane, it’s not a war zone, it’s a college campus,” he said. The statement doesn’t necessarily represent the thousands of Democratic college students whose campus chapters fall under the larger College Democrats umbrella. Rather, the only binding vote on its release was held by the CDA executive board. Two members of that body opposed it. One of them, Joshua Martin, the former student body president at the University of Houston, commented on social media: “The only way to bring peace is to destroy Hamas, who through years of terror have subjugated Palestinians to decades of violence.” Allyson Bell, a Meredith College graduate student and chair of the College Democrats Jewish Caucus — and who collaborated with Pyarali in a December call for cease-fire — told HuffPost in an email that earlier statements focused on condemning instances of campus antisemitism had been “voted down by the executive board and replaced with what was released.” She called the final statement “one sided.” Sohali Vaddula, a New York University student and communications director at CDA, said that, ultimately, “the board has final say on all statements,” and that the statement they approved condemned both antisemitic and Islamophobic bigotry and violence. “But we also will stand up in solidarity with protesters who are peacefully protesting — the key word is peacefully protesting,” she said. For Pyarali, Biden’s ongoing support for the Israeli military campaign is an obstacle to his reelection. The next four years will change America forever.

In that time, there have been huge amounts of threats to the free press, all cropping up at the exact moment that our democracy seems to be most at risk. It’s clear that this is a challenging moment for digital media. And yet, in the last three years, HuffPost has reached historic growth. We’re regularly producing award-winning journalism, holding power to account, and bringing you fun and fearless news every single day. This is one of the most critical moments for news I have ever experienced. Threats on IVF, a draconian abortion ban in Arizona, and the looming Biden-Trump showdown all will have vast and potentially dire impacts on American life. I’m incredibly proud of the journalism we’ve produced and the stories we’re telling every day. But this challenging moment for the media means we have to think critically and creatively to ensure the future of our newsroom. “This is one of the most critical moments for news I have ever experienced. Threats on IVF, a draconian abortion ban in Arizona, and the looming Biden-Trump showdown all will have vast and potentially dire impacts on American life.” We are in a perilous time, but HuffPost was built for this moment. When I joined HuffPost in 2021, I was familiar with the brand as it was a newsite I’d been reading since its inception, but I didn’t know the people. What I found were dedicated, warm and hard-working journalists, committed to their craft. Individuals like Christopher Mathias, a reporter covering the fringes of our politics so we better understand what nefarious forces are at play, seeking to undermine our diverse democracy. And journalists like Taryn Finley, a writer and podcast host who brings a fresh perspective and humor to our race and culture reporting. Or an editor like George Zornick, who runs our National desk, covering pressing issues — from education to healthcare and beyond — across the U.S. We are a lean, dedicated newsroom committed to delivering necessary, award-winning, and paywall-free journalism in the style and personality we are known for. And in this age of misinformation and disinformation, having timely, accurate information focused on the facts is more important than ever. “We are in a perilous time, but HuffPost was built for this moment.” And your trust in us to deliver those facts fuels our excellence. But we need your support to fuel our fight. Journalists like Chris, Taryn and George and so many more in our newsroom need your help so we can continue to bring you the news you need daily. Advertising revenue simply isn’t guaranteed — and for that reason, we’re asking you, the people most deeply impacted by and deeply engaged with our work, to play a part in our next chapter. If you are able, we’d deeply appreciate your financial support. You can contribute as little as $2 to help us fund our work and keep our journalism free for all. If we are going to win this fight to protect our democracy, it’s going to take all of us — together. We need you. Please join us so HuffPost stays free.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ridiculous-things-said-multiracial-families_l_663131f2e4b0c9bc8759282f,The Most Ridiculous Things People Say To Multiracial Families,marie holmes,5/1/2024,"Crystal Shaniece Roman vividly remembers the first time that she saw someone outside the family fail to recognize her connection to her mother. “It was a parent-teacher conference in Staten Island, NYC. I was in grade school. I went with my mom, and the teacher asked if my mom was coming, although she was standing by my side. At that moment I realized people looked at my mom differently from me,” Roman told HuffPost. She documented this memory in ”Black Latina: The Play,” which explores her experience of being raised by her light-skinned Puerto Rican father and dark-skinned Jamaican mother. The teacher’s comment, she said, “robbed me of my innocence.” “A child looks at their parents through the eyes of love, not color,” she said. Unfortunately, for multiracial families, who comprise 10.2% of the U.S. population according to 2020 Census data (a 276% increase since 2010), these kind of upsetting comments aren’t always avoidable. Whether well-intentioned, overtly aggressive, ignorant or unintentionally hilarious, strangers’ inability to comprehend that kids’ hair and skin don’t always “match” their parents’ — and their total lack of shame in voicing their confusion — is something that multiracial families can expect to confront at some point. Anjali Ferguson, a psychologist and the mother of Black and Indian children, told HuffPost that her kids have been the subject of anti-Black racism delivered in the guise of “compliments” such as: “But your kids don’t even look Black,” “It’s a good thing they turned out light-skinned” and “Good thing they got your hair.” Phrases like these suggest “that a certain feature or characteristic is more favored,” Ferguson explained, and “can profoundly impact self-esteem and acculturative stress in an individual as they learn to build their identity.” But parents can help kids cope with such comments and develop a healthy racial identity and a sense of pride in who they are. First, Ferguson recommends that parents tackle such comments head-on in a way that positively affirms a child’s identity. For example, if someone remarks that a child doesn’t “look Black,” a parent could say, “They are! They’re both Black and Indian.” If someone comments on a child’s hair texture, a parent might say, “We love how unique and different each of our hair textures are. They’re all beautiful.” It can be tempting to avoid talking about such an incident, or to wait and see if your child brings it up. But Ferguson suggests that parents press through any of their own discomfort in order to make space for kids to talk about the experience. “Make sure you deliberately check in with them,” she said. You might say something such as, “Remember when X said this about your hair? I’m wondering how that made you feel?” The conversation will give you insight into your child’s experience and give you an opportunity to affirm and celebrate their unique heritage. “This helps them build resiliencies in the face of future comments because they get to work through the tough emotions with you and empower their self-esteem in the process,” she said. While you can’t prevent someone from making a thoughtless comment, you can prepare your child to handle it via “explicit discussion of cultural identity and pride in the home as well as exposure to groups that are different from your own,” Ferguson continued. “We develop a firmer sense of self which, builds up our resources when someone challenges us and our identities,” she said. We asked the HuffPost Parents Facebook community what comments they have received about their multiracial families. Here’s what they told us: “I went for my newborn son’s first pediatrician’s visit when he was only a few days old. The doctor asked me if the baby had been on a trip to somewhere warm and tropical to get that ‘tan.’” — Lisa Stephenson-Home “I love hearing ‘What is she mixed with?’ I reply ‘a spoon.’” — Melissa Norton, New York City “Once I was pushing my daughter in the cart at a grocery store. A man asked me, ‘Are you babysitting?’ I said no. He replied with a laugh, ‘You got you a white girl!!’ I’m Native American and Filipino.” — Julian Ghoulian Apilado, New Mexico “Picking up my mixed grandson from a football game. One of his friends commented, ‘Your grandma’s white?!’” — Carol Beckman Bennett “‘Are you the nanny?’ My son looks just like his father: blond hair, blue eyes. — Lisa Tesitor “You all are together? Are you sure?” — Gail C., California “[With genuine confusion] ‘Where did they get their hair from?’ I was baffled that they seemed to be confused about why my kids’ hair is a different texture from my own — given that they know dad is Black (and I’m white).” — Rebecca Bodenheimer “I’m half African American and my husband is White and from Europe — Ireland. My husband was sharing the ethnicity of myself and our children to an elderly gentleman. He took a look at our daughters and replied, ‘There ain’t no Black blood in those kids!’” — Ingrid Kellaghan, Michigan “I am a brown-skinned Hispanic and my ex is a white-skinned Hispanic. Once I had no choice but to take my son with me to class at Temple University, and after class a student asked if I was his nanny. My son has darker blond hair and blue eyes.” — Brenda F.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arizona-repeals-1864-abortion-ban_n_66328057e4b0849b2eddf3f7,Arizona Legislature Passes Repeal Of 1864 Abortion Ban,alanna vagianos,5/1/2024,"The Arizona Senate on Wednesday repealed the 1864 near-total abortion ban that the state Supreme Court greenlighted in a shock ruling last month. The state Senate voted to pass the repeal in a close vote, 16-14, with two Republicans voting to repeal the near-total ban. The state House voted to repeal the ban last week, and Gov. Katie Hobbs (D) is expected to sign the repeal soon. A spokesperson for the governor said she will not sign the repeal on Wednesday. The majority of Republicans were frustrated with Democrats, who they claimed were “rolling” or fast-tracking the bill. There were no initial readings of the bill, although state Sen. Anna Hernandez (D) read the one-line bill on the floor during discussion. The floor debate over the repeal spurred outbursts from both Democrats and Republicans, as well as people from the public watching the vote from the gallery. One Republican, state Sen. Wendy Rogers, said the 1864 abortion ban “got it right,” suggesting that life then is the same as life in 2024. State Sen. Anthony Kern (R) agreed, adding that the abortion ban that predates Arizona statehood was the “best abortion ban in the nation.” Kern also compared repealing the 150-year-old abortion ban to the Holocaust. While the vote is a huge turning point for abortion rights advocates in the state, the ban will unfortunately still be in effect for a window of time. The ban prohibits nearly all abortions except for when the pregnant person’s life is at risk. It also carries a felony punishment of two to five years in prison for providers. Despite the repeal, the near-total abortion ban will go into effect — likely as early as June 27, according to the state’s Attorney General Kris Mayes (D). The repeal, once signed by Hobbs, will not go into effect until 90 days after the current legislative session ends. The legislative session doesn’t have a specific end date; in past years the session has ended in late June, but in 2023 the session didn’t end until August. The near-total abortion ban could potentially be in effect through the summer and fall, possibly even through the general election in November. Mayes has vowed to not enforce the abortion ban during the window it’s in effect. “Make no mistake: Democrats’ fierce persistence against weeks of Republican obstruction is the only reason the 1864 ban was repealed and this shows a clear contrast in leadership,” Heather Williams, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee president, said in a statement. “As Republicans regroup to defend their 15-week ban and work to undermine the upcoming abortion ballot measure in Arizona, we are focused on flipping the two seats in each chamber that will deliver Democratic majorities in Arizona’s legislature,” she added. “The only way to protect and expand reproductive freedoms in Arizona is to elect Democrats to the state legislature.” Abortion rights groups in the state are working to get a pro-choice amendment on the ballot. Although the state legislature has historically been hostile towards direct democracy actions, the coalition behind the amendment is optimistic it will be on the ballot in November. The amendment seeks to enshrine abortion access until fetal viability, or 24 weeks, into the state constitution.

Alongside re-posting a series of memes, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee wrote on his Truth Social platform: “Do you think that the Radical Left Lunatics that are causing all of the CHAOS at our Colleges and Universities are doing so in order to take the FOCUS away from our Southern Border, where millions of people, many from prisons and mental institutions, are pouring into our Country? Just askin’…???” While Fox News and other conservative outlets have often peddled the idea that protesters are “paid agitators,” Trump’s version — that pro-Palestine demonstrators are specifically covering for migration policy — hasn’t yet gained much traction on right-wing media. A wave of student protests washing over the country began when police first tried to end an encampment at Columbia University in New York nearly two weeks ago. Broadly speaking, activists are calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, and some are questioning university investments in companies that do business in Israel. Meanwhile, illegal immigration is seen as a growing crisis for the Biden administration — and an issue where Trump can score political points — as authorities both at the border and in cities nationwide have struggled to handle recent surges. Trump has also used the protests to downplay the Jan. 6 insurrection. Speaking on Tuesday, Trump said he feared pro-Palestine demonstrators could be treated more leniently than the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol. With court of session Wednesday, Trump is scheduled to make his first campaign stops since his hush money trial began, and is set to visit Waukesha, Wisconsin, and then head to Freeland, Michigan. Both states flipped from Trump to President Joe Biden in 2020, and remain on a knife-edge ahead of November’s vote.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/shooter-wisconsin-school_n_66327e86e4b0849b2eddf1a2,"Police Shot And Killed Armed Student Outside Wisconsin School, Authorities Say",todd richmond,5/1/2024,"MOUNT HOREB, Wis. (AP) — Police shot and killed a student outside a Wisconsin middle school Wednesday after receiving a report of someone with a weapon, the state’s attorney general said in the first law enforcement briefing on gunshots that sent children fleeing and prompted an hourslong lockdown of local schools. Authorities had previously said an active shooter who never got inside the building was “neutralized” outside Mount Horeb Middle School. State Attorney General Josh Kaul told reporters Wednesday evening no one else was harmed and that an investigation is ongoing. “This incident took place outdoors. The subject in this case never gained entry,” he said. Authorities described the student as a juvenile male but didn’t provide an age or indicate which of the Mount Horeb district’s schools he attended. Kaul declined to answer several questions about what happened once police responded, including whether the student had fired a weapon, what type of weapon he had, and whether he tried to get inside the school. Authorities said multiple Mount Horeb officers, wearing body cameras, had fired weapons but they did not say how many. Police remained on the scene hours afterward while students were kept locked down in buildings late into the afternoon before slowly being released to relatives. For panicked kids and their terrified parents, it was an anxious, unsettling wait. Parents described children hiding in closets, afraid to communicate on cell phones, and one middle schooler said his class initially fled the school gym on in-line skates. The district used Facebook posts throughout the day to give updates, with the earliest around 11:30 a.m. reporting all district schools were on lockdown. Authorities in Mount Horeb said the “alleged assailant” was the only person harmed, and witnesses described hearing gunshots and seeing dozens of children running. Several hours later, school buses remained lined up for blocks outside the middle school and police tape surrounded the middle school, the nearby high school and playing fields between both buildings. “An initial search of the middle school has not yielded additional suspects,” a post around noon said. “As importantly, we have no reports of individuals being harmed, with the exception of the alleged assailant.” Earlier, the district posted without elaborating that “the threat has been neutralized outside of the building” in Mount Horeb, a small village about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the state capital of Madison. Jeanne Keller said she heard about five gunshots while in her shop The Quilting Jeanne, just down the block from the middle school. “It was maybe like pow-pow-pow-pow,” Keller told The Associated Press by phone. “I thought it was fireworks. I went outside and saw all the children running ... I probably saw 200 children.” One middle schooler said his class was in the school gym practicing in-line skating when they heard gunshots. Max Kelly, 12, said his teacher told the class to flee. He said they skated to a street, ditched their in-line skates and ran to a nearby convenience store and gas station and hid in a bathroom. Kelly, shoeless, was reunited with his parents and sat on a hillside with them early Wednesday afternoon waiting for his younger siblings to be released from their own schools. “I don’t think anywhere is safe anymore,” said his mother, 32-year-old Alison Kelly. Police in Mount Horeb said they could not provide information in the immediate hours afterward. The Dane County Sheriff’s office directed reporters to a staging area but also provided no updates. Anxious parents spent hours thronging a bus depot waiting for their kids. Kaul said law enforcement had been concerned about the possiblity of a continuing threat though he didn’t provide more details. He said investigators sought to interview students as they were reunited with parents. Shannon Hurd, 44, and her former husband, Nathian Hurd, 39, sat waiting for their 13-year-old son, Noah, who was still in the locked-down school. Shannon Hurd said Noah texted her saying he loved her and she nearly fell down the stairs at her work as she rushed to the school. “I just want my kid,” she said. “They’re supposed to be safe at school.” Stacy Smith, 42, was at the bank Wednesday when she saw police cars rush by and got a text warning of an active shooter. She initially couldn’t reach her two children — junior Abbi and seventh-grader Cole. Finally, she reached Abbi by phone but the girl whispered she was hiding in a closet and couldn’t talk. She eventually connected with both and learned they were OK. “Not here,” she said in disbelief. “You hear about this everywhere else but not here.” Schools nationwide have sought ways to prevent mass shootings inside their walls, from physical security measures and active shooter drills to technology including detailed digital maps. Many also rely on teachers and administrators working to detect early signs of student mental health struggles. Mount Horeb Area School District Superintendent Steve Salerno suggested that without recent security upgrades “this could have been a far worse tragedy.” He said students immediately told school staff about seeing someone suspicious outside the building but did not elaborate. “It’s an experience that you just pray to God every day that you just don’t ever have to enter into,” Salerno told reporters. The village is home to around 7,600 people and the central office of outdoor gear retailer Duluth Trading Company. Mount Horeb markets itself as the “troll capital of the world,” a reference to carvings of trolls stationed throughout its downtown district. The next four years will change America forever.

The actor was having a casual chat about Frank Sinatra in an episode of the “Our Way with Paul Anka and Skip Bronson” podcast released Wednesday, when the conversation turned from the Rat Pack to Baldwin’s decadeslong sobriety after Anka asked if Baldwin was “a drinker.” “I don’t discuss this a lot, I discuss it every now and then when it makes sense,” he said. “I’m 39 years sober. I got sober Feb. 23, 1985. Because, as I tell people — and you’ll appreciate this — I was in Los Angeles in ’83, and I had a two-year, daily white-hot problem.” “Every day for two years, I think I snorted a line of cocaine from here to Saturn,” he continued. “We did one on the rings of Saturn, then we … took it back home. I mean, cocaine was like coffee back then — everybody was doing it all day long. I did a lot of coke.” The native New Yorker had yet to land major roles in “Beetlejuice” or “Working Girl,” which came to define his early silver screen career, when he decided to become drug-free. However, he revealed that he knew alcohol would become his newfound crutch after quitting drugs. “I stopped,” he told Anka. “And ’cause I stopped doing drugs, my drinking increased — which they tell you that’s going to happen — and that did happen. I just started drinking. And the thing I miss is drinking. I don’t miss drugs at all, but I do miss drinking. I like to drink.” Elsewhere in the interview, Baldwin talked about how he navigates turmoil while being sober. “New York relaxes me, I walk around and I see aspects of it that I’ve never seen before,” he said, adding, “I do try to meditate, but meditating with seven children is like trying to play ping pong on the deck of an aircraft carrier. It’s a real pain in the ass, man.” While he’d already curated a lengthy resume of public flare-ups and personal controversies for years, Baldwin only recently faced the most consequential incident of his life — when 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot on set during filming for “Rust” in 2021. Baldwin was rehearsing with a gun when the firearm went off, killing Hutchins and injuring Joel Souza, the director of the movie. Baldwin, who co-produced and stars in the upcoming film, has since been charged with involuntary manslaughter for the shooting and could face up to 18 months in prison if found guilty. He has pleaded not guilty and is set to go to trial in July. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

(Watch the video below.) The claim shocked host Jimmy Kimmel into concern for Seinfeld’s possible legal jeopardy on Tuesday’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Seinfeld wrote, directed and starred in “Unfrosted,” which debuts Friday on Netflix. It loosely chronicles the corporate race in the early ’60s to bring the toaster pastry to market. Kimmel asked the “Seinfeld” legend if it was true that he didn’t consult with Kellogg’s before making the movie. Seinfeld hemmed and hawed before saying, “No, I didn’t.” Kimmel noted the possibility that an injunction could halt a project that already cost millions. “It could happen,” Seinfeld replied. “But then I explained to them [Netflix] that if it does happen, think of the publicity that would be. We’ll be even bigger. The movie will be even bigger if I get hauled into court on Pop-Tart charges.” Kimmel snidely compared Netflix’s lawyer to former Donald Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. “We literally said, just write up a page that says it’s OK to make fun of stuff. First Amendment, parody rights — just throw a lot of that stuff in there,” Seinfeld said. The sitcom legend added that a Netflix official initially asked him if he had the proper rights and clearances, to which Seinfeld said he answered, “Oh, absolutely.” “They never checked.” Fast-forward to 7:25 for the Kellogg’s segment: Even if he’s fudging a little like some actual Pop-Tarts do, he’s Jerry Seinfeld for God’s sake. Besides, Kellanova, which is what Kellogg’s snack manufacturer is called now, appears to be on good terms with the comic despite the company acknowledging that it had no involvement in the movie. Seinfeld and the brand are partnering on a digital ad. “Jerry is probably our biggest fan,” Oli Morton, the general manager of portable wholesome snacks at Kellanova, told Fast Company.

During a surprise walkabout after an engagement in Newcastle upon Tyne, the Prince of Wales spoke with a concerned fan who asked how he and his family were doing. “Do you mind if I ask how you and the children are?” a woman in a Union Jack hat and cape asked the prince. “All doing well ― thank you. Yes, we’re doing well,” William answered in a clip captured by the Daily Mail, as the woman asked about William’s wife, Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales. “We’re all doing well,” William reiterated, before complimenting the woman’s companion on part of her patriotic outfit. Prince William gives an update on Kate and the kids pic.twitter.com/ZH63bi8zx1 It was the first update William has shared since Kate announced her cancer diagnosis in a March video, following months of speculation about her health. “In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was noncancerous,” Kate said in the video, adding that her surgery was “successful.” “However, tests after the operation found cancer had been present,” she explained. “My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy, and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.” Kate began chemotherapy in February. She did not specify what kind of cancer she has, or its severity. The palace said at the time that it would provide no further updates on Kate’s health. “The Princess has a right to medical privacy, as we all do,” a spokesperson said. William and Kate recently celebrated a happy milestone together, marking their 13th wedding anniversary on Monday with a never-before-seen photo. The black-and-white portrait was taken by photographer Millie Pilkington. “13 years ago today!” the couple captured their photo.

The “Thor” actor confirmed as much in a new interview with Vanity Fair published Tuesday, in which he revealed he’d actually named one of his sons after a character Pitt played in the 1994 movie “Legends of the Fall.” Hemsworth said he and his wife, actor Elsa Pataky, rewatched the film while she was pregnant with the couple’s twin boys. “Is this not the coolest character in the world?” Hemsworth said of Tristan Ludlow, Pitt’s character in the movie. “I think one of our kids needs to be named Tristan.” The two ended up naming one of their now 10-year-old twins Tristan. The other is named Sasha, after a friend who is a stuntman. Hemsworth and Pataky also share a daughter, India Rose Hemsworth, who is 11. The Marvel star previously made waves for a name that one of his sons called him in a video he posted on Instagram last year of them fishing together. In the clip, Hemsworth’s son called him by his first name as he attempted to reel in a fish. The actor didn’t specify which son is in the video.

The “Daily Show” host was seen standing courtside in Madison Square Garden in New York City, looking completely bewildered after Philadelphia 76ers guard Tyrese Maxey hit a three-point shot with just over 8 seconds left in the game, sending the two teams into overtime. Cameras caught Stewart, a dedicated Knicks fan, seemingly processing the turn of events. Prior to the last 28 seconds of the game, the Knicks were close to pulling out a win, which would have sent them to the second round of the NBA playoff series.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) said she’ll force a referendum on House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) — but not until next week. Greene has been dangling her ouster motion against Johnson since last month. At a press conference on Wednesday morning, HuffPost asked why she wanted to wait another week. “Everybody needs the weekend to prepare,” Greene said. Greene’s initial threat against Johnson last month failed to deter him from letting the House pass bipartisan legislation reauthorizing the government’s wiretapping powers and funding aid to Ukraine and other U.S. allies. And it’s only become clearer with time that the motion will fail, with few Republicans backing Greene and Democrats more than willing to bail him out. The extended delay does one thing, however – it maximizes attention on Greene, with even more reporters chasing her across the Capitol grounds than normal. Greene cast her hesitation as responsible rather than self-aggrandizing. “I’m not irresponsible. I care about my conference. I have been measured,” she said. “I have given this time. I have given warning after warning after warning. And that’s why we don’t have to rush. We can do it next week.” Acknowledging her motion would fail, Greene said it would be useful to force the vote so that voters could see Democrats back Johnson, whom she described as little more than a puppet for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). “I find it very satisfying that they are ready to vote for Mike Johnson,” she said. “I want to see it happen.” crazy scrum as MTG walks out of the Capitol in an uncharacteristic stoic silence pic.twitter.com/Ly3EzTdlLu Johnson, for his part, put out a forceful statement after Greene’s press conference: “This motion is wrong for the Republican conference, wrong for the institution, and wrong for the country.” As Johnson explained at a press conference last month, Greene’s demands that he refuse to cooperate with Democrats on legislation would only result in gridlock, not victories for Republicans, because Democrats control the Senate and the White House, meaning they have a legitimate say in the legislative process. Greene’s Republican colleagues, too, have seemed to tire of her antics. Only two lawmakers have publicly backed her stand against Johnson, and only one of them, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), came to her press conference on Wednesday. (Greene said the other one, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), had a scheduling conflict.) “There just isn’t the will amongst the conference to do something that drastic,” Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) told HuffPost on Tuesday. Republicans threw out their previous speaker, former Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), after he allowed bipartisan votes last fall. They had no alternative and went three weeks before finding Johnson after rejecting high-profile alternatives such as Reps. Steve Scalise (La.), Jim Jordan (Ohio) and Tom Emmer (Minn.). It’s even less clear now who Republicans could turn to next. The most recent items Greene and other far-right Republicans are upset about, a spying authority known as Section 702 and the Ukraine bill, passed with overwhelming bipartisan margins. The spying bill got 273 votes, with 126 from Republicans, while the Ukraine bill got 311 votes, with 101 from Republicans. It only takes 218 votes to pass something in a full House. A deal to avoid a government shutdown and fund the government through September also received broad bipartisan support, even as it angered Greene and others.

The piece begins with the sentence: “Donald Trump thinks he’s identified a crucial mistake of his first term: He was too nice.” “It sets the tone for the whole piece,” Calabresi told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “Which is: This is the same Donald Trump we’re all very familiar with.” “But he struck Eric Cortellessa, our reporter, and all of us involved in the piece, as more confident,” he continued. “That confidence, I think, comes from his own experience, but also from having a real plan for what he would do if he got in office. And it is, in some ways, designed to be tougher than last time.” Trump was interviewed twice in April for the article, once for over an hour at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, and a second time for 20 minutes over the phone on Saturday. Time published a transcript of the interview in addition to its article. It included some of Trump’s most in-depth comments yet about his aggressive plans for a possible second term. Among the most shocking: He suggested he could use the military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, and that states with abortion bans could monitor pregnant women to ensure they don’t terminate their pregnancies. He also suggested there wouldn’t be political violence in the November election if he wins ― but that “if we don’t win, you know, it depends,” he said. Asked if he would consider pardoning every single person sentenced over their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, Trump said he “absolutely” would. He also said he would consider firing a U.S. attorney who didn’t prosecute someone he ordered them to. The next four years will change America forever.

Rowling's Anti-Trans Crusade,marco margaritoff,5/1/2024,"Daniel Radcliffe is “really sad” about “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling and her vocal anti-transgender views. “It makes me really sad, ultimately,” Radcliffe told The Atlantic in an interview published Tuesday, “because I do look at the person that I met, the times that we met, and the books that she wrote, and the world she created, and all of that is to me so deeply empathetic.” “‘Harry Potter’ would not have happened without her, so nothing in my life would have probably happened the way it is without that person,” he added. “But that doesn’t mean that you owe the things you truly believe to someone else for your entire life.” Rowling continued her yearslong anti-trans rights campaign by sharing a list on social media last month of transgender individuals in order to mock a new hate-crime bill in the U.K. that gave them extra protections. After police said her posts were not criminal under the new Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act, Rowling wrote on social media earlier last month that Radcliffe and his former co-star Emma Watson, who has also vocally supported the trans community, “can save their apologies.” Rowling’s novels and their movie adaptations were a true phenomenon and made Radcliffe, who starred as the titular main character, a star. While he has used his fame to advocate for an LGBTQ suicide-prevention hotline known as The Trevor Project, however, Rowling grew into a staunch anti-trans voice. The writer argued against the term “people who menstruate” in 2020 and has doubled down on her opinions since then. Radcliffe said Tuesday he hasn’t spoken to Rowling since she first made her views known, but countered her comments at the time.

On Tuesday, Eric Trump became his first relative to support him in person in the courtroom. Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived Trump White House director of communications, suggested it showed the rest of the Trump family was embarrassed by the basis of the allegations. It also pointed to a bigger problem for the ex-president, he said. “Family members have said they’re not going to go work for him back in the White House. Melania is absent and I think this plays a bigger part of the story and it’s a bigger toll on him than people imagine,” Scaramucci said. “Whether you like him or dislike him, he worked with his family on real estate, he worked with his family on ‘The Apprentice,’ he brought his family into the White House,” he added. “They are not there with him, and I think that’s something that bothers him way more than anybody is letting on.” Watch Scaramucci’s comments here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

To be the best, you have to best the bees. pic.twitter.com/f2huVcpS0A The start of Tuesday night’s game between the Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers was delayed nearly two hours after a bee colony swarmed the top of the protective netting behind home plate. Matt Hilton turned into the star of the night for removing the bees, earning a brief slice of stardom and the nod to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. The @Dbacks rewarded beekeeper Matt Hilton with a ceremonial first pitch!He is pure electricity. pic.twitter.com/We6hMwOgBJ “Minor leagues to the big leagues now,” said Hilton, branch manager for Blue Sky Pest Control’s Phoenix office. “It’s pretty cool.” The buzz started about five minutes before first pitch. Mike Rock, the Diamondbacks vice president of baseball operations, got a call from the senior manager of events telling him a growing colony of bees was collecting atop the netting. “She doesn’t usually call me about that time. I knew something was odd,” Rock said. “She said we have bees landing on the net right behind home plate. I said, How many? And she said, hundreds — no way, thousands. And I knew we had a problem.” Bee swarms are common during the spring in Arizona and have caused numerous spring training delays through the years. A bee swarm also caused a lengthy delay in a match between Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, last month. Chase Field has a retractable roof, but it was open for Tuesday’s game, so the bees had free reign. Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts met with the umpires shortly after the delay began and the public address announcer told the crowd about the delay. Rock and his team had already put the bee-removal wheels in motion. Hilton was at his son Levi’s final T-ball game of the season when he got the call. He lives in Surprise, nearly 45 minutes from downtown Phoenix, so he quickly grabbed his beekeeping gear and hit the road. “There was zero traffic, thankfully,” Hilton said. At the stadium, the fans started getting antsy — bee-sy? — while waiting for a beekeeper to arrive, cheering as a grounds crew member wheeled a scissor lift onto the field and positioned it just below the bees. The sections behind home plate were cleared for safety reasons and Rock consulted with Major League Baseball on whether to wait or postpone the game. Hilton arrived about 70 minutes after the scheduled first pitch and pumped up the already-cheering crowd as he rode in on a cart from right field. Hilton suited up then rose toward the swarm, causing more cheers. With another quick wave to pump up the crowd, he stunned the bees with spray and started sucking them up with a shop vac as Bonnie Tyler’s “Holding Out for a Hero” blared through the loudspeakers. Hilton hit the last few stragglers with more spray before lowering back onto the field, pumping his fist as the crowd cheered again. The delay lasted nearly 90 minutes and was extended another 30 to make sure all the bees were gone and so the players could loosen back up. The Diamondbacks switched starting pitchers after the delay, from Jordan Montgomery to Brandon Hughes. Hilton had to switch gears while making a stadium call, getting a tap from the “bee-pen” to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. “I thought I was just going to do my thing and cruise out, but it was fun because of the thousands of people cheering for you,” he said. “It was a little nerve-racking, I’m not going to lie — a lot of pressure to get this game going.” Of course, he wore his beekeeper suit for the toss. The Diamondbacks won the game, 4-3. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Earlier this month, the combination of the two made for a stressful trip in an Amazon package, a feverish search, a California rescue and a tearful reunion. Her family is still waiting to “reintroduce cardboard to her again,” owner Carrie Clark said Tuesday, because they don’t want to stress her out. Clark got Galena as a kitten after her aunt rescued a pregnant feral cat. The American short hair with calico and Siamese coloring has been a constant companion and source of emotional support. “I’ve been through a bunch of health things and she and I have gone through all of that together. And she’s she just has this extra great part about her personality that’s very loving. And she can tell when you don’t feel well,” Clark said. “And she’s just really, really special to me.” So when Galena disappeared on April 10, Clark was beside herself. They searched the neighborhood, put up flyers and posted notices on Facebook lost pet pages in Lehi, Utah. “Not knowing what had happened to her was pretty excruciating,” Clark said, “I cried my eyes out for seven days trying to figure out what had happened.” Clark also ran through all the worst-case scenarios, wondering if the cat could have gotten out of the house and been nabbed by a predator or run over by a vehicle. Clark said she received a “text that changed my life” on April 17, saying that Galena’s microchip had been scanned, so Clark knew she had been found somewhere. Soon after, she got a call saying her cat was near Riverside, California, after being found in a box along with steel-toed boots that had been returned to an Amazon warehouse. Clark’s husband had ordered several pairs of boots, kept one and returned the rest in a large box on April 10. “We realized that our sweet kitty must have jumped into that box without us knowing,” she said. Amazon employees knew just who to call when they found the feline — co-worker Brandy Hunter, who rescues cats, Clark said. Hunter took the cat home and to the vet the next day, where the microchip was scanned. Clark spoke with Hunter who “calmed me down and told me that my kitty was OK,” despite having spent six days in a cardboard box without food or water. “I wanted desperately to be with her,” Clark said. She and her husband flew to California the next day, reunited with Galena at the veterinarian’s office and rented a car to drive home. “We did what we needed to do because I just adore her,” Clark said. It was an intensely emotional week. “I went from hysterically laughing that she was stuck like that — we mailed our cat — you know ... just the humor part of that, to hysterically crying all within like five seconds,” Clark said. The family was lucky to get Galena back, Clark said, in part because the weather was not harsh during the time the cat was missing, the box was torn at a seam, allowing her to get more air, and because Hunter who took her to a vet and had her scanned for a microchip.

Mike Kelly (R-Pa.), an outspoken critic of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, used the law to receive a grant to install solar panels at one of his car dealership locations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture gave a Uniontown dealership owned by Mike Kelly Automotive Group a nearly $315,000 grant to install a 261.9-kilowatt solar panel array, according to the Erie Times-News, the local news outlet that first reported the grant on Monday. The grant is set to save the firm $23,700 per year in energy costs, according to the USDA. The USDA distributed the grant through its Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). The program has existed since 2018, but the Inflation Reduction Act injected an additional $1 billion into the program dramatically expanding its scope. The federal government then announced that it would distribute that money in grants to rural businesses over the course of 2023 and 2024. In his official statement following the bill’s passage, Kelly derided the legislation that made those grants possible as the “so-called Inflation Reduction Act,” charging that it was “loaded with bad policy and wasteful spending that will ultimately worsen inflation, expand government, and hurt the middle-class.” His office singled out the bill’s climate provisions as damaging in bullet points accompanying the statement. “The bill provides $375 billion in so-called ‘climate change’ legislation, which include $7,500 tax credits for wealthy Americans to purchase electric vehicles (EV),” his office said. Asked how the grant squares with Kelly’s opposition to the IRA, Kelly spokesperson Matt Knoedler referred HuffPost to the statement he provided the Erie Times-News. “Representative Kelly’s energy policy has always supported an all-of-the-above approach,” Knoedler said. “Additionally, Rep. Kelly does not have an active role in the day-to-day operations of his family’s business.” In his 2022 financial disclosure, Kelly reported an ownership stake in Mike Kelly Automotive Group worth between $50,001 and $100,000, and a salary from the company of just under $30,000. Kelly also reported a “note receivable” from the company worth between $500,001 and $1 million. Mike Kelly Toyota, the dealership that got the grant, is located in GOP Rep. Guy Reschenthaler’s district south of the Erie-area seat that Kelly represents. Kelly has represented Pennsylvania’s northwestern corner since 2011 and has not faced a close re-election battle since 2018. Former President Donald Trump carried Kelly’s current district, Pennsylvania’s 16th, by nearly 21 percentage points in 2020. This year, Preston Nouri, a 25-year-old legislative analyst for the Department of Defense, is the Democratic nominee to take on Kelly. Nouri called on Kelly to return the money his family’s business received. “Mike Kelly shows his true colors once again,” Nouri said in a statement. “For over 13 years, he keeps getting caught with his hand in the cookie jar, taking taxpayer money to enrich himself while working against the interests of the people he’s supposed to represent.” The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/south-africa-baby-turtles-rescue-effort_n_66322cfce4b0849b2eddbc5f,Rescue Effort Underway After Storm Washes Hundreds Of Baby Sea Turtles Ashore,gerald imray,5/1/2024,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — An aquarium in South Africa is stretched beyond capacity after more than 500 baby sea turtles were washed up on beaches by a rare and powerful storm and rescued by members of the public. The little turtles are mostly endangered loggerheads and should be cruising the ocean. Most of them instead will spend the first few months of their lives in newly built plastic tanks at the Turtle Conservation Center at the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town. The aquarium is rehabilitating around 400 of the roughly 530 sick and injured turtles that were brought in, while sending the rest to two other aquariums to spread the load. Baby turtles have to fend for themselves from the moment they hatch on beaches and make their way to the ocean. In South Africa, loggerheads hatch on the northeast coast on the far side of the country from Cape Town. These turtles were likely sucked in by the warm Indian Ocean Agulhas Current, carried around the tip of South Africa and spat out in the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Town. That’s fairly common, said Talitha Noble-Trull, the head of the Turtle Conservation Center. She’s in charge of treating the new arrivals. What isn’t normal is the powerful storm that recently hit the Cape Town area, leaving hundreds of baby turtles needing help. The conservation center usually receives a few to maybe 100 stranded young turtles in the three to four months after hatching season. It has a normal capacity of 150 turtles. “What we haven’t seen before is over 500 turtles in two weeks, which is what the last little bit of time has brought us,” Noble-Trull said. “My budgeting plans for the year have really gone out the window.” She estimated that each turtle will cost $500 to get back to full strength before being released into the warmer Indian Ocean in a few months. The Turtle Conservation Center has brought in a small army of volunteers to help the aquarium’s full-time staff care for them. The turtles are ranked according to how sick they are, with some needing intensive care due to injuries, malnutrition or infection. A number is written on each shell to identify them. While the storm was a major shock to the turtles, who are vulnerable to extreme weather and climate change, it has given Noble-Trull and other conservationists a valuable insight into another increasingly common danger. Many of the turtles had ingested small pieces of plastic, which exited their systems after they arrived at the aquarium. Noble-Trull has a tray of plastic pieces collected in just one day, some as big as a fingernail. The next four years will change America forever.

Turtles spend almost all their lives in the ocean, apart from when they’re born and when females return to shore to lay eggs. Because of that, they’re “ocean indicators,” Noble-Trull said. “Little bits of soft plastic, little bits of hard plastic are floating all along the oceans and turtles are eating them.

On the same day 56 years earlier, the front page of Columbia’s student newspaper featured similar scenes of officers storming into crowds of students protesting the Vietnam War and proposed segregation policies. The Columbia Spectator, New York, Tuesday, April 30, 1968: https://t.co/4sNEDQ38Ks pic.twitter.com/2GO9MwUdx7 The resurfaced front page of the Columbia Spectator, which was posted on X (formerly Twitter) by Omar Jimenez, stated that on April 30, 1968, Columbia University called 1,000 police officers to end the demonstration at multiple buildings — including Hamilton Hall. The situation ended in nearly 700 arrests and 100 injuries. The front page photo shows police officers surrounding a professor outside a building on the campus. The caption states that law enforcement stomped and kicked protesters. On Tuesday, New York City Police Department officers on Columbia’s campus detained 100 people and cleared about 30 people from Hamilton Hall. Demonstrators had set up encampments on campus and occupied the academic building to protest Israel’s attacks on Gaza, which have killed more than 30,000 people since the militant group Hamas killed hundreds of civilians in October. The protesters demanded that the university divest from businesses that are profiting off Israel’s attacks on Gaza, and that the college increase transparency on their ties to Israel — a demand similar to that of yet another past set of protests on campus, when students in 1985 called for divestments from companies doing business with South Africa during apartheid. The university responded to Tuesday’s protest with an announcement that the NYPD will remain on campus until May 17, after the college’s graduation ceremony is set to take place.

The bizarre matchmaking attempt happened in 2001 when current “Way Too Early” anchor Lemire was interning for the New York Daily News and asked the future president a question at an event, he remembered on Seth Meyers’ “Late Night” show on Tuesday. Trump “looked at me, he looked next to me, he pointed at me and he pointed to the young female reporter next to me and was like, ‘Hey, are you two together?’” said Lemire. Lemire told Trump they weren’t dating. Trump reportedly replied: “Well, you both have red hair so I just assumed you guys were together.” Lemire at the time wondered if Trump thought “couples come color-coded.” After Trump finished talking to the press, Lemire said he called him over and told him: “You guys, really, you aren’t together? Well, would you want to be? I can make that happen.” Lemire “never saw that woman again in my life” and “did not take Donald Trump up on his matchmaking ability,” he told Meyers.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brennan-center-election-officials-poll-political-interference-threats_n_6631273ae4b0849b2edd303d,Nearly Two-Thirds Of Election Officials Worry Politicians Will Interfere With Their Work: Poll,matt shuham,5/1/2024,"Most local election officials fear for their colleagues’ safety and 62%, almost two-thirds, are concerned about politicians trying to interfere in how they or others do their work, according to a new poll conducted by the Brennan Center for Justice and released Wednesday. The poll, to which HuffPost was given early access, was based on the responses of 928 local election officials between Feb. 23 and March 28 this year and showed they have pervasive concerns about safety and political independence. Sixty-two percent of officials said they were either very or somewhat worried about “political leaders engaging in efforts to interfere with how you or your fellow election officials around the country do their jobs,” according to the poll. Thirteen percent were concerned they would face “pressure to certify election results in favor of a specific candidate or party.” As HuffPost has reported, election offices across the country have taken action to increase election security since 2020, when Donald Trump’s lies about the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s election inspired a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol and multiple attempts to overturn the results. Perhaps most notably, the poll found election workers faced shocking rates of threats, harassment and abuse. More than one in three respondents said they had been harassed and abused because of their work as a local election official, and 16% said they had been threatened. Of those that had faced threats, 61% said they had been threatened over the phone, and the same number had been threatened in person. What’s more, 70% felt that the level of threats had increased since 2020, 54% said they were either very or somewhat concerned about the safety of their colleagues or staff, and 27% said they were concerned about being assaulted at home or at work. Four in 10 officials said they were very or somewhat concerned about being doxxed, or having their personal information “published online with the intent to threaten [their] safety,” as the poll defined it, and 23% were concerned about being “swatted” — being targeted with a fake emergency call that sends a SWAT team to the victim’s home. In response to the wave of hate fueled by Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election, many seasoned election administrators and poll workers have left the field. Twenty-seven percent of election officials said they personally knew at least one or two election workers who’d left their jobs at least in part due to fear for their safety, increased threats, or intimidation — a 50% increase over 2023, according to the poll. The number who’d seen “many” election workers leave their jobs for those reasons doubled, from 4% to 8%. Those departures will likely continue after 2024: Twenty percent of respondents said they were unlikely to continue serving in the 2026 midterm elections. That shift in the elections workforce brings with it a drop in institutional knowledge: 2024 will be the first presidential election a quarter of election officials have worked, according to the poll. And nearly half of election workers told pollsters they were very or somewhat concerned that new local election officials might themselves believe in disproven conspiracies about election fraud. They have reason to be worried: Most Republicans believe falsely that the last presidential election was illegitimate. Election officials across the country are taking previously unheard-of steps to secure the elections process — including beefing up defenses against threats ranging from shootings to hacking attempts to fentanyl-laced mail. According to the Brennan Center poll, 92% of local election officials have taken at least some critical steps to increase election security since 2020. More than half, according to the poll, have implemented cybersecurity measures, including multi-factor authentication and unique log-in credentials for devices. Forty-four percent have updated polling place contingency plans, and 40% have enhanced the physical security of election offices or polling places. The next four years will change America forever.

The hypocrisy was not lost on commentators, who wondered where this outrage was when hundreds of Trump’s supporters laid siege to the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 election. Calling into Sean Hannity’s Fox News show, Trump praised New York police for clearing people from the university administration building on Tuesday night. Protesters had occupied the building in protest of Israel’s war on Gaza. “It should never have gotten to this, and they should have done it a lot sooner than before they took over the building because it would have been a lot easier if they were in tents rather than a building,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity in a phone interview. “And tremendous damage done, too. You know, when you look at that building, that’s a landmark, and it’s really been damaged badly by these people.” Photos from the university show broken windows and stacked furniture inside Hamilton Hall after police had cleared the structure of protesters, dozens of whom were arrested. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Trump: Tremendous damage done too. That’s a landmark and it’s really been damaged badly by these people pic.twitter.com/4NkVPLrV7w Earlier on Tuesday, speaking at the Manhattan courthouse where he is on criminal trial, Trump compared the Columbia situation to the Jan. 6 attack, and wondered if participants would face the same consequences. “They took over a building. That is a big deal,” Trump said of the pro-Palestinian protesters. “And I wonder if what’s going to happen to them will be anything comparable to what happened to J6, because they’re doing a lot of destruction, a lot of damages, a lot of people getting hurt very badly.” More than 1,200 people have been charged by the Justice Department in connection to the deadly Capitol attack, during which rioters ransacked the Capitol and assaulted police. According to the DOJ, the violence resulted in approximately $2.8 million in losses, including damage to the building and grounds, as well as costs carried by Capitol police. Trump has promised to pardon Jan. 6 defendants as a priority if he returns to the White House. Social media users were quick to point out the obvious: He didn’t say this on Jan 6. https://t.co/PE59xVRKy5 pic.twitter.com/xc1DTHkPqz https://t.co/E8CQx8ZRkT https://t.co/82nBqizL14 https://t.co/pDksYPGTH4 pic.twitter.com/zWZg5Gmlze I don't recall Trump saying that about the Capitol on January 6. https://t.co/vvsAak9VoE Somebody put this audio over J6 footage please. https://t.co/QQVQ9jVUNd Ironic him being angry and complaining about outsiders damaging a landmark building… https://t.co/IKBEiiQxxI His people literally smeared feces in the halls of the US Capitol. https://t.co/NcgrYFEl7c He must be really pissed about the US Capitol, then... https://t.co/XQaGC6WhlR The next four years will change America forever.

But the former president then struggled to back up his assertion when quizzed on the source of his statistic. Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee, ended an interview with Fox 2 Detroit anchor Roop Raj by saying: “One stat before we go. Venezuela was very crime-ridden. They announced the other day 72% reduction in crime in the last year. You know why? They moved all their criminals from Venezuela right into the good old U.S.A. and [President Joe] Biden let them do it. It’s a disgrace.” Raj asked Trump, “But sir, where are those numbers coming from?” Trump floundered in response: “Uhhh, I guess I get them from the papers in this case. I think it’s a federal statement or, well, they’re coming actually from Venezuela. They’re coming from Venezuela.” “We’ll have to check on that,” said Raj, whose full interview with Trump will air Thursday. FOX 2's Roop Raj one-on-one with former president Trump. Abortion, immigration, states-rights...a wide-ranging ""nothing off-limits"" interview Thursday on FOX 2. pic.twitter.com/uKIbgjm1oc Trump has made a similar claim about the effect that Venezuelan immigration to the U.S. is having on its own national crime stats before ― but with a different number. “Crime is down in Venezuela by 67% because they’re taking their gangs and their criminals and depositing them very nicely into the United States,” he told supporters at a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on April 2. PolitiFact, the nonprofit political fact-checking site, described that instance of Trump’s spin as exaggerated. The next four years will change America forever.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Some types of cleaning are simple: Think wiping down countertops, throwing your sheets in the washing machine, or scrubbing your dirty pots and pans. Then there’s the type of cleaning that’s so tricky it almost feels like it should be left to the professionals — getting particles out of your keyboard, dust and other gunk out of car vents, and minuscule crumbs out of cupholders. Luckily, I recently discovered a solution to this particular problem in the form of this car-cleaning putty, which currently costs less than $5 on Amazon. If you were a fan of Silly Putty, slime, or Play-Doh as a kid, you’ll love playing with this stuff, but you’ll also love the magic it works on so many of your devices. All you have to do is gently press this gel onto any dusty surface (like inside your car vents or cupholders), and slowly pull it off. The process is beyond satisfying albeit a little disgusting, and while this gel is technically meant for car detailing, that’s hardly its only use. It’s also perfectly safe for the tiny spaces between your keyboard, your cell phone, your remote, and other gadgets that tend to gather dust and debris in hard-to-clean spaces. Before you think you have to stock up on multiple jars of this putty, I have good news: You can reuse this putty over and over again until the color turns dark and it starts to lose its texture. Or, if you feel weird about reusing it, know that a little goes a long way, and you can pinch off pieces to use on different areas of your car or your gadgets. I’m not the only one who’s obsessed with this inexpensive electric blue goo — it also has hundreds of five-star reviews on Amazon. “I am pleasantly surprised this worked so well,” one reviewer wrote. “At first when I took it out of the package I thought... maybe it’s going to stick inside my laptop keys or wherever I was going to use it because it’s very loose feeling. It’s like a thick gel. But I tried it on my laptop keys and it worked fabulous. I used it in my car in the vents and it worked fabulous. I used it behind my stove knobs and it worked great. No gel residue was left behind. I would recommend this product.” Another reviewer stressed that this is a long-lasting product. “I hate dusting and rarely do it. But today, with this, I was really enjoying it. Like am I playing with a toy, or am I cleaning? Both,” they wrote. “And it goes a long way before becoming no longer usable. It’ll look a tiny bit dingy pretty fast but I used mine until it was black as tar and wouldn’t pick anything up anymore. And trust me that was a LOT of cleaning.” And if you’re craving that new car smell/feeling, well, this gel will be the answer to all your prayers. “The little bits of crumbs, dust and dog hair that accumulate in the boot around the gear shift, around the door handles, in little nooks and crannies in the car drove me crazy. (Especially when I have to share my car with hubby. You know what I mean),” a reviewer wrote. “This gets it! Give me a little vacuum cleaner and this goo and I can make my years-old car look good.” While you could always splurge on getting your car detailed, why not opt for this $5 putty instead? You’ll get a cleaner keyboard, remote, phone, oven knobs — and the list goes on — as part of the deal, too.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/until-august-posthumous-published-books_l_66301ef7e4b0eb5fda515566,"Gabriel García Márquez’s Final Novel, ‘Until August,’ Publishes Against His Wishes. Here's Why.",tessa flores,5/1/2024,"This story and interview originally appeared in HuffPost’s Books newsletter. Sign up here for weekly book news, author interviews and more. Released in March this year, “Until August” tells the story of a woman, Ana Magdalena Bach, who makes a yearly trek to her mother’s grave on a Caribbean island to not only lay flowers but to have extramarital affairs with different men. However, author Gabriel García Márquez, who passed away 10 years prior to the book’s release, wanted it to be destroyed and never read by anyone, let alone published. Regarded as one of the greatest Spanish-language authors of all time and best known for his novel, “One Hundred Years of Solitude,” García Márquez was worried that, given his battle with dementia, the book wasn’t at the caliber his fans had come to expect. His sons, the heirs to his final work, had a peculiar ethical choice to make: publish their father’s final novel for his audience or accept his wishes and destroy the manuscript. García Márquez’s sons, Rodrigo García and Gonzalo García Barcha, ultimately made the choice to publish, committing what they themselves called “an act of betrayal” in order to honor not only the late Colombian author but his fans as well. Although their decision ended up causing both controversy and intrigue in the literary world, aspects of this story go deeper than the clickbait notion of a monumental writer betrayed by his duplicitous sons. Following García Márquez’s death in 2014, his bequeathed literary estate included drafts and notes on the unfinished “Until August,” which were presented in various iterations to the public throughout the author’s life. In 1997, he even read aloud an excerpt, and in an interview with journalist Rosa Mora in 2004, he said he felt “quite satisfied” with the development of the protagonist, but not entirely with the book. As a known rewriter, it is possible that the book’s constant revisions became looped in an endless purgatory between García Márquez’s habit of perfectionism and his declining health. “That notion of a final text and of the author’s final intent is often a kind of illusory thing,” said Stephen Enniss, director of the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas, where much of García Márquez’s drafts, journals and belongings are displayed. “And the multiple drafts of an archive like the one here at the Ransom Center just underscore how fluid texts are and how many competing texts might actually exist for a given work.” Enniss went on to add that “the process of writing is a highly unstable activity, and many intense second thoughts can creep into drafting.” Joanna Reynolds, the CEO of The Folio Society, a publisher that works with many posthumously published titles, said that though it’s a sensitive subject, society would have lost a lot of major and influential works without the option of publishing posthumously. She pointed to books like Anne Frank’s “The Diary of a Young Girl” or Mikhail Bulgakov’s “The Master and Margarita,” which wouldn’t have made it past government sensors had there been a push to publish them while the authors were still alive. “It’s the job of each generation to reassess past works and to judge which should remain relevant. The creative act lasts well beyond the author’s death,” Reynolds said. We spoke with Rodrigo García, who is presently shooting a film, about his father and the publishing of “Until August.” The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity: Do you feel that the publishing process for “Until August” was respectful to your family and your father’s work? It’s a choice you have to make. Obviously, my father thought the book didn’t make sense, but we decided that the book was in better shape than he could probably judge. He never left a book unfinished. He either finished it and published it, or he destroyed it. So there were no works in progress. We thought the book, although not as polished or as important as many of his other books — and that, of course, is a high bar — was enjoyable. And we thought readers would enjoy hearing his voice one more time, and I think it has proven so. Was it respectful? The book was at the Ransom Center [where] it was already scanned and open for students and researchers to read, so it was already being read. A couple of pages had been photographed and published, and we were also worried that it could leak and be published in pirated editions in Latin America, which are not uncommon. But ultimately, it was our choice to make, and we feel a little validated by the fact that our father always said, “When I’m dead, do what you want.” It’s such a personal experience to have a family member dealing with dementia and mitigating their autonomy with the disease, and it puts you in a difficult position. How long was the discussion about deciding to publish “Until August” for you and your family? Yes, there was a process for my brother and me. We left the book untouched for 10 years. And then, after it was made public by the Ransom Center for researchers, we also read it again, and we thought it was better than we remembered. Our best guess is that our father, because of his dementia, lost the ability to judge the book. If he had not lost that ability, he would have either finished it or destroyed it. What made you believe that the book was ready to be published or that it was as complete as it could be? I think, mostly, readers have been thankful to hear his voice for one last time. And the question if audiences should view it as a complete reflection or compare [it] to his other work? I think the book should be viewed as a work of his, and it’s very characteristically his. It still has many of its flourishes, his descriptive powers, and a very interesting female character at the center of it, which is rare for him. He has great female characters, but never one as the principal character of a novel. And we thought it was good and a feminist piece. And not just for that reason, but we thought everything taken together made a good addition to his canon — however unpolished it was in the end. These are things you have to decide on your own. It’s set a little bit in a more contemporary world, or at least closer to our time. My father’s books usually happen in a kind of rarified space, a place that seems a little bit out of time. A kind of Colombia in its own bubble. And again, yes, it was written with declining mental health, but I think it fits into the canon of his writing and his obsession with love stories and his obsession with the subjects of sensuality, sex and matrimony — subjects that he’s touched on in different ways and in many of his books. So I think this one adds to it. This interview was done by Emily Bond, HuffPost Books contributor. Keep reading to see a list of other posthumously published books.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tablet-phone-stand-for-bed_l_662fef8ae4b0c9bc8758691d,Stare At Your Screen Hands-Free With The Help Of This Affordable Gadget,tessa flores,5/1/2024,"HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Anyone that values modern invention and its ability to add ease and comfort to your daily life would be remiss to overlook one of the internet’s most recent gadgets that could possibly change the way you lounge and view your favorite content. A tablet and phone stand, specifically this well-rated one that we chose to feature here, is essentially a fully customizable arm that can hold your chosen device, be it your Kindle or iPhone, so you can watch it completely hands free in virtually any position. It essentially works by attaching to any number of surfaces like a countertop, table’s edge or bed headboard, using an manually tightening base so it’s secure without the need for permanent installation involving drill and screws. Then the three-point-bending flexible arm, which is attached to a 360-degree rotating socket, can be moved to hold your screen wherever you need it. This kind of adjustability means you can scroll social media while lying on your side or read your e-book in bed without having to hold a tablet. Or, if you’re someone that often finds themselves scrolling through a recipe on your phone in the middle of preparing a meal, this can make things a lot less cumbersome. According to reviewers, it might also mean a reduction in neck pain caused by looking downwards at their phones for too long or straining in odd positions to view a television screen. And for a completely hands-free operation that doesn’t involve you lifting an arm to control your screen, there are Bluetooth remotes you can purchase, which connect with Smartphones and tablets. Most of the popular “entertainment stand” options that we could find online were either just for phones or for tablets, but this one claims to be universally compatible with a variety of both — from iPhones to Androids to iPads and even Nintendo Switches. It also doesn’t use the commonly found “gooseneck” design which can be prone to drooping under the weight of a device over time. The tablet stand’s maker says that the device is made with durable materials like aluminum and an alloy base. Several reviewers back up this claim, with one user stating that they use “this sturdy piece of hardware” to hold up a portable HDMI monitor. While installation of this stand isn’t permanent by any means, you can leave it in place and just fold it down flat when not in use, or detach it completely and neatly store it until later use. Before the next crick in your neck appears or you find yourself wishing for a more comfortable way to binge your favorite television show, grab this a-little-over-$20 tool that one reviewer claims was the “best $20 I’ve ever spent.” Promising Amazon reviews: “Best $20 I’ve ever spent to improve my quality of life. I love falling asleep to a show on my iPad but never had a good way of propping it up in bed. This is the perfect solution! It is easy to push out of the way when not in use.” — Jennifer Walton “I used to have a gooseneck holder for when I read in bed, but after 2yrs it got worn out and wouldn’t stay up anymore. So when I went searching for a new adjustable holder, I was excited for this one since it’s all metal with springs.The main clamp fit over my thick headboard and I was able to screw it on tightly. The arms also have knobs that can be tightened to better secure the angle you’d like, which I appreciated. My iPad fits snuggly into the end clamp - I used to have the gooseneck holder clamp onto the sides of my iPad, but this one is too large for that so it clamps onto the top and bottom of my iPad. There are holes on the clamps that allow me to still charge my iPad even while it’s behind held. I haven’t tried it with my iPad case on, but that might work if you don’t like to constantly switch between having a case on and not.Besides the part that clamps onto my headboard and the part that holds my iPad, everything else was assembled when it arrived in the box (thank the gods), so I didn’t struggle with any screws or whatnot.” — Nicole Brown (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review.) “I absolutely love this thing! It works beautifully for me. I read some complain that it is cheaply made and breaks easily. Anything can break if you try to force it to do something it’s made not to do. Took me a while to figure out how to bend and adjust the right way. Once I did that, I can’t believe how great this thing is. The only concern I had was the clamp that attaches to headboard. My headboard is wood and thick. But once I attached it, it worked great. I would recommend this if you like reading in bed. Works perfectly for my Kindle, have not tried it on my Ipad yet. But I really love this thing and would recommend.” — John “I wasn’t expecting much, but this is a sturdy piece of hardware. I’m using this to hold up a portable HDMI monitor, which is probably both heavier and larger than this was designed for. I have to tighten the screws to max, but it holds it in place just fine. Attached it to my headboard and hooked it up to my PC, and now I can use my PC while lazing about in bed.” — Dayne By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Even if you minimize your on-the-go items as much as possible, the real dilemma is that your travel essentials — typically your phone, wallet and keys — at minimum — are also some of your most valuable belongings. While the honor code method — where you simply leave your belongings unattended and trust your fellow beach- or vacation-goer to do the right thing — might work for some, I’d propose that there is a happy medium, where some security precautions can be taken. This can take three forms, in my view: one, waterproof pouches that you can take in the water with you; two, portable safes you can store your items in while you go have fun; and three, decoy cases made to look like something else (like a hollowed-out book) that secretly house your belongings. What works best for you is based on the individual and the situation at hand. We’ve rounded some of the best beach and poolside security products for you to check out, below.

Nobody would be thinking this could happen. You look at the antisemitism, the hatred of Israel by so many people.” “You go back 10 years, I mean Israel was protected by Congress,” he continued. “And now, Congress is just doing numbers that are unbelievable with I think a very, very small group of people within Congress and it’s gotta stop. But we have to go back to the roots. We have to protect, we have to stop the antisemitism that’s just pervading our country right now and Biden has to do something.” Trump also claimed there were “paid agitators” among the protesters, said some are “brainwashed,” insisted that Israel needs to “clean out the cancer,” and accused President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) of not being supportive of Israel. The former president spent much of the day in court, where his criminal trial in the Stormy Daniels hush money case continues ― and where he reportedly dozed off during the proceedings again.

Dale, talking to Jake Tapper on “The Lead,” highlighted the presumptive GOP nominee’s contradictory complaints about Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the proceedings. Trump, who is accused of falsifying business documents to conceal an alleged hush money payment to silence porn actor Stormy Daniels about their alleged affair, moaned that Merchan is “rushing this case through,” noted Dale. But Trump also claimed that “someone said to him, ‘I’ve never sat this long in court before,’” Dale added. Trump is “simultaneously complaining — like, literally almost in the same breath — the judge is making this go too fast and also is making it go too slow,” said Dale. Tapper agreed and likened it to conservatives who claim President Joe Biden is a “doddering, senile old fool who is also at the same time a criminal mastermind operating all of these different trials.” “I mean, pick a lane,” said Tapper. “Fair,” said Dale. “Yeah, it’s a ‘pick a lane.’” Watch the full fact check of Trump’s claims here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The lengthy interview is “Trump in his own words saying these scary things,” said Griffin. “It is devastating to me that this is not resonating with Republicans, a party I’ve been a member of my whole life, that they’re just not believing it,” she continued. “The things he says, we should take literally.” Former Trump aide Griffin: I read this TIME interview with Trump.

On Tuesday’s broadcast of Anderson Cooper’s “AC360” show, a panel discussion turned to the latest developments in the case against Trump and in particular the testimony given by lawyer Keith Davidson about his role in the hush money that Trump allegedly paid to porn actor Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election to keep quiet about their earlier alleged affair. Trump is accused of falsifying business documents in a bid to cover it up. Davidson detailed the aggressive nature of Cohen when it came to defending his then-client Trump and remembered how Gina Rodriguez, Daniels’ publicist, once referred to Cohen as “some jerk” in a telephone call to him. Collins commented, “Trump’s attorney, I should note, was grinning at points when Keith Davidson was testifying that. I never saw Trump himself laughing. But even Trump’s team was laughing. I mean, everyone who knows Michael Cohen, knows how Michael Cohen is.” The moment “did kind of prompt a round of laughter in the courtroom,” she added. Cooper, however, noted that Cohen, who was sentenced to prison for his role in the hush money scheme and has now become a vocal critic of his former boss, will be called as the prosecution’s main witness.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/medical-gaslighting-doctor-sneaky-signs_l_66310bd5e4b0c558f741d4a7,5 Sneaky Signs Your Doctor Is Gaslighting You,anika nayak,5/1/2024,"Gaslighting, the term used when someone in power manipulates another person to doubt their own judgment, can manifest in medical settings. “Medical gaslighting involves patients’ symptoms and lived experiences being dismissed by medical providers and explained away with incorrect diagnoses,” said Alyssa Burgart, a physician, bioethicist and clinical director at Stanford School of Medicine. “This can mean questions, tests and diagnoses that fit a biased pattern, rather than addressing the patient’s actual symptoms.” Patients who are gaslit in clinical settings often experience delays with their medical treatment, missed diagnoses, and overall worsened health outcomes. This disproportionately affects women and people of color, who may experience greater distrust as a result. Medical gaslighting can be so subtle that you may not even notice it happening as you are seeking care. Here, we spoke to experts about the subtle signs of medical gaslighting and what to do if you suspect it’s happening to you: If your provider doesn’t listen to your medical concerns and constantly interrupts you when you’re describing your symptoms, that’s likely a red flag. Providers should be an engaged listener and validate your feelings. According to Burgart, all care providers ― including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and nurses ― can do this to patients. “Medical gaslighting is when people in an institution or people in a position of medical power are denying the patient’s reality,” said Julie Cantor, a physician, lawyer and entrepreneur. This may feel like your questions are often being dismissed or ignored, resulting in you not receiving answers you wanted. For instance, your provider may be questioning if you actually feel a certain way and downplaying any pain you may experience. Sometimes, a provider may indicate that your symptoms are the result of your negligence or actions. They may be passive aggressive, disrespectful or condescending toward you. Even if your symptoms or condition have nothing to do with action or inaction, the provider may be gaslighting you into believing that you caused your current state. Regardless of how your condition came to be, it’s a red flag for them to delay care and blame you. Your provider may blame your symptoms on mental illness, but you may not be referred to a specialist or be screened for a mental health condition. “If you’re quickly diagnosed with anxiety, stress or another mental health condition, this may be gaslighting,” Burgart said. This can happen frequently, especially with women, even if your symptoms don’t align with the traditional issues associated with anxiety. A provider who’s a generalist and doesn’t know much about your symptoms or condition should at least point you in the direction of a specialist who can provide you with specific care, Cantor said. Failing to provide a referral to a specialized provider, or not ordering lab work or key imaging can be a form of gaslighting, she explained. Receiving medical care should never be a taxing, stressful process. Spot the signs of medical gaslighting and ask any questions you may have. It may be helpful to take notes during your appointment and compare them to the note that your provider took at the time of your visit. Try to advocate for yourself with your existing provider first, as it may result in you feeling more heard, seen and validated. “If you suspect your concerns are being dismissed, ask your clinician to repeat back to you what they understand about your symptoms,” Burgart said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/outercourse-for-better-sex-life_l_662ae6abe4b09d8df9d5f778,Want A Better Sex Life? Then It's Time To Embrace 'Outercourse.',kelsey borresen,5/1/2024,"When we talk about sex, often we’re really referring to intercourse. But there’s so much more to a satisfying sex life than just penetration. And when we broaden our definition of sex to be more inclusive, there’s a whole world of pleasure to be gained. That’s where “outercourse” comes in. “Outercourse is really an umbrella term for a wide variety of sexual activities that don’t involve any type of penetration,” clinical sexologist and sexuality educator Lawrence Siegel told HuffPost. It’s “a way of increasing sexual passion and eroticism,” he continued. “Any rubbing, touching, kissing or caressing that doesn’t involve any part of one body entering any part of another. It can also involve mutual masturbation, scissoring and dry humping.” (That being said, what constitutes outercourse may vary person to person. For instance, some people believe fingering and oral sex are examples of outercourse, while others do not.) What many people call foreplay would be considered outercourse. But when we refer to all of these sexual acts as just foreplay, it reinforces the idea that penetration is the main event. In reality, these pleasurable activities can be a satisfying sexual experience on their own, even when they don’t lead to intercourse, Siegel said. According to sex educator and podcast host Chris Maxwell Rose, “Outercourse can include any way we touch, lick, stroke, stimulate and turn-on the biggest organ in our bodies: the skin,” she said. “So many of us experience touch hunger — and the remedy is full-body, affectionate touch.” Erotic massage is another example of outercourse that can “provide deeply satisfying, highly erotic experiences with touch alone,” said Maxwell Rose, who is also the founder of PleasureMechanics.com. Outercourse can even include cuddling and spooning, which “foster closeness and a sense of security,” said sex therapist and clinical psychologist Nazanin Moali. It can also include talking openly about your sexual fantasies, “which allows partners to connect on a deeply personal level,” Moali, host of the “Sexology” podcast, told HuffPost. Once you get to a certain age or reach a certain stage in your relationship, having sex often means a bit of rushed foreplay as an appetizer before moving on to the intercourse entree. Outercourse can break up dull or repetitive patterns you may have fallen into in the bedroom, opening up new or forgotten pathways to sexual pleasure. “Many of us remember the very beginnings of our sexual discoveries, even the very beginning of our relationships that started with making out and getting ‘felt up’ or ‘feeling up,’ and how exciting that was,” Siegel said. “Outercourse can really be what helps build a level of passion that creates powerful orgasms.” Outercourse also pushes you to be more sexually creative and connect with your partners in more intentional ways, “helping people explore sexual pleasure and stimulation beyond the genitals,” said sexologist and sex educator Goody Howard. Embracing outercourse can also be great for folks who have arousal issues, Moali said — some of whom might avoid sex entirely because of these problems. Same goes for people with certain health conditions or physical limitations that take penetrative sex off the table. “Within many heterosexual relationships, sexual encounters often commence with an erection and culminate in ejaculation,” she said. “Consequently, erection difficulties can result in a complete withdrawal from sexual activities.” Additionally, outercourse is a safer — but not entirely safe — alternative to penetrative vaginal, anal and oral sex in terms of both risk of pregnancy and STIs. First, take some time to reflect on one of your best sexual experiences. Think about what you felt before, during and after. This will help you tap into what Moali calls your “core erotic emotions.” “For many, consistent themes make sex memorable and exciting. For some, this could be the thrill of being desired, for others, a sense of shame, and for others still, it’s about power exchange,” she explained. “Identifying your core desire is akin to discovering the genre of the novel you’re writing. As an author, you can enrich this experience by incorporating elements that heighten the specific emotions you wish to explore.” This exercise will help you zero in on the sexual narratives and types of outercourse that might be most fulfilling to you. Exploring outercourse can also be an opportunity to start a dialogue with your partner (or partners) about your fantasies, what you enjoy in bed, and any personal boundaries around things you’re not comfortable with, too, Siegel said. “Talking about experiencing and understanding different types of touch can contribute greatly to experiencing better intercourse,” he said. Treat this exploration as a way to expand your sexual horizons, Siegel said. Slow things down so you can focus on intimate acts like kissing, cuddling and touching each other’s bodies in different and intentional ways. “Use massage and genital rubbing through the clothes; try slipping up from behind while they’re brushing their teeth or doing dishes, or other ‘safe’ times when they don’t expect it,” he said. “Incorporate mutual masturbation into your sex play, both with and without sex toys. Even simulated intercourse, like sliding a penis between a partner’s thighs, breasts or butt. This can be a wonderful entree into experimenting with more ways to pleasure yourselves and each other.” Try to get out of your head and put aside preconceived notions about what sex “should” be so you can discover what feels fun and pleasurable for you and your partner. “It might be awkward at first to remain clothed when connecting to sexual pleasure, especially if you’re used to being naked and ‘going all the way,’” Howard said. “But don’t be afraid to try something new. My suggestion is to start fully clothed and remove clothing as desired, but not removing any bras or underwear.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-okra-water_l_662a6702e4b005d7bf0cceb3,TikTok Claims ‘Okra Water’ Can Clear Your Skin And Lube You Up — Experts Have Thoughts,leigh weingus,5/1/2024,"The wellness world has always been rife with questionable-sounding trends, and the rise of TikTok has only added fuel to the fire. The latest wellness trend everyone’s talking about on the social media platform is okra water, which promises smoother and clearer skin, a more efficient digestive system, better lubrication, a more balanced vaginal pH, and the ability to nourish the body with vitamins and minerals that it can be difficult to get enough of. But how legit is okra water, anyway? Does this slimy liquid really have health benefits, or is it just the latest “here today, gone tomorrow” wellness trend? We asked registered dietitians — here’s what they had to say. First, what is okra water, and how do you make it? “Okra water is water you drink after soaking okra for 24 hours,” explained Amy Goldsmith, a registered dietitian at Kindred Nutrition. “To make okra water, you cut five to six pieces of okra into smaller pieces and add them to an airtight container, like a Mason jar, with 16 ounces of water.” After letting it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours, you can strain it and drink it. Sophie Lauver, a registered dietitian at Aeroflow Diabetes, added that while Goldsmith’s recipe is a great blueprint, okra water is very new, and there’s not necessarily an “official” recipe. “The goal is for it to take on a thicker, gel-like texture due to okra’s mucilage,” she said. Like most trendy wellness waters, proponents of okra water claim it can do everything from balancing vaginal pH to curing acne. It’s hard for registered dietitians to say what the exact benefits of okra water are because it hasn’t been around long, but Lauver said the only evidence we really have about okra water’s benefits has to do with the health benefits of okra as a vegetable. “We do know that okra is a very nutritious vegetable and is rich in soluble fiber, which can help improve blood glucose and reduce cholesterol,” Lauer said. “Its insoluble fiber helps keep things moving through our digestive tracts, reducing the risk of colon cancer, constipation and other gastrointestinal problems.” Lauver added that some studies have shown that the consumption of okra or okra capsules can improve blood sugar control and that it’s a superfood when it comes to the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants namely, vitamin K, C, magnesium, calcium and B vitamins. “There’s also substantial evidence to show adequate hydration and a high intake of fiber-rich vegetables reduces the risk for chronic disease, so consuming more vegetables is only beneficial for overall health,” Lauver said. With that in mind, Goldsmith pointed out that it’s unlikely you’re getting many of the benefits of okra from okra water since you’re not actually ingesting the vegetable. “A lot of the nutrient properties reside in the skin and cells of the vegetable,” she explained. “However, since you are drinking the water it does have a positive effect on your daily hydration goals.” As for the claim that okra water can balance vaginal pH and make you more lubricated down there, Goldsmith and Lauver don’t see a lot of evidence to support that. While okra water is unlikely to have tons of health benefits, it probably won’t hurt you either — unless you’re allergic to okra, that is. And if you’re using it as a type of “cleanse,” that can cause problems as well. “It’s important to note that this drink provides very few calories,” Goldsmith said. “If you’re drinking okra water as a meal replacement or in an attempt to reduce calories you will put yourself at risk of not getting enough fuel in a day, which will negatively affect your mood, cognition, focus, sleep and more.” Another risk, according to Lauver, can come from adding sweeteners to your okra water in an effort to make it more palatable. “The added sugars and calories could have an unintended effect, especially with implications for weight management and glucose control,” she said. “And as with any dietary changes, contact your doctor and a registered dietitian to see whether this choice is right for you.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/passport-mistake-travel-experts_l_6626fd0ce4b00ea555a498e4,"The 1 Big Mistake You Should Never, Ever Make With Your Passport",caroline bologna,5/1/2024,"A couple of years ago, I was invited to attend a friend’s July wedding in his wife’s hometown in northern Italy. As the date approached, I remarked to another friend who was also planning to travel from the U.S. for the celebration that I was glad I had just renewed my passport since it was due to expire in May. She responded cheerfully that she was all set because her passport wouldn’t expire until September. She was mistaken. My friend was not all set because Italy, as part of the Schengen Area of European countries, requires visitors to have a passport that is valid for at least three months beyond the date they intend to depart. Fortunately, she was able to expedite her passport renewal and make it to the wedding, but her situation highlighted a fairly common misconception about international travel. “A lot of us just think we need a valid passport to travel the world beyond our borders, but what many people don’t realize [is] that a current passport alone might not be enough,” said Katy Nastro, a spokesperson for the flight alert service Going. Indeed, many countries require your passport to have a certain duration of validity remaining beyond the intended dates of your trip. The most common lengths are three and six months past the date you fly back to the U.S. “A lot of countries, namely in Asia and the Middle East, require six months’ validity beyond your travel dates ― meaning if you take a trip to Vietnam in July, for example, your passport needs to be valid up until at least January,” Nastro explained. “If you arrive at the airport and try to get on your flight, some airlines won’t even let you board without this very important bit of time, in which case you run the risk of not being able to take your trip.” Each country has a different timeline for passport validity, so international travelers need to familiarize themselves with these policies before booking a trip. “Some may require three months, while others may require six months or even more,” said David Alwadish, the founder and CEO of the passport and visa concierge service ItsEasy.com. “When some countries also require a visa and grant a multiyear paper visa, they may require at least one year or more [of] validity.” The specific requirement depends on a variety of factors, including the country’s immigration policies, bilateral agreements and security risk considerations. “Therefore, it’s crucial for travelers to thoroughly check the entry requirements of the specific country they plan to visit to ensure compliance with passport validity regulations,” Alwadish emphasized. He and Nastro have both observed a lack of understanding around passport validity rules. “It’s common for people to be unaware of the three- or six-month passport validity rule, particularly among those who don’t travel frequently or haven’t encountered it before,” Alwadish said. “The rule may not be consistently enforced across all countries, causing misconceptions among travelers. The complexity of immigration policies, which can change, adds to the challenge of staying informed. Lastly, passport validity requirements may not be well-publicized, leading to lower awareness among travelers.” “These requirements ensure that visitors have a valid passport for the duration of their intended stay, as well as for a buffer period in case of unexpected delays or extensions,” Alwadish explained. You might’ve planned a two-week sojourn in the South of France, for instance, but maybe after a few days you realize that you actually want to stay for two months. Or perhaps something happens that’s out of your control. “This is mainly out of precaution,” Nastro said. “Let’s say you fall seriously ill or have an accident and then need to stay in that country longer than intended. If your passport expires during this unplanned time, it can cause a mountain of issues upon trying to exit the country.” The period of passport validity for international tourists provides an extra cushion in case you sustain an injury that precludes you from flying for a while, or you delay your return for other personal reasons. The point is to account for the fact that plans might change. “Countries set a minimum of three or six months of passport validity for foreign visitors to facilitate efficient immigration procedures, bolster security measures and improve emergency management,” Alwadish said. “This ensures that visitors have a valid travel document throughout their stay and can respond effectively to unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, these requirements promote fairness and reciprocity in visa policies, fostering balanced relationships between countries.” The specific duration varies from country to country, and not every destination has these requirements. “For example, the Mexican government only requires that your passport is valid during the entirety of your trip versus after the trip,” Alwadish said. “For a lot of folks, it’s not an issue since you get 10 years out of a passport,” Nastro said. “When you realize it’s the year your passport expires, however, you actually might be running against a six-month clock depending on where you are traveling to. It makes sense to just go through the renewal process sooner rather than later.” She recommended renewing your passport a year before it’s due to expire so that you know it’s all taken care of early. “With expedited processing and wait times at record lows, you’ll most likely see a new book back sooner than expected,” Nastro added. When it comes to passports and other important travel documents, advanced planning is the name of the game. “While some countries enforce uniform rules for all foreign visitors, others may have different requirements depending on the visitor’s nationality or specific visa agreements,” Alwadish said. “It is so vital that travelers check the entry requirements of their destination country to understand any variations based on nationality.” He recommended reviewing an embassy or consulate website in your home country for the place you want to visit. Most provide detailed information about entry requirements for foreign visitors. You might also consult the State Department’s website or travel advisories from the immigration authority at your destination. Once you have that information, compare your passport expiration date with your planned travel dates. “To cross-reference with the country’s validity rules, start from the day you return and add the number of months required for the validity,” Alwadish said. “The rule is usually three to six months from the day you return, not from the day you leave.” Make sure to check the rules of the airline you’re flying as well, especially if you only have four or five months of validity after the date you return home.

Merchan said locking Trump up “may be necessary” if he keeps attacking witnesses, jurors and others linked to the case. “I don’t know if it’s necessary for Trump,” Colbert said. “But I need it.” Merchan ordered Trump to remove the social media posts that violated the order and fined him $9,000. “$9,000 may not seem like a lot to a successful businessman,” Colbert said. “But what about to Trump?” The former president likes to portray himself as a successful businessman when, in fact, many of his ventures ― from a casino to steaks ― have flopped.

The gun fired did not appear to be aimed at anyone and no one was injured, said Doug Cohen, a spokesperson for Bragg’s office, who said the office’s Police Accountability Unit is reviewing the shooting, which it does as a matter of policy. Cohen said no students and only police officers were in the immediate vicinity when the shooting occurred. Rumors of the shooting had quickly spread among students, but had not been confirmed until Thursday. A video posted to X by student Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine Tuesday night showed a police officer texting, “thought we fucking shot someone.” The gun discharge is the latest revelation about the highly-militarized NYPD action to break up a Pro-Palestinian student demonstration at the campus that been going on since April 17. In multiple television and radio appearances, as well as a press conference Wednesday morning, Mayor Eric Adams praised the NYPD’s “precision policing” and made no mention of the shooting. During the raid, police blocked press access to that raid almost entirely, though they released a highly-edited, flashy video of dozens of officers storming the campus, breaking through barricaded doors and locks of the occupied hall, where demonstrators had barricaded themselves into early Tuesday morning. In one clip, officers entered one Hamilton Hall room with weapons drawn. The video also shows officers using “flash-bangs,” or stun grenades. “It’s pretty unusual to use flashbangs for something like this absent some intel about a serious threat to officers,” said a veteran law-enforcement official. “I’ve never seen them used for search warrants involving guns, let alone some barricaded college kids.” A spokesperson for the NYPD didn’t immediately return a request for comment. Ben Chang, a spokesperson for Columbia University, declined to comment, deferring to the NYPD. The next four years will change America forever.

On Thursday, the disgraced actor blasted the network and its forthcoming “Spacey Unmasked” series in a lengthy message on X, formerly Twitter. “Over the last week, I have repeatedly requested that @Channel4 afford me more than 7 days to respond to allegations made against me dating back 48 years and provide me with sufficient details to investigate these matters,” wrote Spacey, whose career in Hollywood was derailed following accusations of sexual abuse by multiple men. “Channel 4 has refused on the basis that they feel that asking for a response in 7 days to new, anonymized and non-specific allegations is a ‘fair opportunity’ for me to refute any allegations made against me,” he continued. The former “House of Cards” star went on to say he “will not sit back and be attacked by a dying network’s one-sided ‘documentary,’” calling it a “desperate attempt for ratings.” “Each time I have been given the time and a proper forum to defend myself, the allegations have failed under scrutiny and I have been exonerated,” he added. He noted that his response to the series will be available on his X account this weekend. Representatives for Spacey didn’t immediately reply to HuffPost’s request for comment. The “American Beauty” actor’s fiery message comes after Channel 4 released a trailer for “Spacey Unmasked” last week. The two-part docuseries looks at Spacey’s “spectacular fall from grace ... amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior” and “talks to multiple men ... about their experiences with Kevin Spacey, almost all of whom have never spoken before,” according to an official description. In 2023, a jury acquitted the Oscar winner of sexual assault in a four-week trial in London. Spacey had faced nine charges related to alleged incidents dating back to 2001, including multiple counts of sexual and indecent assault and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. Earlier this year, Spacey agreed to pay $1 million to the production company behind “House of Cards” to settle an arbitration case related to sexual harassment claims involving crew members Spacey, who was dropped from the hit show in 2017, was originally ordered by a judge to pay $31 million. “Spacey Unmasked” is set to air in the U.K. on Channel 4 on Monday and Tuesday. It will also be released in the U.S. on the streaming service Max. A streaming date has not yet been announced.

Taylor-Joy showed up to the Australia premiere of her new film, “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” on Wednesday in full warrior mode, wearing a sheer, gold chain-linked mini dress and headpiece that were both pierced with dozens of spears. The piece is from Paco Rabanne’s spring 1996 couture collection, according to Vogue. Taylor-Joy’s vintage look included arrows in the front and back of her outfit, just like it was originally shown on the runway. Naturally, the over-the-top ensemble spiked social media users’ interest on X, formerly called Twitter, with people poking fun at Taylor-Joy. kind of obsessed with Anya Taylor-Joy's Boromir cosplay pic.twitter.com/GtknxXSS1z welcome back boromir son of gondor https://t.co/RG2L7l4XMz ""They took the little ones..."" https://t.co/JcFgD8Lu6H Walking out of the ancient temple after triggering every single trap on my way out https://t.co/tRud4VjmsK I feel bad for the people sitting behind and next to her during the screening.

Taylor-Joy, who plays the role of Furiosa (previously portrayed by Charlize Theron), donned a halter-style studded mini dress that bore a resemblance to car tires at CinemaCon last month. It seems like Taylor-Joy is particularly proud of the upcoming movie. In a recent Entertainment Weekly cover story with “Furiosa” co-star Chris Hemsworth, Taylor-Joy spoke about her experience working on the film. “I wanted something that was going to challenge my body and soul, and it was definitely that,” she said. “I think I was surprised.

In an interview with People magazine published Thursday, the “View” co-host recalled how her mother, Emma Harris, was hospitalized for about two years following a mental breakdown. During that hospitalization, which began when Goldberg was 8 years old, Harris underwent electroshock therapy that wiped her memory to the extent that she had no recognition of her two children, Goldberg and her older brother, Clyde Johnson. “My mother at one point when I got older … said, ‘Can I tell you a secret?’ I was like, ‘Sure,’” Goldberg told the outlet. “She said, ‘I didn’t know who you were when I got out of the hospital.’ It’s like, ‘I’m sorry, what? I’m sorry, what?’ She said, ‘Yeah, I had no idea who you were.’” Though Goldberg didn’t specify when this discussion took place, she noted that Harris “didn’t tell anybody” about her experience for decades. “I said, ‘So you carried this for 40 years?’ She said, ‘Well, what else was I going to do?’” Goldberg said. Elsewhere in the chat, the Oscar winner opened up about how her mother’s hospitalization impacted her and Johnson. “Living without my mother, who was always my world, who had always been that center of gravity. Suddenly the center of gravity wasn’t there,” she said. “If I needed information, I was to ask somebody, explain why I was asking and do all the things that I would do with her when she was not there.” Harris died in 2010 at age 78. Five years later, Johnson died at age 65. Due out next week, Goldberg’s memoir, “Bits and Pieces: My Mother, My Brother, and Me,” is billed as “a moving tribute from a daughter to her mother, and beautiful portrait of three people who loved each other deeply.” When announcing “Bits and Pieces” in January, Goldberg told People the book was a reflection on “my mother and my brother and our time together as a small, funny little unit” in New York. “It’s dedicated to anyone who’s found themselves on a scary path not of their choosing or dealing with loss,” she said.

Chris Hemsworth made a rare remark about his brother, Liam Hemsworth, and the rollercoaster romance with Miley Cyrus on Tuesday’s episode of Vanity Fair’s lie detector series. During the interview, the “Avengers” alum was asked if he was upset that his brother got the leading role in “The Last Song” instead of him. The question was a loaded one, being that Cyrus and Liam met and quickly began dating on the set of the 2010 film — which led to an on-and-off relationship that spanned about a decade. In response to the question, the “Thor: Ragnarok” star was quick to say “no” — but couldn’t help but make a crack about how much of an impact that movie had on his brother. “The world — Liam’s life would’ve been very different without ‘The Last Song,’ right?” Chris quipped. Cyrus and the “Hunger Games” alum first began dating in 2009. The two got engaged for the first time in 2012 when she was just 19 and Liam was 22. Then they split in 2013 before eventually rekindling things in 2016.The couple announced they were engaged for a second time later that year, and tied the knot in December 2018. By August 2019, the two had split for good. It is speculated that Cyrus’ 2023 hit “Flowers” was about the joy of being single after her long romance with her ex-husband. Chris Hemsworth’s joke about his brother’s love life wasn’t the only time his famous sibling was mentioned during his Vanity Fair interview.

A gag order hearing during Donald Trump’s first criminal trial in New York went a bit sideways Thursday morning, as Trump attorney Todd Blanche entered into the record a series of tweets mocking his client ― drawing laughs from the courtroom. Blanche was attempting to persuade Judge Juan Merchan that Trump should be able to defend himself from such attacks, even if they’re made by witnesses in the former president’s hush money case. But the argument didn’t quite land. One series of tweets from former Trump fixer Michael Cohen repeatedly employed a nickname for Trump, “Von ShitzInPantz,” which Blanche read aloud for those in attendance — including his client. Todd Blanche displays a string of exhibits of Michael Cohen taunting Trump in tweets and retweets throughout April. Cohen's nickname for him, ""Von ShitzInPantz,"" has entered the public record. Blanche also said that Cohen had retweeted an edited image of Trump as a pudgy, bright orange superhero named “Super Victim,” with the image sparking laughter in the courtroom. “Everyone can say what they want in this case except President Trump,” Blanche asserted. Not buying the argument, Merchan fired back: “They’re not defendants in this case. That’s a very significant issue you’re overlooking.” Thursday’s hearing concerned the prosecution’s belief that Trump has violated a gag order four times since Tuesday, when the court found him in contempt for nine such violations.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/arizona-gov-hobbs-abortion-ban-repeal_n_6633f746e4b0fc2b9528cd29,Arizona Governor Signs Repeal Of 1864 Near-Total Abortion Ban,lydia o'connor,5/2/2024,"Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a bill to repeal the state’s near-total ban on abortion on Thursday, weeks after the state Supreme Court ruled that the 1864 statute could go into effect. Hobbs held the signing ceremony a day after the state Senate approved the measure to repeal the abortion ban by a close 16-14 margin, with the support of two Republicans. “I’ve heard from doctors who were unsure if they would wind up in a jail cell for simply doing their job, women who told me they didn’t know if it was safe to start a family here in Arizona,” Hobbs said Thursday. “These excruciating conversations are exactly why I have made one thing clear, very clear: This ban needs to be repealed.” But even with Hobbs’ signature, the ban will remain in place for some time. It’s slated to take effect June 27, but the repeal Hobbs signed will not override it until 90 days after the end of the current legislative session. That end date is not predetermined, but last year’s session continued through August. Following news of Hobbs’ signature, President Joe Biden’s campaign slammed Donald Trump for his role in overturning Roe v. Wade — and paving the way for the Arizona ban — by appointing conservative U.S. Supreme Court nominees. The campaign also lamented that the 150-year-old law will be in effect for even a short time. “Thanks to Donald Trump, Arizonans continue to live under an extreme abortion ban, even after Democrats repealed his ban from 1864—and we won’t forget who’s responsible,” Jen Cox, a Biden campaign official in Arizona, said in a statement. “Earlier this week, Donald Trump made it clear he’s totally fine with states monitoring women’s pregnancies and prosecuting women and their doctors. I can tell you this: Women in Arizona are not okay with that and will reject Donald Trump and his allies once again.” Hobbs emphasized at Wednesday’s signing ceremony that the fight to protect abortion access is not over. “Today, we should not rest,” she said. “We should recommit to protecting women’s bodily autonomy, their ability to make their own health care decisions and the ability to control their lives.” Organizers behind a ballot measure enshrining abortion protections in Arizona’s constitution said last month they’d collected enough signatures for the measure to appear on the November ballot. Their signatures await verification from the Arizona secretary of state’s office. For now, abortion rights advocates are celebrating a big win with this week’s legislative action. “We are so proud of Governor Hobbs, and our reproductive freedom champions in the legislature for fighting hard and fast to repeal this archaic and cruel abortion ban,” Reproductive Freedom for All President and CEO Mini Timmaraju said in a statement. “This is what happens when we elect reproductive freedom champions up and down the ballot; they protect our fundamental rights and freedoms.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Nick Fuentes, the 25-year-old leader of the America First “Groyper” movement, was banned from Twitter in 2021 for “repeated violations” of the rules. Fuentes attended the deadly 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and was also at the Jan 6. 2021, Capitol attack, encouraging his supporters to take over the building. On Thursday, Musk said he planned to reinstate Fuentes’ account on X, formerly Twitter, after a “Groyper” account with a blue check mark asked Musk to bring Fuentes back. Very well, he will be reinstated, provided he does not violate the law, and let him be crushed by the comments and Community Notes. It is better to have anti whatever out in the open to be rebutted than grow simmering in the darkness. “Very well, he will be reinstated, provided he does not violate the law, and let him be crushed by the comments and Community Notes,” Musk said. “It is better to have anti whatever out in the open to be rebutted than grow simmering in the darkness.” As of Thursday afternoon, Fuentes’ account still appeared to be suspended. Along with his virulent antisemitism, Fuentes has also called rape “not a big deal,” and in a 2022 livestream defended being an “incel,” or involuntary celibate while also bringing up Adolf Hitler. “All I want is revenge against my enemies and a total Aryan victory,” Fuentes said. Fuentes has routinely praised Hitler, favorably comparing Russian President Validmir Putin to the dictator during a 2022 white nationalist conference. “Now, [the media is] going and saying, ‘Vladimir Putin is Adolf Hitler,’ as if that isn’t a good thing,” Fuentes said during the conference, HuffPost reported at the time. “Oops, I shouldn’t have said that.” And in January 2023, he praised Hitler as “really fucking cool.” “‘Hitler was a pedophile and kind of a pagan,’” Fuentes mimicked critics of the dictator. “Well, he was also really fucking cool, so you know, time to grow up.” He added that “this guy’s awesome, this guy’s cool.” Fuentes also joined the antisemitic presidential campaign of rapper Ye, and had dinner with Ye and former President Donald Trump in 2022. Following Musk’s announcement, dozens of accounts with purchased blue checkmarks celebrated Fuentes’ expected return. A request for comment to X was met with an auto-reply: “Busy now, please check back later.” Fuentes was previously reinstated to the website last year, but was banned again one day later. Though Twitter didn’t clarify his return or suspension at the time, a reporter for the Southern Poverty Law Center said Fuentes praised Hitler and the Unabomber in a Twitter space, at one point saying that “Jews run the news” before he was banned again. Musk, who has been bleeding advertisers since be bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, has faced criticisms for endorsing several antisemitic conspiracies. Musk was also recently deposed in a lawsuit after he falsely accused a 22-year-old Jewish man of being a federal agent involved with a neo-Nazi group. The next four years will change America forever.

In a post on X, Musk defended his reasoning to bring back Fuentes. “I cannot claim to be a defender of free speech, but then permanently ban someone who hasn’t violated the law, no matter how much I disagree with what they say,” Musk posted. “This will probably cause us to lose a lot of advertisers and makes me sad, but a principle is a principle.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He’s facing 34 criminal counts in the case, brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. For the past three weeks, reporters in attendance have noted that Trump occasionally closes his eyes and appears to fall asleep. The New York Times’s Maggie Haberman reported on April 15, the first day of the trial, that Trump “appeared to nod off a few times, his mouth going slack and his head drooping onto his chest.” Similar reports have come out since the trial’s start. He’s even been nicknamed “Sleepy Don” by Kate Bedingfield, former communications director to Biden, a clapback to Trump’s “Sleepy Joe” moniker. A possible source of his alleged sleepiness? According to former Trump strategist David Urban, it could be a lack of Diet Coke during courtroom hours. “He’s trying to make light of the situation a little bit and say, look, I’m not sleeping — although, I have to say, sitting there for hours and hours and hours without a Diet Coke, it’s probably killing him,” Urban said, according to Raw Story. Trump is notorious for drinking around 12 Diet Cokes per day, which would equate to about four cups of coffee, according to Vanity Fair. “He’s usually, I’m sure, very caffeinated during the day,” said Urban. “I’m sure he’s missing probably about ten [Diet Cokes] a day. It’s probably rough.” Alina Habba told Fox News’ Martha MacCallum at the start of the trial in April that it was “unlikely” the former president had fallen asleep, saying he’s been “incredibly focused.” “If anything, he’s probably brutally bored,” she said. On Wednesday, Trump went to Truth Social in an attempt to flip the narrative back onto President Joe Biden. “Where’s SLEEPY JOE? He’s SLEEPING, that’s where!!!” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

One side of the four-lane highway in the city of Meizhou gave way about 2 a.m. on Wednesday after a month of heavy rains in Guangdong province. Twenty-three vehicles fell down a steep slope, some sending up flames as they caught fire. Construction cranes were used to lift out the burnt-out and mutilated vehicles. Officials in Meizhou said three other people were unidentified, pending DNA testing. It wasn’t immediately clear if they had died, which would bring the death toll to 51. Another 30 people had non-life-threatening injuries. The search was still ongoing, Meizhou city Mayor Wang Hui said at a late-afternoon news conference. No foreigners have been found among the victims, he said. Search work has been hampered by rain and land and gravel sliding down the slope. The disaster left a curving earth-colored gash in the otherwise verdant forest landscape. Excavators dug out a wider area on the slope. “Because some of the vehicles involved caught fire, the difficulty of the rescue operation has increased,” said Wen Yongdeng, the Communist Party secretary for the Meizhou emergency management bureau. “Most of the vehicles were buried in soil during the collapse, with a large volume of soil covering them,” he said. He added that the prolonged heavy rainfall has saturated soil in the area, “making it prone to secondary disasters during the rescue process.” Over 56 centimeters (22 inches) of rain has fallen in the past four weeks in the county where the roadway collapsed, more than four times as much as last year. Some villages in Meizhou flooded in early April, and the city has seen more rain in recent days. Parts of Guangdong province have seen record rains and flooding in the past two weeks, as well as hail. A tornado killed five people in Guangzhou, the provincial capital, during rain and hail storms last weekend. The highway section collapsed on the first day of a five-day May Day holiday, when many Chinese are traveling at home and abroad. The next four years will change America forever.

The former president attempted to deny claims that he’s had a hard time staying awake during his hush money trial, writing on his Truth Social platform that he’s not snoozing in court but simply closing his “beautiful blue eyes” and listening “intensely” to the proceedings. Trump’s supposed excuse for closing his eyelids was brutally mocked on social media, including from reporters who were observing him in the courtroom. “Trump is closing his ‘beautiful blue eyes’ again,” reporter Adam Klasfeld posted on X, formerly Twitter, adding that it was “presumably to take in the finer technical points of data extraction of digital evidence being not-so-dramatically recounted by the forensic witness.” Trump is closing his ""beautiful blue eyes"" again — presumably to take in the finer technical points of data extraction of digital evidence being not-so-dramatically recounted by the forensic witness. pic.twitter.com/6NNCJ0B2vq Other reactions to the post were brutal.

On Wednesday’s episode of “The Drew Barrymore Show,” the talk show host reflected on a story by British outlet The Independent about millennial women keeping lists on their phones of people they’ve had sex with. Barrymore was all too eager to share her experience on the matter with her co-host, Ross Mathews, and their news desk guests: Tony Dokoupil, Nate Burleson and Vladimir Duthiers, the co-hosts of “CBS Mornings.” “I made a list. It was back in the day,” she said. “I did it with paper and pen. I’m the most disorganized person, I lose everything. I left it at someone’s house.” Barrymore went on to reveal that the person was none other than DeVito. The “Charlie’s Angel” star explained that at the time of the faux pas, she was producing and co-starring in the legendary actor’s 2003 film “Duplex.” Barrymore said she wrote her list, which contained the first and last names of her ex-partners, on the back of some notes about the film, but she lost track of it in DeVito’s abode. The actor said she ultimately “did admit” to DeVito that she lost her “sex list” at his house after he appeared on her talk show. “He came on the show, and I was like, ‘I left my sex list at your house,’” Barrymore said. It turns out she had nothing to worry about after DeVito made light of the awkward slip-up while stopping by Barrymore’s show in September 2022. After asking the “Batman Returns” star if he ever stumbled across her list, he joked, “As a matter of fact, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about this. Some of the names on that ... I made a copy of it, and it’s going to be in my autobiography.” “No, I never came across it,” he admitted. “I never saw it.

The two sides said Thursday that they are “now working expeditiously to return music by artists represented by Universal Music Group and songwriters represented by Universal Music Publishing Group to TikTok in due course.” Taylor Swift, whose recently released album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” has hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, had some of her songs make a return to TikTok last month, but the details of how that exactly happened are unclear, according to Variety. UMG said in January that it had not agreed to terms of a new deal with TikTok, and planned to stop licensing content from the artists it represents on the social media platform that is owned by ByteDance, as well as TikTok Music services. At the time, UMG had been pressing TikTok on three issues: “appropriate compensation for our artists and songwriters, protecting human artists from the harmful effects of AI, and online safety for TikTok’s users.” TikTok pushed back against the claims by UMG, saying that it had reached ‘artist-first’ agreements with every other label and publisher. On Thursday the two sides announced that their new agreement would give significant benefits to UMG’s global stable of artists, songwriters and labels and would return their music to TikTok. “Music is an integral part of the TikTok ecosystem and we are pleased to have found a path forward with Universal Music Group,” TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in a statement. “We are committed to working together to drive value, discovery and promotion for all of UMG’s amazing artists and songwriters, and deepen their ability to grow, connect and engage with the TikTok community.” Part of the new deal includes UMG and TikTok working together to find new monetization opportunities. They will also will work together on campaigns supporting UMG’s artists across genres and territories globally. In addition, the companies will put their combined efforts toward ensuring that AI development across the music industry will protect human artistry and payments for artists and songwriters. TikTok will also work with UMG to remove unauthorized AI-generated music from the platform, as well as on tools to improve artist and songwriter attribution.

Some tools include “Add to Music App”, enhanced data and analytics, and integrated ticketing capabilities. “We’re gratified to renew our relationship with TikTok predicated on significant advancements in commercial and marketing opportunities as well as protections provided to our industry-leading roster on their platform,” Michael Nash, chief digital officer and executive vice president, Universal Music Group, said in a statement. While TikTok has settled its dispute with UMG, the future of the platform remains uncertain. Last month President Joe Biden signed legislation requiring TikTok parent ByteDance to sell to an approved buyer within a year or to shut down. It’s not clear whether that law will survive an expected legal challenge or that ByteDance would agree to sell.

Her prison cell’s toilet was merely a hole in the ground and she had to use one of her ripped-up T-shirts as toiler paper. She said her bed and uniform were far too small for her 6-foot-9-inch frame, showing Roberts a pair of extra-long pants her cellmate custom-made her because she was so cold. The basketball star, who was detained at a Moscow airport in February 2022 when authorities found a small amount of cannabis oil in her luggage, said things got worse when she was transferred to another correctional colony. Her cell there was filled with “dirt and grime” and “bloodstains,” she said, adding that she was fed porridge “that was more like cement,” was allowed one roll of toilet paper a month and was given toothpaste that had expired 15 years earlier. Often, she recalled, she was left outside in the bitter cold Russian winter for hours at a time. Her locs froze, she said, and spiders built a nest in her hair. “I didn’t think I could get through what I needed to get through,” Griner said, adding that she considered taking her own life but worried Russian authorities wouldn’t return her body to her family. “I can’t put them through that. I have to endure this,” she recalled thinking. Griner said she will no longer play overseas, despite highly lucrative basketball opportunities in Russia that dwarf WNBA pay. But she will make an exception to compete in the Paris Olympics this summer. “I mean, the country that literally came and saved me and gave me back my life, to be able to go and represent for that same country and bring home gold ― that would be the icing on the cake,” said Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist. The United States secured Griner’s release in a rare prisoner exchange after she was given a nine-year sentence for drug possession. Russian officials agreed to free her, but would not agree to the release of former Marine Paul Whelan, who’s been detained since 2018 on suspicion of spying for the U.S. Paul’s continued detainment saddens Griner. “No one should be left behind,” she told Roberts. Evan Gershkovich, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, has also been in Russian custody for the past year, despite demands for his release from President Joe Biden. He’s been held there on accusations of espionage, despite having full press credentials from Russia’s foreign ministry.

Spears and Sam Asghari submitted an agreement for dividing up their assets to a judge for approval, according to documents filed in a Los Angeles court on Thursday, nine months after they separated. The filings gave few details but said neither Spears nor Asghari will get future spousal support. Asghari had said in his initial petition that he would seek financial support. Any future disputes would need to be settled in private arbitration. A judge is likely to sign off on the stipulated solution soon and declare both of them single. Emails seeking details or comment from lawyers for both Spears and Asghari were not immediately returned. The two had no children together, so no custody agreement was necessary. Spears wrote in her memoir published last year that she and Asghari had a miscarriage early in a pregnancy about a month before they married. The 42-year-old pop superstar and Asghari, a 30-year-old model and actor, separated in July, about 13 months after they married and seven years after they began dating.

Baldwin once called Paul McCartney an “asshole” to his face, the actor admitted on a podcast on Wednesday. As Baldwin explained, he and a group of friends — including, along with McCartney, painter John Alexander and “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels — attended a regular yoga class together. One day, Baldwin said, he realized “the only one who was really adept at yoga” was McCartney. “He would do a handstand or a headstand and he had the most lithe body you’ve ever seen — and back then he was in his late 60s — and he was so fit,” the actor recalled on Wednesday’s episode of the “Our Way with Paul Anka and Skip Bronson” podcast. “One time he does a headstand before he leaves, and he gets up and whispers to me,” Baldwin continued. “He goes, ‘I’m gonna go take my daughter to lunch. I’ll see you guys later.’ I looked up at him after he does the headstand and I go, ‘You’re an asshole.’” Baldwin has known McCartney for decades and once even interviewed him about his treasured personal friendship with late Beatles member John Lennon — so he could get away with being a little rude. “I never thought I’d call one of The Beatles an asshole, but he was just always showing us up with his physical skills!” he said on the podcast. “He was a very fit guy.” Baldwin also recalled their group christening themselves the “Yoga Boys.” McCartney once shared his memories of that time, as well as a photo of his handstand technique, on his website.

The 32-year-old, who became widely known for her involvement in the 2015 murder of her abusive mother, Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard, discussed some of her recent experiences on a panel at An Evening With Lifetime: Conversations On Controversies FYC Event in Los Angeles, California, on Wednesday. “I’m very much an introvert. And so coming out and this media storm hit me, and I was... At first, I really, really was touched by the positivity that people were showing me,” Gypsy Rose Blanchard told People magazine editor-at-large and panel moderator Janine Rubenstein. “And then, as social media began, and how it always does, it turned negative. It started to have a negative effect on my mental health.” Blanchard, who shut down her public Instagram and TikTok accounts in March, later said during the panel event that she “got back into” social media and learned not to read the comment sections. “I’m just trying to live my life in the best way that I can,” she added. In 2016, Blanchard pleaded guilty to second-degree murder after she admitted to persuading her then-boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, to kill her mother. Dee Dee Blanchard was suspected to have had an undiagnosed case of factitious disorder, formerly called Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The psychological disorder can cause caregivers to “falsely present others, such as children, as being ill, injured or impaired,” the Mayo Clinic states. Gypsy Rose Blanchard was released on parole in December after serving eight years of a decade-long prison sentence. In March, she announced her separation from her husband, Ryan Scott Anderson, whom she married while behind bars in 2022. She has since confirmed that she has rekindled her romance with her ex-fiancé Ken Urker. She told TMZ this week that their “love for each other is simply undeniable.” She added, “Life is too short to not take a chance.” Her new Lifetime series, “Gypsy Rose: Life After Lock Up,” is set to premiere on the network next month.

Blunt recently told Howard Stern about the “best thing” the “Fortnight” singer said to her daughter, 9-year-old Hazel, when the two got to meet. “She’s the nicest,” the “Fall Guy” actor said during an interview on “The Howard Stern Show” on Monday, and she offered up a sweet example of Swift being kind to her kids. “My oldest kid has just cut all of her hair off ― this very short haircut that she was very self-conscious about,” Blunt said. “And Taylor Swift goes, ‘God, look at you! You’re just like this ‘60s beatnik cool kid. I just ― I love your style.’” Blunt said she “thought my child was going to faint.” “It was the best thing anyone’s done for my child,” the Oscar winner added. “That’s so sweet that she did that,” Stern said. While the radio host joked that Blunt had to keep her kids “level” considering they were meeting people like Swift, Blunt said that “it’s quite normalized” for them. “I think they’ve been around a lot of people in this job. And I think they’re relieved, often, to meet children of people in this job,” she said. “Because it’s like a secret language of understanding how weird it is that their mom is known, you know?” The one thing her daughters find “weird,” however, is people approaching their famous mom. “They don’t like it when people come up to me,” Blunt said. “They don’t like it because people’s energies can be quite intense.” The “Oppenheimer” star recently shared that she’s taking a year off of acting due to the “emotional cost” of not spending as much time with her children when she works. Along with Hazel, Blunt has another daughter with Krasinski, 7-year-old Violet. “I worked quite a bit last year, and my oldest baby is 9, like, we’re in the last year of single digits,” Blunt said on Bruce Bozzi’s “Table for Two” podcast last year.

Congress passed a law at the end of 2022 designed to make it easier for organizations such as universities to obtain cannabis and study its potential medical uses, an enterprise hobbled for years by marijuana’s illegality at the federal level. Loosening restrictions on cannabis research was so obviously worthwhile that the law, sponsored by legalization-friendly Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and prominent pot skeptic Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 325 to 95, and the Senate approved it without even bothering to count votes. Blumenauer said that as far as he can tell, however, the administration has done nothing to streamline the process for approving cannabis research. “It’s embarrassing,” Blumenauer, who is retiring at the end of this Congress, told HuffPost. “I’ve seen no evidence that they’re at work to make this research go much more smoothly. I mean, this not low-hanging fruit — this is picking it up off the ground. It just mystifies me.” The law also required the Department of Health and Human Services to submit a report to Congress detailing “the potential therapeutic effects of cannabidiol or marijuana on serious medical conditions,” the effects of marijuana on “on the human body and developing adolescent brains,” and barriers to research in states that have legalized marijuana. The Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act, enacted in December 2022, gave HHS a year to submit its report, but the department has yet to do so. Blumenauer and Harris complained about the blown deadline and the continued research obstacles in a March letter to agency heads but received no response. Spokespeople for HHS did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for the White House and the Drug Enforcement Administration, required by the law to simplify procedures for registering pot researchers and manufacturers, also did not respond to requests for comment. The Biden administration has undertaken a historic review of whether marijuana belongs in the same category of illegal drugs as heroin and LSD, with The Associated Press reporting this week the DEA would reclassify cannabis as a less dangerous substance, stopping short of legalizing it. The move to “reschedule” marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act represents an effort by the federal government to catch up to public opinion on marijuana, which a majority of Americans say should be legal for medical and recreational purposes, and which a majority of states have legalized for one or the other. At the same time, Blumenauer said, the government’s apparent refusal to give greater leeway to researchers shows the bureaucratic inertia against a more enlightened view of cannabis. “That’s part of the bureaucracy with the failed War on Drugs. They’re so invested in hurdles and problems,” Blumenauer said. “It’s extraordinarily frustrating, and it’s a symbol of what’s wrong with federal cannabis policy.” Republicans in Congress have refused to go along with Democratic efforts to legalize weed, but medical marijuana remains a political middle ground. That’s why Harris, who has blocked the Washington, D.C., government’s efforts to set up a regulated marijuana industry in the capital city, was willing to do the research bill. He said he was “deeply disappointed” that the law had not been implemented in line with congressional intent. “While there is evidence to suggest that medical marijuana may be beneficial in the treatment of some diseases like glaucoma and epilepsy, only scientific research will prove the veracity of the many claims regarding efficacy for other diseases,” Harris said. Conducting clinical trials to measure the efficacy of marijuana as a medical treatment requires approvals from HHS and the DEA, which the agencies have refused to grant even in cases where state governments have funded studies into the potential benefits of cannabis for military veterans. Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said the Blumenauer-Harris law has had no noticeable impact on the marijuana research landscape. He faulted the law itself for adding a requirement the U.S. attorney general sign off on research applications. “Unfortunately, while I think some folks were acting in good faith when they were supporting that bill, it was so watered-down by the end that I was not convinced it was going to lead to any significant major changes, and I don’t think today it has,” Armentano said. Armentano also noted, however, that a lot is already known about the effects of cannabis on the human body, including through a plethora of observational studies. The National Academy of Sciences reported in 2017, for instance, that there’s strong evidence cannabis can relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea in cancer patients and that there’s no statistical association between cannabis use and lung cancer.

(Watch the video below.) Hathaway was talking up her chemistry with co-star Nicholas Galitzine when suddenly she blurted out to the crowd, “Has anyone here read the book?” The silence, as they say, was deafening. Hathaway appeared stunned. “No, we don’t read,” host Jimmy Fallon said on Monday, prompting Hathaway to laugh and cover her face as she tried to collect herself. “This is ‘The Tonight Show.’ You want to go to Stephen Colbert if you want to get people that read books,” he added. Fallon gave reading a literal thumbs down and exclaimed, “Lame,” before putting up the “loser” hand gesture to his forehead. “We do Audible here,” he continued. “Does that count?” Hathaway asked Fallon to move on with the interview, and he obliged, leading in with, “It’s based on this book —” “What’s a book?” Hathaway cracked back, receiving laughter from the audience. Finally, she declared, “The book does have a fan following somewhere.” “The Idea of You,” in which Hathaway’s single mom character falls for a boy band star, began streaming Thursday on Prime Video.

In the stunt actor-inspired action-comedy, Hannah Waddingham’s producer character walks into a messy trailer. She tells Emily Blunt, playing a director, “It’s like Amber and Johnny were just in here.” The scene didn’t sit right with some people online, who thought the “distasteful” and “cheap” line made light of domestic violence. Others posted that they had been excited to see the movie before hearing about the off-color joke. Heard and Depp married in 2015 but split just 15 months later. Details about the pair’s tumultuous relationship would become public years later, when Depp sued Heard for defamation after she called herself a “a public figure representing domestic abuse” in a 2018 op-ed for the Washington Post. An intense court battle ensued, in which both actors accused each other of abuse. In the end, a jury ruled in Depp’s favor and ordered Heard to pay him millions in damages. HuffPost has reached out to the distributor of “The Fall Guy,” Universal Pictures, for comment. See some reactions here: the fall guy: was just kind of cringe and smug until the weird j*hnny and a*ber joke, then it was unpleasant I know it’s a brief a throwaway line, but still not sure what was up with the domestic violence joke in The Fall Guy. “the fall guy” made a distasteful “joke” about the domestic abuse amber suffered at the hands of johnny. it’s 2024, why are we writing these kinds of lines into movies? nasty work https://t.co/n1eCsM2o38 everyone should be aware that the new “comedy” movie The Fall Guy (which is getting a wide theatrical release in a few weeks) allegedly makes a cheap Amber / J*hnny joke. would love to ask the writer what he thinks is so funny about domestic violence… We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hamas-delegation-egypt-israel-gaza-ceasefire-talks_n_6633d126e4b0fc2b9528c23a,Hamas To Send Delegation To Egypt In Latest Sign Of Progress For Cease-Fire Talks,"bassem mroue, lee keath , sam mednick",5/2/2024,"BEIRUT (AP) — Hamas said Thursday that it was sending a delegation to Egypt for further cease-fire talks, in a new sign of progress in attempts by international mediators to hammer out an agreement between Israel and the militant group to end the war in Gaza. After months of stop-and-start negotiations, the cease-fire efforts appear to have reached a critical stage, with Egyptian and American mediators reporting signs of compromise in recent days. But chances for the deal remain entangled with the key question of whether Israel will accept an end to the war without reaching its stated goal of destroying Hamas. The stakes in the cease-fire negotiations were made clear in a new U.N. report that said if the Israel-Hamas war stops today, it will still take until 2040 to rebuild all the homes that have been destroyed by nearly seven months of Israeli bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza. It warned that the impact of the damage to the economy will set back development for generations and will only get worse with every month fighting continues. The proposal that U.S. and Egyptian mediators have put to Hamas -– apparently with Israel’s acceptance — sets out a three-stage process that would bring an immediate six-week cease-fire and partial release of Israeli hostages, but also negotiations over a “permanent calm” that includes some sort of Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, according to an Egyptian official. Hamas is seeking guarantees for a full Israeli withdrawal and complete end to the war. Hamas officials have sent mixed signals about the proposal in recent days. But on Thursday, its supreme leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said in a statement that he had spoken to Egypt’s intelligence chief and “stressed the positive spirit of the movement in studying the cease-fire proposal.” The statement said that Hamas negotiators would travel to Cairo “to complete the ongoing discussions with the aim of working forward for an agreement.” Haniyeh said he had also spoken to the prime minister of Qatar, another key mediator in the process. The brokers are hopeful that the deal will bring an end to a conflict that has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, caused widespread destruction and plunged the territory into a humanitarian crisis. They also hope a deal will avert an Israeli attack on Rafah, where more than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have sought shelter after fleeing battle zones elsewhere in the territory. If Israel does agree to end the war in return for a full hostage release, it would be a major turnaround. Since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack stunned Israel, its leaders have vowed not to stop their bombardment and ground offensives until the militant group is destroyed. They also say Israel must keep a military presence in Gaza and security control after the war to ensure Hamas doesn’t rebuild. Publicly at least, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to insist that is the only acceptable endgame. He has vowed that even if a cease-fire is reached, Israel will eventually attack Rafah, which he says is Hamas’ last stronghold in Gaza. He repeated his determination to do so in talks Wednesday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was in Israel on a regional tour to push the deal through. The agreement’s immediate fate hinges on whether Hamas will accept uncertainty over the final phases to bring the initial six-week pause in fighting — and at least postpone what it is feared would be a devastating assault on Rafah. Egypt has been privately assuring Hamas that the deal will mean a total end to the war. But the Egyptian official said Hamas says the text’s language is too vague and wants it to specify a complete Israeli pullout from all of Gaza. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to talk about the internal deliberations. On Wednesday evening, however, the news looked less positive as Osama Hamdan, a top Hamas official, expressed skepticism, saying the group’s initial position was “negative.” Speaking to Hezbollah’s Al-Manar TV, he said that talks were still ongoing but would stop if Israel invades Rafah. Blinken hiked up pressure on Hamas to accept, saying Israel had made “very important” compromises. “There’s no time for further haggling. The deal is there,” Blinken said Wednesday before leaving for the U.S. An Israeli airstrike, meanwhile, killed at least five people, including a child, in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. The bodies were seen and counted by Associated Press journalists at a hospital. The war broke out on Oct. 7. when Hamas militants broke into southern Israel and killed over 1,200 people, mostly Israelis, taking around 250 others hostage, some released during a cease-fire on November. The Israel-Hamas war was sparked by the Oct. 7 raid into southern Israel in which militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 hostages. Hamas is believed to still hold around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others. Since then, Israel’s campaign in Gaza has wreaked vast destruction and brought a humanitarian disaster, with several hundred thousand Palestinians in northern Gaza facing imminent famine, according to the U.N. More than 80% of the population has been driven from their homes. The “productive basis of the economy has been destroyed” and poverty is rising sharply among Palestinians, according to the report released Thursday by the United Nations Development Program and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia. It said that in 2024, the entire Palestinian economy — including both Gaza and the West Bank -– has so far contracted 25.8%. If the war continues, the loss will reach a “staggering” 29% by July, it said. The West Bank economy has been hit by Israel’s decision to cancel the work permits for tens of thousands of laborers who depended on jobs inside Israel.

The “Griselda” star announced their “difficult decision to divorce” last year and explained in a candid new interview Wednesday that it was the “fair” thing to do. Vergara, who married Manganiello in 2015, said she simply wasn’t eager to become a mom all over again. “There’s things in life that might sound like good ideas, but they’re not,” she told People. “I was a mother already. I know what it means to be a good mother or to try to be the best mother that you can, and that takes a lot of sacrifices, takes a lot of energy.” “Nowadays, thanks to science, women can actually have babies older,” Vergara continued. “Before, nature for some reason tells your body at 50 you are in menopause, it’s time for you to be done with that. There is a reason why nature is doing that.” Vergara was barely an adult when she and her high school sweetheart welcomed a son in 1991. The 51-year-old told Spanish newspaper El País last year that Manganiello filed for divorce because “he wanted to have kids and I didn’t want to be an old mom.” “But that’s for me, and I totally respect where anyone wants to be a mom after 50,” she told People. “I didn’t think because of my career, the way I live my life, the way my marriage was, that it was fair to bring a kid to this world, and I’m not going to be able to give 100%.” Vergara first met the “Magic Mike” star at the White House Correspondents Dinner in May 2014 — and called off her engagement to actor Nick Loeb within weeks. Manganiello proposed to her in December of that year, and they tied the knot in 2015. On July 17, 2023, the former couple announced their divorce in a joint statement. “We have made the difficult decision to divorce,” they told Page Six at the time. “As two people that love and care for one another very much, we politely ask for respect for our privacy at this time as we navigate this new phase of our lives.” The announcement arrived shortly after Vergara was spotted celebrating her 51st birthday in Italy — sans Manganiello or her wedding ring. They’ve forged ahead amicably, however, with Vergara dating an orthopedic surgeon and Manganiello seeing actor Caitlin O’Connor. When asked what she’s looking for in a man these days, Vergara kept it real. “Health. Money. Fun. With [his own] kids. That’s it. That’s all I want,” she told People.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-immunity-assassinate-political-rival-senate-republicans_n_6633b54de4b05f96b0178bce,Senate GOPers Scoff At Trump’s Lawyers Arguing He Could Legally Kill A Political Rival,igor bobic,5/2/2024,"WASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s claim to total immunity is a bridge too far for Senate Republicans, even some who are normally willing to say or do anything to show their support for the former president who tried to overthrow democracy. Trump’s attorney last week argued before the Supreme Court that the presumptive 2024 GOP nominee can’t be held criminally liable for anything he did as president without being first impeached and convicted by Congress. This “absolute” immunity, the lawyer said, applied to outrageous hypotheticals posed by the justices, including a president ordering a military coup, selling nuclear secrets or directing the assassination of a political rival. On Wednesday, GOP senators squirmed and scoffed when asked if they agree with Trump that a president is immune from being prosecuted for anything, including ordering the murder of a political opponent. “Obviously, presidents can’t assassinate political rivals,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said flatly. The court is likely to reject or sidestep Trump’s bid for total immunity, and send the case back to a lower court for more deliberation over what counts as an “official” presidential act. Trump’s team has argued that many of his actions aimed at overturning the 2020 election were part of his official duties — including when he directed the submission of fraudulent slates of alternate electors in the election, despite President Joe Biden’s victory. “Well, I mean, there’s got to be some immunity for official acts. The question is, what are those,” said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). “I don’t know the answer to that.” Hawley, a lawyer himself, wouldn’t say whether he would have made the same argument about total immunity that Trump’s lawyers did before the Supreme Court. “I’ll do my fellow lawyers the courtesy of not second-guessing them,” he said. Is there any scenario, though, in which a president should be granted immunity for assassinating a political rival? “I have a hard time seeing that,” Hawley finally said. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), one of a handful of Republican senators who voted to convict Trump for inciting an insurrection, said he definitely did not agree. He mimicked a gun with his hand and pointed it at a HuffPost reporter’s head. “I mean, could I, as president, shoot you in the head?” Cassidy said. “Of course not.” Some GOP senators, perhaps eager to stay in Trump’s good graces, dodged the question and instead tried to compare Trump’s actions in office to Biden’s. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), one of Trump’s top allies on Capitol Hill, suggested that Biden could benefit from Trump’s arguments for immunity from prosecution because he might, somehow, face legal trouble over his administration’s policies granting student loan relief. “I mean, presidents already have immunity, because if you don’t, they’re gonna go back — we’re gonna have a lot of people go to jail,” Tuberville said. “Yeah, especially this one going against the Supreme Court, you know, forgiving student loans.” The Supreme Court struck down Biden’s student loan forgiveness program last year, but unlike Trump, Biden hasn’t been charged by the Justice Department and isn’t facing jail time over it. Asked again if he agrees with Trump’s argument that presidents can get prosecutorial immunity if they order the assassination of a political opponent, Tuberville demurred. “I ain’t gonna get in on that,” he said. “I mean, that’s crazy.” Some Democrats warned that the Supreme Court will further risk damaging its legitimacy if it rules in Trump’s favor, or if it sends the case back to an appeals court for more deliberation. If it does the latter, that would mean Trump wouldn’t go to trial for trying to overturn the results of a presidential election, despite no evidence of the widespread voter fraud he claimed. “This is an ongoing indication of how radical conservatives on the court have lost their way,” said Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.). “I mean, you ask any random person on the street, ‘Should any person be above the law, including the president?’ The answer is no.” “That’s been part of our Constitution. It has been part of the norms of our society. And the Supreme Court is questioning that,” he added. “It’s pretty shocking.” Strangely, only one Republican senator seemed to convey the same level of disbelief that this question is even being discussed. “No. No. No immunity. No!” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). “It’s just that simple.” “I mean, you ask any random person on the street, 'Should any person be above the law, including the president?' The answer is no.” The closest anyone came to agreeing with Trump’s lawyers was when Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) broadly defended the concept of presidential immunity without an act of Congress. In a Wednesday interview on CNN, Vance, who has been floated as a potential running mate for Trump, declined to say where any limit should be. “You’re basically saying that if the president orders a military coup, you believe the only remediation for that is impeachment?” CNN host Kaitlan Collins asked. “You’re dealing with hypotheticals here that are completely outside the bounds of this situation,” Vance replied. “Donald Trump did not order a coup, despite the fact that a lot of media people say he did on January the 6th.” Trump’s total immunity argument also carries an inherent contradiction. By arguing that a president can’t be criminally liable for anything they do without first being impeached and convicted by Congress, that would bar the Senate from convicting them because they wouldn’t be subject to the law in the first place. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor put it to Trump’s lawyers: “If he’s not covered by the criminal law, he can’t be impeached for violating it at all.” None of this seemed to matter to Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), who said he hasn’t been following Trump’s case but dismissed the question about a president having total immunity because it was HuffPost asking the question. “If a president assassinated his political rivals in America, he would be impeached,” Sullivan grumbled, climbing into a Senate subway car. But would a president even be convicted in the Senate in this scenario, given that Republicans have already twice refused to convict Trump on serious charges? The first charges were for obstruction of justice and abuse of power, the second instance was for inciting an insurrection. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-second-boeing-whistleblower-has-died_n_6633a23fe4b05f96b0177995,A Second Boeing Whistleblower Has Died,sebastian murdock,5/2/2024,"A former quality auditor who accused a Boeing supplier of ignoring manufacturing defects on the 737 Max jetliner died Tuesday at age 45. Joshua Dean had alleged that he was fired in April 2023 for bringing up poor standards at Spirit AeroSystems’ manufacturing plant in Wichita, Kansas. He died following a sudden illness, The Seattle Times first reported Wednesday. Dean had developed a fast-spreading bacterial infection, MRSA, and was hospitalized before his death. Dean’s aunt, Carol Parsons, shared a Facebook post with a message from Dean’s mother, dated Monday, that said his condition was deteriorating. “His lungs are totally whited out from infection,” the mother’s message said. “Josh is very depressed, frightened, and doing a lot of sleeping and not responding as much as he was a few days ago and has not been on any sedation or pain meds.” Dean filed a complaint with the Labor Department following his termination from Spirit last year, alleging that he was fired in retaliation for raising safety concerns. He alleged that mechanics were improperly drilling holes in the aft pressure bulkhead of the Max, and that management didn’t take his complaints seriously, according to The Seattle Times. Dean gave a deposition and filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration alleging “serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management of the 737 production line” at Spirit AeroSystems. News of Dean’s death comes as Boeing faces criticism following multiple reports of plane failures. So far this year, there have been over 40 incidents, accidents and occurrences involving Boeing planes, according to the National Transportation Safety Board’s Case Analysis and Reporting Online tool. However, that number nearly matches the data for the same period in 2023, and experts say that Boeing’s issues aren’t actually on the rise. Dean is now the second Boeing whistleblower to die this year. In March, former Boeing employee John Barnett, 62, was found dead in his car from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Barnett, who was a quality control engineer before retiring in 2017, had been testifying in a deposition against Boeing prior to his death. In a 2019 interview with The New York Times, Barnett alleged that he found metal shavings hanging over wiring that commands the Boeing 787 Dreamliner’s flight controls, putting the wires at risk of “catastrophic” injury during flight. Barnett’s attorneys, Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles, told HuffPost at the time of his death that the case was “nearing the end.” “He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on,” the attorneys said in a statement. “We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.” Knowles and Turkewitz also represented Dean. “Whistleblowers are needed. They bring to light wrongdoing and corruption in the interests of society. It takes a lot of courage to stand up,” Knowles said this week in a statement to The Seattle Times. “It’s a difficult set of circumstances. Our thoughts now are with John’s family and Josh’s family.” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

Last month, another former Boeing employee who worked on the company’s 787 Dreamliner went public with claims that the plane’s fuselage could fall apart midflight. “I literally saw people jumping on the pieces of the airplane to get them to align,” whistleblower Sam Salehpour told reporters on a call. “That’s not how you build a plane.” Salehpour alleged that after bringing his concerns to management, he was transferred to another division. In a statement to HuffPost at the time, the Federal Aviation Administration said that it was “thoroughly” looking into Salehpour’s complaint.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/taking-ozempic-what-im-telling-my-kids_l_66328fb9e4b0fc2b952813e7,I'm Taking Ozempic. Here's What I'm Telling My Kids.,brianna bell,5/2/2024,"“What are those needles in the fridge?” my 11-year-old, Nell, asked, peering at the boxed Ozempic medication that I had not-so-discreetly placed on the top shelf of our refrigerator. “Oh, they’re Mommy’s new medicine,” I said nonchalantly, frantically trying to figure out how I would approach the fact that I’m taking a somewhat controversial weight loss medication with my preteen daughter. That night I knocked on Nell’s bedroom door while she was getting ready for bed. I asked if she wanted to chat about the medication she had found. We ended up snuggled in her bed while I explained that my doctor had recommended that I take the medication because it would help me balance my blood sugar. “I’m healthy, but the medication will help me be even healthier,” I explained. At this point, Nell didn’t know what Ozempic was, and she hadn’t seen any videos online or heard about celebrities using the drug. We focused on my desire to grow stronger and healthier, and I explained that one of the side effects is that my body could change. “I love my body now, and I’ll love my body if it changes,” I explained. With my 9-year-old, I had a similar conversation. We agreed to keep the line of communication open, and over the next few months we did. Sometimes I was extra tired, and I’d explain that was one of the side effects of my medication. When we saw a commercial on TV for Ozempic, we talked about the messaging of the commercial and why the media was talking about the drug more and more. “Not everything the media says is true,” I explained, which led to a deeper analysis of media literacy. “We learned about this at school,” Nell added. After six months, I decided to go off of Ozempic for a variety of reasons: my insurance wouldn’t cover it, and the side effects were impacting my quality of life. My kids didn’t ask, so I didn’t mention that I’d stopped taking it until they randomly noticed the medication had disappeared from the fridge. Nicole Roder, a board-certified therapist in Columbia, Maryland, has personal and professional experience in navigating these types of tough conversations with your kids: Roder was also prescribed a semaglutide in the past. “I try not to tell parents what they should or shouldn’t do. That being said, I do think it’s appropriate to tell your kids if you’re taking a semaglutide like Ozempic,” Roder told HuffPost. Roder recommends having an age-appropriate conversation with your children. For older children who have been exposed to different media about Ozempic, it’s best to keep the communication lines open. “The best way to balance these perspectives is to foster open dialogue so you can know what they’ve heard and provide corrective information if necessary…. I recommend letting them ask questions…. That goes for any touchy subject, not just weight loss drugs,” Roder said. She added that you can also ask open-ended questions, like “What have you heard about this medication?” Roder said that she kept an open conversation with her own children while she was taking a semaglutide and that she explained the medication was prescribed to help improve her health. Her children mainly wanted to know if the needle hurt. “It’s best to keep this conversation about health and not body image,” said Roder. “Talk about your health reasons for taking the drug and the health benefits you hope to gain.” She added that it’s important to prioritize a healthy outlook on body image with your children. Never make disparaging comments about your body, and focus on positive comments, like your strong arms or the fact that your stretch marks are a reminder of the joy of bringing your kids into the world, she said. Samantha DeCaro, a psychologist and the director of clinical outreach and education at The Renfrew Center, has a different opinion on the subject. “Parents shouldn’t discuss any method or strategy they’re using to intentionally pursue weight loss, including dieting or using weight loss products,” DeCaro said. She added that talking to your children about your medication usage can increase the risk of them internalizing harmful beliefs about body image. If your child notices that your body is changing, DeCaro says you should “validate what the child is observing but do so in a completely neutral way. Remind your child that bodies come in all shapes and sizes, and we can’t tell how someone is feeling or how healthy they are by looking at them.” Los Angeles-based therapist Torri Efron Pelton says that choosing to talk to your children about your weight loss medication is a personal choice that will depend on each child. “I encourage parents to take a holistic health approach and not focus on the weight loss but rather the health goals and benefits,” she said. “The first step is for the parent to really understand their own motives and goals for taking [the weight loss medication] and what values they want to pass on to their children,” Efron Pelton said. “If your child is not asking questions or is not curious, the best way to go about it would be to talk to your children the same way you would about any other medicine or medical condition.” Efron Pelton recommended the following phrases and questions to guide the conversation: DeCaro suggested responding with these phrases if your child notices and comments on your weight loss: HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-gop-campaign-chief-abortion-messaging_n_6633b3b0e4b05f96b01789b4,Senate GOP Campaign Chief Says Candidates Need To Tailor Abortion Messages To States,jonathan nicholson,5/2/2024,"The senator in charge of making sure Republicans win back control of the Senate said Thursday that GOP candidates need to adapt their abortion messages to their states this fall but also include widely supported exceptions to abortion bans. “It is important. I think that’s a lesson learned from ’22 to get the messaging right and also for our candidates to state where they stand on the issue,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of the Senate GOP. “We’re advising our candidates to take a position on abortion that best matches the state they represent. That’s what we’re telling our candidates, and we’ll let them decide where they stand on it,” Daines said. He made the remarks at a breakfast with reporters in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision threw the abortion issue back to states, many of which enacted bans of varying durations and restrictiveness, Republicans have been struggling to blunt the political fallout. In March, House Republicans at their annual retreat grappled with supporting in vitro fertilization, which often includes discarding unsuccessful fertilized eggs, and the idea held by many anti-abortion party members that life begins at conception. In the Senate, Republicans currently hold 49 seats and need to flip two — or only one, if presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump wins — to take back control. They are the odds-on favorite to return to power, given the number and particular seats Democrats are defending this year. Daines said Republicans were aware, through what he called extensive polling and focus group efforts, that voters wanted exceptions to abortion bans. “Be clear on the exceptions of rape, incest and the life of the mother, and make the point that most Americans believe we should have reasonable limits on late-term abortions,” Daines said the NRSC was telling candidates. Almost a dozen states have abortion bans that range from six to 22 weeks of pregnancy; 25 states and the District of Columbia have retained allowing abortions beyond 22 weeks. But 14 states have near-total bans, regardless of how far along a pregnancy may be, with varying degrees of exceptions like those mentioned by Daines. Abortion rights advocates say those exceptions — like what constitutes a danger to the life of the mother — are often too vague to actually provide much relief. For example, abortions may still not be available where there are few doctors, and they are worried about being prosecuted if there is doubt about the danger to the mother. Additionally, rape exceptions can be undermined by the requirement that victims report the rape to law enforcement, whether they want to or not. Daines did not offer insight into the NRSC’s guidance to GOP candidates running in states with narrower exceptions than rape, incest and the life of the mother. He was bullish, however, on the GOP’s chances for success this year, but, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), also tempered expectations. In 2022, Republicans had been expected to gain seats; instead, Democrats ended up winning one additional seat. Asked his forecast for how many seats Republicans would hold after November, Daines said, “51,” the bare majority needed to control the Senate when the party does not have the White House as well. “I will let you all go through and analyze the races and decide what numbers you want to put on it. All I know is what matters the most is the majority, and 51 is what we’re focused on,” he said. “You will not hear me, from now until Nov. 5, say anything but 51. That is the majority, that is what puts the gavel in the hands of the new Republican leader,” he added. Daines then turned his attention to voters and said they are focused on three major issues that he said favor Republicans: border security, inflation and crime. He also dismissed concerns Republicans would be hurt by Democrats portraying them as soft on Russia and Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine. Aid to Ukraine was held up for six months by objections from Republicans, and some in the GOP, including potential vice presidential nominee Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), have echoed the Kremlin’s rhetoric about the war. Daines said it was fair to ask what the United States’ objectives were for its involvement. “I think the pro-Putin thing is Democrat spin,” he said. He noted most Republicans in the Senate ended up supporting the $61 billion in aid for Ukraine approved recently. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-idea-of-you-film-review_n_6632f46fe4b05f96b0171047,'The Idea Of You' Is Not As Good As The Bold And Sexy Love Story In The Book,sarah hunter simanson,5/2/2024,"It’s easy to be swept away by the idea of “The Idea of You,” the new romantic comedy starring Anne Hathaway as divorced mom and gallery owner Solène Marchand and Nicholas Galitzine as British boy band megastar Hayes Campbell. A celebrity falling for a non-famous person is a trope as old as time, or at least as old as Hollywood, and this film gives it a fresh update through its adaptation of Robinne Lee’s super-spicy 2017 novel. The twist in both the book and the movie is the age gap. Solène is a mom who just turned 40. Hayes is 24. The reversal of the older-man, younger-woman relationship and the promise of Hathaway as a globe-trotting mom having a sexual awakening (as well as her on-screen chemistry with Galitzine) have created significant buzz for the movie. The trailer broke the record for most-watched trailer for a streaming movie. This level of anticipation makes sense. The escapist plot, high-profile casting and promise of steamy love scenes are the ingredients of a standout rom-com, but this movie does not live up to its idea, and there’s a chance it will leave you more than a little underwhelmed, especially if you’re a fan of the book. The movie softens the book to make Hathaway’s character more accessible. Instead of a Range Rover, Solène drives a Subaru. Instead of a midcentury modern house in the hills, overlooking the ocean, she lives in a cozy bungalow that her pretentious ex-husband refers to as a starter home. Instead of leaving her husband because he didn’t support her career ambitions, Daniel (Reid Scott) cheats on her with a much younger woman. The effect, as Julie Miller describes in Hathaway’s April cover story for Vanity Fair, is that “Solène is less tony and more relatable.” Discrepancies between the book and movie also serve to make the age gap more palatable and Solène’s decisions as a mother less questionable. In the movie, Solène meets Hayes when she takes her 16-year-old daughter to the Coachella music fest for a VIP meet-and-greet with the boy band August Moon and mistakes Hayes’ trailer for a bathroom in the VIP section. Though August Moon is still supposed to be the most popular boy band on the planet, Solène’s daughter, Izzy (Ella Rubin), isn’t into them anymore because they are “so seventh grade.” And when she was obsessed with them, Izzy loved Rory, never Hayes. In the movie, mother and daughter do not ogle the same guy. In the book, Solène meets Hayes at a VIP meet-and-greet when taking her 12-year-old daughter to an August Moon concert in Las Vegas. He’s signing an autograph for Izzy, who is very-much obsessed with him because he is unquestionably her favorite member of the band. They take a group picture that, to no reader’s surprise, Izzy will destroy in a fit of rage after learning that her mom is dating the boy whose poster hangs on her wall. In Lee’s book, the daughter and mom both lusting after Hayes can be uncomfortable, but it feels real and forces the reader to wrestle with the societal expectations of Solène as a mom and the internal desire for her happiness as a person. On screen, these deviations from the text soften Hathaway’s Solène, making it easier for the viewer to root for her without question. The dynamics are also more socially acceptable because, even though the older-female, younger-male relationship still pushes the patriarchal envelope of what’s socially acceptable and normally depicted, it isn’t as subversive as the age gap in the book. In the novel, Hayes is 20. One could argue this complex love story being tamped down into an easier-to-digest, more commercial rom-com is the very thing Lee’s Solène would refuse to tolerate, both as an advocate for female artists and as a mother. “We have this problem in our culture. We take art that appeals to women — film, books, music — and we undervalue it,” Solène tells Hayes in the novel. “We assume it can’t be high art. Especially if it’s not dark and tortured and wailing. And it follows that much of that art is created by other women, and so we undervalue them as well. We wrap it up in a pretty pink package and resist calling it art.” Lee’s novel uses steamy sex scenes and a fantasy-filled plot to show how a love story can reveal life’s complications and be art while still being fun, but the film adaptation does not meet this bar. In the movie, the attraction between Solène and Hayes is immediate and present, but it’s not substantive. Hayes telling Solène she is smart and “hot or whatever” is a far cry from Lee’s description of the rapture Hayes feels when Solène uses her artist’s eye to describe how she sees the world and what she thinks about art. Their first meetings are not clandestine affairs that occur when their busy schedules happen to overlap in cities around the world; instead, Hayes buys all of the art in her gallery, making it possible for Solène to follow him on tour while her daughter is at summer camp. There is also a lack of emotional depth in the movie. The foundation of admiration and respect that makes the sex so sexy in the book is absent, and the moments when those feelings could exist on screen are reduced and packaged into montages of jet-setting and hotel rooms and sensual moments in the ocean or the dark corner of a Parisian café. A theme that both the film and movie explore is this idea of Solène as a flower unfolding, blooming. “I wanted to make this movie because it was a great part and a fun premise, and, for some reason, we talk about coming-of-age stories as being something that happens to you in the earliest part of your life, and I don’t know about you, but I feel like I keep blooming,” Hathaway told the audience at the South by Southwest premiere of the film on March 16 in Austin, Texas. Though Hathaway’s version of Solène proves women can be visible and sexual at any age, the movie doesn’t give her character the space to be nuanced or ambitious or unlikable or complicated or — God forbid — a “bad” mother in society’s eyes. (It should also be noted that Hathaway looks so stunning in every scene that she doesn’t appear that much older than Galitzine’s character, but her role as mom to a teenager and frequent mentions of her age make it clear that this gap exists between Solène and Hayes.) Also, for an R-rated movie, it’s not that sexy, at least not nearly as sexy as one would expect from a movie in which almost every review focuses on how steamy it is. The first kiss is extremely hot, but the rest of the scenes of intimacy feel standard and compulsory, exactly what you’d expect to see in a major rom-com except for the age difference. Ultimately, by softening the details of the novel, the movie version of Solène and Hayes’ love story sells itself short. It makes itself smaller and less visible in the way society often asks women, especially mothers and those approaching middle-age, to do. “Is ours a love story?” Solène asks Hayes in the book. “I don’t know. Is it?” he replies. There’s no question the movie adaptation is a love story — a rom-com — but I can’t help wishing it was so much more. I didn’t want “The Idea of You” to be “dark and tortured and wailing,” but I would have liked it to live up to the challenge of Lee’s novel, to shift the paradigm for what a rom-com or love story can be, not just the ages of who can star in one. “The Idea of You” begins streaming Thursday on Prime Video.

Speaking from the White House’s Roosevelt Room, Biden praised both the right to free speech and the rule of law as “fundamental American principles” and urged both be upheld and respected. “We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent,” he said, describing peaceful protest as “in the best tradition” of American democracy. “But neither are we a lawless country. We’re a civil society and order must prevail.” Pro-Palestinian protesters have set up encampments at college campuses from New York to California, prompting some institutions, including Columbia University and UCLA, to dismantle them by force. Counter-protesters have also attacked at least one camp, instigating violence. Protesters are calling on universities to divest from, and stop doing business with, Israeli companies and companies they say support the war in Gaza. Biden continued: “Violent protest is not protected. Peaceful protest is. It’s against the law when violence occurs. Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It’s against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduation: none of this is a peaceful protest. Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It’s against the law.” President Biden on college campus protests: ""There's the right to protest, but not the right to chaos."" pic.twitter.com/wtmvjOrLWH “There’s no place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence against Jewish students,” Biden added. “There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind — whether it’s antisemitism, Islamophobia or discrimination against Arab-Americans or Palestinian-Americans. “I understand people have strong feelings and deep convictions,” he continued. “In America we respect and protect the right for them to express that. But it doesn’t mean anything goes. It needs to be done without violence, without destruction, without hate, and within the law.” Asked afterward by a reporter if the protests have forced him to reconsider his polices in the region, where Israel has carried out an unrelenting assault since an Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, Biden answered, “No.” The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bc-sci-orangutan-self-medication_n_6633b2e5e4b0fc2b9528aaf1,Wild Orangutan Observed Using Medicinal Plant To Treat Wound,christina larson,5/2/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — An orangutan appeared to treat a wound with medicine from a tropical plant— the latest example of how some animals attempt to soothe their own ills with remedies found in the wild, scientists reported Thursday. Scientists observed Rakus pluck and chew up leaves of a medicinal plant used by people throughout Southeast Asia to treat pain and inflammation. The adult male orangutan then used his fingers to apply the plant juices to an injury on the right cheek. Afterward, he pressed the chewed plant to cover the open wound like a makeshift bandage, according to a new study in Scientific Reports. Previous research has documented several species of great apes foraging for medicines in forests to heal themselves, but scientists hadn’t yet seen an animal treat itself in this way. “This is the first time that we have observed a wild animal applying a quite potent medicinal plant directly to a wound,” said co-author Isabelle Laumer, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz, Germany. The orangutan’s intriguing behavior was recorded in 2022 by Ulil Azhari, a co-author and field researcher at the Suaq Project in Medan, Indonesia. Photographs show the animal’s wound closed within a month without any problems. Scientists have been observing orangutans in Indonesia’s Gunung Leuser National Park since 1994, but they hadn’t previously seen this behavior. “It’s a single observation,” said Emory University biologist Jacobus de Roode, who was not involved in the study. “But often we learn about new behaviors by starting with a single observation.” “Very likely it’s self-medication,” said de Roode, adding that the orangutan applied the plant only to the wound and no other body part. It’s possible Rakus learned the technique from other orangutans living outside the park and away from scientists’ daily scrutiny, said co-author Caroline Schuppli at Max Planck. Rakus was born and lived as a juvenile outside the study area. Researchers believe the orangutan got hurt in a fight with another animal. It’s not known whether Rakus earlier treated other injuries. Scientists have previously recorded other primates using plants to treat themselves. Bornean orangutans rubbed themselves with juices from a medicinal plant, possibly to reduce body pains or chase away parasites. Chimpanzees in multiple locations have been observed chewing on the shoots of bitter-tasting plants to soothe their stomachs. Gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos swallow certain rough leaves whole to get rid of stomach parasites. “If this behavior exists in some of our closest living relatives, what could that tell us about how medicine first evolved?” said Tara Stoinski, president and chief scientific officer of the nonprofit Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, who had no role in the study.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/simple-modern-stanley-tumbler_l_6633a88be4b0849b2ede936f,"Right Now, This Stanley Tumbler Look-A-Like Is Even Less At 20% Off",tessa flores,5/2/2024,"HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. For anyone who loves everything that the Stanley tumbler has to offer, but doesn’t have the time (or the extra funds) to snag the latest goods from the brand, let me put you on to one hidden gem of a drinking vessel from Amazon that has been drawing many comparisons to — and according to some buyers, outperforming — its buzzier and less-accessible version. The Simple Modern 40-ounce tumbler, which comes in over 40 color combinations (and also a 30-ounce size), has a near-perfect 4.8-star rating on Amazon, tons of promising reviews and is currently up to 20% off. Like its competitor, this sip-able tumbler has double-walled stainless steel insulation to keep contents hot or cold for longer and has an ergonomic handle that makes it easy to tote around. Another bonus is the tapered bottom, which makes the Simple Modern compatible with most car cup holders. Where this doppelgänger might have the Stanley beat however, is in its more trusted leakproof design, which according to reviewers, makes it easier to commute with or pack into bags. The insulated lid, which is four-way threaded to allow four different straw placements for your drinking hand preference, features a silicone straw gasket that stops spills even when tipped over. “With the straw [in] and the tumbler turned upside down, yes it does leak a bit, but knocked on its side, it doesn’t leak. Without the straw and tumbler upside down it doesn’t leak at all,” wrote one reviewer on Amazon. If you don’t want to carry one of two included straws separately while transporting the tumbler, you can even purchase compatible straw covers. Read on for some promising endorsements or grab one from the link above before they sell out, too. Promising Amazon reviews: “I just got this tumbler and I already love it. I got it to help with drinking more water through the day and I like my water to stay cold. With the straw [in] and the tumbler turned upside down, yes it does leak a bit but knocked on its side it doesn’t leak. Without the straw and tumbler upside down it doesn’t leak at all. I love the design, I got the black leopard print and so far it keeps the water and ice cold. I’m hoping it keeps my ice in there more than a day or two but so far I really love everything about it: looks, leak proof and design. It’s not that heavy either. I was afraid it was gonna be like carrying a heavy bag all day but no. [It] has some weight to it but that’s expected, Really love it.” — Renne420 “First and foremost this tumbler is durable, spill-proof (without the straw, very little spills out with the straw in depending on the angle of the fall), and it keeps my water ice cold for quite awhile. I recently purchased the graphite colored tumbler for my husband and he says nothing but good things about it and loves taking it to work with him. If I have ice in it the ice is still in there for at least two days if not a little longer which is awesome! If you’re clumsy like myself and knock it over a few times no worries! No spills when knocked over (with the straw out and very little potentially with the straw in depending on how it falls), no damage that I can see on the cup itself or the lid for each time it has been knocked over. The weight isn’t too heavy either when it’s completely full. I absolutely love this tumbler and have multiple of them! It is definitely a great alternative to other tumblers out there and it is definitely a more cost effective option compared to other pricy tumbler brands like Stanley.” — KayBee “The water tumbler is a amazing with exceptional quality and sleek design. The durable construction ensures longevity, and the double-walled insulation maintains the temperature of my beverages for extended periods. The secure, leak-proof lid adds a practical touch, making it perfect for on-the-go hydration. Overall, this water tumbler combines style and functionality, making it a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable and aesthetically pleasing hydration companion.” — Dhruvi By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The one-minute ad centers on Trump’s recent comments that he wants to leave abortion rights to the states, and he’s fine with those states monitoring pregnant women so they don’t get abortions. The ad features Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN from Texas, who was forced to leave the state to get abortion care after she was given a fatal fetal diagnosis. “If Donald Trump is elected, that is the end of a woman’s right to choose,” Dennard tells the camera. “There will be no place to turn. We could lose our rights in every state, even the ones where abortion is currently legal. And that means every woman in every state is at risk.” The seven-figure ad buy will run on the two-year anniversary of the leaked draft decision that revealed the Supreme Court was poised to overturn Roe v. Wade. The ad will run in battleground states across the country, according to the Biden-Harris campaign. “Over the last two years, we’ve seen a health care crisis unfold for women because of what Donald Trump did as president. If he’s reelected, he’ll make things even worse,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the Biden-Harris campaign manager, said in a statement. “He’s saying he approves of states surveilling, monitoring, prosecuting, and punishing women for receiving reproductive care,” she said. “Our campaign will continue to relentlessly remind voters every single day about the very real and horrifying stakes for women this November if Trump has his way.” The next four years will change America forever.

Vice President Kamala Harris is still on her “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” campaign tour, and recently spoke in Florida after the state’s six-week abortion ban went into effect on Wednesday. Last month, Harris was in Arizona after the state Supreme Court ruled that an 1864 near-total abortion ban can take effect. Biden criticized Trump’s comments around prosecuting women seeking abortion care in a video posted to Twitter on Wednesday. “There seems to be no limit to how invasive Trump would let the state be,” Biden says. “This should be a decision between a woman and her doctor, and the government should get out of people’s lives.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The judge overseeing Trump’s hush money case sustained the objection. “I think it’s, in a weird way, against the law,” Kelly declared. (Watch the video below.) On “Greg Kelly Reports,” the far-right anchor fixated on a Friday exchange between Trump defense lawyer Emil Bove and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker about a 2016 meeting at Trump Tower. Bove referred to a phone call with “President Trump” before the meeting was to take place. “You talked to President Trump that day in connection with the meeting; right?” Bove asked Pecker, according to a court transcript. “Objection,” Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass said. “What’s your objection?” Judge Juan Merchan asked. “He wasn’t ‘President’ Trump in June of 2016,” Steinglass replied. “Sustained,” Merchan said. Kelly railed that this bit of testimony exposed the “corruption” and “hideous bias” of the proceedings, but saved perhaps his wackiest comment for later. “The judge is sustaining that objection,” Kelly said. “Now that is personal, that is mean, and also I think it’s, in a weird way, against the law. I think he [Trump] retains that title no matter what.” It should be noted that Trump’s defense team announced it would refer to him as President Trump as a sign of respect afforded ex-presidents. The attorneys have done so dozens of other times without objection. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/we-are-lady-parts-season-2-trailer_n_66327f50e4b0fc2b952803f3,One Of The Most Undersung Shows Is Back — And Here’s An Exclusive First Look,marina fang,5/2/2024,"There’s a real go-big-or-go-home energy that crackles throughout the Peacock comedy series “We Are Lady Parts.” That kind of buoyant maximalism is a throughline connecting much of writer-director Nida Manzoor’s work, including her debut directorial feature film last year, the genre-bending heist comedy “Polite Society.” Now that Manzoor has the success of both the series’ first season, which premiered to great acclaim in 2021, and “Polite Society” under her belt, it’s no surprise that Season 2 of “We Are Lady Parts” goes even bigger and bolder. The show follows the members of Lady Parts, an all-female British Muslim punk band: Amina (Anjana Vasan), Saira (Sarah Kameela Impey), Ayesha (Juliette Motamed) and Bisma (Faith Omole), plus their manager, Momtaz (Lucie Shorthouse). Everything about the new season feels like the volume has been turned up, from more impressive songs and visual set pieces to deeper themes and conversations among the characters about art and identity. “Everyone was able to level up in Season 2 across the board,” Manzoor said in an interview this week, explaining how these last few years have given her a greater “sense of being self-assured and being confident in my voice.” HuffPost has an exclusive first look at the Season 2 trailer, launching Thursday, and new photos from the upcoming season. All six episodes premiere May 30 on Peacock, as well as on Channel 4 in the U.K. In Season 2, now that their band is more established, the members of Lady Parts grapple with what success looks like, vying for a record deal and a potential spot at Glastonbury, the U.K.’s biggest music festival. But with those markers of mainstream success come reservations and roadblocks. As their platform grows, how will they maintain their authenticity and integrity as artists? As Manzoor explained, she drew some of those big, existential questions at the heart of the series from similar conversations she has had with fellow artists — and with herself. “There is a slightly meta element to these things, and it makes it very joyful to write when you’re going through similar feelings at times,″ she said. “But more than that, I think just noticing that there’s such a pressure especially on younger people to be famous — this idea of fame as success, and reaching big, big platforms [as] success. But actually, is that really success?” “There’s so much joy to be able to create your art on a big platform, as I’m allowed to do,” she added. “And that’s just also exploring: How far can you go? What can you say? What is the compromise there?” What happens when art collides with capitalism and commercial considerations was also a frequent conversation topic in the writers’ room, according to Manzoor. For this season, she convened a group of Muslim women “from a variety of backgrounds: different levels of religiosity, ages, ethnicity, sexuality,” she said. Not all of them were screenwriters; for example, Manzoor said she brought on the Welsh Iraqi poet Hanan Issa, the National Poet of Wales. Each of the writers brought their varied experiences and points of view, which informed the complex conversations the characters are having this season about art and identity, Manzoor said. For instance, she said, they grappled with how Muslim queer women express their identities, and “the tensions, the nuances and the differences, even within Muslim women who identify that way.” Questions about “motherhood and femininity,” also came up. “And there’s also talking about art and self-expression, what you feel you can and cannot say,” Manzoor said. “It was so vibrant, and it really informed a lot of those big band scenes.” Another way Season 2 is a step up from the first season is its deeper exploration of each Lady Parts member outside of the band, from their home lives to romantic relationships. Now that we know these characters, we can get more invested in them. Throughout the new season, we see each of them deal with layered and sometimes difficult questions about everything from their different expressions of Muslim identity, to Blackness and queerness, to the complications of interracial dating. In several cases, Manzoor wanted to upend and challenge some of the characters’ traits and perceptions from Season 1, giving them moments of growth. That depth of storytelling also came from Manzoor knowing her actors better and being able to tailor the writing toward their performances. “I’d written for them for Season 1, not really knowing fully their skill sets and their different talents,” she said. But now, she’s able to tap into her actors’ strengths. Motamed, who plays Ayesha, has a “vulnerability, this very open-heartedness, that I really wanted to give her opportunities to explore in Season 2,” Manzoor said. “So Ayesha’s character would go sort of deeper into her story, exploring her queer identity. And then conversely, Sarah, who plays Saira, isn’t someone that I would usually give big full pratfall moments to, but she’s got some really fun ones, ’cause there’s a real silliness and physicality to Sarah, which I learned.” One of the season’s standout musical scenes is a virtuosic solo featuring Bisma, Omole’s character. Manzoor said she wanted to give Omole a powerhouse moment because “she’s got such an incredible, emotive voice.” Manzoor has a few more projects in the works, all emblematic of her unique sensibilities and ability to meld different genres. “Things are sort of bubbling away. I’m developing a dark sci-fi comedy TV show, which I’m really enjoying,” she said. “And then I’m also working on another — I wanna do more action, so a big action spy movie, but with a lot of weird twistiness inside of it, playing in genre, playing with comedy.” With each new accomplishment, Manzoor said she has an easier time trusting her instincts. She described how earlier in her career, she “may have second-guessed and tormented and stewed on things for much longer, whereas [now], I feel much more self-assured.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

She is particularly proud that the new season reflects the growth of their collective efforts. “I felt like I trusted my heads of department even more. They had such strong instincts for the show,” she said. “I think that’s the most joy I get from creating things.

The former Los Angeles Laker recently confirmed on “The Big Podcast with Shaq” that he gets regular pedicures and loves having his toenails painted. O’Neal, who famously wears size 22 shoes, also revealed he pays a fortune for every session — because his feet “stink.” “I give about $1,000 because I know my feet stink, I know they’re ugly and I like to paint them,” the 52-year-old NBA star explained on the podcast, adding: “I want it to look pretty. … That’s why I paint them.” The four-time champion takes the topic of his feet in stride and even allowed his “NBA on TNT” colleagues to joke about them on air in 2017. While he denied getting pedicures at the time, O’Neal is now revealing the sweet origin of the tradition. “One time I had a toenail that was torn off and I wasn’t going to play a game,” he said on the podcast. “And my mom was like, ‘Babe, why you not playing the game?’ I was like, ‘I tore my toenail off.’ So she did something, and then she put some red polish on the thing.” “And I had 40 [points] that game,” O’Neal continued. When asked if he prefers to have his toenails painted in solid colors or picks more elaborate patterns, the towering athlete stated plainly: “I do, like, sparkles and designs and all this stuff, you know, just to make it look pretty because I have ugly, stinky feet.” While the subject of his feet isn’t new — O’Neal reportedly needed surgery to remove bone spurs from an arthritic toe in 2002 — it’s certainly stood the test of time. ESPN’s “SportsCenter” shared an Instagram video Wednesday, for instance, of O’Neal mid-pedi. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

During an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” Gosling recalled working with the late actor on 1996′s “Frankenstein and Me” — Gosling’s first movie. Kimmel asked the “Barbie” star, who was a teenager at the time, if he got to spend any time with Reynolds on set. “It’s complicated,” Gosling said. “Because I thought he took a shine to me. I thought he thought there was something special about me. And then I realized that I have a really beautiful mom.” “He was just kind of interested,” he added. “I was getting like a secondary shine. The real shine was for my mom.” He added that his mom “loved it.” Kimmel pointed out that if they had gotten married, “You could have been Ryan Reynolds!” Gosling’s parents, Donna and Thomas Gosling, split when he was 13. He grew up with his mom and sister in Ontario, Canada, and he has credited his mom for nurturing his passion for acting from a young age. He recently brought her along as his date for the Oscars, where he delivered a showstopping performance of “I’m Just Ken” from the “Barbie” movie. Gosling appeared on “Kimmel” Wednesday while promoting his new movie, “The Fall Guy,” in which he stars as stuntman Colt Seavers.

Vance (R-Ohio) on Wednesday cast doubt on the very real threat that was posed to then-Vice President Mike Pence when pro-Donald Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Some Trump supporters chanted “Hang Mike Pence!” as they searched for the VP in the corridors of Congress. They were seeking vengeance after Pence chose democracy over Trump when he refused to block the certification of electoral votes in Trump’s bid to overturn President Joe Biden’s 2020 election win. At one point, Pence was reportedly just 40 feet from rioters as Secret Service agents whisked him away to an underground loading dock. But Vance told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that he was “truly skeptical” that Pence’s life “was ever in danger.” Vance’s claim came after Collins noted he was a potential Trump running mate and asked if Trump’s treatment of Pence gave him “any pause” about taking on the possible role. “I think politics and politics people like to really exaggerate things from time to time,” Vance told Collins. Collins suggested Pence “would disagree.” “A lot of folks in the Democratic Party, Kaitlan, act as if Jan. 6 was the scariest moment of their lives,” Vance responded. “I think Jan. 6 was a bad day. It was a riot. But the idea that Donald Trump endangered anyone’s lives when he told them to protest peacefully, it’s just absurd.” Collins noted the chants against Pence. “Well, Kaitlan, did a few people say some bad things? Sure,” admitted Vance. “But do we blame Donald Trump for every bad thing that’s ever been said by a participant in American democracy? I think that’s an absurd standard.” Watch the full interview here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/poo-plumes-bacteria-bathroom-podcast_n_6630f48ce4b0c558f741bd0d,The Nasty Truth About 'Poo Plumes' — And How To Protect Yourself From Them,am i doing it wrong?,5/2/2024,"A wise philosopher once noted, “everybody poops,” and if you live in the United States and many other parts of the world, you’re probably using a toilet when you do. So just how germy are they? And what can we do to keep our toilets, our bathrooms, and ourselves as fecal-matter-free as possible? That’s what we — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — asked microbiologist Jason Tetro, aka “The Germ Guy,” when he recently chatted with us about the grossest parts of our bathrooms and how to vanquish the bad germs that might be thriving in them. Listen to the full episode by pressing play: “There are trillions and trillions and trillions of microbes that are essentially part of you,” Tetro, the author of “The Germ Files” and “The Germ Code,” told us. “The majority of them happen to be in your gastrointestinal system ... As you might expect then, the majority of germs that we’re going to encounter in any household happen to be in the toilet.” Many of those microbes are harmless, but some can make us sick. Even though our toilets do a great job of capturing and eliminating our waste, rogue “poo particles” (a decidedly non-scientific term Michelson used) can still escape the bowl — especially if we don’t shut the lid when we flush. “This first started [to be studied in 1976], and the whole idea was, is there something that’s coming out of the toilet when you flush it if you don’t keep the lid down?” Tetro said. “[Back then we called it] a ‘plume.’ So it’s not ‘poo particles,’ it’s a plume of droplets in the air.” Scientists placed petri dishes around a toilet, flushed it multiple times, and looked to see if anything sprouted. “Sure enough, within six feet of that toilet, you had microbes that were growing because that’s the droplets’ span,” Tetro said. “Let’s jump to today, because we now have had the ‘Austin Powers’ movies, and as a result of that, what are we going to use to be able to identify poo droplets? A freakin’ laser,” he said laughing. After using lasers to map toilet plumes, scientists confirmed that they can launch as high as six feet in the air and the spray can land as far as six feet from the bowl. “Within six feet of your toilet is usually your toothbrush,” Tetro noted. “When you think of it from that perspective, then you start to begin to realize that if you’re not closing the lid, then what ends up happening is that plume of droplets that contains your poo particles are getting onto things that are going to be touching your face and going inside of your mouth.” That’s bad news because, as Tetro explained, “those fecal microbes can potentially cause infection and other problems.” Though a partial plume could still escape from the sides of the seat even with the lid down, Tetro assured us most of the spray would be contained. “If you keep the lid closed and you do end up with a little bit of a plume coming out of the sides, it’s just essentially gonna drop,” he said. ”[Just] make sure that you’re cleaning the floor around your toilet.” What about cleaning the toilet itself? “If you were to be able to swab a [toilet bowl] and then run that on a petri dish, you’re probably going to get a bunch of bacteria, but most of those are going to be environmental because it’s from the water,” Tetro said. “The reason for that is because toilets do what they’re supposed to do, which is to remove whatever is in the bowl — other than the plume — and take it down into the drain. So, in that sense, you really don’t need to worry too too much about contamination and growth and all that stuff.” What we do need to worry about are biofilms, which are caused by bacteria in the water and often form as rings in our toilet bowls (and other places like our bathtubs and shower heads). “They become very sticky and that’s where the poo bacteria can essentially start to accumulate,” Tetro said. “So what you want to do is try and prevent any of these biofilms from forming. It takes about three days to start creating a biofilm that isn’t visible, but could start being sticky. So if you really wanna be clean about it, then you want to be cleaning about every three days.” However, Tetro said that it takes about seven days before “any of that stickiness could lead to poo sticking around,” so he advised cleaning our toilets once a week. “The only time that I would say that you would want to do it more than that is if someone does have a gastrointestinal infection,” he added. “We’ve seen Salmonella survive in a toilet bowl up to seven weeks... [so] if you have any GI issues, then you really should be cleaning up later on that same day.” We also chatted about the parts of our bathrooms with the most germs (they probably aren’t the spots you’d guess), how often we should be washing our towels (and the gross reason they start to smell), and much more.

In an interview Wednesday with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Trump said of the upcoming presidential showdown, “If everything’s honest, I’ll gladly accept the results. I don’t change on that. If it’s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.” In other words, it sounds like he’ll dispute any outcome in which he is not the winner. It’s the same kind of rhetoric on which he built his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. That prompted a violent coup attempt to stop certification of the results and charges against him for allegedly scheming to overturn the outcome. In an interview with Time magazine published this week, Trump suggested there would be no political violence if he wins the November election — but “if we don’t win, you know, it depends.” Trump spent an off day from his trial in the hush money case campaigning in Wisconsin, where he baselessly claimed victory in that state the last time around. “If you go back and look at all of the things that had been found out, it showed that I won the election in Wisconsin,” Trump told the Journal Sentinel. “It also showed I won the election in other locations.” Trump beat Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin in the 2016 election en route to the presidency but lost the state to Joe Biden by more than 20,000 votes in 2020. It’s a defeat he has refused to accept. The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

In 2022, Trump suggested that a court-ordered reduction in drop boxes for absentee ballots in Wisconsin meant that the votes counted from those boxes in 2020 were somehow bogus. “This means I won the very closely contested (not actually!) Wisconsin Presidential race because they used these corrupt and scandal-ridden Scam Boxes,” he falsely wrote on Truth Social at the time.

Trump said the capital was “unrecognizable” after “Europe opened its doors to jihad.” His comments, at a campaign rally, have re-ignited his long-running feud with the London mayor, who is seeking reelection for another four-year term in today’s local elections. Khan said: “Today is an opportunity to show Donald Trump and my Tory opponent that London will always choose hope over fear and unity over division.” Trump said: “We’ve seen what happened when Europe opened its doors to jihad. Look at Paris, look at London, they’re no longer recognizable.” His comments echo those he made ahead of a visit to the U.K. in 2018, in which he personally attacked London mayor Khan over the London Bridge terror attack the previous year. The then president said: “I think allowing millions and millions of people to come into Europe is very, very sad. I look at cities in Europe, and I can be specific if you’d like. You have a mayor who has done a terrible job in London. He has done a terrible job.” In response, Khan told HuffPost UK: “I’m happy to meet President Trump and to explain to him, in a respectful, courteous manner where I think he’s wrong on a number of issues, to hear him out, see what his explanation is for holding me responsible for the attacks we saw in London last year.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The “View” co-host rang “some alarm bells” about the presidential election. She explained that she initially believed the presumptive GOP presidential nominee’s hush money trial was “gonna hurt him,” noting that it’s put him in a courtroom as opposed to on the campaign trail. “I’m startin’ to think that it doesn’t in the same way, because he’s not out there saying crazy things. He’s not saying, ‘Immigrants are poisoning our blood.’ He actually has to kinda sit there silently with his hands folded,” Griffin said. “So what people are seeing when they turn on the media — not that crazy Time piece we read yesterday about all the horrifying things he’s gonna do in a second term — they see violence and they see protests on college campuses,” she added. “They see young people calling Joe Biden ‘Genocide Joe’ and it scares people, whether you’re from a law and order perspective, whether you’re on the fence about Biden.” Griffin’s made her comments less than 24 hours after counter-protesters attacked pro-Palestinian demonstrators at UCLA while Columbia University called in police to clear an occupied building of protesters calling for divestment from Israel on Tuesday night. She added that there’s a “real reality” in which Biden could pick up swing voters and moderate Republicans. “He could pick up all the demographics you generally need but lose young progressives and lose the election to Donald Trump. That’s where we are right now,” said Griffin, noting that Trump could “very well” become president in seven months based on an aggregate of polls. The next four years will change America forever.

The hamberder-loving former president pronounced the word unconventionally during a campaign rally in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on Wednesday, as he invited a Milwaukee business owner onstage to voice her support for his campaign. Trump introduced the woman as the owner of “a vaigan restaurant.” “Supposed to be really good. I’m not into the vaigan stuff, I must say, but I’m gonna have to try this,” Trump said. “When we come here in a short period of time, into Milwaukee, we’re gonna come and try that vaigan food.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-palestinians-colombia_n_66335f46e4b05f96b0174763,Colombia To Break Diplomatic Relations With Israel Over Gaza War,ap,5/2/2024,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday announced his government will break diplomatic relations with Israel effective Thursday in the latest escalation of tensions between the countries over the Israel-Hamas war. Petro again described Israel’s siege of Gaza as “genocide.” He previously suspended purchases of weapons from Israel and compared that country’s actions in Gaza to those of Nazi Germany. “Tomorrow, diplomatic relations with the State of Israel will be broken … for having a genocidal president,” Petro said during an International Workers’ Day march in Colombia’s capital. “If Palestine dies, humanity dies, and we are not going to let it die.” Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz quickly rebuked Petro’s comments on the platform X. “History will remember that Gustavo Petro decided to side with the most despicable monsters known to mankind who burned babies, murdered children, raped women and kidnapped innocent civilians,” he said. Weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that sparked the current war in Gaza and killed some 1,200 people, Petro recalled Colombia’s ambassador to Israel as he criticized the country’s military offensive. Historically, Colombia had been one of Israel’s closest partners in Latin America. But relations between the two nations have cooled since Petro was elected as Colombia’s first leftist president in 2022. Colombia uses Israeli-built warplanes and machine guns to fight drug cartels and rebel groups, and both countries signed a free trade agreement in 2020. “Relations between Israel and Colombia always were warm and no antisemitic and hate-filled president will succeed in changing that,” Katz wrote Tuesday. “The state of Israel will continue to defend its citizens without worry and without fear.” The South American country deepened its military ties with Israel in the late 1980s by purchasing Kfir fighter jets that were used by Colombia’s air force in numerous attacks on remote guerrilla camps that debilitated the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The attacks helped push the group into peace talks that resulted in its disarmament in 2016. Petro participated in Wednesday’s march in Bogota to promote his proposed health care, pension and labor reforms.

We all love the hits at Sephora and influencer faves, but don’t forget that branding is only half the battle – and often more than half the price tag. Sure, some of these products’ presentation can leave something to be desired, but what they lack in aesthetics they more than make up for in function. In fact, there are so many sleeper products out there it was really hard to narrow down favorites. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. This salve has earned cult status for good reason. Great for dry skin, it also works as a hydrating lip balm, a cuticle treatment, an overnight moisturizing mask, an eye cream and a makeup remover. It’s also excellent for post-tattoo care and for healing minor cuts and burns. Unscented and designed specifically for dry or compromised skin, Aquaphor's healing ointment may not boast Instagram-ready packaging, but what it lacks in branding it more than makes up for in function. My grandmother’s medicine cabinet was notoriously sparse, but there was one product reliable stocked in her shelves: witch hazel. This multi-use astringent is a true beauty workhorse, known for its anti-inflammatory properties that can help treat acne, bug bites, aching muscles, minor irritations and even soothe hemorrhoids. When it comes to moisturizing, Vanicream can't be beat. The sensitive skin-friendly formula is rich, but quickly absorbing and non-comedogenic (in other words, it won’t clog pores). Vanicream is all about the ingredients — or lack thereof. It’s free of dyes, fragrances, formaldehyde, lanolin, and parabens. The bedside table-friendly pump design, while decidedly unsexy, makes your moisturizing routine a snap. This $8 body wash is causing quite a stir on TikTok. Users have been quick to point out that it smells very similar to scents from Le Labo and Glossier. Inspired by travel in the Mediterranean, the body wash has citrus top notes of blood orange and red currants, a middle of fresh fig, neroli, lavender and finishes with cashmere musk, vetiver and palo santo. True, it’s not as sexy as a Le Labo bottle sitting in your shower, but the high-end pick sports a high-end price tag — so do yourself a favor and snag the more affordable option. Of course it’s great for its intended use, but did you know baby shampoo can be used for all sorts of other cleansing tasks? Next time you need to give your makeup brushes a deep cleanse, reach for baby shampoo instead of pricey brush cleaner. You can also launder your delicates with a bit diluted in warm water.

Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. For as long as I’ve been obsessed with skin care, there’s always been one jaw-dropping product comparison I’ve often heard being made: The Nivea Creme and Crème de la Mer. One is an affordable drugstore moisturizer first introduced in 1911, and the other, a famous luxury formula that will set you back at least $100 for just half an ounce. With such a colossal price difference, it seemed impossible to me that these two creams could perform so similarly, much less contain a similar list of ingredients as so many people on TikTok and elsewhere had claimed. After speaking with dermatologists, I got the real scoop on their similarities and their differences. “Nivea Creme and Crème de la Mer are likely compared to one anotherbecause there is significant overlap in the ingredients that appear atthe beginning of their ingredient lists,” explained Dr. Brendan Camp, a board-certified dermatologist with MDCS Dermatology in New York City. According to Camp, this order of ingredients is important to note because the ingredients listed first are the most present in a product. Manhattan Beach, California-based board-certified dermatologist Dr. Divya Shokeen Khalsa said that both creams are designed to nourish and hydrate, improve skin barrier function as well as skin texture and appearance. Shokeen Khalsa explained that some of these shared ingredients include glycerin, a favored humectant that draws moisture into the skin and panthenol (provitamin B5), which soothes and heals using anti-inflammatory properties. She mentioned that the two moisturizers have a comparable rich and thick consistency, in part to the inclusion of lanolin alcohol and petroleum, an emollient-rich and occlusive combination that works to soften skin and lock-in moisture — kind of like how people use petroleum jelly to slug their skin. Unsurprisingly, the ingredient list is also where the most notable differences lie. “Crème de la Mer’s formula is centered around its ‘Miracle Broth,’” Shokeen Khalsa said. ”[This] is a fermented mix of sea kelp and other nutrients, along with a bio-fermentation process that the company claims makes the product unique.” According to La Mer, this secretive solution is what helps to repair visible signs of premature skin aging, rejuvenates the complexion and is what makes this cream so sought after. Shokeen Khalsa notes that the coveted recipe is also packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals — a contrast to Nivea, which she said “has a more straightforward formula, which while effective, does not boast the same proprietary components or the extensive research and development that La Mer does.” But before you sheepishly retrieve your wallet and shell out $100 or more for a face cream, Camp said that certain moisturizers can perform similarly even when their ingredient lists vary. With this guidance, it could be safe to assume that, when it comes to moisturizers, you don’t necessarily need to pay for something top-dollar as long as a cream is doing its job as a hydrator. And many people attest to the Nivea Creme doing just that, even if it doesn’t boast the same composition as La Mer. Intended for use on the body, face and hands, reviewers claim that Nivea has provided relief for damaged, flaking skin when nothing else would and has even helped to minimize the appearance of fine lines and dryness-related wrinkles. You can read them for yourself down below or buy a budget-friendly tin from any of the links above. Promising Amazon reviews for the Nivea Cream: “I had seen a video online that compared this product to a very expensive high end cream moisturizer that I use daily. The comparison, done by chemists, showed the two products to be surprisingly similar. I decided to purchase this and was amazed at how much product comes for such a low price. Is it the same as the high-end luxury moisturizer? No. But it is a lovely alternative. I use this product a couple of times a week. I do recommend it. Great value. Very good product.” — S. Kessler “This moisturizer is used for the entire body and face. You don’t need anything fancy since it is probably the best product out there that does a great job for dry skin. I have also used La Mer and I really haven’t seen the difference.” — Katherine L., NY NY “Leaves my skin moisturized without feeling greasy. My late grandma used to use this cream and her skin was always so health, smooth, and youthful looking. Don’t waste your money on expensive creams. This is all you need” — Travel Bug “My hand had a wire brush hit the top of it, it was dry cracked and hurting for about a week and was not getting better until i put this on it, immediate pain relief and no more cracking.” — Brandon Centeno “I’ve been using it almost 2 months on my face and to my surprise my laugh lines around the mouth have actually become finer and less noticeable.

They can be a breeze to slip on and off, provide some much-needed relief and arch support after a long day of wearing structured shoes or being on your feet and can even add a dash of style to an otherwise casual at-home look. While many turn to ultra-popular Crocs shoes to fill this void, the supremely popular foam shoe just isn’t for me, so I’ve been searching high and low for a stylish alternative that looks as good as it feels. I’ve been gravitating towards a slightly more classic rubber clog style, and am delighted to find quite a few sophisticated and timeless options available for purchase. Below, I’ve rounded up a few fabulous garden clogs in a range of colors, styles and price points. Having one of these cuties at your disposal is essential, whether you have an expansive backyard garden or just a small city balcony like me. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. If the standard garden clog isn't warm enough for your feet, reviewers insist that this cozy design keeps feet nice and toasty. This affordable clog is made with a soft EVA foam material that's resistant to water and lined with plush faux fur. They have a lattice-textured outer sole to prevent slipping and can be found in seven colors and women's sizes 6-14. Promising Amazon review: ""I had to wear shoes without backs (mules or sandals) all winter because of an Achilles tendon problem. My feet were freezing and the several brand name shoes I bought were too narrow even when I ordered a wide. I ordered these inexpensive, furry, wide, plastic mules hoping for a miracle. These shoes were wide enough that my feet fit under the upper part. My feet were kept as warm as possible. These are the only shoes I have worn (even on warm days) since receiving them . The fur is mashed down but the shoes are still comfy. They are great for wearing around the house and go great with blue jeans, or most dress slacks for when I go out. My podiatrist even noticed how well they worked for me."" — Deborah Davis Jones Blundstone is known for crafting some of the most reliable and durable work boots in the land and the brand's applied those same design features in its premium leather and water-resistant clog. These slip-resistant shoes have a cushioned footbed and a shock-absorbing heel for all-day comfort and a lightweight outsole. They also promise to be easy to clean so fear not if you need to trek through mud or damp gardens. Shop them in three neutral colors and sizes 6-11, half sizes included. Sorel's Caribou Clog is a fun and modern play on a traditional garden clog with super chunky construction and a platform sole. They are entirely made from waterproof injection-molded EVA and feature a lightweight foam underfoot cushion so each step feels marshmallowy and supported plus, Sorel's signature high-traction outer sole promises fewer slips. Nordstrom currently has these in four fun colors, while the Sorel site offers them in a bright coral, an iridescent white shade and a neutral tan. You can find them in women's sizes 5-11. Promising Nordstrom review: ""Life changers! These are the best for the winter too! I have another color for summer and now I love these for winter... they are very warm. They are also stable, i never roll over in them, never! So easy to kick on and off. Wear them every day.

They are wonderful. I can slip them on, walk down the gravel driveway to the mail box and back. I slip them off when I get in the house. My feet are dry and comfortable, very good soles. I don't [feel] the rocks on the drive way and my feet really are dry when I get back to the house. These shoes are exactly what I was hoping for since I slip in and out of shoes a lot of times a day. Sloggers are great. I bought my shoe size. Many comments said buy one size larger and others said larger was way to big. I took my chances and my size 9's fit just right.

I bought a size 8 and they're a little roomy so l always wear thick socks. With thick socks they are just right. I usually wear these in cooler months so it's nice to have on cozy socks in a plastic shoe. These have surprisingly good arch support, fabric lining, and it feels like a memory foam footbed. I am not sure if it is, but it's that comfortable. I feel like l am wearing a shoe and not a clunky rain boot so they are easy to walk in. The fabric around the ankle ensures only soft material is against your skin. Since these are plastic l doubt if they'll wear out, but if they do l will buy them again."" — Lucy These EVA clogs are a great affordable alternative to another popular brand with a similar silhouette.

They were initially designed as the slip-on version of boots that are typically worn on the deck of Alaskan commercial fishing boats, so you know they're made to last. They're available in women's sizes 6-11.Promising review: ""I'm a big fan of Xtratuf & the clogs were such a good deal I couldn't refuse. If you own a pair, you know there really isn't a 1/2 size option. I end up going down a size knowing I will still have room for a pair of thinner wool socks to start out with. They do stretch a little & fit to your foot without being too narrow. These came in the original box & are the real deal.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. We’ve covered Brooks sneakers before at HuffPost — namely the Ghost 14, a highly-rated running shoe beloved by the older women that we know, in addition to scores of HuffPost readers. In researching for that story, we learned Brooks were gladly worn by not only runners but also older active folks, orthotic wearers, people recovering from foot, knee and hip surgeries and really, anyone who likes a roomy “toe box.” Lucky for us, the brand just launched the Ghost 16, the newest iteration of this reader-beloved style. This latest version of the Ghost is partially made with recycled materials, offering an EVA foam and rubber midsole that gives you a neutral cushion without being bulky. Where older models of the Ghost have soles infused with air, the 16 model uses nitrogen to be extra lightweight, and “floaty-feeling” per the brand. The 16 also offers an extra grippy rubber outsole, providing traction on uneven ground and making the shoes even more durable. The enhanced air mesh upper promises breathability while still offering a secure fit and the sole is specially designed to lessen extra pressure on the balls of your feet as you walk or run. Certified pedorthist Michael Fishkin also named Brooks as a supportive and comfortable option for adults, saying it’s a top-recommended brand for patients. Reviews for earlier models of the Ghost say these kicks are great for hiking, traveling, playing with kids and grandkids, running errands and just hanging out. If you’re in the market for a solid pair of sneakers, the Ghost 16 is the newest option from a revered brand. It’s a fuss-free sneaker that’s intended to keep you balanced and smooth-moving, wherever your feet take you. Both the women’s and men’s styles come in seven colorways and offer narrow, wide and extra-wide options. The women’s sizes run 5-13 and men’s 7-15. If you’d like to hear more about users’ experience with the 16, we’ve rounded up some promising reviews from the Brooks website: “Great updated ghost. I always gravitate towards Ghost when looking for a new pair of runners/walkers, and this new pair is the best. So comfortable right out of the box. Springy and supportive... like Im floating on air. Worth every penny” — jeanne m “These shoes are wonderful! I work in healthcare and I’m on my feet most of the day. My feet are very picky and I need comfortable shoes. I ordered these on a whim because I liked the color. I could not be happier with these and will be ordering more.” —Regina S “Ghost shoes are the best. They are comfortable, wear well, and fit well. Love that they fit the same from year to year, which isn’t always the case; this makes it easy to feel comfortable ordering them online.” —Connie B “Comfortable shoes, lightweight and room in the toe box. Shoe fits true to size. Love the colors.” —Michelle R “I love the Ghost 16. They are comfortable. The cushioning and support are great. The toe box seems to be a little wider, which I like. I don’t have any negative comments on this sneaker. I rotate between Ghost 16 and Ghost Max.” — Cindy A “I am so far liking the new Ghost 16. It has a snugger feel to it and very nice cushioning. It feels more supportive because of the snugger fit and that has been particularly good for my right foot because I had a very bad ankle fracture and dislocation that has left that foot much weaker than my other one. Because of a bunion I have had for years, the snugger fit is a little tight in that one area, but so far, it has not interfered with me being able to run. The shoe is also very light and responsive.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hacks-season-3-review_n_662ffa19e4b0c9bc87587548,'Hacks' Knows Exactly What It’s Doing — And That’s What Makes It Great,marina fang,5/2/2024,"On paper, “Hacks” could have been — excuse the pun — a hacky premise: a generational clash between a boomer comedian and a Gen Z comedy writer forced to work together. Insert some low-hanging jokes about their differences, and call it a day. But the Max comedy series has always been richer and deeper than that, thanks to creators Lucia Aniello, Paul W. Downs and Jen Statsky — veterans of great TV comedies like “Broad City” and “The Good Place” — and an ensemble of extremely funny actors led by television icon Jean Smart. In 2021, the show’s first season mined real-world parallels to create a perfect tonal alchemy, uproarious one minute, poignant the next. Smart’s character, fictional comedy legend Deborah Vance, evoked lots of real-life women in entertainment who have been unfairly maligned, misunderstood and written off. And Deborah’s relationship with her writer Ava (Hannah Einbinder) was always much more complex than a simple pairing of two mismatched people or a toxic boss managing an entitled new employee. Add in a rich tapestry of supporting characters, including Deborah and Ava’s long-suffering manager Jimmy (played by Downs), his inept assistant Kayla (Meg Stalter), Deborah’s devoted but perpetually overworked CEO Marcus (Carl Clemons-Hopkins) and striving assistant Damian (Mark Indelicato). Seamlessly weave in some mordantly funny meta-commentary on the entertainment industry, and you’ve got comedy gold. Season 2 found new ways to do the same things that made the first season great, taking the characters on the road as Deborah tests out new material for what becomes a career-defining comedy special. It ends with one of the show’s best scenes, where Deborah fires Ava — but does so out of respect and love, so Ava can go find her own comedic voice. Ava tearfully tells Deborah: “I want to be wherever you are.” It was a reminder of yet another clever and sneakily brilliant trick the show had been pulling all along: making a rom-com about work. So it should come as no surprise that the third season of “Hacks,” premiering Thursday, is once again funny as hell, while also warm and poignant. Over nine sharp and succinct episodes, just when you think the show’s central dynamics might get repetitive, “Hacks” keeps finding new ways to push things forward. Season 3 opens a year after Deborah and Ava’s separation. Ava is thriving in a coveted staff writing job on a “Last Week Tonight”-like show, and seemingly has a healthier relationship with her on-again-off-again girlfriend Ruby (Lorenza Izzo). Deborah, riding high off the success of her special, is figuring out what comes next. But we know where this is going. “Hacks” doesn’t really work without the work marriage of Deborah and Ava, so they’re bound to get back together again — and they do. By Episode 2, when Deborah gets the opportunity to pursue her deferred dream of hosting a late-night talk show, she rehires Ava, setting up the central storyline of the season. The themes and character dynamics we know and love keep evolving. As she makes the case that she should be the next late-night host, Deborah wonders if she can even say her ambitions out loud, knowing all too well how being ambitious puts women in a bind. Meanwhile, a more seasoned Ava is learning how to set boundaries with Deborah and be a better advocate for herself. All of the show’s main characters are once again navigating their relationships to their work and figuring out whether they can ever untether their identities from their jobs. Another work marriage on “Hacks,” the one between Jimmy and Kayla, also gets to transform in new and surprising ways. Kayla remains laugh-out-loud funny, while also revealing some depth as a person who secretly does care about her job. Meanwhile, Marcus, who has long been married to his job, is wondering whether to finally put himself first over his devotion to Deborah. The show has few flaws, if any, but the viewer might wish that Clemons-Hopkins, Indelicato and some of the other ensemble players had more to do. There are a lot of character dynamics to juggle, particularly with this season’s impressive roster of guest stars. Perhaps unavoidably, some of the show’s recurring characters get short shrift — though many of them do get at least one centerpiece moment to shine. “Hacks” is at its best when it keeps finding new ways to turn familiar tropes into something unexpected. For example, there’s a climactic airport scene that encapsulates how the show continues to take rom-com tropes and apply them to work-related situations.

But the presumptive GOP nominee isn’t always in dreamland when his eyes are closed, she added. “Sometimes he is closing his eyes — and I’ve talked to people around him about this too — because that is how he tries to just basically stay calm and deal with it,” Haberman explained. “And whether that then leads to sleep or whatever, who knows, but he is sitting there with his eyes closed for long periods of time. It’s not always sleeping,” she added. Collins said she’d “noticed this” when in the courtroom. Trump is “very clearly awake but his eyes are closed for a minute at a time, […] it’s like he doesn’t want to hear what they are saying,” the CNN anchor suggested. Haberman replied, “I think it’s a compartmentalization method and he’s pretty good at compartmentalizing.” Watch the video here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) slammed the petroleum industry on Wednesday as he pointed to experts who described Big Oil’s “pattern of lying and evasion” that has “set the country back decades” in its ability to address climate change. “Instead of acting like Paul Revere and sounding the alarm about climate change, they acted like Maleficent the evil fairy in ‘Sleeping Beauty’ and cursed everyone to try to go to sleep for 100 years,” said Raskin during a Senate Budget Committee hearing. Raskin’s remarks came after that committee and the House Oversight Committee released a 65-page report following a three-year investigation into oil and gas companies’ “evolving efforts to avoid accountability for climate change.” The Maryland Democrat described calling a House Oversight hearing in 2019 where scientists and experts testified that the companies “knew” that burning fossil fuels caused climate change as early as 1959. “The year the first Barbie Doll appeared in the United States, the year Alaska and Hawaii were admitted to the Union — by the 1960s, before Neil Armstrong even walked on the moon, the science of global warming was well understood by Big Oil,” Raskin noted. The report focused on several companies, including Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP, the American Petroleum Institute and the Chamber of Commerce, described as having “obstructed and delayed the committees’ investigation.” He said, “Our investigation uncovered compelling evidence of aggressive industry deceit, which continued long after Big Oil gave up on its outright climate denialism.” The next four years will change America forever.

A lot. Reporters at his criminal trial in the Stormy Daniels hush money case say Trump keeps falling asleep during the proceedings, with MSNBC’s Lisa Rubin saying his attorneys are even trying different tricks to keep the former president awake, but to no avail. Trump may not be quite as tough as Habba thinks, either: The former president has repeatedly complained that he’s cold in court, and his attorneys have asked the judge to turn up the heat. Habba is not representing Trump in the hush money case but is frequently on TV defending the former president. Critics fired back on X, formerly Twitter: Even Kim Jong Un doesn’t expect this level of sycophantic nonsense https://t.co/VaZXIRou1o That's - literally - an incorrect use of the word ""literally.""

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kimberly-guilfoyle-kristi-noem-dog-claim_n_66332d1ce4b0849b2ede35ea,Kimberly Guilfoyle Floats Wild Theory About Kristi Noem’s Dog-Killing Admission,lee moran,5/2/2024,"Kimberly Guilfoyle on Wednesday tossed out a strange theory to explain away South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s dog-killing admission. One America News Network host Dan Ball asked Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr., “why the hell” Noem would have copped in her new memoir to once shooting her 14-month-old pup dead. The admission has been condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike with commentators on both sides of the aisle suggesting it has tanked Noem’s bid to become presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump’s running mate. “It makes no sense. I don’t understand,” said Guilfoyle. “I’ve always liked Gov. Noem. She works very hard, tirelessly on behalf of the movement.” Guilfoyle, who works with the no-kill animal welfare organization Furry Friends, cited her previous legal work as an animal abuse prosecutor as why the issue of animal rights is “something I take really seriously.” “I just can’t imagine that because there’s a forever home for all animals,” explained Guilfoyle, who was ostensibly on the show to promote her new dog-themed children’s book “The Princess and Her Pup.” Then she floated the theory: “I don’t know what happened, maybe somebody slipped that in and she didn’t see it. I don’t know, but it doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, so that’s a tough one to take.” The theory seems unlikely, though, given how Noem has since doubled down on the admission, spinning it as proving her decisive leadership skills and ability to do difficult things when needed. Ball admitted there were “tough decisions” to be made on farms before regaling Guilfoyle with a story about his dad once shooting their dog dead after it was hit by a car, saying it’s a “different world today.” Guilfoyle countered by saying there were organizations like Furry Friends that offer help to animals that have been “terribly abused and abandoned that need serious medical care.” Guilfoyle reportedly began dating former President Donald Trump’s eldest son in 2018, the same year she left Fox News amid allegations of sexual harassment.

(AP) — A Pennsylvania man who credits an alligator named Wally for helping relieve his depression for nearly a decade says he is searching for the reptile after it went missing during a vacation to the coast of Georgia. Joie Henney has thousands of social media users following his pages devoted to Wally, the cold-blooded companion that he calls his emotional support alligator. He has posted photos and videos online of people petting the 5 1/2-foot (1.7 meter) alligator like a dog or hugging it like a teddy bear. Wally’s popularity soared to new heights last year when the gator was denied entry to a Philadelphia Phillies game. Now Henney said he is distraught after Wally vanished while accompanying him on an April vacation in Brunswick, Georgia, a port city 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of Savannah. He said he suspects someone stole Wally from the fenced, outdoor enclosure where Wally spent the night on April 21. In social media posts, Henney said pranksters left Wally outside the home of someone who called authorities, resulting in his alligator being trapped and released into the wild. “We need all the help we can get to bring my baby back,” Henney said in a tearful video posted on TikTok. “Please, we need your help.” Henney said he didn’t have time to talk when The Associated Press reached him by phone Wednesday morning. He did not immediately return follow-up messages. The man from Jonestown, Pennsylvania, has previously said he obtained Wally in 2015 after the alligator was rescued in Florida at the age of 14 months. Henney told The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2019 that Wally helped alleviate depression following the deaths of several close friends. He said a doctor treating his depression had endorsed Wally’s status as his emotional support animal. “He has never tried to bite no one,” Henney told the newspaper. No one has filed police reports about the missing alligator in Brunswick and surrounding Glynn County, according to spokespersons for the city and county police departments. The Georgia Department of Natural Resources confirmed that someone in the Brunswick area reported a nuisance alligator on April 21 — the day Henney said Wally went missing — and that a licensed trapper was dispatched to capture it. The agency said in a statement that the gator was “released in a remote location,” but stressed that it doesn’t know if the reptile was Wally. It’s illegal in Georgia for people to keep alligators without a special license or permit, and the state Department of Natural Resources says it doesn’t grant permits for pet gators. Pennsylvania has no state law against owning alligators, though it is illegal for owners to release them into the wild, according to its Fish and Boat Commission. David Mixon, a wildlife biologist and coastal supervisor for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, has handled plenty of alligators reported in people’s yards and swimming pools. He has also shown gators kept in captivity in presentations to school groups and Boy Scout troops. He said even alligators that seem docile can be dangerous, and he always makes sure to hold their mouths closed with a hand or, preferably, a band. “They’re unpredictable, and they’re often reactive to stimulus,” Mixon said. “There’s lots of videos and pictures where people handle gators, and they do it without getting hurt. But the more time you spend around them, the more likely you are to be injured.” State wildlife officials in neighboring Florida, home to an estimated 1.3 million alligators, have recorded more than 450 cases of unprovoked alligators biting humans since 1948. That includes more than 90 gator bites since 2014, six of them fatal. In areas where people can legally own alligators, it is possible for them to be considered emotional support animals, said Lori Kogan, a psychologist and Colorado State University professor who studies interactions between humans and animals. Unlike service animals that help people with disabilities such as blindness or post-traumatic stress, emotional support animals have no special training, Kogan said. They also don’t have any official registry, though health professionals often write letters of endorsement for owners with a diagnosed mental health condition.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/money-rules-financial-advice_l_66326dbfe4b0fc2b9527f977,7 Surprising Money ‘Rules’ Most People Don’t Know (But Should),sarah bourassa,5/2/2024,"You’ve probably heard common financial advice like keeping a budget and trying not to spend more than you make. But other tips aren’t as well-known that can help you save a lot of money and create a financially healthy life. From daily hacks to long-term tips, we talked to financial experts about not-so-obvious money advice they follow. Here’s what to know: “A low price on a lousy product is actually a terrible deal because you will end up spending more, in the long run, to replace cheaply made items that break easily,” Andrea Woroch, a consumer-finance and budgeting expert, told HuffPost. “Focus on quality and spend more if it means it will last.” Woroch tries to save on quality merchandise by shopping second-hand for name brands. For big-ticket items, she recommends taking advantage of retail sales events (like Amazon Prime Day) and buying seasonal items (like patio furniture and winter clothing) at the end of the season. Other tips: Participate in free loyalty programs and search for online coupons before making a purchase. “Although a detailed budget keeps you on track to meet your financial goals, one that is too restrictive will actually backfire quickly due to burnout,” Woroch explained. “[And] if you try to change all your spending habits overnight, it will be difficult to stick to the plan.” Instead, she suggests making a few small changes to your spending and savings habits — and then building on these once they become routine. She said it’s also important to make room in your budget for expenses that matter to you. For example, if a dinner date with a friend or partner is a priority, keep this in your budget. Find other ways to cut down on spending, like canceling unused subscriptions and unplugging gadgets to decrease energy bills. “It’s extraordinarily easy now in our society to spend money without thinking about it,” said Anne Lester, author of “Your Best Financial Life.” “You can sign up for auto-renew … you see something cute on Instagram, you go tap and boom, you bought it.” But being able to buy things too easily can lead to unconscious spending. Instead, Lester advises slowing yourself down to make spending money more of a conscious decision. One way she does this is to always create a shopping list before she goes into a store or buys items online. For online shopping, she suggests setting aside a specific time once a week to make purchases. When reviewing your list, ask yourself: Do I really need this? Is there a tangible moment when I know I’ll use this? Just making the list will give you time to reflect on whether the purchase is worthwhile. For subscriptions, it can be easy to forget ones set to “auto-renew.” Lester suggests doing a “subscription cleanse” periodically, reviewing all your subscriptions and canceling the ones you’re no longer using. “You should automate everything you can about saving so that you don’t have to make a conscious decision to do it,” Lester said. “[If you don’t] you set up a conversation … with yourself about what you could be doing with that money, and often you lose because getting stuff is more fun than saving.” Michael Finke, professor of wealth management at The American College of Financial Services, suggests setting up an automatic transfer to a high-yield savings account. For example, if you get paid at the end of the month, you can set up a transfer on the first day of the next month. “Money in a checking account can be tempting to spend,” he said. “Making regular transfers to a high-yield savings account can help you build an emergency fund without feeling the pain of writing a check.” Lester also recommends automatically transferring money to a retirement account. If you work for a company that offers a 401(k) plan, it’s ideal to sign up for the full employer match. “Not taking advantage of a match is like leaving hundred-dollar bills on the ground,” Finke explained. “Even if you took it out after a year and paid a 10% penalty, you’d still come out way ahead.” If you don’t have access to a 401(k) plan through work, you can set up an individual retirement account (IRA) and still have money automatically transferred, Lester explained. When reviewing your credit card statements, it’s easy to just focus on the bigger charges. But it’s actually key to also review the smaller line items. “Not every fraudulent charge is a four-figure shopping spree,” Sara Rathner, personal finance expert at NerdWallet, told HuffPost. “Often, thieves test your card out with a few purchases of just a few dollars.” These purchases are easy to overlook, and if you miss them, bigger fraudulent charges could follow later on. Rathner advises checking your credit card statements monthly, and if you see something you don’t recognize (even a few-dollar charge), report it to your credit card company immediately. “[While] most of my clients have at least one long-term [investment] account, I encourage them to consider opening another investment account for mid-term goals,” said Elaine King, a certified financial planner and founder of Family and Money Matters. Mid-term goals could include buying a home, paying for education, purchasing an investment property or starting a business. “When separating investment accounts, we aim to match the portfolio allocation to the specific goals and time horizon and, in the end, save you time and money,” she explained. For example, if buying a home is on the short-term horizon, the “real estate fund” should be invested in short-term assets. “Personal finances [are] personal and seasonal … [they should be] based on values [and] life circumstances,” said Kara Stevens, founder of The Frugal Feminista and author of “Heal Your Relationship With Money.” Once you understand that other people’s priorities are not the same as yours, “you’ll be able to better identify the tools … that make the most sense for you.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/spine-back-pain-advice_l_66324140e4b0fc2b9527d375,"I'm A Spine Doctor. Here's 1 Thing I'd Never, Ever Do If I Had Back Pain.",alexandra frost,5/2/2024,"An estimated 8% of American adults suffer from persistent or chronic back pain that limits their daily activities. Spine doctors have a very specific message for people walking around with back pain: Don’t push through. This is especially true with one specific combination of movements, according to Dr. Arthur Jenkins, a spine surgeon and neurosurgeon for the New York Jets and the NFL Retired Players Program. Jenkins has an initialism for back pain sufferers: BLT, or bending, lifting and twisting. It’s a dangerous combination when done all at once for those with preexisting back pain, he explained. Experts would avoid doing this at all costs if they’re dealing with back pain. Here’s what to know: According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, people with back pain might be at risk for a disk herniation, which is when the disks that provide cushion between the vertebrae in the spine tear or rupture. This can occur after the disks have been bulging first, and that herniation puts pressure on the nerves in the spinal canal. “Many patients walking around with back pain likely already have damage to their disks in their back. They may not have as much ... damage that qualifies them as having a disk herniation, but they are certainly at risk of developing one,” Jenkins said. “A disk herniation typically happens when the outer ring of the disk is damaged, allowing the inner nucleus to squeeze out under pressure. So having existing damage to the annulus certainly predisposes you to more disk herniations, but sometimes it happens all at once.” Bending, lifting and twisting can increase this risk. “Each type of movement increases the pressure in the disk space and can lead to a disk herniation, but all three at once is the worst,” Jenkins said. Take shoveling snow, for example. This “involves lifting and usually a twisting movement where the snow is picked up in one place and thrown off to the side,” Jenkins said. “The person usually has to bend over to put the shovel into the snow, and then ... [when] this weight is heavier than anticipated, such as when the snow is wet, that puts even more stress on the spine.” You may not even realize how often you execute this motion in your everyday life. “Other common examples include lifting a child car seat out of a car door,” Jenkins said. “In this case, the parent has to stand somewhat crooked because of the way the door opens, and often when wedged in next to another car. They have to lift the car seat ... twist out, and there is usually some bending involved since the car seat is usually below the chest level.” Moving luggage when traveling is another example. Pretty much anytime you need to contort your body, it can cause problems “if the weight is not adequately anticipated and the lifter was not engaging their core in a conscious and thoughtful way to reduce the stress on the spine itself,” Jenkins said. Instead of a BLT, follow Jenkins’ personal method for lifting instead: Engaging your core is key to protecting your back. The core muscles, namely the abdominals, work with back muscles to stabilize the back itself, Jenkins explained. “Muscles opposing from both the front and the back give a balance of support, and they prevent any and all of the spine levels from moving too much when a force is applied to them,” he said. He recommended that back pain sufferers keep their back and abs as strong as their body will allow. “I find that my back tends to hurt less when I do my core exercises regularly,” he said. “Sometimes if I have forgotten for a week or so, my back will remind me. And then once I start doing the back exercises again, I feel better.” Core moves like plank variations, bridges and dead bugs are all stabilizing exercises you can try. These might be done on your own, or with the help of a trainer or physical therapist, depending on the extent of your injuries and pain. You can engage your core far beyond the gym for extra stability and protection, though, especially if you find yourself in a BLT-type situation. Simply contract your abdominal muscles by pulling your bellybutton toward your spine. With practice, it might even become a natural posture for you. “If you are lifting, keep the load close to the core and use the legs,” said Dr. Meredith Warner, an orthopedic surgeon, an author and the founder of Well Theory. “One way to help your back out is to get strong quadriceps muscles. This allows you to use your legs to lift more easily.” She added: “For loads a bit away from the core that must be lifted off a floor, putting a leg behind you as a counterbalance helps, too. This works if one has balance, obviously.” Twisting by itself is a natural motion for the spine and critical to human function, she noted. In addition to the back and abs, consider adjacent muscles that you need to strengthen. “Hip strength is important as well,” Warner said. “Strong hips can take some stress away from the lumbar muscles.” Many people worry that the only way to find relief from herniated disks is through surgery. While surgery is an option, Warner said that various cases of back pain can also be managed without it ― and not all back pain is caused by disk issues. Up to 90% of Americans can expect to deal with back pain at some point, making it a somewhat annoying but normal part of aging in many instances, she noted. “Many people begin to have pain during adolescence or the early 20s,” Warner said. “Back pain is now understood as a chronic condition with normal episodes of waxing and waning discomfort. Rarely is there a true injury.” She added, “Most of the pain is due to the very complex interactions between the musculoskeletal system, human physiology, the brain and other factors.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/skin-aging-well_l_6626aee5e4b04378c08b0ea3,5 Good Signs Your Skin Is Actually Aging Well,sydney wingfield,5/2/2024,"We all know the telltale signs that your skin isn’t aging well — sun spots, deep wrinkles and dry skin are just three things to look out for. If you’re a smoker, you may notice deeper wrinkles and dry skin. If you’ve lacked sun protection over the years, you may experience hyperpigmentation. But what are the signs that your skin is on the right path? The aging process can look extremely different from person to person, and there can be certain noticeable signals that you’ve taken good care of your body throughout your life. Dermatologist Dr. Hadley King says that lifestyle factors such as your sleep schedule, exercise routine and stress will also contribute to how your skin ages. We spoke with two dermatologists to help us determine the five signs your skin is actually aging well. When it comes to your wound healing, how quickly you heal can easily show the health of your skin and how it is aging. If your skin heals from an open cut within a week or so, “This means your diet has enough protein to help with wound healing, [or that you have] a healthy immune system [or maybe] good genes,” dermatologist Dr. Lauren Moy explained. If you’re dealing with a more serious wound, it should heal within four to six weeks, per National Library of Medicine. So how do you know if your wound is healing well? If you’ve had a cut, your body goes into repair mode to restore its skin barrier, forming a scab. This protects your wound, allowing the skin underneath it to heal. You’ll know it’s healed when your skin is fading from a pink color to closer to your skin tone, and the wound will flatten out and soften. There are a handful of factors to consider when it comes to your skin healing from an injury, especially as you’re getting older. Two in particular are skin moisture and nutrition. Wound Care Inc. reports that moisture is extremely important for healing wounds. When skin is dry, it’s more at risk for skin lesions, infections and thickening — all of which will hinder the rate of wound healing. When your body isn’t fueled with nutrients for cell repair and growth, your wound will heal at a slower pace. Since your body uses protein to build and repair skin, a high-protein diet can help ensure your skin is healing well. This is something to keep in mind as you age, since your skin will take longer to heal. If your skin feels smooth the majority of the time, you can assume that your skin is aging well. This is most likely due to a lack of sun damage, as well as hydrated skin. You also probably have your skin care routine down to a T. When your skin looks and feels consistently well hydrated and not dry or itchy, this means you’re doing a good job at moisturizing well after showering or washing your face. Oftentimes, those who have dry skin and experience scaly patches lack hydration, which prevents skin from feeling smooth. When your skin isn’t hydrated, “natural hyaluronic acid, glycosaminoglycans, and other elements of the extracellular matrix can decrease with age, making the skin less hydrated and bouncy,” King explained. If your face is maintaining its facial volume or fat as you age, it’s a very good sign. King says that the factors that largely affect your facial volume are “sun exposure and other extrinsic aging factors, [which] can expedite the loss of healthy elastin fibers in our skin, increasing laxity and decreasing elasticity.” “The collagen scaffolding in our skin provides skin strength and structure,” King added. So, when your facial volume is in good shape, you can guarantee that your skin has healthy collagen and elasticity. These components contribute to skin looking youthful and aging slowly. Moy says that if you have minimal sun spots — those flat, light brown spots on your face — this means that throughout your life, your cumulative sun exposure has been minimal, and you’ve done a great job protecting your skin well. It’s commonly known that the sun is simply not good for your skin. “Daily sun-smart behavior is one of the most important things we can do to help our skin age well,” King explained. So, if you don’t use sun protection while outside, you are more at risk of seeing uneven skin tone and discoloration. “Much of the sun damage that accumulates in our skin is the result of daily incidental sun exposure,” she added. However, if your skin is even toned and there isn’t really any discoloration, this is a sign that your skin is aging in the ideal and healthy way. “Over time, chronic sun exposure can increase dark spots, redness and yellowish discoloration in the skin,” King said. Another culprit of discoloration is blue light from the screens of your phone, TV and other devices. “We’re spending a lot of time on our screens lately, and we’ve learned that blue light can not only affect our sleep and harm our eyes, it can also cause discoloration and aging of our skin,” King explained. You can take precautions by using special products that protect your skin from the effects of blue light and other environmental stressors (like these from Ilia and PCA Skin). If you’ve abstained from smoking throughout your life, you’ve given your skin the opportunity to age properly and in a healthy way. “Smoking increases fine lines and wrinkles and leads to drier skin and many other complications deeper than the skin,” Moy explained.

Some short-term effects of smoking can include yellowing of the fingers and nails and teeth discoloration, which may also make you look older than you are.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/msg-in-asian-food_l_662669fee4b08151cacaf746,Many Americans Have Villainized MSG — And Now It's Making A Comeback,julie kendrick,5/2/2024,"After years of defensively touting “No MSG” on their menus, many Asians working in the food industry are not only fighting back against stereotyping of this heritage ingredient — they’re proudly featuring monosodium glutamate, or MSG, on their menus. If you like to eat authentic Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese or Korean food, your taste buds are likely already familiar with MSG, since all those cultures regularly use it in cooking. MSG is a naturally occurring kind of salt, described scientifically as the “sodium salt of the common amino acid glutamic acid.” It’s present in our bodies and in many glutamate-rich foods like soy sauce, anchovies, tomatoes and cheese. Chefs use it as a flavor enhancer for both savory and sweet menu items since it provides a punch of pure umami, one of the five tastes that also include sweet, sour, salty and bitter. According to MSG manufacturer Aji-no-moto, umami means “delicious savory taste” in Japanese, and its taste is often described as the meaty, savory quality that deepens flavor. It can also be used as a way to reduce salt in a dish, since MSG contains approximately 12% sodium vs. 40% sodium in salt. More umami and less sodium? It’s no wonder places like Mission Chinese in San Francisco have put MSG shakers next to the salt and pepper. There’s even one line of hard seltzer, Lunar, which advertises “a pinch of MSG” in some of its drinks. “I grew up in an Asian household, and I never knew MSG had such a bad reputation, since my parents always used it,” said Dan Q. Dao, a Vietnamese American food writer. “After learning more about the negative propaganda surrounding it, I was sort of shocked. But in some ways, it’s not all that surprising. After all, in America, Asian food was often stereotyped as cheap and low quality. It took lots of independent research and self-education on my part to understand that the claims made against MSG were rooted in racism.” Those claims, which Dao correctly noted have been disproved, include reports of weakness, numbness, palpitations and headaches after eating food containing MSG, often Chinese food. The misconceptions around the ingredient are plentiful. Korean American chef Kate Telfeyan pointed out one of the biggest blunders: “People think MSG is chemical, but it’s actually plant-derived.” According to the website for Aji-no-moto, a leading producer of MSG, it’s produced through fermentation of plant-based ingredients including sugar cane, sugar beets, cassava or corn. But that plant-based origin story hasn’t always been understood or appreciated. “If people don’t want to eat MSG, that’s their choice and prerogative,” said Taiwanese American registered dietitian nutritionist Rebecca Valdez. “I have a greater issue with influencers who use fear, guilt and shame to make people feel they’re not eating ‘clean’ enough, or they’re a bad person for making certain food choices, including foods with MSG.” Noting that MSG is already used in many packaged foods and in restaurants, Korean American Sean Ro, co-founder of Lunar Hard Seltzer, said, “I don’t see a lot of folks vilifying Chick-fil-A or Doritos for containing MSG — which they absolutely do.” Japanese American chef John Sugimura, who is preparing to open a new 10-seat sushi bar in Minneapolis’ Eat Street Crossing, commented on the negative stereotyping by putting it simply: “It stings — ’nuff said.” How did we get here, anyway? In 1968, The New England Journal of Medicine published a letter titled “Chinese-Restaurant Syndrome,” in which a doctor described symptoms he had after eating Chinese food. He speculated that perhaps MSG, soy sauce or cooking wine could have caused the problem. From that one letter, people seized on the idea that the mysterious ingredient known as MSG was the culprit. This shaky theory has been disproved but that hasn’t helped dispel the negative associations. The perception continues despite numerous research studies, such as those described by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration: “Although many people identify themselves as sensitive to MSG, in studies with such individuals given MSG or a placebo, scientists have not been able to consistently trigger reactions.” Tia Rains is a nutrition scientist and vice president of customer engagement and strategic development for the MSG producer Aji-no-moto. She recently told CNN, “When people tell me that they ate at a Chinese food restaurant and they had trouble breathing and tightness in their chest, I get worried — and I’d say, ‘You need to follow up on that because MSG is not an allergen. It’s not going to cause an allergic response. Our bodies make glutamate, so it would not be possible to have an allergy to glutamate.’” Since “salty” and “umami” are two of the five basic tastes, you can see how salt and MSG can complement each other in your home cooking. Taste a little bit of MSG, and you’ll notice that the main flavor is savory, with just a hint of salt. So while you probably won’t want to eliminate salt entirely from recipes, you can introduce that savory boost by combining salt with MSG. Create your own at-home mix of 1 teaspoon finely ground MSG with 2 tablespoons kosher salt, and use it as an all-purpose seasoning wherever you might normally use salt. You can buy MSG by picking up Ac’cent Flavor Enhancer, which is packaged MSG, at any traditional grocery store. And if you’re shopping at an Asian market, look for the Aji-no-moto brand. Many of the chefs we spoke to recommended it. “I’m an Aji-no-moto loyalist,” Telfeyan said. “It’s definitely in my top arsenal of go-to seasonings. While too much of it can be overpowering, I think it adds a really savory quality that, when deployed well, can amplify flavors.” “Adding it judiciously and with an understanding of how much it can alter the flavor of a dish is key to using it properly,” she said. “Like with all seasonings, achieving balance will yield a greater result.” There are many ways to incorporate MSG into recipes. “It’s truly versatile and all-purpose,” Dao said. “You can add it at various stages of cooking, though it’s best to use while being heated, so it can properly dissolve.” Ro said his favorite way to use MSG is in soups. “The depth and flavor that MSG adds is clutch for an amateur cook like me,” he said. “My favorite way to use MSG is to use it when I’m making a veggie sauté dish,” Valdez said. “In many Chinese dishes, we use a bit of meat and fat to add flavor to vegetable dishes, but MSG also works great to enhance flavors and add that umami.” Attitudes about MSG are changing, according to many in the Asian food community. Cookbook author Andrea Nguyen said she didn’t call for any MSG in her first cookbook, “Into the Vietnamese Kitchen,” which was published in 2006. “Even seeing it in a recipe’s ingredient list made some people uncomfortable,” she said. In her latest cookbook, “Ever-Green Vietnamese,” which was published in 2023, recipes call for MSG or an equivalent in Asian mushroom seasoning granules. “I’m encouraging people to play with it. Why let corporations and others determine your MSG experience when you can do it yourself?” she asked. MSG is turning up in less-expected places, too. Lunar Hard Seltzer teamed up with 886, a New York restaurant named for Taiwan’s international calling code, on a pineapple cake drink made with a pinch of Aji-no-moto MSG “for that hit of pastry umami,” the brand stated. A collab with Williamsburg’s Cantonese American restaurant Bonnie’s yielded a salted kumquat beverage, also made with MSG. “Given each of these restaurants’ fight against the xenophobia-rooted vilification of MSG, we all were incredibly proud and excited to create the first-ever hard seltzers with MSG in them,” Ro said.

A similar shift is emerging in the restaurant scene, chefs said. “The narrative and negative connotation MSG had is definitely changing with the younger generation, and there are more and more people like me who are proudly using it and advertising that we’re using it,” said Calvin Eng, the Chinese American owner and chef at Bonnie’s, which created that hard seltzer flavor with Lunar. Eng’s cookbook, “Salt, Sugar + MSG,” is slated for publication in March of next year. “I use MSG not only in savory dishes, but in desserts and drinks, too,” he said. Eng calls on MSG as a workhorse in his busy kitchen, including dissolving it in water as a vegetable blanch for his Garlic-Chive Ranch Dip with Crudités. “We even put it in the name of menu items, like our MSG Martini.” For many Asian American and Pacific Islander food professionals, accepting MSG in their work also can contribute to greater self-acceptance. “For many years, I had a sense of cultural limbo that characterized my life,” Sugimura said. “When I became a fully trained Japanese chef, I began to see my world open up. Asian cuisine delivers a story that certainly resonates not just with me, but with those who want to eat with purpose and meaning. Some foods are deserving of an MSG bump — so deal with it, people.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) received an embarrassing reminder during her visit on Wednesday to an encampment set up by George Washington University students who are protesting Israel’s war in Gaza. The far-right congresswoman was greeted with chants of “Beetlejuice,” a clear reference to her booting from a Denver theater in September for vaping and groping her then-date during a performance of the hit musical. Someone also stood behind Boebert with a sign bearing the production’s name as she addressed protesters via a bullhorn. Boebert toured the encampment with other Republican lawmakers. She accused the protesters of being “very disrespectful” to their fellow students and threatened that Congress could cut the school’s funding. At another point during Boebert’s visit, she unsuccessfully tried to rip down a Palestinian flag that had been put on a statue of George Washington.

President Joe Biden had already been in office more than three months. Biden by this point three years ago had signed dozens of executive orders reversing Trump policies, and signed into law the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion stimulus package aimed at helping the nation out of the COVID-19 pandemic as vaccines became widely available. Trump lost the 2020 election, and wasn’t president three years ago ― and his critics were quick to offer a history lesson: Oh, look— Trump is campaigning for Joe Biden.Welcome to the resistance. That’s true. Trump had been voted out of office for 4 months. That’s how we made America great again. https://t.co/2y3Coqy3wv Donald Trump is really confused.

Kristi Noem (R) declared that she makes “tough decisions” on Wednesday as she doubled down on her defense of shooting and killing her dog after the story from her upcoming memoir sparked backlash. “It was a hard decision and the reason it’s in the book is because this book is filled with tough, challenging decisions that I’ve had to make throughout my life,” Noem told Fox News host Sean Hannity. She continued, “And I hope that people understand from this that what the point of this story is is that most politicians they will run from the truth, they will shy away and hide from making tough decisions.

She recently said that killing one of the working dogs at her ranch wasn’t easy “but often the easy way isn’t the right way.” She has argued that, under South Dakota law, dogs can be put down for attacking and killing livestock.

Matthews told CNN’s Jim Acosta that “competency and experience” will be “out the window” if Trump wins the 2024 election and stacks his administration — as he has vowed to — with loyalists and sycophants. “It’s concerning to think there won’t be people, I believe, of good character staffing him this go-around,” said Matthews. “You’re not going to have the John Kellys and Mark Espers who would push back on him. Instead, it’s going to be a bunch of yes men and women who will do and say what he pleases.” During Trump’s first term, Matthews said staffers “were able to dissuade him from a lot of bad policies by saying, ‘Oh, well this could hurt your reelection chances.’” But “that won’t be a concern” for Trump if he’s reelected, she warned. “So I think that you’re not really going to be able to steer him off of some of these bad policies such as family separation, like we saw in his first term, things like that I believe he would go forward with because he wanted to do that during the first term,” Matthews added.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pro-palestinian-protests-colleges-midwest_n_66330022e4b0849b2ede2445,Protests In Support Of Palestinians Are Spreading Far Beyond Coastal Universities,shruti rajkumar,5/2/2024,"While all eyes in the nation are fixed on the police response to pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University and the University of California, Los Angeles, this week, demonstrations are spreading beyond the Ivy Leagues and universities on the East and West coasts. Students at several colleges and universities in the Midwest have orchestrated pro-Palestinian demonstrations, including encampments and protests, joining students at numerous schools across the country in calling for divestments from companies that do business with Israel. Part of their demands include increased transparency about university ties to Israel and a public denouncement of Israel’s attacks on Gaza as a genocide. On Oct. 7, the militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel in which 1,200 Israelis were killed and about 240 people were taken hostage. In retaliation, Israel has repeatedly launched strikes on the Gaza Strip, resulting in more than 30,000 deaths so far, the displacement of nearly the entire population and a growing famine. The deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli military have prompted a mobilization of college students across the U.S. and the world. Protests at Ivy League schools and larger institutions in major cities have been met with forceful pushback from university officials, many of whom have called in law enforcement to crack down on the demonstrations. Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian rallies at many universities in the Midwest have been able to continue without much police escalation or incidents. On Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators, including faculty and students, gathered on Ohio State University’s campus for a protest in which they chanted, prayed and waved Palestine flags. According to The Columbus Dispatch, the gathering remained peaceful and nonviolent with minimal confrontation with police officers, a contrast to a smaller demonstration at OSU last week that resulted in 36 arrests. Students at the University of Nebraska, University of Kansas and Iowa State University also held protests at their campuses on Wednesday, which remained peaceful and calm throughout the day without any major police intervention, local news outlets reported. “Our positionality in the Midwest is important in this movement because there is a shared fallacy that non-white bodies do not exist,” KU Students for Justice in Palestine said in a social media post. “Midwest is often dismissed as a region of little significance in elections; however, our voices today align and express the same disgust for the ongoing financial support that the U.S. provides toward the genocide of the Palestinian people.” Similar reports were given of a protest at the University of Missouri earlier this week, in part because of “lessons learned” by the college nearly 10 years ago. In 2015, students camped out at the university to protest its failure to address the culture of racism on campus, KMIZ-TV in Columbia, Missouri, reported. Black student athletes also refused to play until then-President Tim Wolfe resigned. Mizzou saw lower applications from prospective students for years following the protests. After the 2015 protest, the University of Missouri changed its policies to prohibit camping on school grounds. On Monday, campus protesters were expected to follow school policies as well as city ordinances. “Yesterday we felt was a very large success for everyone involved,” University of Missouri spokesperson Christian Basi told KMIZ-TV. “The student groups were able to hold their protests. They were able to have their march. They were able to utilize the routes that they wanted to take. At the same time, the university was able to continue its operations.” At the DePaul University in Illinois, students have gathered for a second day at their Chicago encampment, which has not faced police intervention. According to WLS-TV in Chicago, university officials are making a concerted effort not to have their college join the list of schools where violent clashes have occurred, and local police are aiming to keep the campus calm. “With our universities here, people are protesting peacefully. We’re not engaging them in a way that is going to inflame what they are trying to do,” Chicago Police Department Supt. Larry Snelling said, according to WLS-TV. Many right-wing pundits and some news outlets have cast the protests at Ivy League schools and other universities on the coasts in recent weeks as being violent, pointing to graphic scenes of police interventions and unrest. CNN reporter Dana Bash faced backlash on Wednesday for claiming that protesters “lost the plot,” and she compared the fear that Jewish students feel on campus to the treatment of Jewish people in Europe in the 1930s. “Destruction, violence and hate overtake college campuses across the country with Jewish students feeling unsafe at their own schools. It is unacceptable, and harkening back to the 1930s in Europe,” she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Yesterday we felt was a very large success for everyone involved. The student groups were able to hold their protests. ... At the same time, the university was able to continue its operations.” It is unclear whether violence was instigated before or after police intervened at the protests across the country. Some reports indicate that there were clashes between pro-Palestinian protesters and pro-Israel counter-protesters. Many students, faculty and witnesses have claimed that they were attacked by police and counter-protesters, accounts that appear to be corroborated by photos and videos online. Some politicians have called out the police escalation at universities and in cities across the country, pointing out how de-escalation plans have been successfully carried out at protests in other areas.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-palestinians-campus-protests_n_66324a2fe4b05f96b016b944,Police Start Crackdown On Pro-Palestinian Protesters At UCLA Campus,"stefanie dazio, ethan swope, jake offenhartz , joseph b. frederick",5/1/2024,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Police removed barricades and began dismantling a pro-Palestinian demonstrators’ fortified encampment early Thursday at the UCLA campus after hundreds of protesters defied police orders to leave, about 24 hours after counter-protesters attacked a tent encampment on the campus. The law enforcement action comes after officers spent hours threatening arrests over loud speakers if people did not disperse. Hundreds of people had gathered on campus, both inside a barricaded tent encampment and outside of it in support. As police helicopters hovered overhead. The sound of flash-bangs, which produce a bright light and a loud noise to disorient and stun people, could be heard as police moved in, and chants of “where were you last night” could be heard. Police methodically ripped apart the encampment’s barricade of plywood, pallets, metal fences and trash dumpsters and made an opening toward dozens of tents of demonstrators. Police also began to pull down canopies and tents. Demonstrators were holding umbrellas like shields as they faced off with dozens of officers. Some of the protesters warned their fellow demonstrators to be ready with water in case police release tear gas or other irritant. The police action occurred a night after the UCLA administration and campus police waited hours to stop the counter-protesters’ attack. The delay drew condemnation from Muslim students and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Demonstrators rebuilt the makeshift barriers around their tents on Wednesday afternoon while state and campus police watched. Tent encampments of protesters calling on universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread across campuses nationwide in a student movement unlike any other this century. The ensuing police crackdowns echoed actions decades ago against a much larger protest movement protesting the Vietnam War. In the Mideast, Iranian state television carried live images of the police action, as did Qatar’s pan-Arab Al Jazeera satellite network. Live images of Los Angeles also played across Israeli television networks as well. The tense standoff at UCLA came one night after violence instigated by counter-protesters erupted in the same place. The law enforcement presence and continued warnings stood in contrast to the scene that unfolded the night before, when counter-demonstrators attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment, throwing traffic cones, releasing pepper spray and tearing down barriers. Fighting continued for several hours before police stepped in, though no arrests were made. At least 15 protesters suffered injuries, and the tepid response by authorities drew criticism from political leaders as well as Muslim students and advocacy groups. By Wednesday afternoon a small city sprang up inside the reenforced encampment, now full of hundreds of people and tents on the campus quad. Some protesters said Muslim prayers as the sun set over the campus, while others chanted “we’re not leaving” or passed out goggles and surgical masks. They wore helmets and headscarves, and discussed the best ways to handle pepper spray or tear gas as someone sang over a megaphone. A few constructed homemade shields out of plywood in case they clashed with police forming skirmish lines elsewhere on the campus. “For rubber bullets, who wants a shield?” a protester called out. Outside the encampment, a crowd of students, alumni and neighbors gathered on campus steps, joining in pro-Palestinian chants. A group of students holding signs and wearing T-shirts in support of Israel and Jewish people demonstrated nearby. The crowd continued to grow as the night wore on as more and more officers poured onto campus. Ray Wiliani, who lives nearby, said he came to UCLA on Wednesday evening to support the pro-Palestinian demonstrators. “We need to take a stand for it,” he said. “Enough is enough.” Elsewhere, police in New Hampshire said they made 90 arrests and took down tents at Dartmouth College and officers in Oregon came onto the campus at Portland State University as school officials sought to end the occupation of the library that started Monday. The chaotic scenes at UCLA came after New York police burst into a building occupied by anti-war protesters at Columbia University on Tuesday night, breaking up a demonstration that had paralyzed the school. An Associated Press tally counted at least 38 times since April 18 where arrests were made at campus protests across the U.S. More than 1,600 people have been arrested at 30 schools. UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said in a statement that “a group of instigators” perpetrated the previous night’s attack, but he did not provide details about the crowd or why the administration and school police did not act sooner. “However one feels about the encampment, this attack on our students, faculty and community members was utterly unacceptable,” he said. “It has shaken our campus to its core.” Block promised a review of the night’s events after California Gov. Gavin Newsom denounced the delays. The head of the University of California system, Michael Drake, ordered an “independent review of the university’s planning, its actions and the response by law enforcement.” “The community needs to feel the police are protecting them, not enabling others to harm them,” Rebecca Husaini, chief of staff for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said in a news conference on the Los Angeles campus Wednesday. Speakers disputed the university’s account that 15 people were injured and one hospitalized, saying the number of people taken to the hospital was higher. One student described needing to go to the hospital after being hit in the head by an object wielded by counter-protesters. Several students who spoke during the news conference said they had to rely on each other, not the police, for support as they were attacked, and that many in the pro-Palestinian encampment remained peaceful and did not engage with counter-protesters. UCLA canceled classes Wednesday. At the University of Wisconsin in Madison, a scrum broke out early Wednesday after police with shields removed all but one tent and shoved protesters. Four officers were injured, including a state trooper who was hit in the head with a skateboard, authorities said. Four were charged with battering law enforcement. This is all playing out in an election year in the U.S., raising questions about whether young voters — who are critical for Democrats — will back President Joe Biden’s reelection effort, given his staunch support of Israel. In rare instances, university officials and protest leaders struck agreements to restrict the disruption to campus life and upcoming commencement ceremonies. At Brown University in Rhode Island, administrators agreed to consider a vote to divest from Israel in October — apparently the first U.S. college to agree to such a demand. The nationwide campus demonstrations began at Columbia on April 17 to protest Israel’s offensive in Gaza, which followed Hamas launching a deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to stamp out Hamas, Israel has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Health Ministry there. Israel and its supporters have branded the university protests antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, organizers of the protests, some of whom are Jewish, say it is a peaceful movement aimed at defending Palestinian rights and protesting the war.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dan-schneider-defamation-lawsuit-quiet-on-set_n_6632cae7e4b05f96b0170a43,Dan Schneider Files Defamation Suit Against 'Quiet On Set' Producers,taiyler s. mitchell,5/1/2024,"Kids television producer-screenwriter Dan Schneider is suing the producers behind “Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV,” a docuseries about the alleged abuse of child actors on several Nickelodeon shows. The suit — the defendants in which include Warner Bros. Discovery, Maxine Productions, Sony Pictures Television and others — was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday, more than a month after the docuseries aired on March 17. “‘Quiet on Set’s’ portrayal of Schneider is a hit job,” the lawsuit, which was obtained by HuffPost, reads. Schneider’s suit seeks financial compensation and to remove or edit parts of the series and the trailer. Schneider, 58, is known for numerous Nick hits including “All That,” “iCarly,” “Victorious,” “Drake & Josh,” “The Amanda Show,” “Zoey 101″ and “Kenan and Kel.” He did not appear in the five-part series, but several former child actors shared their experiences on the sets of some of these shows. The series also showed imagery of Schneider cozied up with some of the young female actors on set and several other clips that appeared to show young actresses feeling uncomfortable in his presence. Subjects in “Quiet on Set” also described Nickelodeon as a workplace that was hostile and discriminatory against women. Sources on the show said that Schneider frequently required the women on set to massage him. Nickelodeon reportedly cut ties with Schneider in 2018. The company had investigated Schneider for “alleged sexual behavior,” but found only that he had been verbally abusive to employees, according to Business Insider. “Schneider will be the first to admit that some of what they said is true,” the lawsuit reads. “At times, he was blind to the pain that some of his behaviors caused certain colleagues, subordinates, and cast members. He will regret and atone for this behavior the rest of his life. But one thing he is not — and the one thing that will forever mar his reputation and career both past and present — is a child sexual abuser.” In the series, Drake Bell, who starred in Schneider’s “The Amanda Show” and “Drake & Josh,” recounted being sexually abused by Brian Peck, Bell’s dialogue coach. Several of the former child actors also recalled being forced to participate in scenes that imitate uncomfortable and/or sexual situations under the guise of comedy. In a statement to HuffPost, Schneider said that the series “highlighted mistakes I made and poor judgment I exhibited during my time at Nickelodeon. ... There is no doubt that I was sometimes a bad leader. I am sincerely apologetic and regretful for that behavior, and I will continue to take accountability for it.” But Schneider and his lawyers argue the documentary conflates his own misconduct with the child sexual abuse detailed by Bell and others. “In their successful attempt to mislead viewers and increase ratings, they went beyond reporting the truth and falsely implied that I was involved in or facilitated horrific crimes for which actual child predators have been prosecuted and convicted,” he continued. “I have no objection to anyone highlighting my failures as a boss, but it is wrong to mislead millions of people to the false conclusion that I was in any way involved in heinous acts like those committed by child predators.” Need help?

In a new interview with People, the “Fast & Furious” actor, 50, recalled how when she became pregnant at 40 with her first child with husband Ryan Gosling, people made it a “big deal” because of her age. “And then I was 42 and I was pregnant with my second one,” she said, “and people were like, ‘Oh my God, you’re going to be so tired. That’s why people have kids in their 20s.’ I was like, that’s the most sorry, asinine thing I’ve ever heard.” Mendes and Gosling share two daughters: Esmeralda Amada, 9, and Amada Lee, 8. The couple wed in 2011. Mendes said she’s also confident in her decision to give birth later in life because she had some vices to kick before stepping into motherhood. Because parenting “takes more patience,” she said, “in my 20s, I shouldn’t have even been around a child. I was just foul-mouthed and smoking.” “I could not have raised kids in any other era of my life but now, for sure,” Mendes added. The “Hitch” actor went on to share that after becoming pregnant, she knew immediately that she would rather take a step back from her acting career than miss out on her kids’ first years. “It was the easiest decision I’ve ever made,” she recalled. “I was older and I knew that my kids are going to be little once, and whatever I do or don’t do right now is going to affect them the rest of their life.” “Your career comes and goes but kids, yeah, that was easy for me,” Mendes added. “They’re just formative years.

On Thursday, the “Raven’s Home” star posted a TikTok video of her with Pearman-Maday as she called out people who have attacked her wife online after their appearance last month on the “Bottoms Up With Fannita” podcast. In that podcast episode, Pearman-Maday told host Fannita Leggett that she had faced backlash for publicly stating that she hadn’t watched the popular Disney Channel show “That’s So Raven,” which ran from 2003 to 2007, before the two met in 2015. She also later named other projects of Raven-Symoné’s that she hadn’t watched prior to meeting her now-wife. On TikTok, Raven-Symoné addressed some of the backlash, saying, “I’m here with Miranda, my wife, to tell you stop it in the comments.” “And stop with the death threats in her DMs,” she continued, calling the attacks “disrespectful” to the couple, who wed in June 2020. Pearman-Maday said that the response has been “wild” and that she wanted to “clear the air.” “I never have once said that I did not know who Raven was,” she said, adding that instead she’s said she didn’t “grow up watching ‘That’s So Raven.’” “But since getting married and meeting her in 2015, I have seen the majority of her work,” she said, adding that her wife is “endlessly talented.” Pearman-Maday had told Leggett in the podcast that she also hadn’t seen some of her other Disney Channel projects, including the “Cheetah Girls” movies and appearances in the “Zenon” series, before they met. Although Pearman-Maday, 36, explained that she has since caught up on those shows and that she had previously seen Raven-Symoné in the 2008 film “College Road Trip,” the actor, who is now 38, hadn’t been on her “radar” when she was growing up. “I do not think I watched anything and registered that it was Raven before we were together,” she said, before speaking directly to her wife: “I knew who you were, but you just, like, were not on my radar.” Last week, Pearman-Maday addressed a TikTok user who said there was “no excuse” for not having seen much of Raven-Symoné’s work, including her role on “The Cosby Show” that began when she was 4.

During their appearance, Raven-Symoné had remarked that she believed it was “fantastic” that her wife hadn’t seen a lot of her movies or TV shows before they met. “Imagine being in a relationship with someone that doesn’t look at you like a famous person even though you’ve been famous your whole entire life,” she said.

Holmes React To Former Colleague Rob Marciano's ABC News Firing",curtis m. wong,5/3/2024,"T.J. Holmes and Amy Robach are speaking out in defense of their former ABC News colleague Rob Marciano following his headline-making dismissal from the network. Marciano, who worked as a senior meteorologist at ABC News for 10 years, was reportedly fired this week after getting into a “heated screaming match” with one of the producers of “Good Morning America.” According to The Daily Beast, the alleged outburst “wasn’t the first time that Marciano had crossed the line on the set,” and he was reported to network leadership. On Friday’s episode of their “Amy and T.J. Podcast,” Holmes and Robach urged listeners to empathize with Marciano. “It’s a tough situation. Yes, we have walked down that road and it’s not an easy one,” Robach said. “And I think he might still be going through a divorce. So we know what it’s like to have your entire life upended, career and personal life.” After noting that he didn’t “know all the details” regarding Marciano’s exit from ABC News, Holmes said, “Whatever it is, we hate to see somebody who’s been a friend and a colleague for a long time end up in this place, this position, to be talked about the way he’s being talked about, to some degree.” “We do know what it’s like to have those headlines, to be the subject of clickbait,” Robach added. “And that’s a tough position for anyone to be going through, especially someone who is a father of two. I know how much he loves his kids. He talks about them all the time. So it’s just tough to see those headlines, almost for the sake of his family, his kids, him, all of that. So our heart goes out to him.” For the record, Marciano and his wife split in 2021 after 11 years of marriage. The former couple share a daughter, Madelynn, and a son, Mason. Robach began working for ABC News in 2012, with Holmes joining the network two years later. The pair became co-hosts of ABC’s “GMA3: What You Need To Know,” a spinoff of “Good Morning America,” in 2020. They were formally fired from the network last year, shortly after it was publicly revealed that their relationship had gone from professional to romantic. At the time, they were both married to other people. Since then, Holmes and Robach have taken steps to rebuild their respective public images. In the late fall they launched “Amy and T.J.,” which is dedicated to “meaningful conversations about current events, pop culture and everything in between.” Listen to Holmes and Robach discuss Marciano at the 21:37 mark below: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/goon-squad-lawsuit-police-dog-mississippi_n_663543f7e4b05f96b018586f,New Lawsuit Alleges 'Goon Squad' Officer Tortured Black Man With Police Dog,phillip jackson,5/3/2024,"A Black man in Mississippi filed a federal lawsuit this week alleging a former officer in the high-profile and highly scrutinized Mississippi “Goon Squad” in Rankin County and several other law enforcement officers set a police dog on him while he was handcuffed on the ground in 2021, resulting in several injuries. Bobbie Adams, 41, alleged in the suit that Tony Shack, a Rankin County sheriff’s officer, unleashed his dog VooDoo on Adams after a police chase. The suit says that Christian Dedmon, an investigator with the department, falsified a report about the incident. The Rankin County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on the lawsuit. Dedmon is one of six Goon Squad officers sentenced last month by a federal judge for torturing two other Black men, Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker. Dedmon received a 40-year prison sentence. On May 1, 2021, Adams attempted to flee deputies on foot after being caught selling methamphetamine to an informant, but he surrendered after seeing six officers on the scene in a wooded area. Officers pointed a gun at Adams while handcuffing him in a “subdued position” on the ground, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit says that while Adams was handcuffed with several officers surrounding him, Shack ordered VooDoo to attack and bite him. “As Defendant Shack held VooDoo’s leash, the dog began to attack the handcuffed and compliant Plaintiff, biting and chewing upon the Plaintiff’s legs and feet repeatedly,” the lawsuit says. The lawsuit alleges that it took eight minutes from when Adams was handcuffed for deputies to radio in that he needed medical attention and 13 minutes for dispatchers to say that a police dog had been released. Dedmon’s subsequent police report said that Adams kicked at the dog and that caused him to bite him several times, including on his foot, which the lawsuit said is false. Another deputy reportedly told medical personnel that Adams hurt his foot running from the officers. The suit does not name the other officers, besides Shack and Dedmon, who were at the scene. Adams and his attorney requested all information from the investigative file of the incident, but the sheriff’s office denied the request, the suit claims. No body camera footage has been released of the incident. Adams’ attorney declined to comment on the lawsuit. Trent Walker, an attorney who represented Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker, told HuffPost the lawsuit will be the first of many against Rankin County deputies and that he believes Sheriff Bryan Bailey is to blame. “The allegations in this lawsuit just go to further prove the longstanding customs, patterns and practices of the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, particularly under the tenure of Sheriff Bryan Bailey,” Walker told HuffPost. “These allegations show that violence has been endemic to the culture of the department for decades. It is long past time that these all-too-frequent incidents cease to be treated with a ‘wink and a nod’ by those in power in Rankin County.” Several of the white officers who belonged to the self-proclaimed Goon Squad were connected with recent incidents of abuse and using excessive force against residents of Rankin County. In 2022, Dedmon also beat and shocked a man and then fired a gun toward his head in order to coerce him into a confession. Other officers, Hunter Elward and Daniel Opdyke, failed to intervene in the incident, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-israel-gaza-statement-international-us-law_n_66353e4de4b00b1eab534dc6,Joe Biden Is Days From A Key Statement On Israel And Gaza. Here’s What The Ally Who Sought It Expects.,akbar shahid ahmed,5/3/2024,"WASHINGTON — With the Biden administration days away from issuing its opinion on whether Israel is violating international and U.S. law in Gaza, the lawmaker who pushed for a State Department probe of that question doubts he’ll get an honest answer. Starting in December, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) rallied 19 senators to support legislation demanding assurances that all countries receiving American weaponry — including Israel — are complying with international and U.S. statutes barring violence against civilians and efforts to block humanitarian aid. In response, President Joe Biden in February issued a new policy known as NSM-20, which required federal agencies to send a report to Congress on Israel’s conduct during its Gaza operation by May 8. The report poses a test for the White House: Will it acknowledge the alarming actions taken by its ally, strengthening calls for the U.S. to reassess its support for Israel, or will the administration risk embarrassment and outrage by misrepresenting Israeli behavior? The administration appears to be split. The U.S. Agency for International Development and several State Department bureaus believe the administration cannot credibly say Israel is respecting either international law or the U.S. laws that require recipients of American military support to allow the free flow of U.S. humanitarian aid, according to Reuters and Devex — raising the prospect that Biden would have to withdraw military assistance. But the State Department team leading the report side-stepped the question of whether violations are occurring and instead emphasized the risks of cutting off support for Israel, per Reuters. Meanwhile, other top State Department officials, like U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew, are internally endorsing Israel’s promises to abide by the law, despite broad skepticism of those claims from outside analysts, as HuffPost revealed in March. Van Hollen said he’s alarmed by the disclosures about the administration’s handling of the report. “The credibility of the U.S. government depends on it being honest and based in fact and law,” the Biden ally told HuffPost in a Thursday interview. So far, Van Hollen said, “the reporting on the internal dynamics at the State Department clearly indicated that those who were most expert in applying the facts and the law were ignored and overlooked by those pushing a particular policy agenda.” Together, the recent developments represent “a big warning sign, like a big flare,” with respect to the upcoming report, Van Hollen said. The senator spoke approvingly of an alternative assessment of Israel’s actions that is already public: an independent analysis performed by an ad-hoc group of outside experts that investigated scores of examples of Israeli military actions in Gaza — incidents which, the authors said, violated international law and U.S. directives in “a clear pattern.” Van Hollen called that assessment “a very important yardstick against which to compare what the Biden administration comes out with.” He told HuffPost he asked five of its authors to brief senators on Wednesday in a previously unreported private meeting. “We had a total of 13 members — that’s more members than you get for a regular hearing in the United States Senate. So I think it was an expression of the depth of concern,” the senator said. The assessment’s authors in attendance included former State Department official Josh Paul, who quit over Biden’s policy in a development first reported by HuffPost, and prominent Palestinian American attorney Noura Erakat. The lawmakers’ openness to the assessment’s conclusions, even if they prove to run counter to the State Department’s, is extremely notable because of the pathway that Paul and his colleagues endorse. They say Israel’s military is showing “systematic disregard” for the international and U.S. norms, note “grave concerns” that the Biden administration is violating the law via prolonged backing for Israel’s offensive and urge “appropriate steps to prevent further violations” — which could range from limiting the procurement of weapons for specific Israeli units to a broad reset in U.S.-Israel cooperation. In February, HuffPost broke the news that U.S. officials at a number of government agencies, including the State Department, the Pentagon and the National Security Council, were investigating possible Israeli war crimes like strikes on overwhelmingly civilian targets — despite public claims from Biden administration spokespeople that there was no basis for questioning Israel’s actions. And on Friday, 88 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote to Biden saying that they believe Israel’s restrictions on humanitarian aid for Gaza violate U.S. law, a view shared by Van Hollen and several other senators. Israel has been pummeling Gaza with near-total U.S. support for nearly seven months, in an offensive that’s killed close to 35,000 people per local authorities and initiated a famine there, in retaliation for an Oct. 7 attack by the Gaza-based Palestinian militant group Hamas. Van Hollen told HuffPost observers should also look to another outside deep-dive into Israeli conduct as a point of comparison to the eventual report from the Biden administration: an April 29 brief that Amnesty International prepared in response to NSM-20. That brief focused on American-provided weapons, saying Israel has used them “in serious violation of international humanitarian and human rights law and … inconsistent with U.S. law and policy.” “The Biden administration and the United States loses credibility when we point to reports by Amnesty or Human Rights Watch where [they] serv[e] our political interests, and sometimes ignores them when they don’t,” Van Hollen said. “In order to be credible, you need to be consistent.” The U.S. government regularly cites those watchdogs, among others, in its own annual human rights reports and in condemning geopolitical foes like Russia and Iran. The senator is not seeking to “prejudge” the administration’s report, he told HuffPost. He said he has been clear to “very senior” members of Biden’s national security team about what he sees as the intent of the process: “to lay out the facts and the law. “What policies are derived from that, we can debate. … We can have an ongoing discussion and we may have differences.” Asked about Van Hollen’s comments, a State Department spokesperson told HuffPost: “We do not want to get ahead of any official announcements or decisions.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted calls from Biden and others to temper his offensive against Hamas, instead saying the campaign must expand to Rafah, the final refuge for more than a million Palestinians displaced by the U.S.-backed campaign and the hub of aid efforts for Gaza. Democratic lawmakers worried about the humanitarian and strategic toll of the policy have steadily become more assertive in discussing steps to rein in Israel, which is reliant on American support for its operations. Some congressional staff have been tasked with preparing menus of options that legislators could use to pressure Netanyahu if he does go ahead with an invasion of Rafah, a senior Democratic aide told HuffPost this week. One high-profile prospect the aide identified: forcing an up-or-down vote in the Senate on the next major proposed sale of weapons to the Israelis. The Biden administration has sought to dodge congressional scrutiny by funneling arms shipments to Israel through packages that are below the threshold for advance congressional notification, by relying on transfer authorizations that date back years and by citing emergency powers to bypass normal oversight procedures. Though Congress last month passed a national security funding bill which authorized $15 billion in additional military aid for Israel, lawmakers and the Biden administration have significant flexibility in deciding how the country can use that money, such as what kinds of American equipment it can buy, said John Ramming Chappell, an advocacy and legal fellow at the nonprofit Center for Civilians in Conflict. His organization and 24 other humanitarian and human rights groups issued a statement after the passage of the April funding for Israel, arguing: “Congress has the responsibility to ensure that the use of appropriated funds, including for the purchase of weapons, is consistent with U.S. law and policy.” Van Hollen told HuffPost lawmakers are engaged in “an ongoing effort …independent of the May 8 report” to refuse to send more offensive weapons to Israel until Netanyahu changes his policies to address American concerns. The senator noted that those efforts would not affect Israeli defense materials like the Iron Dome missile defense system and that the legislators involved agree on Israel’s right to self-defense. “We’ve had months and months of President Biden making very reasonable demands, only to be mostly ignored by Netanyahu,” the senator said. “I will say the administration has told us repeatedly that they have found NSM-20 to be a useful tool in moving the Israeli government in the right direction,” he continued, indicating that public pushback to U.S. support of the war in Gaza has not been for naught. Yet Netanyahu has yet to budge on major policies, like denying electricity to Gaza, and has not loosened the sharp limits on what aid Israel allows into the Strip. “Clearly, incremental steps are not enough when you have people literally starving to death in Gaza,” Van Hollen said. Activists hope next week’s delivery of the Biden administration report will strengthen interest on Capitol Hill in measures to ease pain in Gaza and prevent further alleged war crimes. They are widely promoting the outside assessments related to NSM-20 and other substantial collections of data — like a tracker of incidents since October run by the American Friends Service Committee — that could have legal implications for U.S. backing for Israel. “If the Biden administration disregards extensive evidence of the Israeli military’s violations of their assurances, it will be up to Congress to step in and make clear that unconditional arms transfers to the Netanyahu government must end,” said Chappell. Annie Shiel, CIVIC’s advocacy director and a former State Department official, called accountability and a shift in the U.S. approach desperately overdue — and unlikely to come unilaterally from Biden. “The Biden administration has abjectly failed to enforce U.S. law and policy, which would have required the U.S. to end its support for catastrophic harm in Gaza many months ago,” Shiel told HuffPost. “So while we sincerely hope that the May 8 report will mark a turning point in U.S. policy towards Israel, the administration’s actions to date have given us little reason to trust that this is a good-faith process.”",0.127577858,0.24334263

The rule updates Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The federal legislation, passed in 1973 and championed by disability rights activists, prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in any program or activity that receives federal funding or is conducted by a federal agency. This includes programs in elementary and secondary schools, nursing homes and hospitals. The update aims to strengthen civil rights protections in health care and social services for disabled people by clarifying obligations for nondiscriminatory treatment that were not stated in the original regulation. HHS said that the rule “addresses discrimination in medical treatment, adds enforceable standards for accessible medical diagnostic equipment, and ensures accessible web content and mobile apps.” “It is comprehensive in scope, advancing justice for people with disabilities,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement, adding that the update “furthers the Department’s commitment to ensuring equal access to this nation’s health care system and its social service programs.” Though Section 504 had sought to ensure equal access for the country’s tens of millions of disabled people, discrimination and inadequate treatment have remained a reality for many. “The COVID-19 pandemic shone a spotlight on the discrimination that too many people with disabilities continue to face, from denial of medical treatment due to ableism, to inaccessible medical equipment and websites, to having no choice but to receive services in institutional settings,” said Alison Barkoff, the head of the government’s Administration for Community Living, when the update was proposed last year. According to HHS, the rule seeks to ensure that Section 504 is interpreted similarly to other legislation offering disability protections, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Affordable Care Act. “Today’s rule is long overdue,” said Melanie Fontes Rainer, the director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights. “My office heard from thousands in overwhelming support of this rule and the need to update this rule now for people with disabilities.” Mia Ives-Rublee of the Center for American Progress described the rule as “a major step toward gaining greater equity for disabled people across the United States.” The next four years will change America forever.

Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), who has long advocated for improvements to health care access for disabled people, also lauded the update to Section 504. “The unjust status quo has subjected our neighbors with disabilities to daily injustices,” Pressley said Thursday. “This much-needed and long-overdue rule is a historic step forward that will help prevent discrimination for folks with disabilities and help them access healthcare and other services they need and deserve.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The “Goonies” star visited “The View” to promote his memoir “Coreyography” in 2013, in which he candidly detailed the child sexual abuse he says he endured from numerous Hollywood insiders, only for Walters to tell him: “You’re damaging an entire industry.” “It was like a knife in the heart,” Feldman told Entertainment Weekly in an interview Thursday. “It was shocking to me that somebody who I admired so much and I looked up to so much could be so deaf and just so completely wrong and off base.” His comments arrive weeks after the Investigation Discovery documentary series, “Quiet On Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV,” accused several Nickelodeon insiders of child sexual abuse. Feldman, a former child star himself, has spoken about this issue for years. The former actor not only claimed in the 2020 documentary “My Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys” that Charlie Sheen raped his friend Corey Haim — a claim Sheen denies — but told The Guardian in 2020 “the biggest problem in Hollywood is pedophilia.” He didn’t mince words about it on “The View” in 2013. “I’m saying that there are people ... that did this to both me and Corey, that are still working, they’re still out there, and they’re some of the richest, most powerful people in this business,” he told Walters. “And they do not want me saying what I’m saying right now.” When he doubled down on the claim, Walters accused him of “damaging” the industry. “I never got an apology,” he said Thursday about Walters, who died at 93 in 2022. “The only apology I’ve ever gotten is from a few Twitter followers who’ve said, we all want to apologize on her behalf for the fact that she never acknowledged you or apologized.” Feldman told Walters after her comment at the time that child sexual abuse in Hollywood is “a very important, serious topic.” Social media users have increasingly agreed, particularly after the revelations about financier Jeffrey Epstein became public and bolstered the notion. “It very much gave everybody, I think, the feeling that she was either part of it or covering up for it,” Feldman told Entertainment Weekly about Walters so leisurely dismissing his accusations, “which is shocking and scary.” Epstein, a billionaire who hobnobbed with Prince Andrew and several former U.S. presidents, was arrested in 2019 on charges of sex trafficking minors and died by suicide the next month at 66 while being held in jail. Walters’ name appeared in Epstein’s “little black book” of high-profile contacts. While previously named Jon Grissom as one of his abusers, Feldman has yet to identify the others he purportedly knows about. Feldman, who previously named Jon Grissom as one of his abusers, said Thursday that while “Quiet on Set” gives him hope, people keep seemingly ignoring his story. “Honestly, nobody in Hollywood has really stood with me during this, and it’s been really rough, but you never know,” he told EW. “Tides seem to be changing, and the tides seemed to be turning. And hopefully maybe one day somebody will care enough.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Hicks spent most of the day answering questions for the prosecution, and as Bove rose to question her, the cumulative stress of the experience became clear. According to HuffPost’s Matt Shuham, who was in the courtroom Friday, Hicks recounted how Trump had lied to her in detail about the involvement of his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen. Trump claimed Cohen had personally paid off Stormy Daniels, with whom Trump was accused of having an affair, as a show of generosity and loyalty to the future president, Hicks said Friday. But Hicks said she didn’t buy that claim: “I didn’t know Michael to be an especially charitable person or selfless person.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/canadian-police-make-arrests-in-killing-of-sikh-separatist_n_66353fc6e4b00b1eab534dc9,Canadian Police Make Arrests In Killing Of Sikh Separatist,"rob gillies , jim morris",5/3/2024,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Canadian police said they arrested three suspects Friday in the slaying of a Sikh separatist leader last June that become the center of a diplomatic spat with India, and are investigating possible ties between the detainees and the Indian government. Three Indian nationals in their 20s identified as Kamalpreet Singh, Karan Brar and Karampreet Singh were arrested in Edmonton, Alberta on Friday morning in the slaying of 45-year-old Hardeep Singh Nijjar by masked gunmen outside Vancouver, police said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sparked a diplomatic feud with India in September when he said that there were “credible allegations” of Indian involvement in the slaying of Nijjar. India had accused Nijjar of links to terrorism, but angrily denied involvement in the slaying. In response to the allegatio ns, India told Canada last year to remove 41 of its 62 diplomats in the country. Tensions remain but have somewhat eased since. The three suspects had been living in Canada as non-permanent residents, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent Mandeep Mooker said Friday at a news conference in Toronto. “We are investigating whether there are any ties to the government of India,” Mooker said, adding that it was an “ongoing investigation.” Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner David Teboul said Canadian authorities are speaking to counterparts in India. “I would characterize that collaboration as rather challenging,” he said. “It’s been very difficult.” The three men were expected to be transported to British Columbia by Monday to face charges of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Nijjar, an Indian-born citizen of Canada, was a plumber and also a leader in what remains of a once-strong movement to create an independent Sikh homeland, known as Khalistan. But he had denied allegations of ties to terrorism. A bloody decadelong Sikh insurgency shook north India in the 1970s and 1980s, until it was crushed in a government crackdown in which thousands of people were killed, including prominent Sikh leaders.

Click here to subscribe. You know the drill: clock out of work, take a breather, and get into The Culture Catchall. No time for the introduction, let’s just get into it. *rubs forehead* Now, don’t get me wrong: I absolutely adore Drew Barrymore, and she’s one of the few individuals in Hollywood who truly captivates me. Whether it’s her infectious energy on-screen or her genuine personality off-camera, there’s something undeniably magnetic about her. However, she received a small bombastic side eye from me after a recent episode of her talk show, “The Drew Barrymore Show,” where she interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris. (Of course, Harris showed off her fresh blowout and all.) Barrymore made history with her first all-female audience during Harris’ appearance, but the moment was quickly overshadowed by a comment during their conversation. While discussing Harris and her family dynamic, Barrymore jokingly calls our VP “Momala,” which in that context seemed appropriate. Barrymore then proceeds to discuss how our country needs a “mom” and a “hug,” to which she insists Harris should take on the role as America’s mother and be its “protector.” That is where our girl shook the table on social media. Even Harris’ face looked like she was cringing. Black women have long been burdened by the stereotype of the “Mammy” figure, perceived as the eternal caregiver and problem-solver. While Barrymore is someone I deeply admire, it’s essential for her and her team to grasp the importance of not perpetuating harmful stereotypes. They need to critically assess how their actions and messaging might unintentionally reinforce these damaging narratives. Social media didn’t like it, either. You could literally see the VP swallow what Drew said. And it was an unpleasant taste. 🙃 https://t.co/afhQWhZAnU “We need you to be Mamala of the country” let’s be for real Drew Barrymore pic.twitter.com/l79s8LFf5m Asking the first Black women VP to serve the mammy trope for America’s comfort is ASININE. 🤯 🤣 Girl you TRIED IT. #mamala https://t.co/8UQI1Gfdqo The Dems want Kamala to be their ""Mamala."" #Gutfeld@KennedyNation pic.twitter.com/3JfCFokdZ6 This isn’t the first super-awkward moment on Barrymore’s show. She had another slightly cringey moment when Oprah appeared on her show last year, as she seemingly caressed Oprah’s hands during their conversation. (Oprah shut down the accusations that she wasn’t fond of the interaction and said she took it as “comforting.”) Also, off screen, Barrymore was embroiled in controversy when she announced that her talk show would return amid the writers strike in 2023. Ultimately, she ended up pausing production on the premiere after a big backlash. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/annelise-orleck-dartmouth-professor-protest_n_663525d9e4b0fc2b95296da2,A 65-Year-Old Professor Describes Being Manhandled By Cops At Campus Protest,dave jamieson,5/3/2024,"Dartmouth College history professor Annelise Orleck went viral Thursday following her arrest the previous night for taking part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration on campus. Video from New Hampshire television station WMUR showed police in riot gear pulling the 65-year-old Orleck away from the protest before one officer appears to push her to the ground. “Are you kidding me?” a stunned demonstrator can be heard yelling. Orleck said she was zip-tied, placed in a van with other arrestees and held in lockup in Lebanon, New Hampshire, for two and a half hours. She was charged with criminal trespass, and the terms of her bail stated she was not allowed to return to the campus where she’d been teaching for more than 30 years. A former chair of the college’s Jewish studies program who specializes in U.S. political history and women’s history, Orleck had been teaching about the civil rights movement that afternoon. In an interview with HuffPost, she explained how the ordeal unfolded. Police officers arresting an elderly demonstrator @WMUR9 pic.twitter.com/2hOFaiNcHq She initially came out to the College Green on Wednesday afternoon in support of graduate student workers who went on strike. The labor action, she said, eventually morphed into a broader protest against the college, calling for Dartmouth to divest from companies tied to Israel. A “very small number” of students intended to set up an encampment, Orleck said. She and other supporters were asked to encircle them to create a barrier with police. “It was peaceful,” Orleck said. “It was a very minor, mild protest. There were multi-faith expressions of solidarity, Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish, Christian. It was a really nice, peaceful event.” She and others broke for dinner around 7:30 p.m., but they soon got a message that more cops had shown up. Concerned, Orleck and her group — “older women faculty,” she described them — headed back. “The Green was transformed,” Orleck said. “There was an unbelievable presence of militarized police. Like nothing I’d seen in more than 30 years of teaching here. And so the students on campus were upset by that, and so the numbers on the Green began to grow.” “I fault the institution for bringing in riot police. [The protest] was completely, 100% peaceful.” She said that presence included campus security, local police from Hanover and Lebanon and state police. She credited the campus security officers for keeping order but said they eventually moved out. Orleck said police officers in riot gear were “swooping in” and arresting those who were part of the encampment. She and her faculty friends tried to stand between the two sides, thinking the police wouldn’t get physical with older women. “Well, that was wrong,” Orleck said. She started taking pictures with her phone and telling the police to leave the demonstrators alone. She says she was thrown to the ground. A video from Dartmouth student journalist David Adkins posted on X shows Orleck getting up and confronting police. Orleck says one took her phone and she was demanding it back. The video from WMUR journalist Ross Ketschke shows a cop in riot gear yanking Orleck away from the protest and handing her off to a pair of cops in trooper-style hats. Orleck tumbles to the ground — she says she didn’t fall but was pushed. Then they drag her onto her stomach. “They slammed me down ... They were dragging me. My hands still hurt ... They kneeled on my back,” Orleck said. The van of arrestees she was placed in included a pair of student journalists who’d been wearing their credentials, Orleck recalled. She said one student was crying. Orleck decided to lead them in singing civil rights songs. But since the day had begun with labor protests, they started with “Solidarity Forever.” “And then we went to ‘This Little Light of Mine’ and ‘We Shall Not Be Moved,’” Orleck said. “It made the students and me feel a little better.” According to the Hanover Police Department, protesters had been ordered to disperse after Dartmouth made it clear no tents or encampments would be allowed. Many who refused were arrested. Hanover Police Chief Charlie Dennis confirmed that Orleck was arrested and charged with criminal trespass, a class B misdemeanor. He said a total of 89 arrests were made. He declined to comment on Orleck’s account. Orleck said the Vermont Workers’ Center, a labor group, posted the $40 bail for her and others who were arrested. Orleck had no cash on her. A Dartmouth spokesperson said the school was “taking every reasonable step to ensure [Orleck] can continue teaching classes.” “We are also clarifying the conditions imposed by the bail commissioner, noting that Dartmouth had no intention of seeking Prof. Orleck’s exclusion from campus, and we will promptly request that any errors be corrected,” the spokesperson said. “This generation is actually quite a remarkable generation. They're politically committed and savvy and moral.” Orleck said she received a call Thursday from Dartmouth President Sian Leah Beilock asking how she was doing. Orleck told her she had bruises from the arrest. She said they disagreed on the need for such a strong police presence. “I fault the institution for bringing in riot police,” Orleck said. “[The protest] was completely, 100% peaceful. I know the president doesn’t agree with me because she said that to me yesterday, but I was there. And the only way to think of them as not peaceful is if you think that using the words ‘Free Palestine’ means you’re dangerous.” Orleck also said she was proud of how the students behaved. “This generation is actually quite a remarkable generation. They’re politically committed and savvy and moral,” she said. “I really want to see, you know, the discussion of them and the treatment of them be kinder and more attentive. I think we just need to be doing our job, educating them and not, you know, attacking them violently. This is a moment where we need to go back to thinking that protest is a part of campus life.” Orleck said she has a class to teach on Friday. Even though Dartmouth has told her they never intended to ban her, an attorney told her she would be violating her bail terms by stepping foot on campus. She believes she’ll need either a new bail bond or to have the charges dropped. For now, she plans to teach via Zoom.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-to-do-if-you-think-you-have-an-online-stalker_n_6633eb5fe4b00b1eab52a1e6,Seen ‘Baby Reindeer’? Here’s What To Do If You Think You Have An Online Stalker,brittany wong,5/3/2024,"In Netflix’s hit British miniseries “Baby Reindeer,” Donny, a struggling comedian, is relentlessly stalked by Martha, a woman he meets at the neighborhood bar he works at in the evenings. The show is based on comedian Richard Gadd’s autobiographical one-person show. In Donny, Gadd is playing a fictionalized version of himself. The Scottish comedian really was stalked in his early 20s by an older woman who, like Martha, flooded his email and social media with poorly spelled messages that were sexually explicit and threatening at times. (Baby Reindeer is one of the many weird, uncomfortably intimate nicknames Martha gives him.) When Donny goes to the police with the messages as proof, they tell him not much can be done because the messages aren’t outwardly threatening. They also quiz him why it had taken him so long to report his perpetrator. (Of course, it doesn’t help that because Donny is a man and his stalker is a woman, male stalking victims don’t tend to be treated with the same seriousness as women who are stalked. Research also shows they’re slower to report, perhaps because of fear of not being taken seriously or believed.) For people who’ve been online stalked, the powerlessness and frustration Donny feels in “Baby Reindeer” is all too real. Cyberstalking now happens more often than traditional, in-person stalking. Approximately 3.4 million people ages 16 or older (about 1.3% of the U.S. population) were cyberstalking victims in 2019, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. (Many said that the online harassment escalated to more traditional, in-person stalking.) Ashley McMann, a licensed professional counselor in Austin, Texas, was online stalked years ago, and “Baby Reindeer” took her back to that jarring experience. Much like Donny in the show, McMann had a difficult time convincing the police that her stalker was a serious threat because most of the contact was done behind a computer screen. While most states have laws covering at least some aspects of online abuse, in Texas, McMann was told that without an actual, verbal or written physical threat — or actual face-to-face contact ― there wasn’t much that could be done. “Regardless of how many times my stalker had contacted me, regardless of the things that they said online, there was little to be done unless the individual actually made an explicit threat to my physical harm or to my physical safety,” McMann was told. “There’s this large lack of knowledge regarding the potential consequences that could occur,” she said. “We don’t talk enough about the emotional and physical damage that online stalking can cause.” Of course, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t report online stalking to the authorities. And there are absolutely ways to safeguard yourself if you suspect someone is tracking you. Below, experts share some steps you can and should take if you believe you’re being online stalked. Whether it is online or in person, stalking is essentially the same. It’s a pattern of behavior designed to inflict fear, said Paul DelPonte, the executive director at the National Crime Prevention Council. “Prime examples are someone making posts stating that they know where you live, where you work, and that they will find you,” DelPonte said. “They could also call your phone multiple times to instill fear. Stalking doesn’t have to be in the form of a direct threat, but it will always make you feel fearful.” Cyberstalkers can be strangers or people you know ― sometimes ex-partners or people you’ve met on dating apps. The more determined or obsessive stalkers become, the more likely they are to move from one online channel to another until your online presence is fully intruded upon: Incessant messaging on text or social media, tracking your location, doxxing, catfishing and cyberbullying can all come into play. “The common thread is that they tend to obtain their information about you via your online details of personal and financial affairs, relationships, social and work life and your location,” said Tony Neate, the CEO at Get Safe Online, a non-profit organization in the U.K. It sometimes escalates to receiving direct threats through email or instant messaging ― and even the online stalker reaching out to people you’re close to. “Harassment of your relatives, friends or colleagues isn’t uncommon,” Neate said. “On average, a stalker will contact 21 people connected to the victim.” The realization that you may be being stalked can come on slowly; it’s not easy to recognize a pattern of another person ignoring boundaries you have put in place or your attempts to stop contact, especially if the surveillance or reaching out is done over a long period of time. “If it has taken a while, this is not your fault, and should not deter you from asking for help,” said Emma Short, a researcher and lecturer in cyberpsychology at the London Metropolitan University. Some figures suggest that many people do not report stalking until around 100 incidents of unwanted contact have occurred, as they are unsure of what is happening, Short told HuffPost. “Many of the communications or incidents might seem harmless if they are looked at in isolation, but put them together and they create a course of conduct that has made you feel unsafe and has caused significant disruption,” she said. Christina Mancuso, a licensed psychotherapist and traumatologist at Clarity Therapy NYC, agrees. What she appreciated most about “Baby Reindeer” was how it dug into why Donny was hesitant to report his stalker, and how sometimes, a history of trauma or past abuse can result in an inability to recognize harassment early on. “I really liked how they kind of started midway and showed you what the experience was like and then reverted back to what had occurred initially,” she said. “Sometimes people who are stalked respond from a place of trauma and that creates a lack of confidence or results in someone not asserting themselves in the way they need to.” As stressful as this whole experience is, it’s important to take the time to document everything that has occurred with your stalker: The timelines and date of when the person reached out, screen captures of distressing messages, even messages or out-of-the-blue contact (“likes” for instance, and Instagram story views) that your close friends or relatives received. “Keeping track of behaviors by an abusive partner/stalker will help you better identify specific red flags, take steps towards safety, and prepare yourself if you decide to seek legal help,” a communications manager at the National Domestic Violence Hotline (The Hotline), told HuffPost. Digital evidence can be altered or removed at any point by your stalker, so take screenshots liberally. The National Domestic Violence Hotline recommends getting documentation of any of the following digital abuse you’re experiencing: If someone threatens you with physical harm or the harassment continues or escalates, contact your local police department immediately. You might consider taking legal action. All states have laws against cyberstalking, and it could help to speak with a legal advocate about protective orders or other legal measures, according to the The National Domestic Violence Hotline. If you are experiencing digital abuse from an abuser or stalker, a good resource is the website WomensLaw.org, which has information about cyberstalking and online safety. Go Fort Knox on your social media privacy settings: Make your profiles private, and unfriend any profile that looks suspicious. Change your passwords, obviously block or unfriend the suspected stalker, and don’t provide details of your social plans or whereabouts online. That means not tagging your location on Facebook or Instagram. As you’re going through this, let your friends and family know to be alert, since the stalker might reach out to them and they may not understand what’s happening or inadvertently give them information. You should also key them into what’s going on so you don’t have to experience this alone, Short said. “If you feel able to let them know, they may be able to give you the emotional support you need,” she said. You should also ask them not to tag you when they check in to places or otherwise mention your location online. This can be a lonely, isolating experience, but you’re hardly alone. Statistics show that online stalking has been steadily on the rise in the last few years, in part because of the increase in social media use, combined with a post-pandemic loneliness epidemic.

Recalling her long history with the Trump clan, Hicks said the Trump campaign was in “crisis” after the Washington Post in 2016 published a transcript of Trump bragging about his ability to sexually assault women. An audio version of what became known as the “Access Hollywood” tape leaked soon after. In it, Trump can be heard telling former “Access Hollywood” correspondent Billy Bush, “When you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.” The development knocked coverage of a Category 4 hurricane from the news, Hicks recalled. “I had a good sense this was going to be a massive story and dominate the news cycle,” she said in court Friday. “I think there was consensus amongst us all that the tape was damaging and this was a crisis.” Prosecutors displayed an urgent email Hicks forwarded to senior members of the campaign regarding the tape and how they should respond. “FLAGGING,” the email says, then offers two thoughts:“Need to hear the tape to be sure”“Deny, deny, deny.” Hicks said Trump’s response was initially pretty muted compared to the rest of the campaign staff, and that he regarded the tape as fairly standard subject matter for two guys chatting with each other. That set the tenor for the campaign’s initial, more dismissive, public statement, which cast the tape as no more than “locker room banter” and “a private conversation that took place many years ago.” When that failed to quell the outrage, Hicks said, Trump agreed to release a more direct apology. In her recollection, Trump seemed more concerned with the political fallout than anything else. Hicks’ relationship with Trump soured after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which she previously said made Trump staffers “all look like domestic terrorists.” The next four years will change America forever.

Trump faces 34 criminal counts for allegedly falsifying business records to conceal hush money payments made in 2016 to silence allegations of an extramarital affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels.

The duo co-starred alongside Wesley Snipes in “To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! July Newmar” (1995), a comedy about three drag queens on a road trip. When asked if the late great Swayze was the “angel” he’s remembered as, however, Leguizamo kept it real. “It was difficult working with him,” he recalled Thursday on Sirius XM’s “Radio Andy.” “[He was,] I don’t know, just neurotic, maybe a tiny bit insecure,” Leguizamo added, when host Andy Cohen asked for details. “And then Wesley and I, we vibed because, you know, we’re people of color and we got each other.” Leguizamo was already an established comedian when he was cast in the part, which he said Thursday he “rewrote” because “that role was nothing.” While that creativity landed him his first Golden Globe nomination, Leguizamo said it made Swayze “mad and upset” on set. “I’m also an improviser, and [Swayze] didn’t like that,” Leguizamo said. “He couldn’t keep up with it. He’d be like, ‘Are you gonna say a line like that?’ I’d go, ‘You know me. I’m gonna do me. I’m gonna just keep making up lines,’” Leguizamo recalled. “He goes, ‘Well, can you just say the line the way it is?’ I go, ‘I can’t,’ and the director didn’t want me to.” Swayze revealed in his 2009 memoir, “The Time of My Life,” that this bickering began as early as rehearsals for the film. He recalled Leguizamo’s “hyperactive” horseplay driving him so “crazy” that he screamed at his energetic co-star to “shut the fuck up for once.” The actors nearly got into a bona fide fistfight until they realized they were in costume. “John and I were wearing stocking caps, makeup and eyelashes, and garter belts — we must have looked ridiculous, a couple of tough guys ready to go at each other while wearing panty hose,” wrote Swayze in his memoir.

Leguizamo paid tribute in a statement to Entertainment Weekly at the time and wrote: “It’s tough to see such a young spirit and positive individual leave us. “Why is it always the good ones that are taken too soon?” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

On Thursday, the actor arrived at a star-studded gala for King Charles III’s charity The King’s Trust in New York City. She wore a one-shoulder, shimmering white organza gown, accessorized with peep toe platform heels and a sparkly green clutch bag. Beckinsale told People that it had “been a rough year.” “Because my parents have both been unwell and my cat ... it’s been a bunch of things,” she said. “So that’s why it’s nice to come and see friends and have a little perspective. Everyone’s had a bit of a rough year, I think.“ In March, Beckinsale shared a now-deleted Instagram photo that showed her in a hospital bed, without detailing the circumstances around it. She dedicated the caption of that post to her mother in honor of Mother’s Day in the U.K. “Thank you to those that love us and support us when it’s shit and try to make sure there are some bits that aren’t,” she wrote. “And for looking after our dogs when we can’t , and lead us to remember happy things when we can’t . And turn up when we are sick and sit with us.” She shared various other photos of herself in a hospital bed that month, including a picture of her wearing bunny socks on Easter. Since then, the “Underworld” actor has apparently deleted all of the hospital posts from her Instagram account, including one from April 17 that showed her wearing a T-shirt with the words “Tummy Troubles Survivor.” In January, Beckinsale had posted photos of herself by her stepfather’s side in the hospital shortly after she attended the Golden Globes.

The release of “Unfrosted” comes after a media campaign where Seinfeld griped about the state of comedy because of all “the extreme left and PC crap.” The film was released Friday, and by lunchtime it was obvious many critics weren’t sweet on the film, based on a tally of reactions compiled by the Hollywood Reporter. Chicago Sun-Times critic Richard Roeper even went as far as to call “Unfrosted” “one of the decade’s worst movies” in his review and said in a social media post that it was so dreadful it made “Flamin’ Hot,” a film about the creation of an extra-spicy type of Cheetos, “look like ‘The Social Network.’” In the pantheon of Brand Origin Stories, ""Unfrosted"" is so dreadful, it makes ""Flamin' Hot"" look like ""The Social Network.""https://t.co/cd5rI9mw6L He wasn’t the only person who popped off at Seinfeld’s Pop-Tarts film.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/florida-bans-lab-cultivated-meat-sales-distribution_n_6634edd9e4b0fc2b952949e9,Florida Bans Sale Of Lab-Grown Meat Citing ‘Global Elite’ Concerns,nina golgowski,5/3/2024,"In a nationwide first, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has outlawed the sale and distribution of lab-grown meat in his state, claiming a ban will prevent “the global elite” from “forcing the world to eat lab-grown meat and insects.” “Today, Florida is fighting back against the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals,” DeSantis said in a statement following the legislation’s signing Wednesday. The law aims to protect the business of local cattle ranchers and farmers, which the state’s Commissioner of Agriculture, Wilton Simpson, said is under threat by alternative food options. “Lab-grown meat is a disgraceful attempt to undermine our proud traditions and prosperity, and is in direct opposition to authentic agriculture,” Simpson said. Anyone found violating the law, which goes into effect on July 1, risks being fined or having their business license suspended. Similar bans are under consideration in Alabama, Arizona and Tennessee. DeSantis, in explaining the need for a ban, cited an article published on the World Economic Forum’s website that endorsed insect farming for food and animal feed due to rising human population levels. The article, written by the president and chief executive officer of an insect farming company, argues that insect farming could be an environmentally friendly solution to an impending global food crisis. It did not argue for “forcing” its consumption on anyone. Florida’s ban received bipartisan support from Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), who in a statement posted on social media said, though it “pains” him, he agrees with DeSantis. “As a member of [the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, & Forestry] and as some dude who would never serve that slop to my kids, I stand with our American ranchers and farmers,” he wrote. Fetterman’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. The U.S. Agriculture Department last June approved the sale of chicken made from animal cells after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration deemed such products safe to eat. Lab-grown meat, also called cultivated meat, is still hard to find and more expensive than meat that comes from slaughterhouses. The products are produced in steel tanks using cells from a living animal. They’re not the same as plant-based proteins, like the Impossible Burger, which are often packaged to resemble meat that comes from an animal. Meat-manufacturing companies have meanwhile hit back at Florida’s ban. GOOD Meat, which touts itself as the first company in the world to sell cultivated meat, called DeSantis’ law disappointing and “a setback for everyone.” “In a state that purportedly prides itself on being a land of freedom and individual liberty, its government is now telling consumers what meat they can or cannot purchase,” the California-based company said in a statement. UPSIDE Foods, another California-based meat producer, slammed DeSantis’ ban as overreaching “food policing.” The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-vp-list-kristi-noem_n_6634f704e4b0fc2b95294be2,8 Possible Trump VP Candidates Who Haven't Shot Their Dogs,liz skalka,5/3/2024,"Kristi Noem thought the political world would be impressed by her story of executing a dog, but she seems to have misjudged her fellow Republicans — including, most critically, Donald Trump. In the span of a few days, the South Dakota governor reportedly tanked her shot at becoming Trump’s running mate when a section of her forthcoming memoir, obtained by the Guardian, described her decision to lead a 14-month-old wirehaired pointer named Cricket to a gravel pit and shoot her dead. The pup was overly aggressive and bad at hunting, Noem wrote. RIP Cricket! But if Noem’s out, there are still plenty of people on Trump’s VP shortlist who haven’t killed dogs — that we know of! The first-term Ohio senator is reportedly near the top of Trump’s VP list. And unlike Noem, Vance has already had to confront what seemed like his most damaging electoral baggage in his 2022 race: He’s previously bashed Trump, calling him “noxious,” an “idiot” and “reprehensible.” Now Trump and Vance are thick as thieves, although Vance claims that he and Trump haven’t discussed the possibility of running together. “I talk to President Trump a lot. We’re very close. I’ve never spoken to him about being vice president. So, I assume that a lot of this is media speculation,” Vance said recently on Fox News. It’s unclear how serious Trump is about choosing the Florida senator, since the 12th Amendment prohibits Florida’s 30 Electoral College members from voting for a president and vice president who both live in Florida, and that’s where Trump now resides. To run with Trump, Rubio would theoretically have to move and give up his Senate seat. Rubio, who ran against Trump for president in 2016, offered a testy response to the speculation this week. “I’m glad to learn that from the media. I’ll let you guys pick where I’m gonna move, how’s that?” he told reporters at the Capitol. “No one’s offered any jobs, so why would I answer a question that I’ve never been presented?” Rubio also has a cute good boy named Winston who seems to be alive and well, at least as of a few years ago. The South Carolina senator would make history as the first Black Republican VP, and could signal Trump is making a play to win over Black voters disappointed in President Joe Biden. Scott began the 2024 election cycle as an opponent of Trump’s for the GOP nomination, before dropping out and becoming his surrogate on the campaign trail. He played a major role campaigning for Trump against former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley in South Carolina in February. Scott, who doesn’t answer questions from reporters at the Capitol, hasn’t addressed the speculation. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has openly pined for the chance to be part of a second Trump administration, speculating to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in August: “Am I going to be a part of President Trump’s Cabinet if he wins? Is it possible that I’ll be VP?” Greene on Wednesday described herself as “the biggest supporter of President Trump” in Congress. But in recent weeks she and Trump have differed on her quest to overthrow House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), about whom Trump still speaks highly. Trump refused to fan the flames of the dispute while Johnson was with him in Florida last month: “We’re getting along very well with the speaker, and I get along very well with Marjorie.” Kari Lake, an election-denying conspiracy theorist running for a must-win Senate seat in Arizona, has reportedly been getting on Trump’s nerves by spending too much time trying to flatter the former president at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. You might say both Lake and Greene are in Trump’s doghouse right now. Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) is another of Trump’s fiercest defenders in the House of Representatives. She’s called Jan. 6 rioters “hostages” and even scrubbed her past criticism of Trump’s mob from her House website. Stefanik’s vice presidential stock went up when she confronted university presidents about antisemitism on campus, causing them to embarrass themselves by refusing to say if “calling for the genocide of Jews,” as she put it, would count as bullying or harassment. Stefanik said in January that she “would be honored to serve in any capacity in a Trump administration.” The Trump team reportedly likes North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum because he didn’t say mean things about Trump when he was competing in the Republican primary this year, was quick to endorse Trump after dropping his bid, and perhaps also because he hasn’t shot any dogs (again, that we know of!). Burgum, like Trump, is a fellow rich guy, wealthy enough to have self-funded his own presidential campaign (which nonetheless didn’t last through the first nominating contest in Iowa). Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) is not on Trump’s VP list — they hate each other — but his dog story shows why dogs matter in politics. The next four years will change America forever.

He told HuffPost this week it was nothing compared to what Noem did. “I didn’t eat my dog. I didn’t shoot my dog. I loved my dog, and my dog loved me,” Romney said.

The 23-year-old “Whip My Hair” singer is well aware of the discourse surrounding “nepo babies,” a term that describes the nepotism afforded to privileged celebrity children, but she isn’t going to let her parents — Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith — steal her thunder. “I definitely think that a little bit of my insecurity has driven me harder because people do think that the only reason I’m successful is because of my parents,” she told Allure in an interview Thursday. “That has driven me to work really hard to prove them wrong.” “But nowadays,” Smith continued, “I don’t need to prove shit to anybody.” The young musician has forged an impressive career, including collaborations with artists like Nicki Minaj and Travis Barker. She’s also won an NAACP Image Award and earned a Daytime Emmy nod as the co-host of her mom’s “Red Table Talk” series. She made her movie debut at only 6 years old in her dad’s 2007 blockbuster “I Am Legend,” but she argued Thursday that she’s mainly successful because of her “strong spirit” and said, “Even if my parents weren’t who they were, I would still be a weirdo and a crazy thinker.” Smith also argued that the “nepo baby” discourse doesn’t fully apply to Black Americans. “Being Black in America, even with privilege, which I’m never going to deny that I have, you’re still Black,” she told Allure. “And I love being Black. People would look at me and [say], ‘Okay, well, her parents are this and this and that, but she is still like me. She still has brown skin.’ And we all know that that doesn’t exempt you from anything.” Smith noted that her upbringing, while privileged, was always rooted in discipline and self-awareness. She claimed her parents “were always so extreme” about looking people in the eyes and being “very respectful” to all, and argued, “there’s not a lot of that these days.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone says the world should listen. Fanone, who was violently attacked by Trump supporters while defending the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, spoke to HuffPost on Friday about a damning Trump interview published by Time magazine this week. “I believe everything that Donald Trump tells me about his intentions,” Fanone said in a phone interview. “And I think every American should — everyone in the world should — believe Donald Trump in the things that he says because there’s a method to the madness.” Speaking to Time at length, Trump outlined what could happen if he wins back the White House in November — and if he doesn’t. He spoke of his plans to deport millions of migrants. He said that he would permit red states with abortion bans to monitor women’s pregnancies. He suggested that he was open to firing federal prosecutors who don’t follow his orders on who to prosecute, and that he would “absolutely” consider pardoning every single one of the people sentenced for their roles in the Capitol riot. Trump also predicted that there would be no political violence after the November election, but only if he wins. “If we don’t win, you know, it depends,” he said. “I wasn’t surprised, but it’s still shocking to see an American presidential candidate spell out his — I don’t know what to call it,” Fanone said about reading the Time interview. “Evil manifesto,” he said, after taking a moment to think. “And do it in a somewhat respectable news magazine, for everyone to behold.” He asked, “Where is the urgency with our American institutions and those that occupy them to prevent this from happening?” Fanone experienced a heart attack and traumatic brain injury after Trump supporters beat and electroshocked him in 2021. Multiple men who assaulted him have been sentenced to years in prison. He sees Trump’s repeated pledges to pardon Jan. 6 rioters as a “dog whistle” and a “call to action” to his supporters, signaling that they will not face consequences if they commit violence on Trump’s behalf. “If he doesn’t win, then he’ll use any and every means at his disposal to either destroy the system and democracy, or try to put himself back in the seat of power,” Fanone said. Trump’s refusal to rule out violence around the next election and his pledge to pardon the Jan. 6 rioters are basically more messages to his supporters to “stand by,” the former police officer said. He drew on his decadeslong law enforcement career to highlight other concerns about Trump, who is currently on criminal trial and faces three other felony indictments, with two tied to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. “Criminals learn every time they’re exposed to law enforcement’s efforts to apprehend, prosecute, punish,” Fanone said. “They evolve.” He said: “Donald Trump saw what his failures were, or at least what the failures of those around him were in attempting to subvert democracy on Jan. 6. And he’ll make sure that people ... who are not going to be corrupted no longer exist in our government.” The next four years will change America forever.

Many have warned that, in a hypothetical second presidency, he would surround himself only with sycophants and yes men who will not dissuade him from following his worst impulses. Trump himself has suggested that he will be even harsher in firing people he clashes with if he returns to the Oval Office.

Although Twitter has rebranded to X, the humor lives on. Every week, we round up the most hilarious quips from parents on the social media platform to spread the joy. Scroll down to read the latest batch, and follow @HuffPostParents for more! My 8 year old asked if I’d seen his water bottle and I said it was next to the couch. He started to walk off then paused and asked, “the couch for sitting or the couch for laundry?” and the accuracy of the question stung a little. An underrated parenting hack is that kids love branding. My 3yo won't drink milk when I offer it except when I say ""here's your cold, fresh milk"" I took my 6yo to softball practice and then realized it was canceled. My 6yo smiled at me, ""Well, look at that, we yelled at each other for nothing."" My daughter just burped loud as hell in Olive Garden and I’m like WOW have some decorum and she’s like “that word doesn’t effect me cause I don’t know what it means” Okay. Moms in TV ads are almost always wearing this exact outfit and yet I’ve never seen a human woman wear this outfit in real life. pic.twitter.com/1f0sbcSBDe My 8-year-old got his expander and braces taken off and he’s supposed to wear a retainer at night. He lost the retainer by Day 3, and I told him to find it because I’d rather not pay for another one. He looked startled and said “We PAY for this stuff??” My 10 y/o son has a lot of friends who show up on our doorstep but by far my most fave lil dude has got to be the one who always appears holdin a fistful of ham My daughter asked me if the tooth fairy would only give money for *her* teeth and I’m a little concerned In case you ever wanted to feel better about your housekeeping skills: my son just walked in and asked why I was making it smell like his birthday party. All I had done was mopped. Also, his birthday is in July. I’m gonna say no to everything today.— my 5yo really setting the tone for the day Parenting experts never warn you that one day you'll offer to let your son borrow one of your ties to match the suit he's wearing for prom and he'll respond by asking you if you have anything that's not from the 1900s My husband works from home and our toddler knocks on his office door prob 100 times a day to ask if she can see pictures of raccoons on his computer. He‘s never acted annoyed. It makes me cry lmfao I asked my 6yo if she wants to skip school on her birthday and she's having a hard time deciding because she doesn't want to miss out on the birthday sticker they get from their teacher. Explained to a 7 yo that our tv shows were only run at a specific time and if you missed it, you just missed it. After processing this horror she asked “but you could find it on your iPad?” What followed was the millennial version of “in my day I walked miles barefoot to school” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/sea-lions-pier-39-san-francisco-anchovies_n_66350bbae4b00b1eab5335d9,Sea Lions Storm San Francisco's Pier 39 In Massive Numbers For 1 Thing Only,ap,5/3/2024,"SAN FRANCISCO — They’re lounging, biting each other and generally making a ruckus in numbers not seen in more than a decade. And don’t even think about stealing their anchovies. San Francisco’s famed Fisherman’s Wharf district is seeing a surge in sea lions. First appearing at Pier 39 after the 1989 earthquake, the sea lions have become a well known tourist attraction. The number of sea lions — marine mammals that make loud barking calls and can weight up to a half-ton — crashing at the pier fluctuates over the seasons. On most days more than a hundred can be seen. But this week, Pier 39 harbormaster Sheila Chandor has counted more than 1,000 sea lions, and that’s the most seen there in 15 years. A huge school of anchovies — a favored food of the pinnipeds — brought them there, Chandor said. “It’s all about the seafood. It’s all about the food,” Chandor said. “A very good way to put it is they are fueling up for the mating season. It’s spring. They are ready to rock and roll down in the Channel Islands, and we’re a nice pit stop with some great seafood.” The spike in sea lions is indeed only expected to be temporary. But the barges the sea lions lounge on are designed to hold significant weight, and officials admit this current surge is testing their limits. Biologists said the number of anchovies in the bay that seems to have attracted extra sea lions this spring is especially high. Chandor said the schooling fish were off the Farallon Islands.

Log in to hide these messages. Meanwhile, shops and businesses in the area were hoping the sea lion surge would also result in a tourist shopping spree, attracting more visitors to the area. Sea lion lovers have been flocking to the pier to catch a glimpse of the huge, noisy herd. “I’ve never seen that many sea lions in one place. I heard about this place, and we came here a few minutes ago, and it’s awesome to see them,” said Theresa Simbeck, a visitor from Germany. “It’s very loud, of course, but it’s really nice to see all of them. And it’s funny to watch them fight and relax in the sun.” Big numbers of sea lions have come to their pier in past years, and some 1,700 have previously arrived, Chandor said. It’s usually 300 to 400 in winter and up to 700 in spring, Chandor said.

It’s that simple. Then it’s off to dreamland.” The fake Trump has a fantasy about McDonald’s Mayor McCheese before he’s rudely awaked by another bodily function that he’s been accused of during the trial. The former president, who’s charged with disguising hush money payments to a porn actor paramour as business expenses, said he hasn’t been sleeping, just resting his “beautiful blue eyes.” The next four years will change America forever.

Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Getting a restful sleep regularly is an integral part of our overall wellness, but that doesn’t mean everyone has an easy time achieving it. If you’re a hot sleeper or have other challenges resting comfortably in bed, then you may want to hop over to Brooklinen to grab the beloved Marlow pillow. The firmness-adjustable cooling pillow is finally under $50 in Brooklinen’s rare sitewide 25% off sale which ends on May 6. For hot sleepers, the pillow features cooling-infused memory foam and breathable mesh to maintain good airflow. The pillow also has a tiered zipper design — similar to the ones that come on expandable luggage — that makes its height and firmness adjustable. The flexibility of the Marlow style also makes it an ideal choice for various sleeping positions whether you rest on your side, stomach or back. While it’s 80% filled with memory foam, the remaining 20% is polyester fiber to help strike a balance of firm yet plush support. “The zippers on the side really do make a difference,” wrote one reviewer on Brooklinen. “We are a mix: my husband is a back sleeper and I am a stomach sleeper, and there’s just enough fluff for the both of us! SUCH an upgrade from the products that we’ve had before. So go ahead and take the plunge.” Promising reviews: “Can’t say enough about the comfort of this pillow. It keeps cool, it’s firm, yet soft and comfortable. I’m a stomach sleeper and this pillow seemed to have been designed with stomach sleepers in mind! I won’t buy any other pillow.” — Michael O.  “So cool and comfortable, can’t imagine sleeping without it anymore!” — Chad L.  “I am not a memory foam person (or at least I wasn’t). But these pillows are a game changer. I bought them because I thought they would be good for a guest bedroom (guests could choose their preferred pillow firmness). But honestly, we have been using them ourselves. They also stay very cool which is a great perk! I’ve yet to find a Brookline product that I haven’t loved.” — Stephanie P.  “Best side sleep pillow I have had. My neck is not sore every morning like before. Recommend the Marlow pillow protector for ultimate cool sleep.” — Jessica M.  “While I gave the sateen sheets one star and sent them back, I kept all four of these pillows. With the zipper system, it has been easy to experiment with the firmness. They are exactly what the site promises: supportive, cool, and easily adjustable. They work especially well for someone like me who sleeps on both their side and back.” — David S.

Henry Cuellar, Wife On Federal Bribery Charges",daniel marans,5/3/2024,"The Department of Justice indicted Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, on Friday for bribery, unlawful foreign influence and money laundering. The indictment comes more than two years after the federal law enforcement agency raided his home in Laredo, Texas. Between 2014 and 2021, the Cuellars accepted about $600,000 in bribes from an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan, and a Mexico City-based bank, the DOJ charges. In exchange for the bribes from the Azerbaijani company, Henry Cuellar “promised to influence U.S. foreign policy in favor of Azerbaijan,” including in its dispute with neighboring Armenia, according to the DOJ indictment. And in exchange for the funds from the Mexican bank, the federal government alleges that Henry Cuellar “agreed” to use his “influence” against anti-money laundering measures in Congress and the executive branch that “threatened” the bank’s interests. He also said he would support legislation to “block federal regulation of the payday lending industry.” The couple hid the payments using layers of middlemen and a series of shell companies under Imelda Cuellar’s name, according to the DOJ indictment. If convicted, the couple could serve up to 20 years prison, though lighter sentences are more likely. Henry Cuellar denied the charges in a defiant statement earlier in the day on Friday. “I want to be clear that both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations,” he said in a statement that his office posted on X. “Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.” “Let me be clear, I’m running for reelection and will win this November,” he added. Henry Cuellar and his wife were released from jail on a $100,000 unsecured bond on Friday, a DOJ source told HuffPost. He has agreed to step down from his post as ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee’s homeland security subcommittee while his case is open. Hoping to capitalize on former President Donald Trump strong 2020 performance in Texas’ predominantly Latino border communities, national Republicans sought to knock the lawmaker out in 2022. But Henry Cuellar, the House’s last anti-abortion Democrat, triumphed over Cassy Garcia, a former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), by more than 13 percentage points.

Trump claimed Thursday he would be unable to testify in the trial concerning a hush money scheme and falsified business records, and blamed the gag order he’s currently under for keeping him off the stand. “I’m not allowed to testify. I’m under a gag order,” he told reporters in the hallway outside the courtroom. “I’m not allowed to testify because this judge who’s totally conflicted, has me under an unconstitutional gag order.” Judge Juan Merchan corrected Trump’s apparent misunderstanding before the jury filed in Friday morning. The gag order “does not prohibit you from taking the stand,” Merchan told Trump. “As the name of the order indicates, it only applies to extrajudicial statements.” CNN fact checker Daniel Dale called out Trump’s lie immediately. “This claim that the gag order means he can’t testify, it’s just conjured out of thin air,” he told Jake Tapper on Thursday. “Trump has gone from saying that he will testify, to he maybe will testify, to if it’s necessary, to now, ‘Whoa, whoa, I can’t testify, it’s out of my hands.’ But it’s in his hands. He can testify and he’s just making stuff up.” The next four years will change America forever. But HuffPost won't back down when it comes to providing free and impartial journalism.

But he’s free to discuss anything else related to the case, including Merchan and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg ― whom he’s attacked repeatedly. Should Trump actually take the stand, as he unequivocally pledged to do, it would likely be against the advice of his attorneys.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/aroeve-air-purifier-sale-amazon-may_l_6634fdc1e4b00b1eab532871,This Popular Large-Room Air Purifier Is Somehow Less Than $70 Right Now,tessa flores,5/3/2024,"HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Wildfire season is upon many of us just a few short months, depending on your region — which means investing in an air purifier before conditions potentially get smoky might not be a bad idea. The only downside is that these life-improving appliances are notoriously expensive, with some models ranging well into the thousands. But as luck would have it, you can snag one for less than $70 at Amazon right now. The Aroeve air purifier, which has an average 4.6-star rating and tons of positive reviews, is currently on sale for over 40% off its typical Amazon price of $119 and seems to be equipped with all of the vital requirements that make purifiers their most effective ― like a true HEPA filter and air quality monitoring system. All you have to do is remember to clip the coupon to get the lowest price possible. Using a combination of a true H13 HEPA filter (HEPA filters are used in hospitals to prevent the spread of airborne pathogens) and a high-efficiency filtration system, the Aroeve can effectively filter particles as small as 0.3 microns in the air in rooms as large as 1,095 square feet. It also features a UV light treatment stage to provide more comprehensive air purification. Plus, thanks to an air quality sensor, the purifier automatically adjusts its power and will give an idea of your air quality in real time. If you do decide to jump on this deal, the company recommends replacing the filter every three to six months, a process that takes just two short steps. If you need even more convincing to purchase the Aroeve for yourself, keep reading to see why others are so glad they did. Promising Amazon reviews: “Only smoker in the house. Before I was using a box fan in a window to exhaust the smoke. It never did a good job at not allowing the HVAC system to pull smoke back to the return. This machine removes 100% of the smoke particles from the room before it can make its way to another room. Non-smokers can’t even smell a hint of cigarette smoke in the room minutes after you extinguish a cigarette.” — Micheal “Very very small compared to all of my friends’ purifiers, but it does the job. My girlfriend has had zero asthma attacks since I’ve had this thing and that in itself is worth the price. My basement smells a ton better, it used to have like a mildew smell but that’s gone. I’ve got two dog kennels in the basement also that would get smelly but that’s taken care of too. Honestly, I’ll probably buy one for each floor of my house, it’s that good.” — Shane “With the out of control wildfires lately, the air quality in our area has been designated dangerous and I could smell smoke in my house. I ordered this unit, took the plastic off the filter (very important), and turned it on Auto. The fan went to high speed, the light ring turned yellow, and within about a half hour, the ring turned blue, speed dropped, and there was no smoke smell in the house. It’s quiet even when running at high speed, it does the job, and I’m pretty happy with my purchase. The unit seems well made and looks nice enough.” — C Sanders By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-economy-jobs-report-employment_n_6634e83fe4b05f96b018234b,"U.S. Employers Scaled Back Hiring In April But Still Added 175,000 Jobs",paul wiseman,5/3/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s employers pulled back on their hiring in April but still added a decent 175,000 jobs in a sign that persistently high interest rates may be starting to slow the robust U.S. job market. Friday’s government report showed that last month’s hiring gain was down sharply from the blockbuster increase of 315,000 in March. And it was well below the 233,000 gain that economists had predicted for April. Yet the moderation in the pace of hiring, along with a slowdown last month in wage growth, will likely be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates at a two-decade high to fight persistently elevated inflation. Hourly wages rose a less-than-expected 0.2% from March and 3.9% from a year earlier, the smallest annual gain since June 2021. The Fed has been delaying any consideration of interest rate cuts until it gains more confidence that inflation is steadily slowing toward its target. Fed rate cuts would, over time, reduce the cost of mortgages, auto loans and other consumer and business borrowing. Stock futures jumped Friday after the jobs report was released on hopes that rate cuts might now be more likely sometime in the coming months. Even with the April hiring slowdown, last month’s job growth amounted to a solid increase, though it was the lowest monthly job growth since October. With the nation’s households continuing their steady spending, many employers have had to keep hiring to meet their customer demand. The unemployment rate ticked up 3.9% — the 27th straight month in which it has remained below 4%, the longest such streak since the 1960s. Last month’s hiring was led by healthcare companies, which added 56,000 jobs. Warehouse and transportation companies added 22,000 and retailers 20,000. The state of the economy is weighing on voters’ minds as the November presidential campaign intensifies. Despite the strength of the job market, Americans remain generally exasperated by high prices, and many of them assign blame to President Joe Biden. America’s job market has repeatedly proved more robust than almost anyone had predicted. When the Fed began aggressively raising rates two years ago to fight a punishing inflation surge, most economists expected the resulting jump in borrowing costs to cause a recession and drive unemployment to painfully high levels. The Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times from March 2022 to July 2023, taking it to the highest level since 2001. Inflation did steadily cool as it was supposed to — from a year-over-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.5% in March. Yet the resilient strength of the job market and the overall economy, fueled by steady consumer spending, has kept inflation persistently above the Fed’s 2% target.

On a month-over-month basis, consumer inflation hasn’t declined since October. The 3.5% year-over-year inflation rate for March was still running well above the Fed’s 2% target.

Multiple journalists reported that the former president stared at the MSNBC host as he exited the Manhattan courtroom where his hush money trial is taking place. The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman said Trump was “squinting strangely” at O’Donnell. MSNBC contributor Adam Klasfeld said Trump turned his head “directly” toward O’Donnell, glowered and muttered under his breath. “It seems Donald Trump wasn’t really pleased to see me,” O’Donnell, who was seated at the front of the gallery, told viewers on “The Last Word.” “I have my interpretation of what Donald Trump’s face and eyes were trying to say to me, and what drove him to create a final moment in the courtroom today that was worthy of New York Times reporting,” he added. He noted that Trump’s close adviser, Boris Epshteyn, was “sitting in the front row reserved for the Trump family members, who did not show up once again” — right in front of O’Donnell’s own seat. “He should have told Donald Trump, ‘When you walk by O’Donnell, don’t give him the satisfaction of making a moment about him,’” he said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lupus-autoimmune-disease-sun-exposure_n_662407bce4b0167f7bf51988,A Mysterious Illness Turned Me Into A Vampire. My Diagnosis Was Both A Relief — And Devastating.,jennifer spitzer,5/3/2024,"My son’s favorite song is “Vampire” by Olivia Rodrigo. It plays on a continuous loop in our home. I wonder if he is old enough to delight in the lore of the vampire, the figure’s sexy and mysterious violence, and the theatrical crescendos of Rodrigo’s voice: “Bloodsucker, fame fucker.” In mid-October, he assembled a vampire costume for Halloween, replete with fangs, fake blood and a synthetic black cape that barely enveloped his 10-year-old frame. I have a different impression of vampires now that I am one. Because of a condition called lupus, if I’m exposed to direct sunlight, even for 10 minutes, a fiery rash appears on my chest and chin, and a milder rash — call it a blush or a butterfly rash — spreads across my cheeks and nose. The sun also causes me to turn febrile. I shiver and shake. It weakens my legs, sometimes to the point of immobility. It gives me one swollen, cyclopean eye. No wide-brimmed hat or SPF lotion can fully avert such reactions, so I retreat like a vampire into the dark lair of my home on sunny days. I have installed blinds throughout the bottom floor of the house to make the transformation complete. Call it Transylvania. When the rashes first erupted at the beginning of last summer, I had hoped they were heat rashes, like the fiery bumps I remembered from childhood beach trips. And when the sweating began, I assumed it might be the early throes of menopause, which, at the age of 43, did not seem unimaginable. But other symptoms followed. Pain migrated from my fingers to my elbow to my ankle to my knees. The pain was insidious, like a roving animal. My fingers hurt so much that it became difficult to hold a book or press open its spine, something I did every day as a professor. Weeks later a fog descended on my mind. It was so thick that I worried I would never be able to read a full book again. Sometimes the words swam on the page, and I wondered if my eyes were dry or if my vision was worsening, or both. I wondered: Would this be the end of my career? What would I do instead? My joints crackled. My skin itched. When I walked, it felt like I listed sideways, uncomfortably drunk. One day, I called a friend because I couldn’t type an email — my fingers had stiffened. Days later, my husband found me in the bedroom mantled in darkness, after I pulled all the lightbulbs out of their sockets; the brightness stung my eyes. I did not know what was wrong with me, but I felt betrayed by my own body. Autoimmunity is a kind of betrayal. The immune system mistakes the self for an enemy and attacks the body’s healthy tissues and cells. Bodily betrayal is a common refrain of autoimmune sufferers. A body that once functioned in a manner you expected turns on you in unpredictable ways. Your body is without loyalty to the self it serves. *** As the weeks wore on, I felt more and more like a vampire — hiding from the sun during the day, walking my dog at night, becoming paler and more anemic. It turns out that the vampire has long been associated with diseases like porphyria and lupus, both of which produce symptoms intensified by sun exposure and garlic. Bram Stoker’s “Dracula,” published in 1897, introduced another enduring trope: that vampires don’t produce reflections in mirrors. There may have been historical reasons for this choice. In the 19th century, mirrors were backed by a plate of silver, a metal that was supposed to drive back evil spirits. Like garlic, silver has antimicrobial properties, which may have reinforced the vampire’s association with disease. For the first several months of my mysterious illness, I took down almost every mirror in the house, repelled by my own reflection. I couldn’t bear to witness the rashes on my face and my rapidly thinning hair — the bald patches spreading along my forehead. I couldn’t tell if the purple shadows under my eyes were from the illness, the insomnia that plagued me, or the heavy steroids that the doctor had prescribed. When I asked my husband if I looked different, he shrugged and said I looked the same. But deep down I felt I was undergoing a transformation, as if some inner torment were manifesting physically. Then one day my tongue became scalloped, with indentations along the edges. When I showed my son, he gasped, “OMG, what is that?!” Then he wanted to see it again. He seemed curious and even concerned, but I felt like his mother-monster. *** Without a language for my illness, I called myself a vampire. But I wasn’t a bloodthirsty predator, just a formerly able-bodied person suddenly dependent on others for almost everything. The previous year I had taught 125 students and published a book and two articles, but almost overnight I was spending my days shuffling between emergency room visits and medical specialists who seemed faintly alarmed and also baffled by my symptoms. One ER physician told me “to sleep more and eat clean,” which was not the same as a diagnosis. A nurse practitioner thought my bloodwork suggested “weak” Lyme disease and prescribed doxycycline. But I became sicker, weaker and more despairing. When the dermatologist called in November to tell me that I had lupus, to give it a name, I felt relieved — because I had my suspicions, because the blood tests had hinted at it — but also devastated, because now I had an unpredictable and incurable disease. “It is not necessarily fatal,” the internet said, “but it can attack every organ and bodily system.” Like a vampire, I straddled a threshold between life and death. I am lucky to have been diagnosed relatively quickly, with an antinuclear antibody test and a skin biopsy that were both positive for lupus. But this was partly the result of ruthless self-advocacy, painstaking research and navigating the byzantine corridors of the U.S. health care system — which became a full-time job and would have been impossible to do without a medical leave from my institution. I sought out weekly appointments with rheumatologists, pulmonologists, neurologists, optometrists, dermatologists, cardiologists and gynecologists. My diagnosis took under six months, but many people with autoimmune diseases hover in uncertainty for years and even decades. Lupus remains a shadowy illness, vampiric in its predation of nearly every bodily system and organ — skin, heart, kidneys, lungs, liver and brain. It lacks a clear origin and cure, and is notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat. Nine out of 10 people with lupus are women, and it disproportionately affects women of color. Many patients report feeling belittled by doctors or dismissed as hysterical. Because lupus is largely a women’s disease, there is correspondingly little research into it. Women’s illnesses and conditions remain in the dark like vampires, as do the women themselves. When I joined an online support group for lupus, made up primarily of women, I noticed how many of the participants discussed feeling vampirelike too. They spoke of extreme sun sensitivity and the way lupus forced them to live their lives at night, at odds with the normative rhythms of everyday life. But sometimes it felt like they were speaking in code, about feeling isolated, misunderstood by doctors and loved ones, cast aside by a scientific community that devoted little attention and resources to diseases like theirs. The more I participated in these forums, however, the less I felt like a misfit suffering in the shadows. *** I love Anne Rice’s vampires the most — immortal, sensual, pulsing with desire. They are unlike my vampire, who is fragile and hopelessly time-bound. My vampire feels old for her age. This is where the metaphor ends. The more well-known metaphor for lupus is the purple butterfly, an affirming symbol of hope and resilience. Two summers ago, my son and I captured a caterpillar in a jar and stuffed the jar full of leaves, hoping we could grow a butterfly ourselves. We stared at it and stared at it, but we eventually decided it was dead and forgot about the jar, which perched on the lip of our living room window. Then after two weeks we were amazed to find a folded-up monarch clinging to the lid, its wings like stained glass. It had a resilience we couldn’t quite fathom. We walked the jar outside and placed the monarch on a leaf, expecting it to fly off. But it refused to move for hours, as if in stunned stupor at its new shape. As I write this, I feel less like the vampire and more like the stunned butterfly, wondering how I will fly in this new body. There is safety in the long and dark winter periods in upstate New York. I had fantasized that I would emerge transformed in spring, that the medications I began in September would lead me to a better place, and mostly they have. But sometimes my limbs feel heavy like weighted blankets. My fingers still stiffen at the joints. I am told to move more, and on most days, I feel a buoyancy that belies my condition, as if I could move with the sky. But other days I fall hard, like a humbled “lupie” still learning her limits. Nothing about lupus is linear, and the traditional narrative arcs do not apply to chronic illnesses like mine — there will be periods of flare and remission, but no resolution or cure. If I were to plot my progress since June, it would appear an erratic line, tending upward. But this gives me hope. Living with lupus is partly about accepting the unknowns and valuing the good days, while also giving myself permission to mourn my prevampire self. My son, the vampire for Halloween, recently told me we are both vampires, cowering from the sun, only my cape is invisible. The next four years will change America forever.

The pair, in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, opened up about working together on the new action comedy film as EW pointed to director David Leitch’s claim that the two almost drowned on set. Blunt opened up about the “ridiculous” story, claiming not to realize that a monsoon hit the base camp during what she described as a “quiet little” 22-minute meditation session, which was interrupted when a door swung open. “It was like a hurricane was going on, and Ryan was like [‘The] Last of the Mohicans’: ‘You need to leave!’ I was meditating, and now he thinks I meditate too much,” she said. Gosling, in an interview with Jimmy Fallon last month, described Blunt as “cool” and “unflappable” as he reflected on the story. “She had like Headspace on and a little candle and she was like ‘Ryan, I’ll be fine,’” he recalled. Gosling teased Blunt that she was “too chill” and “too zen” to wade out into knee-deep water before his co-star further described the frightening situation. “The trailers were floating away. I mean, I was surprised that my driver, Scott, had not come and knocked on the door saying, ‘We should go.’ Scott was just listening to Spotify,” she said. “I think he got washed away. I just saw his hands above the surface,” Gosling replied. Blunt added that she remembers Aaron Taylor-Johnson taking off “most of his clothes” and running in water at the base camp. “He was still very much in character. Just a regular, run-of-the-mill day on set in Australia,” she said. “We went to Australia for the weather, and that’s what we ended up with.” “The Fall Guy” hits theaters on Friday and is expected to gross $30 million or more at the box office this weekend, according to Variety.

But in a new interview with MSNBC’s Stephanie Ruhle, the Oscar-winning actor offered a more somber analysis (involving just one curse word) to make his predictions of a potential second Trump presidency even more chilling. De Niro — who has previously called Trump “so fucking stupid,” “a fucking moron,” “evil” and a con man— described the presumptive GOP presidential nominee as “genuinely a sick person who somehow has been allowed into our system.” “I’m tired of calling him names,” he told Ruhle. “He just can’t be anywhere near the office of the presidency.” De Niro said he would never portray Trump because there’s “not one redeeming thing in him that I can see, ever, ever.” “It’s fucking scary. Excuse my French,” he said, lobbing the single F-bomb of the chat. President Joe Biden is “the right guy,” and “we don’t have a choice, and I say that in a very good way,” said De Niro. Biden should “keep up the fight” and “go at him hard” because “people take notice of that stuff.” Watch the full interview here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Noem, the Republican South Dakota governor who’s been talked up as a possible running mate for former President Donald Trump, already courted controversy with an account in the book of killing her young dog Cricket because the pup behaved poorly and couldn’t hunt. Noem’s camp pushed back against the assertion that she lied about chatting with the North Korean leader when she served in the House of Representatives. “It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book ‘No Going Back’ has two small errors,” spokesperson Ian Fury said in a statement to HuffPost on Friday. “This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor. Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn’t have been. ... The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected.” “The media will, of course, try and make these tiny issues huge,” he added. Noem also recalled in the book that she canceled a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron last year, which Macron’s office denied, the Scout reported. But her self-aggrandizing passage about the Kim meeting is particularly noteworthy. In “No Going Back,” due out May 7, Noem wrote: “Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I’m sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I’d been a children’s pastor, after all). Dealing with foreign leaders takes resolve, preparation and determination. My experiences on those many foreign trips made me a better member of Congress and a stronger governor. It allowed me to hone my deal-making skills, which play a crucial role in leadership.” The Scout said its examination of congressional travel records raised serious doubts about her claim, as did its sources. “I don’t see any conceivable way that a single junior member of Congress without explicit escort from the U.S. State Department and military would be meeting with a leader from North Korea,” Notre Dame political science professor George Lopez, an authority on the hermit kingdom, told the outlet. “There’s no way,” added Benjamin Young, the author of a book on North Korea.

In court Thursday, Trump attorney Todd Blanche read a crude nickname for his client during a hearing about the gag order against Trump. Blanche was trying to convince Judge Juan Merchan that Trump should be allowed to defend himself against criticism, even if it means attacking witnesses in the case. It was during this argument that the moniker “VonShitzinPantz” entered the court record, as Blanche read out critical tweets from Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen, a key witness for the prosecution. It drew laughs in the courtroom, and again from a panel on CNN, when Tapper shared it, telling viewers, “I apologize for this update.” Ingraham was not amused. She complained that CNN had been fixated on covering the trial — a historic, first-ever criminal trial for a former president — and showed Fox News viewers a clip of Tapper telling the “VonShitzinPants” anecdote. “This is CNN,” she snarked. “Where does James Earl Jones go to get his voiceover back?” Ingraham is not happy with CNN using a certain Trump nickname today pic.twitter.com/iOLnx6S4k7 The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/truck-crash-i-95-closure_n_6634bceae4b00b1eab530356,I-95 In Connecticut Will Close For Days After Fiery Crash Damages Bridge,"susan haigh , pat eaton-robb",5/3/2024,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — The major traffic artery linking New England with New York will be closed in Connecticut for days after a tanker fire damaged a bridge over Interstate 95, Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday. The tanker truck filled with gasoline burst into flames in a three-vehicle crash Thursday on I-95 in southwest Connecticut, closing the East Coast’s main north-south highway and causing major traffic jams. While Lamont said there were no serious injuries in the 5:30 a.m. accident in Norwalk, the crash caused damage to the bridge above it. “The heat from the burning fuel compromised some of the bridge, so that bridge is going to have to come down and that demolition is going to start first thing tomorrow morning,” Lamont said at a briefing Thursday evening in Hartford. He said the hope is to reopen the interstate by Monday morning. Norwalk Mayor Harry Rilling said his city’s schools will be closed on Friday. It’s unclear whether they’ll reopen Monday. He urged local employers to consider allowing employees to work from home on Friday, if possible, or use the MetroNorth commuter rail. Additional trains are being added to the rail line, officials said. While the bridge was less than 10 years old, “the damage was pretty severe due to the amount of gasoline that was in the tanker ignited directly underneath the bridge structure,” Connecticut Department of Transportation Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto said. “The steel did begin to overheat and warp.” The tanker had been carrying a load of about 8,500 gallons (about 32,000 liters) when it crashed beneath the Fairfield Avenue bridge, officials said. The overpass did not appear in danger of collapsing, said Scott Hill, chief engineer for the Connecticut Department of Transportation. Eucalitto said it’s unsafe to allow any traffic to pass underneath the bridge in either direction, so the entire bridge, which has beams that cross both spans of highway, has to be removed. Large equipment was being brought to Connecticut Thursday evening to complete the demolition, which is expected to begin around 3 a.m. on Friday. Lamont said the work could take 24 hours or longer to complete. After that, the roadway may need to be repaved before it can reopen. It will likely take about a year to replace the bridge, a major artery for the city of more than 91,000 people. Lamont said he is hoping to receive federal reimbursement to cover the cost. “I’m glad everyone is OK,” Lisa Brinton, who lives south of I-95, told Hearst Connecticut Media. “My concern is the after effect. Norwalk is divided in half by 95 and I drive over Fairfield Avenue bridge everyday.” The cause of the crash remains under police investigation and no charges have been filed. About 160,000 vehicles travel that portion of I-95 in both directions daily, Eucalitto said. Traffic was backed up for dozens of miles during the morning rush hour, and lengthy delays remained in the area into Thursday evening and were expected through the weekend. Slow-moving detours were set up, taking traffic off the highway and around the accident scene. The crash left other highways and secondary roads in gridlock. The major alternate route in the area, the Merritt Parkway, cannot be used by trucks because the underpasses on that highway are too low. Text alerts were sent to residents of Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, and trucking companies who use the section of I-95 were notified to find alternative routes and means of travel, he said. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg also was notified. “I know what an incredible inconvenience this is for people and all I can ask you to do is stay away from that area as best you can,” Lamont said during an earlier briefing in Hartford. “The traffic jams are horrendous.” Crews offloaded about 4,000 gallons (about 15,142 liters) of gasoline that was unburnt and remained on the tanker. Utility crews were also working to replace downed wires. Environmental crews worked to clean up gasoline and firefighting foam. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said the runoff was contained to a retention pond and did not make it into the Norwalk River or the city’s harbor. The accident was reminiscent of last year’s deadly accident in Philadelphia along I-95 when a tractor-trailer carrying gasoline lost control and caught fire, destroying a section of the highway. The crash also came just over a year after a similar wreck on I-95 in Connecticut that forced the closure of the highway. In April 2023, another fuel truck caught fire after colliding with a stopped car on the Gold Star Memorial Bridge between New London and Groton. The fuel truck driver was killed. The crash shut down the southbound side of the bridge for hours, while the northbound side was closed briefly. The driver of the car was recently charged with negligent homicide. —— Associated Press writer Dave Collins contributed to this report By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

She also predicted why Trump’s wife, former first lady Melania Trump, won’t be standing by his side during the proceedings. Trump is “someone who’s all about branding and optics and he knows that it’s not necessarily the best look that he hasn’t had his family by his side [and] that there aren’t crowds of protesters outside supporting him,” Matthews told MSNBC’s Chris Jansing. Trump “feeds off of that kind of energy and so for that not to be assembled outside the courthouse is probably disappointing to him, and putting him in a bad mood and so then he’s lashing out at aides,” she continued. Eric Trump, the former president’s son, is the only family member to attend court so far. Campaign surrogates have started to join the defendant in the courtroom this week. Matthews envisioned more relatives and supporters coming to Trump’s side in the coming weeks. “They’ll continue to try to bring people to be around him so he feels a little bit less embarrassed about the situation,” she predicted. Melania Trump likely won’t be among them, though, said Matthews. Donald Trump, after all, is accused of falsifying documents to cover up hush money payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels. “Look, she hasn’t even campaigned with him yet,” Matthews noted of the former first lady. “So, I don’t think when we’re talking about a case where he made a hush money payment to a porn star, or had an affair with her, and then paid her off because he had this affair just days after Melania gave birth to their son. I really wouldn’t imagine that she wants to sit through a trial like this.” The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-palestinians-campus-protests_n_6634bbb0e4b05f96b01806ef,"Police Start To Clear NYU Encampment As More Than 2,100 Arrested During Campus Protests","julie watson, christopher l. keller, carolyn thompson , stefanie dazio",5/3/2024,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Police began clearing out protesters at New York University on Friday, the latest development in weeks of pro-Palestinian protests at college campuses nationwide that have resulted in nearly 2,200 arrests. Deputy Commissioner of Operations Kaz Daughtry posted on X that NYU requested police assistance “to disperse the illegal encampment on their property.” Daughtry said police “are on site.” Details on possible arrests were not immediately available. A message seeking comment was sent to an NYU spokesperson. Earlier in the week, more than 100 people were taken into custody during a crackdown at Columbia University, where the protests and encampments over the Israel-Hamas war began. One officer accidentally discharged his gun inside a Columbia’s Hamilton Hall while clearing out protesters camped inside Tuesday, authorities said. No one was injured, the NYPD said Thursday. He was trying to use the flashlight attached to his gun at the time and instead fired a single round that struck a frame on the wall. There were other officers but no students in the immediate vicinity, officials said. Body camera footage shows when the officer’s gun went off, but the district attorney’s office is conducting a review, a standard practice. A tally by The Associated Press recorded at least 56 incidents of arrests at 43 different U.S. colleges or universities since April 18. The figures are based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies. Early Thursday, officers surged against a crowd of demonstrators at University of California, Los Angeles, ultimately taking at least 200 protesters into custody after hundreds defied orders to leave, some forming human chains as police fired flash-bangs to break up the crowds. Police tore apart a fortified encampment’s barricade of plywood, pallets, metal fences and dumpsters, then pulled down canopies and tents. Like at UCLA, tent encampments of protesters calling on universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread across other campuses nationwide in a student movement unlike any other this century. Israel has branded the protests antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers — some of whom are Jewish — call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest the war. President Joe Biden on Thursday defended the right of students to peaceful protest but decried the disorder of recent days. The demonstrations began at Columbia on April 17 with students calling for an end to the Israel-Hamas war, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Health Ministry there. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7 and took roughly 250 hostages in an attack on southern Israel. On April 18, the NYPD cleared Columbia’s initial encampment. The demonstrators set up new tents and defied threats of suspension, and escalated their actions early Tuesday by occupying Hamilton Hall, an administration building that was similarly seized in 1968 by students protesting racism and the Vietnam War. Roughly 20 hours later, officers stormed the hall. Video showed police with zip ties and riot shields streaming through a second-floor window. Police had said protesters inside presented no substantial resistance. The officer’s gun went off at 9:38 p.m., the NYPD said, about 10 minutes after police started pouring into Hamilton Hall. The department did not name the officer, whose actions were first reported by news outlet The City on Thursday. The confrontations at UCLA also played out over several days this week. UCLA Chancellor Gene Block told alumni on a call Thursday afternoon that the trouble started after a permitted pro-Israel rally was held on campus Sunday and fights broke out and “live mice” were tossed into the pro-Palestinian encampment later that day. In the following days, administrators tried to find a peaceful solution with members of the encampment and expected things to remain stable, Block said. That changed late Tuesday, he said, when counterdemonstrators attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment. Campus administrators and police did not intervene or call for backup for hours. No one was arrested that night, but at least 15 protesters were injured. The delayed response drew criticism from political leaders, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, and officials pledged an independent review. By Wednesday, the encampment had become “much more of a bunker” and there was no other solution but to have police dismantle it, Block said. The hourslong standoff went into Thursday morning as officers warned over loudspeakers that there would be arrests if the crowd — at the time more than 1,000 strong inside the encampment as well as outside of it — did not disperse. Hundreds left voluntarily, while another 200-plus remained and were ultimately taken into custody. The next four years will change America forever.

But University of Minnesota officials reached an agreement with protesters not to disrupt commencements, and similar compromises have been made at Northwestern University in suburban Chicago, Rutgers University in New Jersey and Brown University in Rhode Island. Others have taken steps to hire extra security. ___ Watson reported from San Diego, Keller from Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Thompson from Buffalo, New York.

She continued, “And the problem is that we’re seeing that these are being treated as two entirely different people. It’s as if the fact that he is a criminal defendant, the fact that he has committed, allegedly, crimes against the United States of America have no impact whatsoever on his relevance or his standing as a candidate for the presidency.” Mary Trump went on to note that she finds this “really troubling,” adding that it “seems that there’s always a way out for him.” “There’s always somebody willing to bail him out, even if it looks like there’s no escape,” she said. She later expressed doubt that he’d be convicted, stating, “It worries me, quite honestly, that as deep the trouble is that he’s in, it may not be enough.” The comments from the former president’s niece come as he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records tied to hush money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election.

They always seem so sincere despite their inability to recognize just how much they benefit from the status quo. The problem has always been what to do about it. If they renounce their privilege, it feels performative, and if they use it to advance people of color, then it feels like ham-fisted pandering. Enter Drew Barrymore (always Drew Barrymore), who, on Monday, interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris on “The Drew Barrymore Show” and did the thing where she sits uncomfortably close to her guest during the interview. If you were at the ATM and someone got as close to you as Barrymore gets to her guests, you’d assume you were about to get jumped. Anyway, Barrymore was sitting there under the vice president’s nostrils, and she was doing the white liberal thing of earnestness through sympathetic facial expression, and the two started bonding over being stepparents. “I love Disney. However, Disney kind of messed that up,” Harris said. “You know, for a lot of us over the years, [there was] the evil stepparent.” Harris shared that her bonus children call her “Momala” ― you know, a portmanteau of “Mom” and “Kamala.” “It’s just not fair to [children] to put them in a situation where, intentionally or not, they are being manipulated around the adults’ weird relationships with each other,” the vice president said. “You have to sort that out.” And then, with the kind of heartfelt, nurturing tone that only a well-intentioned white liberal can muster, Barrymore made the whole interview cringy AF. “That’s a great segue to say that I keep thinking in my head that we all need a mom,” Barrymore said. “I’ve been thinking that we really all need a tremendous hug in the world right now. But in our country, we need you to be ‘Momala’ of the country.” Do you feel that? That’s the part of you that’s saying, “No, Drew. Not like this.” Momala. Of. The. Damn. Country. Harris’ face, which was a mix of laughter and dread, said it all. Truthfully, this might have been the vice president’s single most impressive moment in public to date, because I’m not sure how she held it all together. “Barrymore had the most powerful woman in the world on her couch, and she asked that woman, who is Asian and Black, to be America’s stepmom.” Whether it’s Kendall Jenner handing riot police a Pepsi or Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats kneeling in kente cloth in the Capitol rotunda after the murder of George Floyd, some acts of white liberalism have always been, well, weird. It’s not that I don’t think they’re well-meaning, or sincere; they just never seem well thought out. At best, white liberals are the burglars in “Home Alone.” I really believe that they want to break in; they just don’t know how to outsmart that pesky kid. Or even better, white liberals have always reminded me of the slave master’s child. You know, the kid who loves the slave and who actually sees them as a full person, but isn’t big or strong enough to do anything about it. Except white liberals actually can do something about it ― they just always seem to get tripped up right around the actionable parts. “The sign that change is real as opposed to symbolic is that people are making real changes to things close to them in their own backyards, such as supporting more affordable housing in their neighborhood, or programs that would integrate schools,” Matthew Delmont, author of “Why Busing Failed: Race, Media, and the National Resistance to School Desegregation,” told CNN in 2020. “Broadly speaking,” Delmont said, “White Americans and other people with socio-economic status have to be willing to give up something to have a more just and equitable society.” And when it comes to most white liberals, not only is that a bridge too far, but ― well, why do anything when there’s a Black woman who can do it for you? Just ask the 94% of Black women who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. In that same election, almost 50% of white women voted for Donald Trump. It seems unlikely that among all those Trump-voting white women, there weren’t any who didn’t describe or think of themselves as “liberal.” But this probably wasn’t at the forefront of Barrymore’s mind when she hopped up on that couch, dangerously close to the vice president’s kneecaps, and declared that the country could use some good old-fashioned Southern hugs from a Black woman caring for a house that isn’t hers. Think about it for a second. Barrymore had the most powerful woman in the world on her couch, and she asked that woman, who is Asian and Black, to be America’s stepmom. She didn’t call for policy change, or push for Harris to use her platform to inform viewers about the importance of November’s election. Nope, she asked the woman of color, who is already working hard enough to ensure that the Biden administration can defeat Orange Thanos, to hug America through it. Harris has spent her entire time in the White House focusing on Black maternal health, an issue distorted by the belief long prevalent among doctors that Black women have thicker skin and can handle more pain than other women. As a result, Black women die during natural childbirth at more than three times the rate of white women. And here was Barrymore asking Harris to bear everyone’s pain for them ― literally the thing that is killing Black women. While Harris handled the awkwardness with grace, I would’ve loved for her to say, “You know, Drew, you can do it. You can hug the country, too, ’cause you is kind, you is smart, you is important.” Seriously, if Harris had said that, it wouldn’t have been too much of a leap from what Barrymore was asking. But I don’t think such a thing would have ever occurred to Barrymore in the first place. Not because she’s incapable of insight ― I just really suspect she’s one of those folks who still believe that you can stop violence with a hug and a kind word. Whatever a Karen believes, Barrymore believes the opposite. She is a Drew. Always a Drew. The next four years will change America forever.

Log in to hide these messages. If Barrymore had waited a beat, she might have realized that it doesn’t make a ton of sense in this situation to ask a Black woman to do yet more heavy lifting, above and beyond what she’s already responsible for ― or to do it on behalf of a country where lots of people don’t particularly care for her, and where some people say truly vile things about her. I would hope that Barrymore would’ve considered that Black women have been tasked with raising other people for centuries. Moreover, as Tinseltown royalty, I would’ve liked for her to reflect on the decades-old history of mammifying Black women in Hollywood ― and then perhaps refrain from asking the Black vice president, who attended Howard University, one of the foremost HBCUs in the country, to be America’s mammy. And don’t make that face, that’s exactly what she did. (Also, not for nothing, but why is Barrymore, an adult, positioning herself and millions of other adults as the children of Harris or anyone else? Harris is 59 and Barrymore is 49, so what are we even doing here?) I don’t think Barrymore had any malicious intent behind her remarks. But that doesn’t change the fact that white liberals can mean well and still cause ruckus when they are uninformed. I know I sound like a crotchety old man, a cynic who just doesn’t believe in the power of good. But that’s because it’s early, and I’ve not had my Pespi, or my daily kneel in the garden draped in kente cloth, or a hug from a kind Black woman who is tired of trying to save us all.",0.142360137,0.283240905
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kevonstage-churchy-bet-comedy_n_6632e338e4b0fc2b95282fc8,"KevOnStage Posts Hilarious Videos On Social Media. He Hopes His Sitcom Can Take Off, Too.",ty cole,5/3/2024,"The internet has birthed some of the greatest stars of a generation, such as Issa Rae and Quinta Brunson. Now comedian and creator KevOnStage is taking his knack for hilarious viral videos on social media to his own sitcom, “Churchy.” Earlier this year, KevOnStage, whose real name is Kevin Fredericks, premiered his sitcom “Churchy” on BET+. It is produced by the SpringHill Company and KevOnStage Studios. The series follows Corey Carr Jr., who departs from his father’s church after being bypassed as the new leader and heads to Lubbock, Texas, to be pastor of a new ministry. Carr quickly finds out creating your own ministry in a remote city isn’t as easy as expected. Filled with laughs and shenanigans, this feel-good comedy captures the essence of community, faith and everyday life with heartwarming sincerity, leaving audiences uplifted and eagerly anticipating each episode. In an interview with HuffPost, the comedian discusses “Churchy,” hard conversations with his sons, how he spoke too soon about a possible opportunity with Issa Rae and taking a leap of faith. In the pilot episode, Corey’s heart was set on leading the second church his father established, only to be passed up for his dad’s “spiritual son.” Have you ever experienced being passed up for something in a similar manner? Yeah. One time I had auditioned for a role on Issa Rae’s “Insecure,” and I misread the email, thinking the part was already mine. I realized they had actually wanted me to come in and audition for the role. I was at work at the time with my friends, and we were all young and Black at the job where I found myself talking a lot of trash. Later that evening, I was showing my wife the email, and then I read the bottom of it where I saw I needed to audition. I went to the audition and didn’t get it. I had to take that embarrassment in front of my work friends [laughs]. When I watched the show, I saw why I didn’t get it: The character was Issa’s character’s age on the show, like a dating partner who was supposed to be between 25-26, and I looked every bit of 37 years old. I spoke a bit too soon, so that was one of my Corey Carr moments. Have you seen Issa Rae afterwards and brought that up to her and laughed about it? I haven’t brought that up to her, but we see each other in passing at times; we dap each other up, and I tell her she’s the most amazing Black person on earth. One day, we’ll sit on a yacht in Malibu and we’ll wax poetically on the good ole days, and I’ll bring it up. I appreciate her for even reaching out to me. The Clubhouse moment on “Churchy” was golden; integrating social media into the series is fantastic considering its pivotal role in your success. How did you master social media? That’s a great question. I think just being active on them is really helpful and also knowing that certain humor and not only certain humor, certain formats, are better for certain platforms, right? TikTok switched video from horizontal to vertical because before that you could do horizontal. Due to TikTok’s success, Instagram’s vertical video is more prominent, Facebook and Instagram have reels, etc., so I’ve switched over to vertical videos predominantly. You also need to understand what trends will pop on certain platforms. In dedicating the first season of “Churchy” to your late brother, Jason Fredericks, did his life or experiences influence any of the storylines in any significant manner? Were you able to workshop any of your comedy material with him? Absolutely. His life and my life were mirrored. “Churchy” is loosely based on our home church in El Paso. We worked very closely, hand in hand, with this. He read scripts, he pitched ideas — he’s a producer on the show for that reason. He was one of the first people to tell me I have to hire traditional actors if you want the show to go where you want it to go, with other friends of mine echoing that sentiment. I dedicate this show to him and all of the future seasons because it was something that we worked on together. I know he’s very proud of me and fighting for me on the other side. There’s a scene in the series where Corey talks to a young adolescent about masturbation. As a parent, understanding there’s talk you may not want to have but need to have is vital. What’s a conversation you’re dreading or have dreaded having with your children? “Churchy” is more reflective of my time as a youth pastor, so I would say it’s the other way around. A lot of times, teens don’t want to hear from their parents, but they’ll hear from somebody else who is their parents’ age with the same advice. As a youth pastor, that was often my place, giving people good advice for their kids. It’s my responsibility as a man to teach my boys about sex and about consent. I have to inform them about that. What I dread talking to them about is being a Black man in America and how they’re perceived. Those are the conversations that I wish I didn’t have to have. My youngest son, his resting face isn’t a pleasant smiling face, and he’s just very nonchalant. I gotta let him know he can’t walk around with a hoodie and a scowl on because you’re gonna look intimidating, and this is when he was much smaller. He’s now bigger and stronger. I told my oldest son, like, hey man, you are Black first everywhere you go, so if you gotta go to the bathroom at a gas station, make sure to buy something first or try to go to a hotel. Things like that to try to prevent them from being in areas where they might be in danger. When it comes to Trayvon Martin’s unfortunate passing and Tamir Rice’s unfortunate passing — I have to take those stories and prepare my children for how the world sees them. That’s probably the thing I dislike the most about parenting, is the truth about being a Black man in America, and, unfortunate as it is, I would do my boys a disservice if I didn’t prepare them for how the world will see them and treat them. Which particular theme or storyline in “Churchy” are you most pleased to have included, and can you share any discussions or updates regarding renewal for a second season? The overarching thing that Season 1 was about, Corey fighting to prove his father wrong. And I think a lot of times that requires charting your own path. If we get a Season 2, what I would love to deal with, and this is what the initial idea for “Churchy” was about, is if your church doesn’t have any new people, the ideas never change. A lot of times people don’t realize the world is passing them by because nobody’s in there challenging them. If you’re not on the internet, if you’re not talking to new people, you’re often not being challenged in your thoughts. I’ve been challenged, and a lot of thoughts have been changed by people younger than me. My cousin taught me stuff, and she’s 10 years younger than I am. So I think that also applies to the church and that’s [what I’d like to explore] if given Season 2. Going viral is a part of any creative’s job, in hopes to reach the masses and keep their name in the conversation, or pose questions for a wider audience. Do you remember the first time you went viral, what was it for and what was going through your head? It was the first two videos I did with The Playmakers. We did a skit, “Stuff Black Church Girls Say” and “Stuff Black Parents Say.” This time, you could only post videos on YouTube, and it went crazy on there with people sharing it on Facebook and Twitter. That happened in early 2012, and I was thinking how crazy this moment was, comparing it to hearing your song for the first time on the radio. It felt amazing, but I had to go to work the next day, and where I was working at the time, I made it a point that nobody knew who I was there because I had been fired previously for talking about my dreams of wanting to be a famous comedian. So I wasn’t making that mistake again. What was it like to take a leap of faith after getting let go from that job? Any tips you can share to people who fear taking that risk? I ask because a former boss of mine had let me go because he felt my heart wasn’t in it as much as he wanted. One thing I’ve learned is everybody will not be happy for you — whether it’s your employer, a family member or people online. What I believe is your path is your path and what God has for you is for you — what is necessary will happen. Even with my getting fired from my job — at the moment that happened, I felt like this was the worst thing that could happen to me because how am I going to feed my kids or pay my mortgage? In retrospect, it was important for me for it to happen because it pushed me to where I needed to go. Make sure you know your purpose, stay true to your purpose, and I wouldn’t advise throwing your dream in everyone’s face because sometimes people will trip. The boss who said that to you and let you go could’ve been giving a projection or a misinterpretation of you, because as long as you’re doing your job, it doesn’t matter what you do outside of work. From stand-up, your own series, to commercials with Spectrum and a late-night talk show called “Friday Night Vibes” with Nina Parker, how does it feel to see all your wishes come true? And how has Nina Parker helped you grow as a host? It’s been amazing having a lot of wins in a row after having a lot of years without many wins. It feels fulfilling, and I’m grateful for this moment — there’s a lot of stuff I still want to accomplish. And I hope that I’m given an opportunity to do everything that’s in my dreams. As far as [Nina Parker] goes, I can’t speak highly enough about her. She’s such an amazing co-host but also so giving, as she’s a huge coach for me on TV. It’s my first TV hosting opportunity, and she made me feel so comfortable on set, especially my first day. It felt like when you go to high school and you’re a freshman, she was the cool senior who was like, you can sit with us [laughs]. You’re known for openly discussing trending topics and issues. What’s a pressing topic on your mind that you’d like to address? I’m all about Black people and our opportunities — I think right now, in our industry at least, we’ve seen a wealth of our shows get canceled. It’s not just our shows, but it seems like that sometimes. So for me, it’s just about making sure that we have representation in spaces, making sure that our ideas are properly credited. It’s always about creating opportunities for people who look like me; obviously in this business, racism is a big deal in Hollywood, but nepotism is equally as difficult, and that’s done often without malice. People just look out for people that are in their community, and a lot of times in these spaces, there’s not a lot of Black people who are making those decisions. I’m grateful that a lot of my opportunities — the majority of them have been [from] a Black person looking out for me. I’ve been qualified to do the job, but people have been saying my name in rooms that I’m not in, so I feel it’s my duty and responsibility to always continue creating those opportunities for others and saying other people’s names in rooms that they’re not in so that they’ll get opportunities that I’m receiving. “Churchy” is streaming on BET+ By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Between the kneeling, bending over and rigorous digging in the hot sun, planting this season’s batch of tomato plants or tending to unruly weeds may not be possible, especially for someone with chronic pain or limited mobility. While there’s no one magic tool to eliminate all of your gardening woes, several items do exist to make yard work easier and more comfortable — and they all happen to be conveniently located on Amazon. If you’re intrigued by the back-saving benefits of a standing weeder or the ease at which one arthritis-friendly set of clippers can cut through the most fibrous stems, keep reading on to the robust collection of products ahead. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. ""With age (I am 77), my gardening has evolved into how can I best garden,"" says Facebook follower Patsy Emery. ""I have rheumatoid arthritis. I found wearing fingerless compression gloves under my gardening gloves works really well."" These come in four colors in sizes XS-XL. 65-year-old Maggie Flynn-Fleet, 67-year-old Leigh Anne Jasheway and 77-year-old Patsy Emery all recommend a versatile kneeling bench. ""The handrails are great for making it easier to get up. And when you flip it over and sit on it, it’s the perfect height for berry picking and deadheading,"" Flynn-Fleet said. Emery, who has spinal stenosis and struggles with bending, added: ""I do most of my gardening sitting and scooting when working in my beds."" This versatile garden bench made with a solid steel frame can be adjusted between various kneeling and seated positions, and the ultra-thick kneeling pad is made from a supportive EVA foam. There are also plenty of pockets to keep tools and seeds within arm's reach, and it compactly folds flat when not in use. (Make sure to “clip” the coupon for $5 off.)Promising Amazon review: ""This makes gardening so much easier. Ability to use it as kneeling or bench allows for multiple gardening projects. Light enough to carry, folds up for easy storage. The tool bags are like having extra hands. No more problems getting up."" — Karen NH ""I am a 68-year-old avid gardener and I use a pair of small needle-nose pliers to pull weeds fully up with all their roots with my little arthritic hands,"" says Lee Debeauchamp. This highly-rated option lets you choose a single set of needle-nose pliers, or you can purchase a set with a bent-nose pair and a four-pack of different pliers with a carrying case. Mary AndKathleen Houghton, 68, adds that ""a hand-held 'claw' tool loosens soil for planting,"" and is ""easier than a shovel."" Weighing 7.4 ounces, this five-prong rake has a 5.5-inch wood handle for easy grabbing. Per Houghton, tools with a longer handle can also keep you from bending. ""Weed Puller is simple and easy to operate standing up,"" she said. With well over 36,000 5-star ratings, this standing weeder is made specifically to effectively remove weeds without kneeling or causing strain on necks or backs. The simple design features a metal claw that grabs weeds from the root with just a tilt of the weeder and the leverage of your foot. Promising Amazon review: ""I cleared a whole garden full of fleabane, amongst perennials i didn't want disturbed. It worked perfectly. The dream. You don't even need to bend down to pick it up after it's been pulled. Just bring a bucket. It's the only weeder that is easy to use. Requires no bending. Can quickly do plant after plant. Doesn't hurt any other plants. And gets the whole root of bulb out quickly and easily. It seems be stable and well designed and made. Couldn't be happier."" — Amazon customer Houghton also suggested getting an expandable hose that grows as it's dispensing water. ""Hoses that shrink up are lighter and easier to move around,"" she said. This expanding pocket hose grows up to 25 feet, then shrinks back to a smaller size when not in use. It weighs ‎2.29 pounds and is designed to be kink-free and not get tangled. Soon-to-be-51-year-old Denise Vyse calls a foam mat a ""MUST HAVE!!!!"" Made from a high-density and shock-absorbing foam, this pad (available in 10 colors) claims to offer a superior level of cushioning for knees, even when placed over gravel, dirt or concrete. Measuring over an inch thick, the pad is slip- and water-resistant. Promising Amazon review: ""This is a great product!! I had a knee replacement and still have issues with the knee area. This pad has made it so much easier and more comfortable doing gardening. The Mrs. loves it and we have gotten a second she uses for cleaning and such."" — John J. Per long-term gardener Sue Mazer (who gave more helpful information than we could fit here, but please check out her comment in full on Facebook), shorter-handed tools work better for women or folks who don't have a ton of upper body strength. ""Get ones with the D-shaped handles, this allows women, especially those who are shorter, to get better leverage, reducing the impact to the body. Condition the wood every year with oil,"" she said. This 28-inch digging shovel weighs under two pounds and has a D-ring handle for help with leverage. ""Gel knee pads are a must for saving knees,"" Mazer says. ""And they can be used with a kneeling pad to keep the knee pads clean and add extra fluff."" To take the cushion with you as you travel around your garden, we love these highly-rated knee pads that are made from EVA foam padding and a thick gel cushion. These come in two sizes. ""Latex-coated garden gloves are a must to save your hands from feeling like pumice stone,” Mazer said, adding the importance of keeping your skin hydrated before and after spending a ton of time outside and in the elements. She says she uses Alba Botanical lotion before and after shifts in the garden. Rita Falcon, 57, says she's an avid gardener and landscaper. ""My recycled plastic wheel barrel is a must! It's light to lift, empty, move, and roll but strong enough for the dirt, weeds, tools, and bricks that I haul from one garden to the next. (I have 6 gardens!)"" While Falcon wrote that she got her wheelbarrow over a decade ago from Menards, how stinking cute is this budget-friendly option that comes in a bunch of fun colors? It has two inflatable, 14-inch rubber wheels and a padded handlebar that's easy to push and pull. Owning one of these attachments could allow you to transform any number of your existing gardening or yard tools into something that's more ergonomic and less straining to use. The universal and adjusting base slides down and secures to the middle of any long-handled stick to offset a load and reduce back bending by 30%, according to the brand. (It also comes in yellow.)Promising Amazon review: ""So simple. Yet so helpful. Makes a big difference when you use this on a straight-handled shovel. This is intended and marketed for snow but it could go onto any shovel, I imagine, and be used for lots of stuff so long as it’s not extremely heavy. This could likely be used for yard work, too. I’m happy with it."" — random person Available in three sizes and several colors, these elbow-length gloves are designed to protect skin from thorns and other pokey plants, while also promising breathable wear that won't have hands feeling sweaty and uncomfortable.Promising Amazon review: ""I love these! I misplaced my old rose bush gloves and was desperate! They are still a little stiff and the size runs a little large. I purchased the medium and will probably get another pair in small. The leather/[suede] is excellent quality and will probably last a long time. The material will soften with use. I've already used them to prune rose bushes and they are perfect for protecting my arms. No snagging or scratches from thorns!"" — Rita Another strain-reducing tool is this full-standing garden shovel. It features a spring-loaded assist handle to add leverage and make shoveling heavy loads of dirt much easier compared to traditional shovel designs. Available in a few different handle lengths and versions specifically designed for snow shoveling, the brand claims that using this tool can improve posture and prevent extra back-bending.Promising Amazon review: ""I bought this to scoop live oak leaves on my 1-acre in Florida. The original that migrated back home with me from Kansas did the job, but this new one with the lower handle causes far less back strain from the repetitive motion of scooping the leaves. It's sturdy, reliable, and makes the job 10x easier. Highly recommended."" — TCH If you have limited dexterity or lack the hand strength required to cut through fibrous stems, branches or vines, this pair of ergonomic clippers might be worth the $22. The clippers have a lever-ratchet design for easy cutting and precision steel blades that are extra sharp. And to ensure safe storage, there's a slider safety lock. These clippers are available in a few different colors and several different styles, like pruners and Japanese-style shears. Note: Clip the on-page $3 coupon to get a little extra savings at checkout.Promising Amazon review: ""I like the ratchet type mechanism for ... thick branches. Made it easy to cut and they’re sharp. Wiped up easy when I was done and ready for next job. Handle is different from most pruners and was comfortable in my small hands that I often get cramps or pain in. They are easy to lock shut when not in use."" — Kem Tilling and prepping soil manually is incredibly labor-intensive, but this Sun Joe electric rototiller is equipped with a robust 12-amp motor to power through and aerate soil with little to no effort on your part. It features six durable steel blades and a three-position wheel to make maneuvering easier, and covers up to 16 inches of ground in seconds. It's also available in 2.5-amp and 13.5-amp options.Promising Amazon review: ""This motor is sooo powerful and nothing short of impressive. It effortlessly breaks through tough soil, weeds, roots and whatever else is in the ground, saving me considerable time and effort with my gardening tasks. Whether I'm cultivating a new area or preparing the soil for planting, this tiller handles the job with the absolute best efficiency. The tilling width covers a substantial area in each pass. This not only expedites the tilling process but also ensures even coverage, creating a well-prepared planting bed. It’s also surprisingly easy to maneuver. The rear wheels facilitate smooth movement, allowing me to navigate around obstacles and tight spaces effortlessly. This feature is particularly handy in my compact garden layout. Operating the tiller is a breeze, thanks to its user-friendly controls. The instant start button eliminates the hassle of dealing with pull cords, and the adjustable handlebar height accommodates users of varying heights, ensuring comfortable operation."" — Erica M (This review has been edited for length. Read full review.) Another genius tip? ""I use pencils to make holes for seeds,"" says Ellen S. Winner, 75, who's been gardening for over 50 years. According to Winner, pencils, a hoe and a spade make the perfect kit for gardening. Another innovative tip she shared: ""This year we laid cardboard in between rows to keep weeds down, worked pretty well.” Rather than straining your fingers to pull up stubborn and deep-lying roots and weeds, these gardening gloves feature securely attached claw tips that can do the tedious work for you. The gloves are made with a breathable and puncture-resistant material and come in a few color options.Promising Amazon review: ""One of the first things to go on my gardening gloves is always the fingertips because I tend to dig with them, but these are perfect for that! Surprisingly, they don't even get much in the way of doing regular stuff with them on, except for maybe picking up small things. Very useful, especially for planting seeds or annuals."" — advocatus leonibus If you want to elevate your garden beds to prevent excessive kneeling and bending, we found this weather- and water-resistant planter box with nearly 6,800 5-star ratings that stands at the ideal ergonomic height. Available in three sizes and finishes, the garden bed is made from cedar and has proper drainage to prevent plants from becoming over-watered.Promising Amazon review: ""Lots of screws but good instructions. I can see a lot of thought went into the making of this planter box. Very sturdy. I am pleased with this wood planter box. It's high off the ground so I don't have to bend down while planting or tending to my small vegetable garden."" — Rosalie This trowel features an ergonomic handle and a patented blade to make breaking and digging soil easier on hands and wrists. Especially beneficial for anyone who deals with arthritis, carpel tunnel or limited hand strength, this trowel also comes in different blade types like a scooper, cultivator and transplanter.Promising Amazon review: ""This thing actually feels nice in your hand so the way you can hold the tool isn't completely horizontal. The curved grip is bigger than expected, so I could choose how/where I wanted to hold it. Then I tried to dig up a large weed, in super dry/dense soil. Oh my gosh, this thing went into the ground WAY easier than I thought, since I can only use one hand to dig and the other on a cane for balance, [and] this is where I also really noticed the ergonomics of the tool. Not only does it cut into the ground without a ton of force, but the handle lets you bend it back pretty [easily], which raises it up. Some weeds were large and I had to dig around it in about 3 places. The roots come out as well. It was so easy and fascinating that my mom laughed [at] me as I kept saying ""wow,"" moving from weed to weed quickly."" — A.A. (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review.) If gardening in the hot sun is keeping you from reaching your yard goals, this wide-brimmed hat is designed to make you more comfortable. It has a vented and cooling design, a moisture-wicking sweatband and is made with UPF50+ material for extra sun-blocking protection. Although this hat is only available in one size, the headband and under-chin strap are fully adjustable, and you can find it in seven colors.Promising Amazon review: ""This hat has a very large brim which provides the much-needed protection from the Florida sun. We work in our yard a lot. Great product for the price. And most of all, it is functional."" — Melvin Tate If you're someone who’s struggling to find the perfect amount of water for your plants or can't be bothered standing for manual watering sessions, these terracotta spikes can come in handy. They work by slowly releasing water into the soil based on the specific need of your plant. A one-liter bottle of water placed upside down in the spike could keep your plants sufficiently watered for up to 10 days.Promising Amazon review: ""I bought these last year and used them throughout the growing season in planters on my patio and in spots through my garden. They worked well, and I live on the Mississippi Gulf Coast where summers are torrid and plants dry out fast. That didn't happen with these devices."" — Starr.Light Susan Boeggeman, 67, likes to mow her lawn. ""We finally bought a battery-operated lawn mower, and it’s been the best investment ever. I also would rather spend my retirement dollars on perennials as opposed to annuals."" This Greenworks electric lawn mower works up to 45 minutes between charges and uses no gas or oil. It's made for small- to medium-sized yards and weighs 37.5 pounds. This multi-purpose electric tool can easily trim the edges of unruly lawns and then seamlessly convert to a traditional weed trimmer — no bending or manual weed pulling required. The 90-degree tilting head also means this trimmer can tackle hard-to-reach areas and sloped terrains while the ergonomic handle can make it less straining to hold and operate.Promising Amazon review: ""I am a single female who has an unfortunate amount of yard work. I gave up on the gas-powered weed trimmer that was a leftover from my former marriage. I spent more time figuring out the line than trimming. It killed my back and shoulders. Last but not least, with gas-powered yard machines I never know how much oil to mix, what kind of gas to put in, and so forth. I am not mechanical. So, my quest for an easier and lighter weed trimmer began. I landed on this Worx Trimmer due to Amazon reviews and popularity, along with other marketplace reviews. I have used the weed trimmer after three mowing cycles. So far: no regrets. It is economical. So how does it perform? I love it. A friend stopped by the other day and complimented me on how nice the yard looked. The trimmer is lightweight, and I have a health issue that causes chronic pain at forty-something. The weight, or lack thereof, is a huge relief compared to the gas trimmer collecting dust and spider webs in the garage. "" — Kimber (This review has been edited for length. Read the full review.)

Davidson brokered hush money deals for porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal to keep quiet about their alleged affairs with Trump, while Howard’s publication’s “catch and kill” scheme buried stories that could be potentially damaging to Trump’s campaign. Asked in court on Thursday what he meant by the message, Davidson replied: “This was sort of gallows humor on election night as the results were coming in. There was an understanding that our efforts — strike that — that our activities may have assisted the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.” The prosecutor shows Keith Davidson his reaction to Trump's imminent victory: ""What have we done?""Davidson: ""This was sort of gallows humor. It was on election night as the results were coming in [...] There was a growing sense that people were about to call Trump's election."" pic.twitter.com/1Du7NEf5WB Eisen said Davidson’s acknowledgment saw “the normal hush of the courtroom” suddenly “punctuated by the audible clattering of the keyboards of more than 60 journalists seated in the pew-like benches.” It’s because the message “reflects the purpose of the payment,” he explained. “Without the intent to cover up another offense, falsifying documents is just a misdemeanor,” Eisen said. “The reason Trump has been charged with felony document falsification here is because it was allegedly done with intent to cover up a payment in excess of campaign contribution limits that was made in order to impact an election.” The next four years will change America forever.

The medals will be presented by the president at the White House on Friday. “These nineteen Americans built teams, coalitions, movements, organizations, and businesses that shaped America for the better,” the White House said in a statement announcing the recipients. “They are the pinnacle of leadership in their fields. They consistently demonstrated over their careers the power of community, hard work, and service.” The Medal of Freedom is the nation’s highest civilian honor, presented to individuals who have “made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.” This year’s list of recipients includes former New York City mayor and philanthropist Michael Bloomberg, who ran for president in 2020 before endorsing Biden. It also includes former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, the wife of the late Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. Other recipients include: journalist and television host Phil Donahue, civil rights activist and lawyer Clarence Jones, teacher and activist Opal Lee, veteran astronaut Ellen Ochoa, astronomer Jane Rigby, United Farm Workers President Teresa Romero and Judy Shepard, co-founder of the Matthew Shephard Foundation. Biden will also hand out three posthumous medals to former New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg, civil rights activist Medgar Evers and Olympic gold medalist Jim Thorpe.

The comedian read some mock notes on “The Tonight Show” Thursday. “He apparently keeps passing handwritten notes to his lawyers. We actually have a few right here, and it’s pretty interesting,” Fallon quipped. “For instance, this one says: ‘Does UberEats deliver to court?’” he said. “This next one says, ‘Are you my best friend: check yes or no?’” “Oh, and finally, this one says, ‘Don’t tell anyone, but I got a 16-ounce bottle of Diet Coke in my tie,’” he added. In court, Trump is not permitted to eat or drink anything other than water, preventing him from drinking some of the multiple Diet Coke he usually has in a day.

David Urban told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the presumptive GOP nominee “sitting there for hours and hours and hours without a Diet Coke, it’s probably killing him, it’s probably killing him.” “He’s usually, I’m sure, very caffeinated during the day,” Urban, a longtime Republican lobbyist, explained. “As folks who know, drink Cokes and Diet Cokes. If you’re missing one or two a day, let alone, I’m sure he’s missing probably about ten a day. It’s probably rough.” Urban’s comment came amid a discussion on Trump’s reported nodding off in court, which New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said Trump sources this week told her was “100% true.” That didn’t stop Trump from going on a tear on his Truth Social platform, however, when he claimed it was fake news, and he was just closing his “beautiful blue eyes” to “take it ALL in!!!” The “beautiful blue eyes” line was “classic Trump,” said Urban. “He’s trying to make light of the situation a little bit and say, ‘Look, I’m not sleeping.’” 5.2.24 238 pm ET CNN Anchor Erin Burnett @ErinBurnett w/CNN Reporter, Alayna Treene @alaynatreene CNN Senior Political Commentator and Republican Strategist, David Urban @DavidJUrban pic.twitter.com/5OCqnt3ovO Trump’s penchant for Diet Coke is well documented, despite his slamming of Coca-Cola products as “garbage” in a 2012 post on Twitter, the platform now known as X. When Trump was president, he reportedly drank up to a dozen Diet Coke every day. His habit was fed via a red button on his desk in the Oval Office. When it was pressed, a White House butler would deliver the beverage to him on a silver tray. The button was removed when Joe Biden became president. In 2021, the Washingtonian magazine shared the “Standard Operating Procedure” that staffers at the BLT Prime steakhouse at Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., would adhere to whenever Trump ordered the drink.

Fox6’s Jason Calvi — who spoke with Trump during his stop in Waukesha, Wisconsin — noted that the former president is in court for the hush money trial “pretty much every day” while on the topic of potential 2024 running mates. “So wouldn’t it make sense to have that person out there right now for you?” Calvi asked. “Well, I’m in a fake trial and I’m in a trial that’s Democrat. You know, you take a look at where did it come from? It came from Biden. It’s a Biden trial,” said Trump, who has repeatedly used the false claim to refer to the trial. “I don’t think there’s evidence of that, that he was involved with this,” Calvi replied. The former president’s “Biden trial” claim doesn’t stack up to the timeline of the Manhattan district attorney’s investigation, which began in 2018 at a time when Biden wasn’t running for president, Politifact noted. Trump, in response, claimed that there is “evidence” and suggested Calvi “just take a look.” “I mean, who’s heading up the trial? Take a look at the person that’s heading it up. There’s a lot of evidence,” claimed the former president, without evidence. He continued, “There’s also common sense involved. There’s a lot of evidence. And it’s disgraceful. Never happened in the history of our country before, what they’re doing. So, I call it the Biden trial. And it’s a fake deal and the voters get it and that’s why I’m up by so much.” “And the jury will have their say, and you’ll have your say in court, as well,” Calvi responded.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/signs-partner-avoidant-attachment_l_663161d2e4b0c9bc875944ec,5 Signs Your Partner May Have An Avoidant Attachment Style,kelsey borresen,5/3/2024,"Psychologists have been studying attachment styles for decades, but in recent years, the concept has generated quite a bit of buzz on social media. If you’re not already familiar, your attachment style, which is essentially a way of understanding how you relate to others in your close relationships, falls into one of four categories: secure, anxious, avoidant (sometimes known as dismissive-avoidant) and disorganized (also known as fearful-avoidant). You can read more about each attachment style here or take one of these tests (here’s a short one and a more in-depth one) to determine yours and ask your partner to do the same if you think they’d be open to it. Here, however, we’ll focus on romantic relationships with someone who has an avoidant attachment style — characterized by a discomfort with emotional closeness, a deep need for independence and a reluctance to rely on others. Being in a relationship with someone with this attachment style comes with some unique challenges. The bond a person has with their primary caregivers in childhood affects their attachment style in adulthood, but it’s not the only influence. One’s attachment style is not set in stone either, nor will it be the same across all of the different intimate relationships in your life. “Be it a friend, colleague, family member or romantic partner, your attachment style that emerges varies based on the pairing and can change or grow over time,” Denver psychotherapist Brittany Bouffard told HuffPost. “For instance, you can be in a securely attached relationship with one person, but in a different romantic relationship or friendship or familial relationship, you might embody one of the other styles.” Below are some of the signs that might indicate your partner has an avoidant attachment style and advice to help you better understand your partner, yourself and the relationship dynamic. A partner with an avoidant attachment style may be reluctant to invest fully in the relationship due to fears about commitment. According to Shaurya Gahlawat, a couples therapist in India, they may avoid conversations about your future or be hesitant to make long-term plans. “In therapy, I’ve observed clients who struggle with commitment express a fear of being trapped or suffocated by the relationship,” she told HuffPost. “This fear often stems from past experiences of rejection or abandonment, leading them to adopt a defensive stance to protect themselves from potential emotional pain.” Appearing disinterested in connection is a key attribute of an avoidant attachment style, which can manifest as trouble committing to the relationship, Bouffard said. “People with avoidant [attachment] can unconsciously fear feeling engulfed or overwhelmed by another person’s connection because, on many levels, they adapted toward disconnection and loneliness,” she said. “So you might feel ready to commit to a relationship or a next level but find your partner unable to express — or want — the same forward energy.” Though maintaining your independence within a relationship is healthy, a strong need for autonomy and freedom above all else can be a sign of avoidant attachment. “Individuals with this attachment style may prioritize their own needs and space over the needs of their partner,” Gahlawat said. A client who was struggling with his partner’s avoidant behavior said that she would become distant whenever conflict or stress arose in the relationship. “He felt frustrated and neglected, as she seemed more focused on maintaining her independence than nurturing their connection,” Gahlawat said. “Through therapy, she began to recognize how her avoidance of intimacy was impacting their relationship, and she learned healthier ways to balance her need for space with the partner’s need for closeness.” Additionally, those who lean avoidant may seem very self-sufficient on the surface, “but usually inside feel easily lonely and disconnected,” Bouffard said. “Some avoidant attachers jump between brief sexual connections or short dating stints, needing to distance after the closeness.” A partner with an avoidant attachment style likely has a hard time sharing their inner world with you. Getting them to express their thoughts, emotions and vulnerabilities can feel like pulling teeth. “Your partner may be able to discuss some details about the events of their day, but when it comes to the part that interests you, the emotional impact of those experiences, your partner may have great difficulty giving detail about this,” Los Angeles clinical psychologist David Narang, author of the attachment style workbook “Leaving Loneliness,” told HuffPost. During conversations about feelings, their responses are often “excessively brief” because they have trouble accessing this part of themselves, he said. Gahlawat said she’s noticed that clients who have a hard time in this area tend to pull back or shut down when faced with emotional closeness. “This behavior can stem from a fear of dependence or a belief that expressing vulnerability will lead to rejection or abandonment,” she said. Partners who have an avoidant attachment style may invest more time and energy in their careers than in their romantic partnerships. According to Narang, this may be because they have learned to value “the more controllable rewards that come from work.” “Their early relationships were likely either intrusive or emotionally vacant, either way teaching them that relationships are not the place that one gains tremendous satisfaction,” he explained. “As a result, they devote their time and energy where they reflexively assume that they will experience rewards.” “You might feel ready to commit to a relationship or a next level but find your partner unable to express — or want — the same forward energy.” And because they’ve placed more value on their career, any accolades they get for working hard on the job tend to feel more satisfying to them than a well-earned relationship success, Narang said. It’s quite common for an avoidant-attacher to couple up with an anxious-attacher. This pairing creates a “push-pull” dynamic, Bouffard said, in which the person with avoidant attachment will not communicate clearly or begin pulling away, which triggers the partner to seek reassurance about the relationship and affirm their connection. Pay attention to how your partner’s avoidant tendencies may activate your anxious ones. “Assess if you are feeling unaffirmed, fighting to have needs met or fearing the person will leave,” Bouffard said. When you feel your partner distancing themselves, you might find yourself trying to “over-prove your worth” to your partner so that they’ll stick around, Bouffard said. “You may do this by putting yourself into a box” that the avoidant person will like, in order to avoid being rejected or abandoned, “or by excessively caretaking, communicating or worrying in hopes of grasping onto the relationship,” she said. Presentation of an attachment style exists on a continuum, Bouffard said. And where you and your partner fall determines if the relationship is likely to be compatible. If the relationship dynamic is relatively healthy, then learning more about their attachment history and finding coping strategies to deal with some of their frustrating behaviors may help, she said. However, if the avoidant partner’s behaviors are so severe that you, in turn, “intensely grasp onto them, feel constantly anxious or worry it will abruptly end, it might not be a mutually healthy match,” Bouffard said. These therapist-backed tips will help you better navigate the dynamic: This is one of the important pieces of advice for folks in relationships with avoidantly attached partners, Gahlawat said. Part of that is recognizing that their challenges around emotional intimacy likely stem from their upbringing or other past experiences, not because they don’t love or care about you, she said. “I often encourage clients to approach their partner with empathy and compassion rather than judgment or frustration,” Gahlawat added. It’s natural to feel hurt or take it personally when your partner refuses to open up or tries to create distance. But if you approach the situation with anger, that is likely to overwhelm your partner, causing them to withdraw even more. Instead, try to employ a more matter-of-fact tone if you can. “Engage your partner’s attention, and then see if he or she can tolerate hearing from you that a bit more verbal discussion would help you feel closer and to reduce some of the painful loneliness that you are feeling in the relationship,” Narang said. “Framing the issue in terms of a way your partner could become powerfully helpful — versus emphasizing that they are currently failing — may support your partner to do the hard work of first trying to access their own experience and then verbalizing it to you.” Keep in mind that your own emotions around this are reasonable. Your partner just has a hard time dealing with them “because they are easily flooded,” Narang said. “This will help you patiently but firmly approach your partner requesting that they push themselves a bit to allow you more access to them,” he said. Working through these issues will take time and effort from both parties — “a process involving multiple skirmishes, dialogues and possible couples’ therapy,” Narang said. “After that process, hopefully you will approach them kindly and audibly when you need connection, and hopefully your partner will then respond with an effort to allow you deeper access to him/her and to listen to you more deeply,” he continued.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mint-julep-recipe-kentucky-derby_l_6633d3c3e4b00b1eab529d7e,This Is The Mint Julep Recipe Served At The Kentucky Derby,lee breslouer,5/3/2024,"The Kentucky Derby has something for everyone, from an incredible history as a sporting event (since 1875!) to its pageantry and elaborate hats. But for us, it comes down to one thing: the mint julep. And since the Derby is the perfect reason to host a bunch of friends for an afternoon of drinking and merriment, we spoke to executive chef David Danielson of Churchill Downs on how he and his team at Levy make juleps for the 400,000 people who come through their gates (including the exact recipe they use), and how you can easily prepare stellar juleps at home. It’s a 2-minute race and a day of drinking juleps Just to give you an idea of the scale of this operation, the Derby takes place on Saturday, May 4, but preparations begin in August of the previous year. “We’ve got an army of people over here working to get everything geared up,” Danielson told HuffPost. He’s not exaggerating, as it takes over 1,000 workers to whip up the estimated 127,000 mint juleps for Derby Day. The premier race is billed as “the fastest two minutes in sports,” but drinking juleps is an all-day event. The bourbon-filled cocktails are being poured right after the gates open at 8 a.m., and people continue imbibing all the way until last call at 8:10 p.m. As a refresher: a mint julep is a combination of bourbon, water, fresh mint, sugar and crushed ice (keep reading, because we’ve got great recipes for juleps at the end of the story). Churchill Downs uses 254,000 ounces of bourbon (or over 10,000 750 milliliter bottles), 300 crates of mint (about 4,000 pounds of locally sourced stuff from Louisville, Kentucky’s Dohn Gardens) and 60,000 pounds of ice to make their juleps. You probably won’t need nearly as much for your home setup. Nonetheless, Danielson has tips from his nine years of working the Derby to help you out. If you think any type of bourbon will suffice for a mint julep, think again. Woodford Reserve is in the Derby’s signature julep, and Danielson cited a few reasons why. “Woodford is a very smooth bourbon,” he told HuffPost. “It has a great flavor profile and delicious caramel notes.” Most importantly, it mixes well with the mint and sugar. Other bourbons can either be too spicy or too mellow for the refreshing spring cocktail. When you’re making drinks in large quantities, you want to be sure you’re able to make consistently tasty drinks at a fast pace. Many recipes (including the one for a classic Woodford mint julep found below) call for tiny spoonfuls of sugar, but it’s not super fun to be scooping sugar behind a bar when you’d rather just be hanging out and drinking. That’s why the Churchill Downs folks instead replace a scoop of sugar with mint simple syrup. “We make a mint simple syrup with equal parts sugar and water. We bring it to a boil and add mint to it. Then we let it steep and strain it off,” Danielson said. That’s a simple enough recipe that even you should try it for your Derby party. We’ve got you covered with more detail on making simple syrup. Once that’s done, mix a big quantity of bourbon with your simple syrup and throw it in the fridge. When your friends and family arrive, your job becomes exceedingly simple. “Take your ice out, pour [this boozy mixture] over top, garnish it, and you’re literally off to the races, my friend,” Danielson said. “Historically, juleps were a sign of prosperity,” Danielson noted. “Ice was a commodity, and so when you wanted to entertain or show people you were in society, you showed people you had ice. If you had crushed ice piled high in a glass, you were really doing well.” Show all your friends you’re also doing great by using crushed ice. Not only does it look fantastic should you want to Instagram your julep, but it gives you a chance to take out all your frustrations in the making of this drink. If you can’t find crushed ice at the liquor store, you can create it by buying a regular bag of ice and smashing it up with a hammer. Or just using a strong blender. You might be tempted to buy fresh mint from the grocery store and store it in your fridge’s crisper drawer, but Danielson recommends treating mint with more respect. “Put an inch or so of cold water at the bottom of a cup,” he said. “Make sure the stems are sitting in the water.” When you’re ready to serve the cocktail, use an entire sprig of mint, which should have about six to seven leaves on it. Yes, there sure are silver julep cups you can purchase online and elsewhere, but Danielson said not to sweat it if you don’t have time to buy them. “A skinny, tall, 8-ounce [highball glass] is a great glass for a julep,” he said. We’ve got two recipes you can check out. The first is the one served at Churchill Downs, and the second is Woodford Reserve’s original recipe. Cheers! Serves 1 2 ounces Woodford Reserve 1 ounce mint simple syrup Sprig of fresh mint Crushed ice Directions Pour Woodford Reserve and simple syrup over crushed ice. Stir with spoon. Garnish with a fresh sprig of mint. Serves 1 2 ounces Woodford Reserve 1 ounce water 4 sprigs of fresh mint 1 teaspoon sugar Crushed ice Directions In a copper julep cup, rub two pieces of fresh mint around the cup to express the oils. Add Woodford Reserve, then the water and sugar and stir with a bar spoon. Add crushed ice to the top, then garnish with four sprigs of mint.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dog-happy-signs-veterinarians_n_66314f59e4b0c9bc8759369b,"6 Signs Of A Happy Dog, According To Veterinarians",jillian wilson,5/3/2024,"Most dog owners would probably love to know what their pet is thinking. Unfortunately, our dogs can’t tell us, so it can be hard to know if they’re truly happy or just making do with their surroundings. While no one can read a dog’s mind, veterinarians are the closest thing we have to dog interpreters ― and they say there are certain behaviors and patterns that can indicate if your dog is living a happy, content life. (And, no, tail-wagging does not necessarily mean that your dog is full of glee.) Below, vets share how to tell if your dog is happy and offer tips on making your pooch happier: It’s hard to be joyful if your basic needs aren’t met, and the same goes for dogs. “When I think of ‘happy,’ I think about welfare and that a dog has all their needs met,” said Dr. Kate Anderson, a veterinary behaviorist at Cornell University’s Duffield Institute for Animal Behavior in New York. “And that idea goes back quite a ways, to the ’60s.” Anderson referenced the five freedoms of animal welfare — freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and disease; freedom to exhibit normal behavior; and freedom from fear and distress. Nowadays, our understanding of dogs’ happiness goes beyond simple criteria like these, Anderson noted. (The same goes for happiness in humans, as evidenced by the thousands and thousands of self-help books on the topic.) But having their basic needs met is a step in the right direction. “Happy dogs should have very loose body language,” Anderson said. “They shouldn’t have any tension. Their ears shouldn’t be pulled back. You shouldn’t see the whites of their eyes. Their tail should be at, depending on their breed, a normal angle to their body like 90 degrees, or just relaxed.” Dr. Kristi Flynn, a primary care veterinarian at the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine, added that their weight should be evenly distributed on all four limbs. They shouldn’t be leaning back or standing with a paw up. “We can think of the dogs just laying out in the yard in the sun, just laying on their side with their body all relaxed,” Flynn said. “That’s, to me, a sign of a happy or content dog.” Anderson added that your dog is likely pretty happy if their movements are “loose and they look like noodles.” Dogs and humans have similar facial muscles, Flynn explained, so certain facial expressions can show if they feel content. These include “the absence of a furrowed brow,” she said, and whether they look “relaxed around the eyes, relaxed around the mouth.” Think about it: When you’re upset, your mouth probably droops and you may squint your eyes. This is not the look of a happy person (or dog). So if you notice a calm, relaxed look across your dog’s face, it’s safe to say that they’re in a good mood. Just like toddlers and young children, dogs like things to be predictable, Anderson said. “It’s not that they don’t want novelty and excitement, but they don’t want the whole world to be constantly different,” she noted. According to Anderson, the toughest times of the year for dogs are when human schedules change. This can happen amid the holidays, a big trip or a return to the office. While vacations are of course allowed ― and a return to the office is likely out of your control ― it’s important to stick to a routine as much as possible with your pet and to establish a new routine when change has to happen. Getting your pooch plenty of exercise is important; not only can it help keep their weight in a healthy range, but it can also provide them with much-needed enrichment. “I categorize exercise under enrichment, and enrichment is a really broad topic,” Anderson explained. “It’s kind of the things in your life that are your self-care.” Beyond just exercise, this can include mental stimulation. So for dogs, physically moving around counts, as does engaging with a puzzle toy or taking part in a training class. “I advocate for and use evidence-based, humane training methods with my dogs and recommend that clients and pet owners use the same, just because it shows that it reduces stress and conflict,” Flynn said. Training can also keep your dog’s mind sharp no matter how young (or old) they are, Flynn noted. So, just because your pup is housebroken and knows their basic commands doesn’t mean that the learning needs to stop. “That can really bring them joy, and it’s a great way to bond with your pet and really strengthen that relationship,” Flynn said. Your dog may exhibit body language that shows how they’re feeling. However, they can’t flat-out tell someone to back off — but you can. It’s OK to voice your dog’s comforts and discomforts to people around you, whether they’re your loved ones or people on the street, Flynn said. All dogs have their own personality; some are social, while others are introverted, she said. If you end up with a shy dog, it’s important to advocate for them by letting people know your pet’s preferences. For example, you might ask strangers not to pet your dog or tell friends to leave your dog alone when they come over. “It can be hard to try to manage the social pressure from the human side and make sure that your dog is comfortable,” Flynn said. “I think sometimes I’ve inadvertently let my dog be in a position where he wasn’t as comfortable as maybe he could have been.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

The presumptive GOP nominee falsely claimed that Judge Juan Merchan’s narrow gag order — which bans Trump from talking about the jurors in the case, witnesses and court staff, prosecutors and their families — meant he couldn’t take the stand to defend himself. “Well, I’m not allowed to testify. I’m under a gag order, I guess,” Trump complained to reporters. Trump: I’m not allowed to testify. I’m under a gag order pic.twitter.com/4qeH81ERWo “That is just a lie,” CNN’s fact-check reporter Daniel Dale told “The Lead” anchor Jake Tapper on Thursday. Trump is “absolutely permitted to testify in his own defense and this false claim, this lie, is part of a pattern of former President Trump grossly exaggerating what the gag order actually says,” he noted. The order doesn’t ban Trump “from speaking to political audiences, from delivering social media posts about politics and policy, from speaking to the media” nor does it “prevent him from attacking the judge, the district attorney prosecuting this case, President Biden, his political opponents,” said Dale. “So this claim that the gag order means he can’t testify, it’s just conjured out of thin air,” he added. “Trump has gone from saying that he will testify, to he maybe will testify, to if it’s necessary, to now, ‘Whoa, whoa, I can’t testify, it’s out of my hands.’ But it’s in his hands. He can testify and he’s just making stuff up.” Critics on X (formerly Twitter) also called out Trump’s latest untruth: Talk about a complete lie. Not even remotely true Uh that's a blatant lie and he has ever right to testify in his own defense. The gag order has nothing to do with testifying. He can't even tell the truth in front of the courthouse. Good luck with testifying. The next four years will change America forever.

We got it here.” Trump has raged against late night shows for making jokes about him, with Kimmel in particular often setting Trump off. Trump reportedly ordered White House officials to try to get Kimmel shut down, leading to at least two phone calls between administration officials and Disney, the parent company of ABC, which broadcasts Kimmel’s show. In this case, attorneys were texting each other about Stormy Daniels’ appearance on Kimmel’s show, which “led to some very angry texts from Trump’s lawyer.” Kimmel said he was “pleased as punch” to be included in the trial but told prosecutors they missed the best part of the interview. That’s when Daniels was asked to pick a mushroom that most closely resembled Trump’s penis. Since they may have missed it, he happily played the moment again.

Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, is accused of falsifying business documents in a bid to cover up payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the run-up to the 2016 election that intended to silence her over their alleged affair. In a thread on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter, Rubin acknowledged that “many Trump trial watchers are still knee deep in the world of [former Daniels’ lawyer] Keith Davidson, where lurid details about people like Hulk Hogan, Charlie Sheen & Lindsay Lohan are bought and sold like candy.” She noted, “But the weirdest moment for me was the cross of a guy who does cell phone data extraction” for the Manhattan District Attorney’s office. NEW: I know many Trump trial watchers are still knee deep in the world of Keith Davidson, where lurid details about people like Hulk Hogan, Charlie Sheen & Lindsay Lohan are bought and sold like candy. But the weirdest moment for me was the cross of a guy who does cell phone data… The Iraq war veteran who took the stand was just there to “authenticate data taken off two cell phones provided to the DA by [former Trump attorney] Michael Cohen” and came across as “knowledgeable, earnest, and honest,” said Rubin. But he was still grilled by Trump’s defense team, which is “looking to sow seeds of mistrust” because they need “only one juror” to find the former president not guilty, she added. Trump’s team suggested Cohen’s devices or data “could have been manipulated and/or deleted by the FBI,” she wrote. Cohen was Trump’s fixer for years before being sentenced to prison over his role in the hush money scheme. He is now a vocal critic of Trump. “And here’s where Trump’s lawyer ended for the day: implying that ‘a prior acquisition and extraction could impact the data’ the DA’s office looked at in 2023 when it was provided to them,” Rubin said.

The former president, after leaving his hush money trial at a lower Manhattan courthouse, traveled to Midtown to drop off boxes of Xeno’s Pizza to “New York’s Bravest” at the FDNY’s Engine Co. 8, Ladder Co. 2, 8th Battalion firehouse. “A true honor to visit the NYFD this evening in Manhattan...,” wrote Trump of the FDNY in a video shared to his Truth Social Platform. The former president praised the Fire Department of New York for being “so respectful” that they “don’t even know,” then again referred to the FDNY as the “NYFD” in a separate post that featured a video of him signing a book at the Midtown firehouse, located less than 15 minutes’ walking distance from Trump Tower. The “NYFD” captions appeared to be deleted by early Friday morning. It’s not the first time a member of the Trump family has used the “NYFD” acronym. The former president’s son, Eric Trump, thanked the “amazing men and women of the NYFD” for extinguishing a deadly fire that broke out in a residential apartment at Trump Tower in 2018. Critics jokingly described the former president, who once reportedly left a Miami restaurant after promising “food for everyone,” as a “real NYC ‘Man of the People’” after he neglected to use the right acronym. The real NYC ‘Man of the People’ doesn’t know it’s FDNY despite spending his entire life in the city. pic.twitter.com/EOcPvpU1wZ It IS FDNY! For a man born and raised in NYC, that is embarrassing! At the same time NYC firefighters were putting out the flames of the WTC, Donald Trump was on TV bragging that his building was now the highest in Manhattan. He doesn’t give a rip about them. I don’t understand why all these people he insults love him so much.

MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace pointed out that many of Trump’s past lawyers have ended up in trouble themselves. “You don’t have many people who have come out better for it,” she said. “I don’t think there are any,” O’Brien said, delivering a warning: They might not even get paid. “If you don’t perform well in front of Donald Trump, he won’t pay his bills,” he said. “And this sort of trade off that, ‘I’ll get publicity or I’ll get a good paycheck, and it’ll be worth whatever professional and personal embarrassments I suffer on the way to that road show,’ I think it often doesn’t come together for people.” O’Brien also said Trump attorney Todd Blanche was “performative” in court, to a “disastrous” effect. “I’m assuming in his real life, which is a life apart from Donald Trump and being Donald Trump’s attorney, he’s a more calm, collected, sober-minded person,” he said. “But today he was buffoonish.” O’Brien is senior executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion, author of the 2005 book, “TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,” and former executive editor of HuffPost when it was called The Huffington Post.

Now She’s Helping Congress End The Stigma.,shruti rajkumar,5/2/2024,"Actor Halle Berry shed light on the stigma surrounding menopause in a passionate speech Thursday on Capitol Hill as she helped lawmakers introduce a bill to improve women’s health care. Berry joined senators at an event to promote the Advancing Menopause Care and Mid-Life Women’s Health Act, which would direct more federal funding toward research, education and clinical trials on menopause and on hormone replacement therapy to treat hot flashes and other associated symptoms. In her speech Thursday, Berry, 57, shared a recent experience she had with a doctor who skirted around naming the cause of her health concerns because of the stigma attached to the word. “We went back and forth… I finally realized he wasn’t going to say it. So I thought, ‘OK, I have to do what no man can do. I have to say it.’” “I said, ’I’m in menopause!” she shouted. The doctor proceeded to tell her that she didn’t look as if she was in menopause and that he could never say that to her or any of his female clients, she said, pointing to the stigma of naming the stage of life. “It has to be destigmatized. The shame has to be taken out of menopause. We have to talk about this very normal part of our life that happens,” she said. “Our doctors can’t even say the word to us, let alone walk us through the journey of what our menopausal years look like.” Berry has previously shared her experience with perimenopause, the stage before menopause. In March, Berry told first lady Jill Biden at the Day of Unreasonable Conversation summit in Los Angeles that a doctor had misdiagnosed her and didn’t prepare her for the changes that begin with perimenopause.

Menopause usually begins in women around the ages 45 to 55, and the hormonal changes can cause symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings and incontinence. “For too long, menopause has been overlooked, underinvested in and left behind,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said at the event Thursday. “It’s well past time to stop treating menopause like a secret and start treating it like the major, mainstream public health issue it is.",0.231861635,0.256268805

Jerry Nehl Boylan, 70, was found guilty in November of one count of misconduct or neglect of ship officer, also known “seaman’s manslaughter,” a charge that carries a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in prison. In handing down the lighter sentence, U.S. District Judge George Wu said he found Boylan “incredibly remorseful,” the Los Angeles Times reported, calling it “one of the most difficult sentencings I’ve ever done.” Boylan was the first to abandon ship and jump overboard after the fire broke out on the Conception, a 75-foot dive boat, in the early hours of Sept. 2, 2019. Four crew members who jumped in the water also survived. All 33 passengers, who were on the vessel for a Labor Day weekend scuba diving excursion, were killed. The sentencing followed hours of emotional impact statements from people who lost loved ones in the fire, including a woman whose three daughters were killed, along with their father and his wife. “The torture happens each and every day,” Susana Solano said, according to KABC. “I feel like a failure because I was unable to protect my children from harm.” “The defendant’s cowardice and repeated failures caused the horrific deaths of 34 people,” U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. “The victims’ families will be forever devastated by this needless tragedy. While today’s sentence cannot fully heal their wounds, we hope that our efforts to hold this defendant criminally accountable brings some measure of healing to the families.” On the night of the fire in 2019, flames quickly engulfed the 75-foot boat while the passengers and one crew member were trapped in a windowless bunkroom. The cause of the fire has not been determined. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that Boylan’s failure to post a crew member as a required roving watch allowed the fire to spread rapidly while the victims were sleeping, the Ventura County Star reported. A 24-second video retrieved from the cellphone of Patricia Ann Beitzinger, one of the passengers on the boat, captured some of the last moments of passengers. “There’s got to be a way out,” a voice is heard saying in the video, which was played during Boylan’s trial, the LA Times reported. “There’s got to be more extinguishers.” “We’re gonna die,” another passenger said. The video was recorded at 3:17 a.m., three minutes after Boylan made a radio mayday call and jumped off the boat, prosecutors said. Boylan’s defense attorneys blamed Glen Fritzler, the owner of the boat company, Truth Aquatics, for a lack of fire training and roving night patrols, KABC reported.

The encampment, which stretched across the lawn by Royce Hall, was established last Thursday by hundreds of students calling for the University of California, Los Angeles, to divest from all companies with ties to Israel and disclose the finances of the school’s foundation. UCLA’s encampment is just one of dozens of similar campus protests across the country since Israel’s military assault on Gaza, which was launched in response to Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack that left about 1,200 people dead and about 240 taken hostage. Since then, Israel Defense Forces have killed more than 34,000 people in Gaza, according to local health officials. Since April 18, when students at Columbia University in New York City began protesting Israel’s offensive in Gaza, more than 1,600 people have been arrested at 30 college campuses nationwide. By Thursday evening, hours before the UCLA encampment was destroyed, it hosted a vibrant community of students, faculty members and volunteers, and was equipped with donations of extra clothing, blankets, food, personal protective equipment, first-aid supplies, hygiene products, a space to pray and legal observers. “We have a program here. We have workshops, teach-ins, self-defense classes,” said Ismael, a 22-year-old UCLA student who requested to be identified only by his first name. Ismael came to the encampment on Sunday straight from the airport after a camping trip, he said. Asked why he chose to participate in the protests, he said, “I’m against genocide.” “Honestly, it was the most beautiful thing that’s happened on campus throughout my eight years at UCLA,” Can Açiksöz, a professor in UCLA’s anthropology department, said. “It was multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-faith … it was very beautiful to witness that the students could build these bridges.” After initially tolerating the protests, university officials declared the encampment illegal on Tuesday, warning of consequences if protesters did not disband. “UCLA supports peaceful protest, but not activism that harms our ability to carry out our academic mission and makes people in our community feel bullied, threatened and afraid,” university Chancellor Gene Block said. “These incidents have put many on our campus, especially our Jewish students, in a state of anxiety and fear.” A large group of counter-protesters — some of whom held Israeli flags — descended on the campus late Tuesday night, attempting to tear down the barricades that surrounded the lawn. Students, faculty and university staff told HuffPost that counter-protesters threw sticks, metal rods, traffic cones, chairs and electric scooters at the encampment, and sprayed chemical irritants that left lingering rashes. Some protesters said they were pulled into the crowd of counter-protesters and beaten. Protesters reported that Los Angeles Police Department officers stood by and watched the violence unfold for hours without intervening. “Why aren’t you helping?” Ismael recalled asking police officers. “Despite everything, we maintained our stance on peaceful protest,” he said, still wearing his bracelet from the emergency room, where he sought treatment for what he believes was pepper spray and tear gas. Aidan Doyle, a 21-year-old junior at UCLA, said he was repeatedly pulled into the crowd of counter-protesters, who whipped him with sticks, threw a battery at his eye and sprayed him with chemical irritants. At one point, he said, he found himself looking at the nozzle of what he believed was a pepper spray gun. “It was the most painful experience of my life,” Doyle said of the attack, his shirt still bloodied and his hands still covered in red rashes. Several protesters said the counter-protesters appeared too old to be college students and that they shouted racist, homophobic slurs and threats of rape. One protester’s mother, who was at the encampment Wednesday, said counter-protesters called her son shahid, an Arabic word for martyr, and threatened to physically hurt him. “The students were great at de-escalating” and “did not respond in kind,” Açiksöz said on Wednesday. “It speaks volumes about their composure and commitment to nonviolence, even in the face of absolute violence.” “What is happening at UCLA right now is a strategy that I recognize from Turkey,” Açiksöz tweeted at the time of the counter-protesters’ attack. “The police outsourcing violence to fascist mobs.” “I compared it to Turkey because this was something that I experienced, personally, many times during my years of student activism,” Açiksöz said in an interview on Thursday. “You have groups of ultra-nationalists or classical fascists attacking students while the police is present and doing nothing. And then the police come and sweeps up and arrest the students who are attacked, rather than arresting the attackers themselves.” “This is the playbook of authoritarianism everywhere, from Egypt to Israel to Turkey to India.” The LAPD reportedly intervened after nearly three hours. The police department made no arrests and used no force, it said on X, formerly known as Twitter. UC President Michael Drake reported that 15 people were injured, although protesters say the actual number was higher. On Wednesday, 398 UCLA faculty members, as well as 680 faculty and staff members from other University of California campuses, issued a letter to Block demanding that there be no police or disciplinary action against students participating in pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The California Federation of Teachers and some faculty at UCLA have called for Block to immediately resign for his “failure of leadership.” Block is set to retire in July and is one of three university leaders summoned to testify before Congress this month about antisemitism on college campuses. Before the counter-protesters violently clashed with people in the encampment on Tuesday, the group had installed a large video screen facing the encampment that played loud footage from the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks all day and night. The jumbo screen was part of a pricey counter-protest from an organization called The Bear Jews of Truth. According to two separate GoFundMe pages, the organization raised more than $133,000 in donations to erect the video display at UCLA and bring similar screens to other universities across the country. One of the pages says the group plans to bring a large screen to George Washington University in the District of Columbia in May. An archived version of one of the fundraising pages shows plans to bring “something very big for the ucla encampment.” “We are working to bring a huge screen and big loud speakers right next to them and just play nonstop clips and interviews from Oct. 7,” the page said. The pro-Israel counter-protest has been supported by celebrities including comedian Jerry Seinfeld and his wife, Jessica Seinfeld, a cookbook author, as well as billionaire hedge-fund investor Bill Ackman, according to the Daily Beast. Students within the encampment told HuffPost the video screen was a “form of torture” and reported a number of other tactics leveraged by the counter-protesters on Tuesday night, including launching fireworks, creating louds noises that sounded like gunshots and incessant cellphone alarms. The UCLA administration canceled classes on Wednesday, and protesters spent the morning cleaning up the encampment and repairing the barriers around the site. A volunteer medic provided treatment for protesters injured the previous night. Participants also passed out goggles, helmets, ear plugs and gloves as rumors circulated that police intervention was imminent. By Wednesday evening, a heavy police presence surrounded the perimeter of the encampment. Protesters barricaded the doors to Royce Hall, from which they anticipated police officers might enter. A group of faculty members lined up in front of the doors to form a human barrier to protect the students. Encampment participants were organized into red, yellow and green categories, based on their willingness to risk arrest. Organizers made sure that participants who could not risk arrest were positioned close to exits and that those who planned to stay until removed had protective equipment. The standoff lasted for hours, with periodic dispersal orders blaring over a loudspeaker. Some protesters, many of whom had barely slept the previous night, suspected that police were waiting until the middle of the night to enter the encampment, hoping people would get tired and leave. In the early hours of Thursday morning, police launched a multi-front operation into the encampment, using flash-bang devices and so-called “less-lethal” bullets against students who were armed with makeshift shields and umbrellas. Although protesters pushed back initial incursions from officers, the camp was fully cleared by morning. “The police attacked not only the encampment but students all over the campus,” Açiksöz said. “There were groups of students, maybe 1,000 students or so, surrounding the encampments in different directions, and everywhere that I went, I saw students being chased by stun grenades and batons.” By Thursday morning, hundreds of students and faculty had been arrested and were being released from detention at the Inmate Reception Center and the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles. The released protesters were greeted by public defense attorneys and family members, and by jail support volunteers who passed out bagels and coffee. Los Angeles Public Defender Ricardo García said in a statement that his office was providing “on-the-ground support to arrestees” but that it was not yet clear what charges, if any, would be presented. LAPD and the California Highway Patrol referred questions to the UCLA Campus Police, which did not respond to a request for comment. Block, the UCLA chancellor, released a statement to the UCLA community Thursday afternoon about the decision to direct campus police and outside law enforcement to help clear the encampment after the administration failed to reach an agreement with encampment leaders. “In the end, the encampment on Royce Quad was both unlawful and a breach of policy. It led to unsafe conditions on our campus and it damaged our ability to carry out our mission,” Block wrote. “It needed to come to an end.” Later Thursday, in an alumni town hall, Block acknowledged the protesters’ demands but did not signal any willingness to meet them. He also said that UCLA’s commencement ceremonies will go forward, though he expects some disruptions. Outside the Inmate Detention Center on Thursday morning, students walked outside red-eyed from lack of sleep and tear gas that still stung their eyes. One 21-year-old psychology major who was released Thursday said that the last two days on campus were like a “war zone” and that she witnessed police removing people’s hijabs and masks, and forcing students to walk by the video screen put up by pro-Israel counter-protesters on their way to arrest. “They did this on purpose,” she said. “They told us, ‘Let’s do a media walk.’ It was a kind of a threat meant for public humiliation.” She was one of a few hundred students, faculty and staff remaining at the encampment at 5:50 Thursday morning, eager to keep the police out of the encampment. She recalled how officers kettled her classmates, pushing through their makeshift barriers with batons and shields. “We’re just kids,” she said. “We didn’t have much to go off of.” Later Thursday, the encampment had been cleared by the university, and dozens of tent-shaped patches of grass marked what had been the makeshift solidarity encampment. Some protesters talked about rebuilding the community, and others expressed caution. “I think it’ll come back,” said a senior bioengineering major who was arrested Thursday morning. He received a concussion after being struck on the head twice Tuesday and pepper-sprayed in the eye. “We just want our demands to be met. We want the university to step up and acknowledge that and be open about how they’re spending their money.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Hundreds of students at colleges nationwide, from Columbia University in New York to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), to Northwestern University in Illinois and Brown University in Rhode Island, held demonstrations in recent weeks to demand that their universities divest from companies that are in business with Israel, and publicly called for a cease-fire. Students at the University of Minnesota joined the national mobilization and set up an encampment that lasted 10 days to protest Israel’s ongoing attacks in Gaza, which has killed over 34,000 people, displaced most of the population and caused famine. Israel’s offensive began after a surprise attack on Oct. 7 from the militant group Hamas, which killed 1,200 people and took hundreds hostage. Eight students and one faculty member were arrested at the encampment Tuesday, but the university agreed to not pursue disciplinary action and urged campus police not to charge anyone involved in the demonstrations over the past week with criminal offense, CBS News reported. On Thursday morning, interim President Jeff Ettinger sent an email to students and faculty outlining the agreement that was reached the night before at a meeting with members of the UMN Divest Coalition to discuss their demands. “We regret that this meeting did not happen sooner, and have committed to regular meetings moving forward to continue to discuss this coalition’s concerns,” Ettinger said in the email. The agreement states that the college will disclose its holdings with public companies on May 7, but that “other investments are protected by non-disclosure agreements or other legal constraints.” Coalition representatives have also been invited to address their divestment demands with the Board of Regents at a meeting on May 10. In return, students agreed to disband the encampments and tents that they had set up on campus, and to not disrupt finals or the university’s commencement ceremony later this month. Beyond divestments and transparency on Israel ties, University of Minnesota’s student protesters had a total of six demands, including amnesty for arrested students, an academic divestment from Israeli universities, and a statement of support for Palestinian students and their right to self-determination. “While we take these concessions as a win for the movement as a whole, we know that the fight for divestment is not over and are committed to continue fighting for divestment from apartheid Israel until it is won and Palestine is free. When we fight, we win!” the UMN Divest Coalition wrote in a social media post on Thursday. The next four years will change America forever.

While being honored for her work supporting sexual assault survivors, the “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” star gave a powerful speech about challenging broken systems, no matter how hard the fight. “I want to talk today about reversing convictions,” Hargitay began, first talking about her commitment to protecting and uplifting survivors. “It’s impossible to reverse my conviction that survivors matter, that what happened to us matters, and that our society must respond to survivors more compassionately, more holistically, with a deeper, more nuanced understanding of what healing means,” she said. Hargitay the addressed Weinstein’s New York rape conviction and the frustrating “reason it was overturned.” “Too many women’s voices. Too many women were allowed to speak,” she said, referring to how judges determined testimony from additional Weinstein accusers unfairly biased the initial trial. Hargitay said she remembered hearing journalists on the New York Times’ “The Daily” podcast say “how it was so risky for the prosecution to have that many women testify.” “Risky to let women speak?” she said she asked herself. “You’re damn right it is. Too many women speaking brings change. Too many women speaking shakes the establishment.” The star of the NBC crime series, now in its 25th season, later called backlash to the #MeToo movement and empowerment of survivors “evidence of how powerful those voices were, those voices are.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-bill-antisemitism-critics-misleading-israel-gaza-protests_n_66340e44e4b0fc2b9528d501,The House Passed A Bill To Fight Antisemitism. Here’s Why Critics Call It Misleading.,sanjana karanth,5/2/2024,"A bill expanding the definition of antisemitism was passed on Wednesday by a bipartisan vote in the House — but despite the legislation on its face claiming to help federal officials better protect Jewish students on school campuses, critics say it is misleading and will only serve to crack down on the free speech rights of students currently protesting Israel’s ongoing military offensive in Gaza and the U.S. government’s continued support. The House voted 320-91 in support of the Antisemitism Awareness Act, establishing a broader definition of antisemitism to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws. The bill would codify the intergovernmental International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism into the legal framework established by the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination based on shared ancestry, ethnic characteristics or national origin. “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities,” the IHRA’s working definition of antisemitism, as adopted in 2016, reads. “Manifestations might include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity,” the IHRA adds. “However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.” Seventy Democrats and 21 Republicans voted against the House bill, which now goes to the Senate. If passed and then signed into law by President Joe Biden, the bill would expand what counts as illegal ethnic discrimination to include anything covered by the IHRA’s definition of antisemitism. A sponsor of the bill, Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), said in a statement Wednesday that the bill “gives teeth to federal anti-discrimination laws to go after those who attack their Jewish peers.” “Politics should never get in the way of the safety of the students,” he said. Kenneth Stern, the professor who drafted the IHRA’s working definition of antisemitism, warned Congress in 2017 that if government bodies “enshrine this definition into law, outside groups will try and suppress — rather than answer — political speech they don’t like. The academy, Jewish students and faculty teaching about Jewish issues, will all suffer.” The Biden administration and Congress have faced increased scrutiny from within the U.S. for their continued support of Israel’s siege in Gaza, which began after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people on Oct. 7 in Israel and took roughly 250 hostage. The Israeli offensive has since killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza and displaced at least 80% of the region’s residents, has destroyed important infrastructure like schools, hospitals and religious institutions and has brought on a famine. If the bill is enacted, the Department of Education could use its expanded definition of antisemitism to stifle the ongoing antiwar protests at college campuses across the U.S., according to the bill’s opponents. In recent weeks, students from multiple faiths, races and ethnicities have begun camping out on school grounds, calling for the U.S. to stop funding Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and for their universities to divest from companies financially tied to Israel. Witness descriptions and footage from the campus protests portray the demonstrations to be generally peaceful — though the arrival of counterprotesters and police, who have been recorded assaulting and arresting students and professors, has caused them to turn violent. Law enforcement agencies, often called in by university administrators, have so far arrested about 2,000 protesters, according to a tally by The Associated Press. “Instead of focusing on protecting the free speech rights of Palestinian, Arab, Muslim and Jewish students who face harassment and attacks during recent student-led protests on campus, House lawmakers attempted to adopt in law the anti-free speech IHRA definition,” said Robert McCaw, director of government affairs for Muslim civil rights group CAIR. “Misleading definitions like these are being weaponized right now to suppress and silence Muslim, Jewish, Palestinian and allied communities’ student-led protests against the Israeli government’s war crimes in Gaza.” Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union called on House lawmakers to vote against the bill, saying federal law already bans antisemitic discrimination and harassment. Dozens of universities in the U.S. already face civil rights investigations by the DOE over allegations of antisemitism and Islamophobia. The bill instead ”would likely chill free speech of students on college campuses by incorrectly equating criticism of the Israeli government with antisemitism,” the ACLU said in a letter sent Friday to the House. Others who oppose the bill — including some Democrats, free speech advocates and pro-Palestinian groups — have also pointed out the dangers of equating criticism of the Israeli government with hatred of a religion or culture. “Speech that is critical of Israel alone does not constitute unlawful discrimination,” Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday. “By encompassing purely political speech about Israel into Title VI’s ambit, the bill sweeps too broadly.” The next four years will change America forever.

IfNotNow, a Jewish American organization that opposes the Israeli occupation, called the bill “fearmongering by political and communal leaders and right-wing organization AIPAC,” referring to the massive pro-Israel lobbying group. “As American Jews, we see this McCarthyite crackdown on speech under the guise of Jewish safety as extremely dangerous,” IfNotNow national spokesperson Eva Borgwardt said after the bill’s passage. “We know that Jewish safety cannot come at the expense of Palestinian freedom. Jewish safety and Palestinian safety are inextricably intertwined.” “This bill would criminalize criticism on college campuses in the name of protecting American Jews, but its impact would be the opposite.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The “13 Reasons Why” and “Love, Victor” actor surprised fans this week by confirming on Instagram that she and her longtime girlfriend, Elise, were married “towards the end of last year.” She included a carousel of photos showing the two in their wedding dresses with the announcement. Dorfman’s post coincided with the publication of a lengthy Vogue essay in which she spoke about her relationship with Elise, whom she met on the dating app Hinge. “We got engaged two months into dating,” she explained. “To our credit, we waited a full 12 months before moving in together, so you can’t say we U-Hauled (though one might argue taking in a Great Dane puppy at our six-month mark was a smidge irresponsible). That’s the thing about falling in love though; your responsibility barometer isn’t always where it should be. Love, for us, required that nauseating combination of naivete, delusion, and fate.” Dorfman first announced her engagement in a 2022 appearance on Rachel Bilson’s “Broad Ideas” podcast, but did not disclose the identity of her fiancée. Noting the “embarrassing amount of headlines” that the news received at the time, Dorfman said she and Elise “decided as a couple to keep things private until we chose to invite others in.” As for the nuptials themselves, the actor noted only that they took place in Los Angeles last fall. “Our love had formed and grown in a contained bubble, so why couldn’t our marriage be on the same terms?” she wrote in Vogue, later adding that the couple “ended the day at a concert without telling a soul what we’d done.” The photos that appeared in Vogue and on Instagram, she added, were taken after she and Elise returned to Brooklyn, New York City, where they held a reception with their friends and family.

Dorfman, best known for her portrayal of Ryan Shaver on “13 Reasons Why,” publicly reintroduced herself as a transgender woman in a 2021 essay published by Time magazine. The following year, she split from husband Peter Zurkuhlen, to whom she’d been married since 2016. “I knew I was interested in women in a way that I hadn’t really been aware of since high school,” she later told Bilson in their “Broad Ideas” chat. “I was really scared to admit that I was perhaps attracted to women because I felt I had such safe relationships with all the women in my life because they thought of me as a gay man.” As for her relationship with Elise, which was then in its early days, she added, “I fell in love with someone who doesn’t fetishize me.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

James, who had been friends with Winehouse since they were children, told The Times in an article published Friday that he doesn’t like “Back to Black,” which hit theaters in the U.K. last month. “There is this sense of Amy being coherent even when taking drugs, but there was so much suffering,” he told the British paper. “The film avoids the uncomfortable. I didn’t like it, and it was hugely triggering for me.” James said that he believes the biopic spends too much time on Winehouse’s relationship with her ex-husband, Blake Fielder-Civil. The former couple, whose tumultuous and drug-fueled relationship often made headlines, wed in 2007 before divorcing two years later. “It focuses way too much on Blake,” James said, adding that the “Rehab” singer “wouldn’t have liked the film.” “She was very real. She was also very funny and intelligent,” he said. “Back to Black,” based on a screenplay by Matt Greenhalgh, is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. The film stars British actor Marisa Abela as Winehouse. The biopic was partly inspired by Winehouse’s hugely successful 2006 album — also titled “Back to Black” — and her “deeply personal lyrics,” according to a film description. Winehouse, a six-time Grammy-winning artist, died of accidental alcohol poisoning in 2011. The musician’s battle with drug addiction often played out in front of the cameras. Elsewhere in his interview with The Times, James, said that he thought Abela “was very good” in the film, but that “essentially this was a person made to look like my friend, was dressed as my friend, with Amy’s make-up and clothes, but it wasn’t her.” He also accused the film of depicting an inaccurate chronology of events in Winehouse’s life, as well as leaving out the impact her friends had on her, The Times reported. James, who has spoken publicly about his own past battle with addiction, said that he wished he had a “mental health professional” next to him as he watched the film. “It took me straight back to that time,” he said. “I probably sound normal now, but I still suffer from anxiety and depression and it was like I had a day-long panic attack afterwards.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The aircraft manufacturer and the workers’ union, the International Association of Fire Fighters Local I-66, have been negotiating since February. Boeing forced the workers out early Saturday morning after the union turned down the company’s final offer. The union accused the embattled plane-maker of choosing “corporate greed over safety,” while Boeing insisted that it had a plan to “ensure safe operations” at the impacted manufacturing sites across the Puget Sound area. “We have now locked out members of the bargaining unit and fully implemented our contingency plan with highly qualified firefighters performing the work of [union] members,” Boeing said in a statement. A lockout is essentially the opposite of a strike ― rather than workers walking off the job by choice, an employer forces them off the job with the aim of gaining leverage in negotiations. Like strikes, lockouts tend to happen when a collective bargaining agreement has expired and a new one hasn’t been reached. The union said the lockout was “intended to punish, intimidate, and coerce its firefighters into accepting a contract that undervalues their work.” “When is Boeing going to make safety a priority? When is Boeing finally going to listen?” Casey Yeager, the union’s president, said in a statement. According to the union, it members respond to fires at Boeing work sites and train other Boeing employees on fire safety practices. The union said that its members earn “up to 30% less” than firefighters at nearby municipal fire departments, and that it would take workers 19 years to reach the top pay rate under Boeing’s most recent proposal. The company said it has made two competitive offers that are in line with similar corporate fire departments. Boeing is facing a wave of political and regulatory scrutiny over its safety practices ever since a door panel blew out on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max jet in January. The Federal Aviation Administration recently said that an audit of the company revealed “multiple instances” in which Boeing and a key supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, had failed to meet quality-control mandates. Boeing announced in March that CEO David Calhoun would be stepping down. Yeager maintained that the firefighter lockout could end up siphoning resources from other fire departments in the area. “Our members are committed to improving the safety culture of the Boeing Company,” he said. “But we refuse to let a multi-billion-dollar company resolve its years of mismanagement on the backs of firefighters.”",0.061586941,0.240843775

Students at UC Riverside organized a sit-in on campus on April 29 demand that their university disclose investments and funding linked to Israel and divest from companies and institutions that are “complicit in the Israeli occupation, apartheid, and genocide” of Palestinians. In the agreement reached with student leaders Friday, UC Riverside stated that the college will take steps to be transparent about its investments. With students, it will also “explore the removal” of its endowment from the broader University of California system’s investment office and the reinvestment of it “in a manner that will be financially and ethically sound for the university with consideration to the companies involved in arms manufacturing and delivery.” The university’s business school has also discontinued its study abroad programs to Israel. “This agreement does not change the realities of the war in Gaza, or the need to address antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of bias and discrimination; however, I am grateful that we can have constructive and peaceful conversations on how to address these complex issues,” UCR Chancellor Kim Wilcox said in a statement sent to faculty and staff on Friday night. The chancellor did not respond to HuffPost’s request for additional comment. “This is not the end of UCR’s complicity, and we will continue to hold our admin accountable. This is a step closer towards a liberated Palestine,” the UCR chapter of Students for Justice In Palestine wrote in a social media post. “Our work is not done. Innocent people are still dying, enduring displacement, and suffering. This is a small victory in many, many more to come,” the group said in a separate post. Colleges across the country, including 10 UC campuses, have set up encampments and demonstrations on their campuses over recent weeks to protest Israel’s war in Gaza and to demand that their schools divest from Israeli institutions and companies. The University of California system overall has opposed calls to boycott and divest from Israel, saying it “impinges on the academic freedom of our students and faculty and the unfettered exchange of ideas on our campuses.” The next four years will change America forever.

Clarence Yoder, 40, approached a bison about 7 miles from the park’s west entrance in Montana on April 21, the National Park Service said Monday. Rangers responded after receiving a report that someone had “harassed a herd of bison and kicked a bison in the leg.” The park service said that Yoder “sustained minor injuries” in the process, without providing specifics. “Rangers transported Yoder to a nearby medical facility where he was medically evaluated, treated and released from medical care,” the agency said. “He then was transported to the Gallatin County Detention Center.” Yoder was charged with disorderly conduct, being under the influence of alcohol, approaching wildlife and disturbing wildlife. A companion named McKenna Bass, 37, was also arrested and charged with disturbing wildlife, failure to yield to emergency light activation, and driving under the influence of alcohol.

LOUIS (AP) — A former Boy Scout volunteer has been sentenced to 22 years in prison for hiding cameras in a bathroom at a Missouri camp. A federal judge on Thursday also ordered David Lee Nelson, a 41-year-old from Redmond, Washington, to pay more than $60,000, with some of the money going toward counseling for the victims. Some of them described at the hearing being fearful and unable to trust because of what happened. The U.S. attorney’s office said Nelson placed the cameras in paper towel dispensers in July 2021, positioning them so they would capture a shower stall and other parts of the bathroom at the S Bar F Scout Ranch in St. Francois County. The camp is about 80 miles (128.75 kilometers) south of St. Louis. Scouts were cleaning restroom stalls with a leader when one of the cameras was discovered. A search ensued, and another camera was found. Leaders then called law enforcement. The next four years will change America forever.

The actor admitted as much in an interview Saturday, saying “everybody came for me” and his acting. Best, whose character remains one of the most reviled in all of “Star Wars” lore, still remembers rehearsals vividly. “This was the first time I was going to do the Jar Jar voice in front of people,” Best told People. “And to be honest, I didn’t know if I was going to do it at that reading or not. I was like, ‘I might do it, I might not.’ And as I’m reading as the first few pages go by, I’m in my head.” But when he did, in fact, bust out the character’s now-infamous singsong voice, “everybody in the room goes crazy for it. So I was like, ‘OK, all right. I got that one out. I’m supposed to be here now.’” Best was a burgeoning actor before he was cast in the highly-anticipated “Star Wars” prequel, the first since the original trilogy ended in 1983, opposite Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. But he soon became the face of fans’ disappointment with the film. While he’s kept most of these frustrations to himself since 1999, Best has stopped mincing words. “My career began and ended. I didn’t know what to do. ... It had never happened before in history,” he told People of the intense hatred for the character. “Especially with the internet component. Now there’s an entire field of psychology based on it.” He noted, too, that he was “first person,” and in particular the “first Black person,” to play a fully computer-generated character in a live-action movie. The reaction to Jar Jar was so negative that Best even considered suicide. But he told People that he “didn’t want to hurt my family like that,” and genuinely “felt the injustice of it all.” “How could I have achieved such a wonderful thing, and then nothing?” Best added. “Nothing. I was longing to continue. I wanted to continue this work. I wanted to continue moving in this direction and seeing what the CGI thing could turn into.” The character disappeared from “Star Wars” films before long. But Best said he hopes to see the clumsy alien again. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/150th-kentucky-derby-could-be-a-wet-one_n_663658dce4b0e44cfb11ac4d,Mystik Dan Wins 150th Kentucky Derby By A Nose In A 3-Horse Photo Finish At Churchill Downs,beth harris,5/4/2024,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — The 150th Kentucky Derby produced one of the most dramatic finishes in its storied history — three noses at the wire. Mystik Dan desperately fought to hang on with two challengers coming to him in the closing strides. He did, too, after a delay of several minutes while the closest three-horse photo finish since 1947 was sorted out. That year, Jet Pilot won by a head over Phalanx, who was another head in front of Faultless. This one was much tighter. Mystik Dan, an 18-1 shot, edged Sierra Leone by a nose, with Forever Young another nose back in third on Saturday. Sierra Leone was the most expensive horse in the race at $2.3 million. Long shots Track Phantom and Just Steel led the field through the early going, with 3-1 favorite Fierceness racing three-wide just off the leaders. At the top of the stretch, everything changed. Track Phantom drifted off the rail, opening a hole that Hernandez squeezed Mystik Dan through, and the bay colt suddenly found another gear. He quickly opened up a daylight advantage on the field. “When he shot through that spot, he was able to cut the corner and I asked him to go for it,” Hernandez said. “He shot off and I’m like, ‘Oh man, I’ve got a big chance to win the Kentucky Derby.’” To Mystik Dan’s outside, Sierra Leone and Forever Young took up the chase in the middle of the track. As Mystik Dan sped along the rail, Sierra Leone lugged in and bumped Forever Young three times in the stretch, but jockey Ryusei Sakai didn’t claim foul. Mystik Dan got so close to the rail that Hernandez’s boot struck it. “But I think we can buy another pair of boots,” he said. The winner’s share of the record $5 million purse was $3.1 million, with the jockey and trainer typically earning 10% each. “Just a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant jockey and ride,” McPeek said. “Brian is one of the most underrated jockeys, but not anymore, right?” Sierra Leone, the second choice at 9-2 odds, and Forever Young from Japan came up just short at the wire in front of 156,710 at Churchill Downs, the largest crowd since 2018. “You get beat a nose in the Kentucky Derby, it’s a tough one,” said Chad Brown, trainer of Sierra Leone. “But I’m so proud of the horse.” It was just the 10th Kentucky Derby decided by a nose — the closest margin in horse racing — and the first since Grindstone edged Cavonnier to wear the garland of red roses in 1996. The crowd waited several minutes in the heat and humidity as the result was reviewed by the stewards and declared official. “The longest few minutes of my life,” Hernandez said, after he and Mystik Dan walked in circles while the stunning result was settled. “To see your number flash up to win the Derby, I don’t think it will sink in for a while.” Fierceness finished 15th in the field of 20 3-year-olds. Owner Mike Repole is 0 for 8 in the derby. He had the favorite in 2011 with Uncle Mo, who was scratched the day before the race with an illness. Last year, Forte was scratched the morning of the race as the favorite with a bruised foot. Mystik Dan ran 1 1/4 miles over a fast track in 2:03.34 and paid $39.22, $16.32 and $10. Hernandez and trainer Kenny McPeek had teamed for a wire-to-wire win in the Kentucky Oaks for fillies on Friday with Thorpedo Anna. McPeek is the first trainer to sweep both races since Ben Jones in 1952. McPeek’s only other victory in a Triple Crown race was also a shocker: 70-1 Sarava won the 2002 Belmont Stakes — the biggest upset in that race’s history. The colt spoiled the Triple Crown bid of War Emblem. The winning owners are cousins Lance and Brent Gasaway and Daniel Hamby III, all from Arkansas. They bred Mystik Dan. “We’ve done it with what I call working-class horse,” McPeek said, explaining the colt’s sire and dam weren’t big names. Sharilyn Gasaway, Brent’s wife, said, “It is surreal for sure. We feel like we’re just ordinary people and we’ve got an amazing horse.” The next four years will change America forever.

But Israel hasn’t sent a delegation and a senior Israeli official downplayed prospects for a full end to the war while emphasizing the commitment to invading Rafah. Pressure has mounted to reach a deal halting the nearly 7-month-long war. A top U.N. official says there is now a “ full-blown famine” in northern Gaza, while the United States has repeatedly warned close ally Israel about its planned offensive into Rafah, the southernmost city on the border with Egypt, where more than 1 million Palestinians are sheltering. Egyptian and U.S. mediators have reported signs of compromise in recent days, but chances for a cease-fire deal remain entangled with the key question of whether Israel will accept an end to the war without reaching its stated goal of destroying the militant group Hamas. Egypt’s state-owned Al-Qahera News TV channel said that a consensus had been reached over many disputed points but did not elaborate. Hamas has called for a complete end to the war and withdrawal of all Israeli forces from Gaza. For the sake of the people of Gaza, the hostages & their families, and the region & the wider world – I strongly encourage the government of Israel & Hamas leadership to reach an agreement in their negotiations.Without that, I fear the war will worsen exponentially. A senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, played down the prospects for a full end to the war. The official said Israel was committed to the Rafah invasion and that it will not agree in any circumstance to end the war as part of a deal to release hostages. Israeli media said that statement had been dictated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose government could be threatened if he agrees to a deal because hard-line Cabinet members demand an attack on Rafah. The proposal that Egyptian mediators had put to Hamas sets out a three-stage process that would bring an immediate, six-week cease-fire and partial release of Israeli hostages, and would include some sort of Israeli pullout. The initial stage would last for 40 days. Hamas would start by releasing female civilian hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Some families of hostages accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war for his political interests. Daniel Elgert, whose brother Itzhak is held by Hamas, addressed Netanyahu at the latest rally in Tel Aviv: “Bibi, we call on you from here to announce the end of the war in exchange for the return of all the hostages. The war is effectively over, we know it’s over, you can’t fool us.” The war has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s local health officials, caused widespread destruction and plunged the territory into an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. The conflict erupted on Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked southern Israel, abducting about 250 people and killing around 1,200, mostly civilians. Israel says militants still hold around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others. Israeli strikes Saturday on Gaza killed at least six people. Three bodies were recovered from the rubble of a building in Rafah and taken to Yousef Al Najjar hospital. A strike in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed three people, according to hospital officials. In the last 24 hours, the bodies of 32 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to local hospitals, Gaza’s Health Ministry said Saturday. The ministry does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its tallies but says that women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed. The Israeli military says it has killed 13,000 militants, without providing evidence to back up the claim. It has also conducted mass arrests during its raids inside Gaza. The territory’s Health Ministry urged the International Criminal Court to investigate the death in Israeli custody of a Gaza surgeon. Adnan al-Borsh, 50, was working at al-Awda Hospital when Israeli troops stormed it in December, according to the Palestinian Prisoner’s Club. The United Nations has warned that hundreds of thousands would be “at imminent risk of death” if Israel’s military moves forward into densely packed Rafah, which is also a critical entry point for humanitarian aid. Israel has briefed U.S. officials on its plan to evacuate civilians. The director of the U.N. World Food Program, Cindy McCain, said Friday that trapped civilians in the north, the most cut-off part of Gaza, have plunged into famine. McCain said a cease-fire and a greatly increased flow of aid through land and sea routes was essential. A Israeli humanitarian official on Saturday called McCain’s assertion incorrect and said Israel has been facilitating the delivery of more aid. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Israel recently opened new crossings for aid into northern Gaza, but on Wednesday, Israeli settlers blocked the first convoy before it crossed into the besieged enclave. Once inside Gaza, the convoy was commandeered by Hamas militants, before U.N. officials reclaimed it. Some displaced residents of northern Gaza said they had been skipping meals and hadn’t seen vegetables for weeks. “You know now everything is scarce in Gaza. There are no vegetables and there is no aid or food packages. It is about once a month that we get food parcels,” Marwan Al-Zaid said. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where tensions have been high since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, the Israeli military said it and Shin Bet had killed five fighters in Tulkarem, asserting the fighters had opened fire. Palestinian authorities said five people were killed by Israeli fire in the town of Deir al-Ghusun, roughly 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) northeast of Tulkarem. ___ Jeffery reported from Jerusalem.

The eldest daughter of the “Pulp Fiction” star told multiple outlets that he’s doing well, noting that she and her own daughter, 1-year-old Louetta, visited him Thursday. “As a family, especially my sisters and I, we’re just so grateful for the love that comes at him,” Rumer Willis told Extra at Jhpiego’s Laughter Is the Best Medicine Gala. “I think it is such a reflection of who he is.” She told Fox News Digital that as her family speaks publicly about his condition, “what’s been so incredible is my dad is so beloved.” “I think if there’s any way sharing our experience brings hope — whatever comes forward as a family — that can have an effect and bring any sort of hope, comfort to someone else experiencing that, then to me, that’s … everything,” she said. In 2022, news broke that the “Die Hard” star had been diagnosed with aphasia, prompting him to step away from acting. His family announced the following year that his condition had progressed to frontotemporal dementia. FTD can cause emotional problems, unusual behaviors and difficulty communicating, according to the National Institute on Aging. Rumer Willis, who recently posted a sweet Instagram photo of Bruce Willis with Louetta, is one of three daughters that her father shares with actor Demi Moore.

The three-time Super Bowl champion gushed about his spouse during a Thursday appearance on the podcast “Impaulsive With Logan Paul.” He said he thinks people “don’t even realize how much she does,” explaining that the Kansas City Current co-owner takes care of the “day-to-day stuff” in their household so that he can focus on football. “And focus on my craft and everything like that, and just being a Hall of Fame mom and a Hall of Fame wife,” he said. “It makes it a lot easier. ...

While there has not yet been confirmation based on forensic examination, physical characteristics — including hair and clothing — means there is a high likelihood that the bodies are those of the three tourists, local TV network Milenio reported, citing chief state prosecutor María Elena Andrade Ramírez. “It is presumed that (the bodies) are the ones being investigated,” an employee of the state prosecutors’ office who was not authorized to be quoted by name told The Associated Press. The bodies were found in a well where investigators also found another body that authorities said would be investigated. “A fourth body was located. It is not related to the three foreigners. The fourth body had been there for a long time,” the official added. The site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tomás was near the remote seaside area where the missing men’s tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast. The men — identified by family members as brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad — went missing Saturday. They did not show up at their planned accommodations over the weekend. The U.S. State Department said: “We are aware of those reports (of bodies) and are closely monitoring the situation. At this time we have no further comment.” Baja California prosecutors had said Thursday that they were questioning three people in the case. On Friday, the office said the three had been arrested and charged with a crime equivalent to kidnapping. It was unclear if they might face more charges. Andrade Ramírez, the chief state prosecutor, said evidence found along with the abandoned tents was linked to the three people being questioned about the missing foreigners. Milenio reported that she said the suspects appeared to have stolen the surfers’ truck and some of its parts were found in another truck belonging to one of the suspects. On Wednesday, the missing Australians’ mother, Debra Robinson, posted on a local community Facebook page an appeal for help in finding her sons. Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodations in the nearby city of Rosarito. Robinson said one of her sons, Callum, was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of a U.S. citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tva-nuclear-power-debt-ceiling_n_66352e7de4b00b1eab534aca,A Century-Old Company The Government Owns Wants To Solve A Big Energy Problem,alexander c. kaufman,5/4/2024,"The Biden administration wants the United States to triple the global supply of nuclear power, with American-designed reactors running on fuel enriched in the West. The goal: Usurp Russia’s near monopoly on atomic energy exports, and keep China from gaining control of yet another green energy industry. But there’s one big problem: The U.S. isn’t even building any more reactors at home. After nearly 15 years of billion-dollar cost overruns and delays, the utility giant Southern Company just hooked the second of two new reactors at a power plant in Georgia up to the grid this week — the only two atomic energy units built from scratch in the U.S. in decades. Developers are shopping around all kinds of novel designs for new-age nuclear plants. Yet few utilities can afford — or persuade investors to put up the cash for — projects that can take a decade or more to complete. Luckily for President Joe Biden, the federal government owns a massive power utility specifically designed to deploy large-scale infrastructure that remains out of reach for the market’s invisible hand. But building new megaprojects means borrowing money — and Congress hasn’t bothered to adjust the utility’s credit limit for inflation in 45 years. Established almost exactly 91 years ago to electrify rural parts of the American South too poor to attract profiteering utilities, the Tennessee Valley Authority today generates and sells power to 153 local distributors that serve 10 million people in Tennessee and the surrounding region. The TVA’s seven reactors, spread out between three nuclear power plants, churned out 43% of its electricity in the past few months. The TVA functions like any other independent power company. But the New Deal-era state corporation’s board of directors is appointed by the White House and its shares are owned by the federal government. That makes the TVA the closest thing the U.S. has to the kind of government-controlled entity that other countries have tasked with completing their own years-long nuclear megaprojects. France, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Poland and Ukraine all use government ownership to build and operate nuclear energy plants. The Kremlin-owned Rosatom has only widened Russia’s lead over the U.S. in reactor and uranium fuel exports in recent years, while successfully deploying new technologies at home. China’s state utilities have built reactors at home faster than any other country, and the country now looks poised to begin exporting its reactor designs in direct competition with the U.S. Putting the TVA at the cutting edge of the U.S. government’s nuclear revival strategy is not a new idea. But it’s gaining momentum. The utility is already working on two next-generation projects to build some of the country’s first small modular reactors. Now even the regulator who oversaw construction of the nation’s only all-new reactors in Georgia is encouraging the TVA to take up the challenge of constructing more. On a call with reporters Tuesday, TVA chief executive Jeff Lyash reversed his past opposition to building more of the large reactors that just came online in Georgia, saying he would no longer rule it out. But the TVA’s atomic ambitions are hurtling toward a major roadblock. In the 1970s, the TVA started work on 17 nuclear reactors to meet growing electricity needs. But it ended up constructing just seven, as increasingly efficient electric technology and the growth of fossil fuels kept demand flat, despite a rising U.S. population. Faced with soaring debt from unfinished projects that would never earn money, Congress set the utility’s debt limit at $30 billion. If Congress had set that budget to automatically rise to account for inflation, that same dollar value would now surpass $137 billion. And with demand now surging from data centers and as the world races to replace fossil fuels with electricity, two-thirds of the TVA’s credit line is used up. Since its debt levels reached $24 billion at the end of 2016, the TVA has steadily shaved billions off its negative balance sheets, in part with contracts that direct revenues directly to paying down debt, John Thomas, the TVA’s chief financial officer, said on the call. He insisted the debt “doesn’t inhibit our ability” to get started on more projects, such as a proposal to build two or more BWRX-300 nuclear reactors — newer, smaller generators designed by North Carolina-based GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy — in Tennessee. Due to its federal ownership, the TVA is legally barred from receiving money from certain government funds, like those from the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office. But the TVA can even benefit from huge new subsidies in Biden’s landmark climate-spending law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The law specifically included language to allow the TVA to receive direct cash payments from the government to help fund new clean energy investments. There is more money on the way. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), who heads the energy and water subcommittee on the House committee that handles the federal budget, included a nearly $900 million line item, through which the TVA could request cash to build the three small nuclear reactors. But Fleischmann said once the project begins, “there would be a potential” scenario where Congress would “have to actually look at the possibility of raising” the TVA’s debt limit. “I think we need to do everything possible” to facilitate the TVA’s nuclear buildout plans, Fleischmann told HuffPost. “I would certainly be willing to look at that possibility.” At $35 billion, the two new Westinghouse AP-1000 reactors at Southern Company’s Plant Vogtle project comprise the most expensive power plant ever built in the U.S., and experts believe those reactors are still the cheapest possible projects for large-scale capability. But even optimistic cost projections would test the limits of TVA’s budget, particularly if the utility goes forward with building both the nation’s third-ever AP-1000 and multiple BWRX-300s. And on top of these nuclear investments, the TVA is still building out new gas-burning generators at roughly double the rate needed to make up for retiring coal plants. On its quarterly earnings call Tuesday, the TVA’s top executives highlighted its two small modular reactor projects as technological innovations that could fill the need gas is currently serving. While the nuclear plants the TVA is now considering use traditional water-cooling technology, the TVA is also working with the California-based startup Kairos Power on a pilot project in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to demonstrate a next-generation reactor that runs on a special kind of fuel and uses fluoride salt instead of water as a coolant, allowing it to more easily rev up and down to match demand. The test reactor got the green light from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in December. “Advanced nuclear in particular holds a great deal of promise as a dispatchable, carbon-free technology,” Lyash said. Once a few projects get going and the supply chain kicks into gear, GE Hitachi estimates that the cost of the smaller BWRX-300 reactors would compare favorably to other energy sources. At $60 per megawatt hour, the reactor would produce electricity more cheaply than many wind and solar sites and could provide back-up to the grid for roughly half the price of a gas-powered backup generator, according to widely-cited data from the consultancy Lazard. But if cost overruns prevent the TVA from actually building more than one BWRX-300 at its new Tennessee plant, there’s no guarantee that they’d see the same cost savings. And their impact on the grid would be less than a large-scale nuclear plant, since each small modular reactor produces at most 300 megawatts of energy. Each AP-1000, meanwhile, packs 1,114 megawatts of power, enough to supply steady electricity to nearly 1 million homes. That scale may make them make more financial sense, even if the first two that were built more expensive up-front to build, now that the U.S. has at least a few functional AP-1000s. Not everyone agrees that TVA should prioritize more nuclear projects. With nearly half the TVA’s electricity already coming from nuclear reactors, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy said the utility should look to build wind turbines, solar panels and batteries — all of which are increasingly cheap but still make up a tiny fraction of the TVA’s overall generating system. “I’m not convinced we need to be building more nuclear plants at TVA,” said Stephen Smith, the environmental group’s executive director. “There’s a decarbonization path that the TVA can take that’s more cost effective, less risky, and balances their portfolio before they jump into bed with the next supposedly favorable nuclear project.” Renewables are by no means incompatible with nuclear power. The country installing by far the most solar panels — China — is also the nation building nuclear reactors at a faster rate than any other. France, which has generated most of its electricity from nuclear power since the 1980s, grew its solar capacity by 30% just between 2022 and 2023. A growing body of research shows how atomic energy’s steady “baseload” power can complement solar and wind, which generate electricity more intermittently. Yet in the U.S. many advocates on opposite sides of the debate pit weather-dependent renewables like wind and solar, which are today the cheapest and most fastest-growing sources of clean electricity, against nuclear power, the largest and most efficient single source of carbon-free generation in the U.S. One reason for the rivalry is logistics. Renewables’ fluctuating output requires a different degree of planning from grid operators than those with power systems with a lot of nuclear reactors, which maintain steady production regardless of the time of day or weather. Another reason is financial. Energy modelers measure the total construction price of a power plant in “overnight cost” — meaning what it would cost to build the facility overnight without incurring interest on loans. A combined-cycle gas plant could come for as little as $1,330 per kilowatt of electricity, according to 2023 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That same gas facility with hardware to capture at least 90% of its carbon emissions? $3,140 per kilowatt hour. Solar panels with batteries would cost $1,808. Onshore wind? $2,098. Now look at nuclear power. A traditional large light water reactor costs $7,777 per kilowatt hour. The federal researchers’ estimate for one of the newer small reactors amounts to a whopping $8,349 per reactor. Given how much longer it takes to build a nuclear reactor, those expenses ― and the interest on loans ― adds up quickly, a risk that few utilities operating in markets with limited options for financing large-scale projects are prepared to take. But the “overnight costs” don’t tell the full story. Measured by the “levelized cost of energy,” a metric that factors in the cost of generating electricity from a plant throughout its operating lifetime, nuclear power makes more sense. Absent subsidies for any sources, nuclear reactors would generate electricity almost as cheaply as solar panels and wind turbines, according to Lazard’s analysis. (The consultancy warned that the calculation may be inflated due to the limited number of new nuclear projects forcing its models to rely on high-cost data from the Vogtle project.) “I think we need to do everything possible.” And even that dollar figure doesn’t account for recent breakthroughs in maintenance and part replacements that could allow modern nuclear reactors to operate for a century or more. The TVA could be better positioned to soak up upfront costs than private utilities, who have a clearer conflict between stewarding investors’ money and gambling on costly projects for the greater good. In states like New York, Texas and California, which broke up their giant monopoly utilities and created competitive markets for electricity, the steep upfront price tag makes building a new nuclear plant almost impossible without targeted government support. Yet even in a traditionally-regulated market like Georgia, where Southern Company’s Georgia Power subsidiary enjoys an old-school monopoly, the debt the utility company incurred from building the new AP-1000s made it spike ratepayers’ bills. In South Carolina, where Westinghouse planned to build another two AP-1000s in the mid-2000s, the local utility went bankrupt and its top executives went to jail for lying about the ballooning cost. The TVA, by contrast, has historically used the rates it collects from selling electricity to pay for maintenance and administrative costs, not new power plants. The TVA itself was also launched to invest in power infrastructure the market deemed too risky. If the only way to drive down the cost of new reactors is for the U.S. to start rolling them out in bulk, it’s difficult to find many boards of directors prepared to sacrifice their companies’ profits at the altar of progress when waiting for a competitor to build their generators first might yield significant price savings. That makes the TVA — the only utility whose board is appointed by a president seeking to spur a nuclear revival, not by big business — a unique candidate for building reactors. But that also puts particular scrutiny on the TVA’s financial decisions. The TVA’s borrowing shows up on the federal balance sheet, making the utility a perennial target of fiscal hawks looking to rein in the national debt. In past administrations, the TVA’s debt may have been a factor in plans to sell off the utility to private investors. Amid a political feud with Republicans, former President Barack Obama proposed “reforming” the TVA, in a move widely interpreted as laying the groundwork for privatization. Former President Donald Trump openly pitched breaking up the TVA and selling off its parts. Republican lawmakers whose states benefit from the TVA balked at Trump’s proposal in 2018. But Trump took a renewed interest in the TVA during his final year as president, abruptly firing the board chairman as part of a bid to oust Lyash as chief executive. Two of the most vocal GOP opponents of Trump’s privatization strategy – including former Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who called the plan “loony” – are no longer in office. The presumptive Republican nominee for president, meanwhile, is already signaling plans to try again at selling off parts of the federal government. Russia launched the world’s first seaborne mobile nuclear power plant in 2019 and now wants to begin exporting its atomic barges. Two years later, China completed the world’s first onshore small modular nuclear plant, which Beijing aims to sell overseas. The next four years will change America forever.

But just a week earlier, the project meant to debut the first U.S. small modular reactors went bust in November. Now, with the Senate voting this week to ban imports of Russian uranium, the U.S. wants to not only end its reliance on foreign nuclear fuel, but invite more of the world to depend on American technology to power the next wave of atomic buildouts. The country is already behind its rivals. The TVA might offer an avenue to catch up ― unless the election scrambles its plans. Arthur Delaney contributed reporting from Washington.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/democrats-say-not-enjoying-gop-woes_n_663543f2e4b0fc2b95297575,House Democrats Swear They Are Not Enjoying GOP's Dysfunction — Honest!,jonathan nicholson,5/4/2024,"Democratic staffers on Capitol Hill were recently discussing the state of the House in a group chat when one posted a meme from “The Simpsons” to illustrate the point. The choice? Two knife-wielding monkeys fighting as onlookers surround them in a circle and cheer them on. The implication was the monkeys were the House Republicans and the bystanders were the Democrats. While Republicans retain the House majority, the extent of infighting has become glaringly apparent in recent weeks, most notably with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) threatening to call for a vote to oust Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.). Publicly, Democrats are avoiding giving Republicans what coaches would call “bulletin board material,” a slight or insult around which the GOP could rally, but they also want to project an air of seriousness as an implicit contrast to Republicans’ ineptitude. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) smiled for just a second when asked Wednesday if Democrats are enjoying Republicans’ misfortune. Then he launched into a very measured and dull answer. “We’re going to continue to keep the focus on getting results for the American people and delivering real results on their behalf,” Jeffries said. Aside from the ongoing will-she-or-won’t-she ouster saga with Greene, Republican disunity has shown up in many other ways, such as Johnson allowing Democrats to carry all or much of the responsibility for passing things, including an annual spending deal, renewal of a controversial spying law and the $61 billion Ukraine aid deal. And there have been smaller but perhaps more humiliating ways. On Wednesday, for the first time since 2004, with six Republicans voting with Democrats, the House GOP lost a vote on a motion to recommit, the congressional equivalent of an inside-the-park home run in baseball. The last-ditch parliamentary move stopped a pro-mining bill from passing and was a rare floor win for the Democratic minority. (The bill is expected to be brought up again next week.) It was the latest embarrassment for House Republicans, topping off a week when Democratic leaders publicly offered to allow Johnson to remain in his job by voting to table Greene’s challenge, should it come up. While Jeffries took the high road, at the staffer level, at least some degree of schadenfreude is apparent. A House Democratic staffer, on condition of anonymity, texted to HuffPost: “Occasionally, we think it’s funny the GOP conference can’t get their shit together, but mainly we dread the entire House shutting down again,” referring to what happened when former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted by his fellow Republicans. The staffer said they and their colleagues were aware, though, of the need to not appear publicly triumphant: “We all get the drill: don’t like Johnson, but can live with him.” Aaron Fritschner, deputy chief of staff for Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and a widely followed social media user on Capitol Hill, crowed about the timing of Democratic leaders’ statement that they would save Johnson from being booted. “It’s already such a massive power play but they really put the cherry on top by announcing it literally in the middle of the House GOP leadership press conference,” he posted. (A cardinal rule of Capitol Hill etiquette is thou shalt not publicly surprise a lawmaker.) The House, by its very nature, is a majoritarian institution, meaning the majority almost always sets the legislative agenda and rules while the minority party simply sits, lobs criticisms and waits for things to turn so they’ll again be the majority. In the Senate, the cozier, clubbier nature of the body and some built-in protections for the minority party, such as the filibuster, encourage bipartisanship rather than the House’s scorched earth approach. But in the House, the gulf between being a member of the majority party and the minority party is a wide one indeed. Which is what makes the situation in the House now so unusual. Even before they were down to having only one vote to spare on party-line votes, Republicans were having trouble doing the things normal House majorities do: winning procedural votes, electing a speaker and negotiating for policy wins in bills. And that’s led to a reversal of roles in many respects. Republicans have taken to aiming low, taking up low-stakes bills about energy standards for appliances and backing off of things like impeaching President Joe Biden. Democrats, almost able to taste a new majority next year, have been, in their rhetoric at least, less deferential than usual. They maintained, though, that the state of the House, which some have compared to a European parliament-style coalition government, was not a cause for mirth. “Sometimes you’ve got to laugh about it or else you’re going to cry,” said first-term Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.). “Overall, it’s not funny. It’s horrible. This is the most unproductive Congress since the Great Depression,” he said. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), who would take over as chair of the Rules Committee if Democrats win in November, also said the Republicans’ problems were no laughing matter. Referring to the possibility of another House shutdown if Johnson is ousted without an obvious successor, McGovern said, “What if there’s an international incident or a catastrophe that we have to respond to quickly and we don’t have a functioning House of Representatives? That’s crazy.” “I still have this feeling about this place where I can strongly disagree with their agenda but not [find] any joy in the chaos,” he said.

People Ask Me Lots Of Questions, But There's 1 That Scares Me Most.",caragh donley,5/4/2024,"You’ve no doubt never heard of “trans bingo,” but it became my game of choice not long after I came out as trans last spring at the age of 63. It was my way of coping with something about transition that I should’ve expected but never suspected. Since I was more often than not the first trans person that friends, family members and complete strangers had ever actually spoken to, they all had questions. Lots and lots of questions. “When did you know?” “What parts have you had either removed or added?” “What are you into now, chicks or dudes?” “Is that your real hair?” And so many more. These queries tumbled out with such regularity, it became a bit of a struggle to answer them without feeling overwhelmed and sometimes even annoyed. Then, after having dinner with a friend I hadn’t seen for years (who just kept repeating “What the fuck, dude?” throughout our meal), I came up with “trans bingo” to keep from weeping openly, when the relentless questioning left me feeling like I was being othered into a caricature. Once anyone asked me five of these routine questions in a row, I’d yell “Bingo!” — at least in my head. It helped me to take a step back, catch my breath and refocus myself. I’ve started to feel like trans people are the gender equivalent of Bitcoin: We’ve both been in the news a lot these past few years; our existence isn’t easy for people to comprehend; and people are constantly clearing their browser history so nobody will know they’ve been searching for information about us. I looked at my future and all I could see was myself constantly explaining my existence and feeling othered, even if people were quizzing me with the best of intentions. I knew transitioning wouldn’t be easy, but I never imagined it as being akin to that note near the end of the chorus of A-ha’s “Take On Me.” You’re sure you can nail it, but when you finally try it, the end result is not at all what you hoped it’d be. The cultural invisibility I’d enjoyed during my days of white cis straight male privilege — when I could easily blend in anywhere without worrying about how I was perceived — was gone now that I’d revealed my true trans self. Don’t get me wrong, I have less than zero regret about coming out, but after six decades of being as anonymous as I wanted to be, it’s strange to now feel on display in any room I walk into. I’m well aware that working in show biz and living in Manhattan and wearing size nine shoes all make my transition situation different from that of so many other trans people, struggling in Ohio or Missouri or without the other privileges I have. Every day, I wake up to stories like the one letting me know at least 10 states are currently trying to keep trans people from updating driver’s licenses, holding public office or using any public restroom, essentially erasing our right to exist. That’s on top of the hundreds of anti-trans bills oozing through dozens of state legislatures. And don’t even get me started on Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton seeking the medical records of Texas juveniles who went to other states for gender-affirming care. With so much hatred towards my community, it’s no surprise hate crimes based on gender identity rose nearly 33% in 2022 or that at least 53 trans people were killed and at least 32 died by suicide in 2023. Black trans women are, and have historically been, disproportionately impacted by violence. Considering that only about 1.6 million Americans older than age 13 are transgender, according to a survey from the University of California, Los Angeles, all of this fearmongering about people who are simply trying to live the life they feel is true and not the one everyone else expects seems... misplaced. Other than indulging in the exhilarating rush that apparently comes with raging at anyone who isn’t exactly you, I’m not quite sure what the transphobes’ endgame is. I know it’s got something to do with a fear of “grooming,” but the only time I’ve groomed a child is when I used to take my son for his haircuts. There’s also panic about trans people using public restrooms but seriously, nobody — trans or otherwise — wants to spend one minute longer than they have to in a public bathroom. I mean, you’ve seen them, right? I hate to say it but I think there are several people in this world who are the grownup version of Third Grade Dave, the bully who liked to beat me up after school for no other reason than he was a bully who liked to beat me up. Despite all of this, there have been some fantastic, identity-affirming benefits to finally living my life on my own terms at 64. I now get to wear some pretty fabulous blazers and dresses instead of hiding myself in a baggy t-shirts and jeans like I’m a 12-year-old boy. Oh, and I can bask in the sort of personal, meaningful, emotional conversations women engage in (as opposed to guy discussions that use surrogate topics like sports or politics or beer to represent whatever it is they’re really thinking and feeling). Best of all, after I wrote about my recurring childhood dream of becoming a little girl so I could play with Tabitha Stephens from TV’s “Bewitched,” Erin Murphy, the actress who played her, got in touch with me. Still, I’m constantly shocked when I find myself in situations where I’m that car accident you can’t help but gape at as you cruise past. There was the salesperson at a well-known clothing store who asked for my ID when she didn’t really need it, then stared at me for a solid 30 seconds before walking over to a fellow employee to show her my license and point at me. There’s definitely been more than one mom on the subway who yanked her child to the other end of the train when she saw me get on board. And who could forget the couple wearing matching “Let’s Go Brandon” T-shirts who followed me through the grocery store while pointing, whispering and snickering? All this contempt from people who will never meet me crystallized after I helped produce a Trans Awareness Week episode for the talk show I work on. It concluded with me coming on as a guest, talking about my AARP-era transition and assuring anyone terrified of coming out that I am so much happier than I was before I began living my new life. A video clip of my appearance went viral, and I quickly learned that what I considered to be self-care was instead seen as selfish by plenty of others, including several people who had previously been close to me. The positive commentary far outweighed the negative. Nonetheless, I heard from too many people who had many other choices for killing time — watching some Netflix, reading a book, yelling at the neighborhood kids to get off their lawn — yet instead chose to anonymously hate someone they’ve never met. This resulted in them posting things like: “So sad. Buy into the delusion.” “Congratulations on creating a place where males with autogynephilia can act out their fetish in public and make everyone around them be part of it WITHOUT consenting to it.” “Quit celebrating severe mental illness.” “Platforming a perfert (sic). This is a mentally ill man.” As horrific as comments like these are, they will still never get me pining for my pre-Caragh days. (Memo to the New York Times and Fox News: trans regret isn’t what you think it is.) However, they did prompt me to reconsider the “trans bingo” question that always scared me the most: “Is your life better now?” I dislike it for a couple of reasons. First, the answer is incredibly nuanced and depends entirely on what hour of the day I’m asked it. Second, contemplating the question is terrifying, because what if the answer is “no”? I’ve lost friends, money, status, reputation and so much more for what appears to be nothing more than a weird fetish to much of the world. Ironically, this was the same question I was asking others a few years ago, when I drove 10,000 miles across the country to meet a bunch of ordinary Americans who decided to run for president. You’ve probably seen one of these people before, when they’re featured in a 30-section segment at the end of the local news broadcast and the anchors chuckle at their ambition. I was writing a book about these people because I’d always been fascinated by these their inexplicable interest in doing something that will cost them their life savings — and potentially their friends and family and reputation — even though they knew there was no chance they’d win. Everyone I met on my trek, from the senior citizen Hell’s Angel in Idaho to the Florida Vietnam vet dying from Agent Orange exposure to the closeted Arkansas mom struggling to support her severely disabled son, thoughtfully explained that running for president wasn’t something they wanted to do. It was something they had to do. And when you have a desire like that burning in your heart, you’ll do anything to keep it ablaze. That’s how I think about being trans. So many people get so much wrong about what it means to be who I am. At its heart, transitioning isn’t about my sex bits or my wardrobe. It’s about self-determination. It means tuning out all the outside noise so I can hear that Whoville-sized voice inside of me screaming, “Help!” People can have endless misdirected conversations about what a woman really is, but at the end of the day, this journey is about becoming the person I have always known I am while I still have time to celebrate my life (which I’ve heard through the grapevine is actually kind of a good thing). Since I came out last year, I’ve been automatically scanning the eyes of every person within 50 feet of me in order to try and gauge what they’re thinking. I nervously hope I blend in, yet the whole point of transition is to show the world who I truly am. Wanting to be seen yet fearing that you’ll be noticed is incredibly stressful, even when spending time with people you know. I suppose the trick is to stop worrying about what others think, but that’s tough in a world where some folks resent people like me just drawing breath, and even allies still ask “trans bingo” questions. The superhuman self-confidence it can take to keep going has frequently eluded me over the last 12 months. As grateful as I am to now be living as my truest self, there are days when everything feels hard. Sometimes too hard. Still, there are moments that give me strength. Recently, when I was out on a walk, I encountered an older woman. She was being pushed along in a wheelchair by her nurse and, as I got closer, her shock of white hair and “you call that music?” glower reminded me of the elderly people in the audience at a MAGA rally. As I walked past her, I braced myself for a “Hello, sir,” or “What the hell are you?” I mumbled a “hello” toward the sidewalk and kept moving until I heard her call out, “I’m sorry to bother you, miss, but where did you get that coat? It’s beautiful!” I stopped, turned around and smiled, and we spent several minutes talking about my H&M overcoat and the approaching snowstorm. It was a quick, fairly surface-level chat, but it left me with this weird feeling that I think the kids are calling “hope.” I’d been judging this woman strictly by her appearance while I was fretting about the world doing the exact same thing to me. I realized that not everyone is out to get me and, on a larger scale, that so much of the hate that trans people face is because people don’t know anything about us. No, I shouldn’t have to educate people about my life and, no, people shouldn’t have to understand me, much less like me, to treat me fairly and humanely. But if I have the answers to someone’s questions — no matter how basic or complicated or misguided or exhausting — maybe I can help change some minds. Maybe I can be a good trans ambassador for those willing to learn, as well as for those who prefer to mock us on Netflix specials, and maybe that can do some good — not just for my community, but also for myself. As I walked away from this lovely woman, I was excited by my new point of view, and one word perfectly captured the feeling: Bingo! The next four years will change America forever.

The Manhattan district attorney has charged Trump with 34 criminal counts for allegedly falsifying business records to hide payments to conceal allegations of an extramarital affair with porn star Stormy Daniels. Hicks began crying as defense attorney Emil Bove started his cross-examination of the former spokesperson, who recalled Trump stating that his onetime personal attorney Michael Cohen had said he’d paid Daniels “out of the kindness of his own heart.” The move, she said, “would be out of character” for Cohen. On MSNBC, network host Lawrence O’Donnell noted that witnesses sometimes surprise themselves “as much as anyone else” when they get emotional. Weissmann said that he “didn’t really care” why Hicks was crying but rather cared about the substance of her testimony. “And I also thought about how her crying was kind of icing on the cake for the DA’s office,” Weissmann said. “I’m not in any way suggesting that they sought it, but her testimony was a body blow to the defense here because she put the guilty knowledge of the hush money payments into Donald Trump’s mouth, and she recounted that testimony to the jurors.” He went on to describe Hicks’ testimony as “devastating” in terms of evidence. “There’s no question that her crying would underscore to the jury, in my view, that she was not there because she wanted to help the government, that she had all loyalty for The Trump Organization,” explained Weissmann, referring to the former president’s company. Weissmann also characterized Hicks as a “very, very difficult witness for the defense” to overcome. The next four years will change America forever.

Though we can’t precisely quantify the effect of a grandmother’s love, a new study offers statistical proof that grandmothers do help children weather life’s hardships. Researchers at the University of Turku, in Finland, looked at data collected in a 2007 survey completed by 1,566 English and Welsh youth, ages 11 to 16. Youth who lived with their grandparents or who did not have at least one living grandparent were excluded from the study. The survey included a behavioral screening questionnaire to measure the young people’s emotional and behavioral problems. “Our main finding was that investment from maternal grandmothers seemed to be able to protect their grandchild from the negative influence of experiencing multiple adverse early-life experiences,” Samuli Helle, the lead researcher, told HuffPost. “Adverse childhood experiences” is a phrase psychologists and others use to describe “traumatic events or difficult circumstances that happened between the ages of 0 to 17,” Whitney Raglin Bignall, associate clinical director for the Kids Mental Health Foundation, explained to HuffPost. Examples, she said, might include “abuse, neglect, having an incarcerated caregiver, witnessing violence,” living with a caregiver with substance abuse issues or living in poverty or in an under-resourced setting. Though not every person who has an adverse childhood experience will go on to have issues, they are more likely to — and this likelihood increases with every additional trauma. In childhood, Bignall said, these experiences may “change brain development and impact their body’s response to stress,” “negatively impact their ability to develop healthy relationships,” “impact their ability to pay attention, learn and make decisions” and “lead to poor mental health.” In adulthood, a person is also more likely to experience mental health problems as well as substance use issues and chronic physical health concerns, such as diabetes, asthma and cancer. So having the ability to prevent adverse childhood experiences, or to blunt their effect somehow, can have a positive influence on a person for many years. This is where the grandmothers come in. Kids who had adverse childhood experiences were less likely to show the negative effects of these experiences as they grew if there was a maternal grandmother in their life who offered support, such as child care or financial assistance. Interestingly, the researchers found this protective, or “buffering,” effect only with maternal grandmothers, not other grandparents. Helle said that this finding was expected and in line with an evolutionary theory known as the grandmother hypothesis, which states that by helping to care for children, grandmothers increase their daughter’s fertility. Helle cautioned, however, that the University of Turku study reveals an average statistical pattern and that in real life there may be numerous examples of grandfathers or paternal grandmothers providing the same care to the same protective effect. Helle also noted that this buffering effect isn’t powerful enough to completely erase the impact of trauma. “Not even the highest level of investment from maternal grandmothers seen in these data was able to fully safeguard grandchildren from the negative effects of adverse early-life experiences,” he said. Because the effect of adverse events in childhood lasts for many years, so may a grandmother’s buffering. “By being able to protect their grandchildren from the ‘full impact’ of adverse life events, maternal grandmothers’ investment in their grandchildren can produce a long-lasting impact on the development and wellbeing of these children,” Helle said. One of the best ways to counter the harm of an adverse childhood experience is for the child to have a strong support system, Bignall said. “This includes having an ongoing and trusting relationship with an adult. An involved grandmother who is consistent, loving and available can be an essential buffer for children,” she explained. No matter what role you play in a child’s life, she recommended the following ways to support a child who is facing hardship: HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/13-going-on-30-anniversary-millennial-anxiety_l_6633e00ee4b05f96b017a1dd,This 1 Thing In '13 Going On 30' Is Still Too Real 20 Years Later,monica torres,5/4/2024,"When you turn the big “3-0,” you are going to hear many unsolicited messages about what you should have accomplished by now. Whether or not you ask for it, you’ll hear advice and admonishment from friends, families and pop culture about what this next decade should look like. And if you were a young millennial in the early 2000s, you likely got one of these messages of what a thirtysomething could and should be from the popular film “13 Going on 30.” In the 2004 romantic comedy, 13-year-old Jenna Rink (Christa B. Allen) makes a desperate wish to jump past the humiliation of puberty and be “30 and flirty and thriving,” which has now become the movie’s most famous line. Jenna gets what she asked for, although nothing turns out quite like she expected. Jenna wakes up and suddenly she is 30, as portrayed by Jennifer Garner. This older Jenna has all the status markers of thirtysomething success that young Jenna wanted. She lives in a luxury apartment filled with designer shoes and clothes, she has a “big-time magazine” job, is on a first-name basis with Madonna and has a buff boyfriend who’s a professional hockey player. But she also happens to be a “pretentious, conniving snake,” as one disgruntled colleague puts it. She is passing off a secretary’s idea as her own after firing her. She ignores professional boundaries and is having an affair with her co-worker’s husband in her office. Jenna’s ambition has made her well-known in her industry but a stranger to those her knew her growing up. As Jenna learns in the movie, you can be 30 and still be a hot mess. Her journey in the film is learning that the success you might end up treasuring the most is something that will not show up on a résumé. (In Jenna’s case, it’s regaining the relationship with her childhood best friend, Matty, as portrayed by Mark Ruffalo.) Although the movie is now 20 years old, “13 Going on 30” depicted a very real pressure to understand yourself by a certain date that is still relevant. Jenna strongly believes her teen angst will end when she turns 30 because society is telling her that’s when she should be “thriving.” And that’s a common belief young people still hold, said Kayleen Schaefer, a journalist and the author of “But You’re Still So Young: How Thirtysomethings Are Redefining Adulthood.” “I absolutely had the misconception, as Jenna does in the movie, that you hit your 30s and everything is figured out,” Schaefer said. “And your life is settled, and the hard stuff is over. And that is a lie.” In this way, the milestone of 30 still carries a heavy weight, especially if you are dissatisfied about what you have yet to do with your life. “There is this idea of taking your 20s to find yourself. But ... I think when you hit 30, you kind of are like, ‘Oh, OK, this is the decade where it gets serious and where I need to figure out my adulthood,’” Schaefer said. “But the thing is, adulthood doesn’t look the same for anybody.” For Schaefer’s book research, she found that 1950s sociologists had a checklist for what adulthood should entail: finish school, leave home, make your own money, marry and become a parent. Back then, you needed all five markers of success to be a real adult. And even though what’s on that cookie-cutter checklist has undoubtedly changed, many young people still have one. “I certainly had that belief that when I was in my 30s, I would just check all these things off, and I was really rocked when it didn’t work out like that because you actually have to go after these things,” Schaefer said about the checklist. “We have a lot of agency, which is amazing, but it’s also really hard.” In this way, it’s interesting how “13 Going on 30” depicted Jenna being unmarried, child-free and career-driven ― and a professional success as a result. Schaefer said it’s an example of how the 2004 film shows a shifting on-screen idea of what society expects from people in their 30s. So, yes, this can be a decade of transformation. But ultimately it helps to put your life in perspective. Each of us has our own path but no roadmap to consult. Schaefer gave the example of starting a new career in your 30s or making the decision to not have children as milestones you can give yourself. “Some people are in early stages of their careers. Some people are in late stages of their career, some people have two kids, some people are still deciding if they want to have kids or not,” she said. “Life isn’t just a straight line anymore.” “I absolutely had the misconception, as Jenna does in the movie, that you hit your 30s and everything is figured out.” Take what happens to Jenna. Once she realizes all the people “older Jenna” has betrayed, she returns to her parents’ home in need of comfort. The background music swells. Billy Joel croons “You’re so ambitious for a juvenile / But then if you’re so smart tell me / Why are you still so afraid?” Jenna is at her lowest, loneliest point. She climbs into her mom’s bed and apologizes for not visiting at Christmas. Her mom gives Jenna the pep talk she needs to keep going, and Jenna returns to New York City to make amends. Jenna discovers that these relationships ― not her résumé ― are what she values. Nurturing and investing in these acquaintances and friendships can actually end up creating the most meaningful memories of all. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

That can look like befriending your young neighbor who lives down the hall and learning her name. Or it can involve thanking your secretary and promoting her ideas. Or sometimes it’s simply sharing red Razzles with your old friend. “We need to remember what used to be good. If we don’t, we won’t recognize it even if it hits us between the eyes,” Jenna declares to her magazine colleagues as she pitches a redesign, to applause. They are taking her more seriously as someone to respect and admire, and so is Jenna. Ultimately, turning 30 has as much power as you give it. This decade will likely take you on a journey you did not intend to make, and that uncertainty can fill you with anxiety or excitement. It just depends on what you wish, as Jenna would tell you.

Plus, the flavors are straightforward enough for the occasional imbiber, but still sophisticated enough to appeal to a connoisseur.” For many people, this drink is all about good times. “Margaritas are for celebrating and getting together with friends,” said Ana Martínez, assistant director of food and beverage and agave spirits expert at Hilton Los Cabos Beach & Golf Resort. Yet as much as this is a cocktail that gives off laid-back, happy vibes, it also requires attention to detail and balance. “Creating a well-made margarita is similar to dancing the tango,” said Gabriela Abaroa, bartender at the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota. “The flavors are the complete opposite of one another, but they also complement each other perfectly.” And, like every good drink, this one should keep you wanting more. “A perfect margarita should hold you in a perpetual cycle of being refreshed, while causing you to become thirsty for another one,” said Maxwell Reis, beverage director at West Hollywood, California’s Gracias Madre. Our cocktail experts were firmly on team “rocks,” with none of them preferring a blended drink. “A truly well-constructed margarita becomes too diluted when blended with ice,” said food photographer, recipe developer and author Jackie Alpers. “I definitely prefer rocks to frozen, because you get a better sense of the details when you don’t blend it into a slush,” said Eric Trueheart, co-founder of Black Yeti Beverage. “Don’t get me wrong, the slurpee margarita is a fun drink, without a doubt. But if you want to taste something complex, interesting and delicious, rocks is the best way to go.” Before you even get started, pop your glassware in the freezer. “Just one minute in a freezer will keep your cocktail as cold as when you use warmed-up plates to keep meals warm,” said Jim Wrigley, beverage manager at the Cayman Islands Kimpton Seafire Resort & Spa’s Coccoloba Bar & Grill. As you’re getting ready to shake your cocktail, keep in mind that another factor separating a “meh” at-home drink from a “wow” mixologist-made one is the quality of the ice you’re using. “If your ice tastes like the other things in your freezer, you’re in for a not-so-tasty surprise,” Reis said. “I don’t think most at-home drinkers realize how much of that ice turns into water that becomes a large portion of your drink. And if you’re using flimsy ice, it will melt too quickly, and you’ll wind up with a watery marg that’s not cold enough.” Don’t worry too much about buying fancy bar equipment, because anything can be a shaker, experts said. “Shake it up in whatever’s easiest for you — a ‘official’ cocktail shaker, mason jar or blender,” said Valerie Alvarado, national portfolio agave ambassador at Pernod Ricard. It won’t take long, we promise: “Shake it 5 to 10 seconds, depending on how vigorous you want to be,” said Lime Fresh Mexican Grill’s beverage director, Ethan Albrecht-Carrié. And then, as fun as it is to act like Tom Cruise in “Cocktail,” stop. “Don’t overshake the cocktail, or you’ll water it down,” said Anthony Aviles, director of operations at the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota. The good news is that the alcohol you use in margaritas doesn’t need to be an over-the-top brand. “Choose a quality silver tequila, but don’t go crazy on price,” Bohen said. “Aged tequila is great to sip on its own, but in my opinion, it’s out of place in a margarita.” As you’re shopping, be sure to read labels carefully. “Tequila should be 100% agave,” Abaroa said. He’s a fan of blanco tequila, noting its “definitive, clean flavor.” The presence of agave in tequila is key, the experts said. “Any tequila that doesn’t say ‘100% agave’ is usually mixed in with other materials like syrups and extracts, so stay away from those,” said Xyza Dapal, food and beverage operations manager at Philadelphia’s Sabroso + Sorbo in The Notary Hotel. While you’re reading labels, take note of where the bottle was produced. “Tequilas from the Los Altos region, with oven-baked agaves, really bring the citrus, fruit and roasted agave flavor,” Alvarado said. Since it has just a few ingredients, you don’t need to cut corners with pre-made mixers. Those bright yellow and orange concoctions, Aviles said, are akin to “tempting the ulcer gods and dancing with diabetes.” Sweetener: Most recipes call for agave or simple syrup, and preferences varied among our experts. “Use good organic agave nectar,” Albrecht-Carrié said. “I prefer a light amber, because darker agave nectars tend to overpower and need to be diluted.” On the other hand, you’ve probably got what you need in your pantry to whip up simple syrup, if you’d rather use that. “I know some people like to use agave in margaritas, and there’s some poetry there, but I much prefer simple syrup,” Bohen said. “It really is simple to make. Use equal parts water and sugar, warmed just enough to dissolve the sugar.” Fresh juice: “I truly believe that without fresh lime juice, margaritas lack the tartness and acid that can only be attained from limes,” said cocktail influencer Carlos Ruiz. That fresh juice, it turns out, brings more to your drink than just its liquid. “Hand-juicing the limes will introduce the delicate oils which come from the peel,” said Stuart Yurczyk, co-founder, vice president and general manager at Mixly Cocktail Co. “Citrus oils have a fantastic aroma and add depth to your cocktails.” Once you’ve mastered the art of juicing limes, you may want to experiment with flavors by tossing in other fresh ingredients. “Adding freshly cut jalapeño, mango, strawberry, avocado or even cilantro will elevate your margarita,” Alvarado said. Salt: Whether you’re a salted-rim lover or hater, you can find a mixologist who shares your views. On the “pro” side, Wrigley is a believer. “Good salt is essential,” he said. “We use Maldon salt for the classics and homemade spicy salt, using local peppers, for our Spicy Margarita. Another fantastic element is Gusano salt, a Mexican salt using the ‘worm,’ a grub that feeds on ripe agaves. And we house-smoke salt, using local logwood, for our Mezcal Margaritas.” But not everyone is pro-salt. According to Carlos Kronen, founder and executive director of The Bartender Company, a mobile bartending service, it’s not a good idea. “Salt kills your palate, so a salted rim is only recommended when using low-end tequila,” he said. Somewhere in the middle of the salt debate is Alicia Perry, general manager at San Diego’s Polite Provisions. “When it comes to a salt rim, I always ask about the customer’s preference, because salt isn’t for everyone,” she said. “I personally prefer a partial salt rim, so I have a choice with each sip.” HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Perhaps try checking out local ingredients to make a margarita truly “yours.” Alpers mentioned a unique garnish she enjoyed at Tucson’s El Crisol mezcal bar. “It was finished with a dried lime slice and creosote leaves,” she said. “Those leaves come from a bush native to Tucson that releases a sweet smell whenever it rains — or when it’s floating on top of a drink. It was a perfect expression of the Tucson desert in every way.” Spicy touches: Once you’ve mastered the basics, you might want to incorporate other elements, like heat. “I remember the first time I had a spicy margarita, and it changed my entire understanding of what a margarita can be,” Yurczyk said. “I’m a Midwest native, so it didn’t take long for sweat to begin beading up around my nose and cheekbones, but I was addicted. I hadn’t realized it until that moment, but the tequila’s smoothness, lime juice’s acidity and orange liqueur’s sweetness were practically begging for the addition of spice.” “I was on my honeymoon a looong time ago in Puerto Vallarta and was served a pineapple chile margarita,” said Dora Stone, founder of the vegan Mexican recipe blog Dora’s Table. She remains a fan of margarita heat, and her blog includes a popular recipe for a Spicy Hibiscus Ice Margarita. Another tip from Stone: “Add candied jalapeños or chile powder on the rim, like the ever-so-popular mango chamoy margarita.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-briefed-us-plan-evacuate-palestinians-rafah_n_6635c272e4b0dfe17c0a83f0,Israel Has Briefed U.S. On Plan To Evacuate Palestinians Before Potential Rafah Operation,aamer madhani,5/4/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Israel this week briefed Biden administration officials on a plan to evacuate Palestinian civilians ahead of a potential operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah aimed at rooting out Hamas militants, according to U.S. officials familiar with the talks. The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity to speak about the sensitive exchange, said that the plan detailed by the Israelis did not change the U.S. administration’s view that moving forward with an operation in Rafah would put too many innocent Palestinian civilians at risk. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to carry out a military operation in Rafah despite warnings from President Joe Biden and other western officials that doing so would result in more civilian deaths and worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis. The Biden administration has said there could be consequences for Israel should it move forward with the operation without a credible plan to safeguard civilians. “Absent such a plan, we can’t support a major military operation going into Rafah because the damage it would do is beyond what’s acceptable,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said late Friday at the Sedona Forum, an event in Arizona hosted by the McCain Institute. Some 1.5 million Palestinians have sheltered in the southern Gaza city as the territory has been ravaged by the war that began on Oct. 7 after Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages. The United Nations humanitarian aid agency on Friday said that hundreds of thousands of people would be “at imminent risk of death” if Israel moves forward with the Rafah assault. The border city is a critical entry point for humanitarian aid and is filled with displaced Palestinians, many in densely packed tent camps. The officials added that the evacuation plan that the Israelis briefed was not finalized and both sides agreed to keep discussing the matter. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Friday that no “comprehensive” plan for a potential Rafah operation has been revealed by the Israelis to the White House. The operation, however, has been discussed during recent calls between Biden and Netanyahu as well as during recent virtual talks with top Israeli and U.S. national security officials. “We want to make sure that those conversations continue because it is important to protect those Palestinian lives — those innocent lives,” Jean-Pierre said. The revelation of Israel’s continued push to carry out a Rafah operation came as CIA director William Burns arrived Friday in Egypt, where negotiators are trying to seal a cease-fire accord between Israel and Hamas. Hamas is considering the latest proposal for a cease-fire and hostage release put forward by U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators, who are looking to avert the Rafah operation. They have publicly pressed Hamas to accept the terms of the deal that would lead to an extended cease-fire and an exchange of Israeli hostages taken captive on Oct. 7 and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Hamas has said it will send a delegation to Cairo in the coming days for further discussions on the offer, though it has not specified when. Israel, and its allies, have sought to increase pressure on Hamas on the hostage negotiation. Signaling that Israel continues to move forward with its planning for a Rafah operation could be a tactic to nudge the militants to finalize the deal. Netanyahu said earlier this week that Israeli forces would enter Rafah, which Israel says is Hamas’ last stronghold, regardless of whether a truce-for-hostages deal is struck. His comments appeared to be meant to appease his nationalist governing partners, and it was not clear whether they would have any bearing on any emerging deal with Hamas.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nypd-shooting-queens-win-rozario-killed_n_6635acb7e4b00b1eab5358e4,Mother Pled 'Don’t Shoot!' Before NYPD Officers Killed 19-Year-Old Son: Body Camera Footage,ap,5/4/2024,"NEW YORK (AP) — Police officers repeatedly fired their guns at a New York City man who had called 911 during a mental health crisis as his mother and younger brother begged officers not to shoot, bodycam video released Friday shows. Win Rozario’s family called on the officers to be fired and charged with murder after the footage of the killing was made public by the state’s attorney general. “The video that was released makes it clear that Win should be alive but the police came and murdered him in our kitchen without any care for him or us,” said a statement from Rozario’s mother, brother and father. “The police created a crisis and killed him in cold blood.” Attorney General Letitia James released footage from body cameras worn by Officers Salvatore Alongi and Matthew Cianfrocco as part of an investigation into the March 27 slaying in the family’s home in Queens. The attorney general is required by law to review any fatal encounter with law enforcement. Police commanders at the time said the officers had no choice but to shoot Rozario when he came at them with a pair of scissors. The scene depicted in two body camera videos is more complicated. Police arrive at the family’s Queens home shortly before 2 p.m. and are greeted at the door by Rozario’s 17-year-old brother, who says his sibling is “having an episode” and doesn’t know what he is doing. The officers enter the house. Rozario, standing in the kitchen, grabs a pair of scissors from a drawer then takes a few quick steps toward the officers, prompting one to fire a Taser. Rozario’s mother holds onto him protectively, then wrests the scissors away. The officers shout at the mother to let go of him, using a profanity as they order her to get out of their way. “Don’t shoot,” the mother, Notan Ava Costa, tells officers after she sets the scissors on a chair and steps aside. The situation quickly escalates as officers fire their Tasers again, and Rozario picks up the scissors and walks toward them. One officer then fires a handgun. It is unclear whether Rozario is hit. His mother rushes to him, followed by her younger son, who tries to pull her away. “Please do not shoot my mom!” Rozario’s brother cries. “Get her out of the way!” police shout. Rozario’s mother and brother fall to the floor. With the brother still holding onto his mother, Rozario, scissors in hand, appears to take one step toward police and is shot. He stops advancing. Three more shots are heard, each about a second apart, as Rozario flinches and staggers, his arms at his side but still holding the scissors. Eventually he falls forward to the floor. “Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!” his mother cries. The NYPD said in a statement that it is cooperating with the investigation. The officers are on modified assignment, meaning they are not carrying a firearm, the statement said. Chief of Patrol John Chell defended the officers’ actions, saying during a news conference on the day of the shooting that “this case was chaotic, fast-moving, and they had to defend themselves.” He said both officers had deployed their Tasers but did not say whether they both fired their guns.

(AP) — Israel-Hamas war demonstrations at the University of Mississippi turned ugly this week when one counter-protester appeared to make monkey noises and gestures at a Black student in a raucous gathering that was endorsed by a far-right congressman from Georgia. “Ole Miss taking care of business,” Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Collins wrote Friday on the social platform X with a link to the video showing the racist jeers. The Associated Press left voicemail messages for Collins on Friday at his offices in Georgia and Washington and sent an email to his spokesperson, asking for an explanation of what Collins meant. There was no immediate response. Ole Miss taking care of business. pic.twitter.com/JiL9hs2pHz The taunting brought sharp criticism on and off campus. “Students were calling for an end to genocide. They were met with racism,” James M. Thomas, a sociology professor at the University of Mississippi, wrote Friday on X. Students were calling for an end to genocide. They were met with racism https://t.co/qeFh5gnzof The Rev. Cornell William Brooks, a former president and CEO of the NAACP and professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, wrote on X that a white man mocking a Black woman as a monkey “isn’t about ‘Stand With Israel’ or ‘Free Palestine.’ This is protest as performative racism.” A White frat boy mocking a Black woman as a monkey isn’t about “Stand With Israel” or “Free Palestine.” This is protest as performative racism. The law may allow you to sound like an ape, but you don’t have to be a racist jackass. https://t.co/8s6EJwVHkb Collins was first elected to Congress in 2022 and made several social media posts criticizing campus protests. Nobody was arrested during the demonstration Thursday at the University of Mississippi, where hecklers vastly outnumbered war protesters. According to a count by AP, more than 2,400 arrests have occurred on 46 U.S. university or college campuses since April 17 during demonstrations against the war. The student newspaper, The Daily Mississippian, reported about 30 protesters on the Oxford campus billed themselves as UMiss for Palestine. Videos and photos from the event showed the protesters were in a grassy area near the main library, blocked off by barriers erected by campus security. They chanted “Free, free Palestine,” and carried Palestinian flags and signs with slogans including, “Stop the Genocide” and “U.S. bombs take Palestine lives.” Student journalist Stacey J. Spiehler shot video that showed campus police officers and the dean of students standing between anti-war protesters and hecklers. After the Black woman protesting the war had what appeared to be a heated exchange of words with several white hecklers, one of the men made the monkey gestures and noises at her. About 76% of the university’s students were white and about 11% were Black in 2022-23, the most recent data available on the school’s website. University of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn Boyce said the school is committed to people expressing their views. He said some statements made on campus Thursday were “offensive and unacceptable.” In another statement Friday, Boyce said one “student conduct investigation” had been opened and university leaders were “working to determine whether more cases are warranted.” “To be clear, people who say horrible things to people because of who they are will not find shelter or comfort on this campus,” he said. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves reposted a video on X that showed counter-protesters on the campus singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” “Warms my heart,” Reeves wrote. “I love Mississippi!” The ‘protests’ at Ole Miss today.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/united-states-gaza-famine-cindy-mccain_n_66359ec1e4b00b1eab53586c,Top U.N. Official Cindy McCain Says Northern Gaza Is Now In 'Full-Blown Famine',"ellen knickmeyer , russ bynum",5/3/2024,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A top U.N. official said Friday that hard-hit northern Gaza was now in “full-blown famine” after more than six months of war between Israel and Hamas and severe Israeli restrictions on food deliveries to the Palestinian territory. Cindy McCain, the American director of the U.N. World Food Program, became the most prominent international official so far to declare that trapped civilians in the most cut-off part of Gaza had gone over the brink into famine. “It’s horror,” McCain told NBC’s “Meet the Press” in an interview to air Sunday. “There is famine — full-blown famine — in the north, and it’s moving its way south.” She said a cease-fire and a greatly increased flow of aid through land and sea routes was essential to confronting the growing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, home to 2.3 million people. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which controls entrance into Gaza and says it is beginning to allow in more food and other humanitarian aid through land crossings. The panel that serves as the internationally recognized monitor for food crises said in March that northern Gaza was on the brink of famine and likely to experience it in May. Since March, northern Gaza had not received anything like the aid needed to stave off famine, a U.S. Agency for International Development humanitarian official for Gaza told The Associated Press. The panel’s next update will not come before this summer. The USAID official said on-the-ground preparations for a new U.S.-led sea route were on track to bring in more food — including treatment for hundreds of thousands of starving children — by early or mid-May. That’s when the American military expects to finish building a floating pier to receive the shipments. Ramping up the delivery of aid on the planned U.S.-backed sea route will be gradual as aid groups test the distribution and security arrangements for relief workers, the USAID official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, citing security concerns accompanying the official’s work on conflicts. They were some of the agency’s first comments on the status of preparations for the Biden administration’s $320 million Gaza pier project, for which USAID is helping coordinate on-the-ground security and distribution. At a factory in rural Georgia on Friday, USAID Administrator Samantha Power pointed to the food crises in Gaza and other parts of the world as she announced a $200 million investment aimed at increasing production of emergency nutritional paste for starving children under 5. Power spoke to factory workers, peanut farmers and local dignitaries sitting among pallets of the paste at the Mana nonprofit in Fitzgerald. It is one of two factories in the U.S. that produces the nutritional food, which is used in clinical settings and made from ground peanuts, powdered milk, sugar and oil, ready to eat in plastic pouches resembling large ketchup packets. “This effort, this vision meets the moment,” Power said. “And it could not be more timely, more necessary or more important.” Under pressure from the U.S. and others, Israeli officials in recent weeks have begun slowly reopening some border crossings for relief shipments. But aid coming through the sea route, once it’s operational, still will serve only a fraction — half a million people — of those who need help in Gaza. Aid organizations including USAID stress that getting more aid through border crossings is essential to staving off famine. Children under 5 are among the first to die when wars, droughts or other disasters curtail food. Hospital officials in northern Gaza reported the first deaths from hunger in early March and said most of the dead were children. Power said the U.N. has called for 400 metric tons of the nutritional paste “in light of the severe hunger that is pervading across Gaza right now, and the severe, acute humanitarian crisis.” USAID expects to provide a quarter of that, she said. Globally, she said at the Georgia factory, the treatment made there “will save untold lives, millions of lives.” USAID is coordinating with the World Food Program and other humanitarian partners and governments on security and distribution for the pier project, while U.S. military forces finish building it. President Joe Biden, under pressure to do more to ease the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza as the U.S. provides military support for Israel, announced the project in early March. U.S. Central Command said in a statement Friday that offshore assembly of the floating pier has been temporarily paused due to high winds and sea swells, which caused unsafe conditions for soldiers. The partially built pier and the military vessels involved have gone to Israel’s Port of Ashdod, where the work will continue. A U.S. official said the high seas will delay the installation for several days, possibly until later next week. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operation details, said the pause could last longer if the bad weather continues because military personnel and divers have to get into the water for the final installation. The struggles this week with the first aid delivery through a newly reopened land corridor into north Gaza underscored the uncertainty about security and the danger still facing relief workers. Israeli settlers blocked the convoy before it crossed Wednesday. Once inside Gaza, the convoy was commandeered by Hamas militants, before U.N. officials reclaimed it. In Gaza, the nutritional treatment for starving children is most urgently needed in the northern part of the Palestinian territory. Civilians have been cut off from most aid supplies, bombarded by Israeli airstrikes and driven into hiding by fighting. Acute malnutrition rates there among children under 5 have surged from 1% before the war to 30% five months later, the USAID official said. The official called it the fastest such climb in hunger in recent history, more than in grave conflicts and food shortages in Somalia or South Sudan. One of the few medical facilities still operating in northern Gaza, Kamal Adwan hospital, is besieged by parents bringing in thousands of children with malnutrition for treatment, the official said. Aid officials believe many more starving children remain unseen and in need, with families unable to bring them through fighting and checkpoints for care. Saving the gravely malnourished children in particular requires both greatly increased deliveries of aid and sustained calm in fighting, the official said, so that aid workers can set up treatment facilities around the territory and families can safely bring children in for the sustained treatment needed. ___ Bynum reported from Fitzgerald, Georgia.

David Trone, a contender for the state’s open Senate seat, after he referred to supporters of his Democratic primary opponent as “low-level.” Trone made the comments during an NBC segment on Wednesday comparing Trone and his chief rival, Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks. “The people that know [Prince George’s County] the best, ironically, all came to us,” Trone told an NBC reporter of his primary endorsers. “But not a majority,” the reporter countered. “The people in Prince George’s County who stuck with her are the low-level folks,” Trone said. “The top-level folks — that’s called the attorney general, I think. I think that’s called the state’s attorney — I think. I think that’s called the senior [state] senator — I think. I think they’re the top-level folks.” The tit-for-tat over endorsements comes after former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski this week endorsed Alsobrooks, adding to her roster of top Democratic backers that also includes Gov. Wes Moore and Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Trone’s campaign in a statement reiterated his support among some Prince George’s County officials, and noted: “While David has focused on the ways that Washington is broken and proposed bold ideas that can fix Washington, our opponents and their supporters have fixated on which politicians have what status.” Nearly two dozen local elected leaders plan to release statements Saturday calling out Trone for the “low-level” remark, including county council members, Maryland delegates and state senators from Alsobrooks’ home county and surrounding areas, HuffPost has learned. “By calling a majority of the county council, seven of our eight state senators, our state treasurer and a sitting member of the U.S. Congress ‘low-level people,’ David Trone has insulted every man, woman and child that calls Prince George’s County home,” reads the text that a number of Prince George’s officials plan to blast out in press releases and social media posts. “David Trone, we aren’t a low-level county. … We may not be a billionaire liquor store owner like you, but you’re going to find out the nearly one million residents that call Prince George’s County home will play a decisive role in electing our next U.S. senator. Her name will be Angela Alsobrooks.” Joseline Peña-Melnyk, a Maryland state delegate backing Trone — whom the campaign suggested HuffPost reach out to — said she doesn’t believe that Trone meant anything by the “low-level” remark. “We’re at a point in this race where tempers are running high ... people are tired,” Peña-Melnyk said, suggesting Alsobrooks is the more “divisive” candidate in the primary. But it’s the latest example of Trone’s words getting him in trouble. Last month, Trone apologized for accidentally using a racial slur in a congressional hearing. He also referred to several Black House colleagues as “great diversity candidates” during a debate. Maryland’s Senate race is on track to become one of the most expensive races in Senate history, with Trone — the wealthy founder of liquor store chain Total Wine & More — spending $57 million in the primary alone. He’s used some of that money to launch an attack ad against Alsobrooks, featuring Black officials from Prince George’s questioning her qualifications for Senate.

But it happened to the two of us.” Wade continued, not confirming whether he regretted the relationship with Willis: “I regret that that private matter became the focal point of this very important prosecution. This is a very important case.” “I hate that my personal life has begun to overshadow the true issues in the case,” he said. In January, rumors began that Wade and Willis were in a romantic relationship when a lawyer for one of Trump’s co-defendants alleged that Willis benefitted from Wade’s hiring because Wade took Willis on dates. Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee found no evidence that supported this claim, however, he said Willis could continue prosecuting the case as long as Wade stepped down, which he did. In March, Trump and his team asked if they could appeal the judge’s decision, but the court hasn’t decided if they’ll allow an appeal. Wade told ABC News that he and Willis thought about pausing the relationship until the case was over, but that “the feelings are so strong.” The next four years will change America forever.

On Sunday, the producers shared a statement on X, formerly called Twitter, that they would not replace Perdomo, who died in a motorcycle crash on March 30. He was 27. “As we continue to navigate the tragic loss of Chance Perdomo, everyone at ‘Gen V’ is determined to find the best way to pay respect to his memory,” the statement said. “We won’t be recasting the role, because no one can replace Chance.

In “Gen V,” a spinoff of “The Boys,” Perdomo starred as fan favorite Andre Anderson, an aspiring superhero at Godolkin University who can control magnetism and magnetic fields with his hands. He was also known for his role as Ambrose Spellman in Netflix’s horror series “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.” In a previous joint statement following his death, the “Gen V” cast mourned Perdomo’s passing. “Our hearts are with Chance’s loved ones as we grieve this shocking loss.

It seems poor Cricket isn’t the only dog Gov. Kristi Noem (R-S.D.) has had in her sights. During a heated interview on “Face the Nation” Sunday, Noem suggested that President Joe Biden’s notoriously nip-happy German shepherd, Commander, should have met the same fate as her late wirehaired pointer, which she wrote about killing in her forthcoming book, “No Going Back.” Host Margaret Brennan asked Noem if she was trying to “look tough” with her talk of culling canines and highlighted a menacing reference the South Dakota governor makes to Commander near the end of her memoir. Commander was moved from the White House last fall after repeated incidents with Secret Service agents; in February, internal documents showed the dog was involved in at least 24 incidents between October 2022 and July 2023. “You say the very first thing you would do if you got to the White House that was different from Joe Biden, is you’d make sure Joe Biden’s dog was nowhere on the grounds. ‘Commander say hello to Cricket.’ Are you doing this to try to look tough?” Brennan asked. “Do you still think that you have a shot at being a VP?” Host: At the end of the book you say, the very first thing you would do if you got to the WH that was different from Biden, is you would make sure Biden's dog was nowhere on the grounds. Commander say hello to cricket. Are you trying to look tough? pic.twitter.com/oAlQBHDCmd Noem turned the question back on Brennan, saying, “Joe Biden’s dog has attacked 24 Secret Service people. So how many people is enough people to be attacked and dangerously hurt before you make a decision on a dog?” After Brennan reminded the governor that the dog no longer lives at the White House, Noem insisted that “the President should be held accountable” for the German shepherd’s actions. “You’re saying he should be shot?” Brennan asked. Sidestepping the question, Noem tried to compare her decision to put down her dog to making tough choices to protect her home state. “I would say about Republicans criticizing me, these are the same Republicans who have criticized me during COVID,” she said. “They’ve criticized me when I’ve made other decisions in South Dakota to protect my state.” In “No Going Back,” Noem wrote about shooting her “less than worthless” hunting dog, Cricket, explaining how she “hated” the 14-month-old pup.

They get welfare to vote, and then they cheat on top of that — they cheat.” Trump’s comments are similar to something Romney was caught on tape telling wealthy donors at a private fundraiser in 2012. The then-Republican presidential nominee said that because 47% of Americans don’t pay income tax, they would automatically vote for then-Democratic President Barack Obama. An echo of Romney's 47 percent comment from Trump to donors last night: “When you are Democrat, you start off essentially at 40 percent because you have civil service, you have the unions and you have welfare...."" 1/ “There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,” Romney said at the time in a video obtained by Mother Jones. “All right, there are 47% who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it — that that’s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. ... These are people who pay no income tax.” ″[M]y job is not to worry about those people,” he continued. “I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.” After Romney’s comments were made public, he released a political ad saying he cares about poor and middle-class families. In 2016, he told CNN that his remarks “didn’t come out right.” According to the book “Romney: A Reckoning,” a biography of the politician released last year, the 47% video drove him into a deep depression.

The “humiliating” meme kicked off years ago after Lipa posted her 2018 BRIT Awards performance of “New Rules” on YouTube. In the comments section, a viewer chided her writing, “I love her lack of energy, go girl give us nothing!” which spawned the viral phrase. Fans quickly ran with the cheeky comment, subsequently using it to describe various low-energy performances from other musicians. Unfortunately for Lipa, the meme attached itself to her longer than she hoped after clips of her looking bored while doing an aggressive hip swivel during a separate performance sparked more online hate. In a new interview with The Guardian, the Albanian singer opened up about how the “hurtful” incident left her in shambles. “When people took that snippet of me dancing online and just turned it into a meme, and then when I won the Best New Artist Grammy and people were like, ‘She’s not deserving of it, she’s got no stage presence, she’s not going to stick around,’” she explained. “Those things were hurtful. It was humiliating.” Lipa said she even had to “take myself off Twitter” because she was devastated that “people were picking everything apart that I’d been working on, and I had to learn all that in front of everyone.” The pop star, now 28, said that being in her early 20s at the time of the failed performance required her to develop unshakable confidence. “In the public eye, I was figuring out who I was as an artist, as a performer,” she recalled. “All that was happening while I was 22, 23 years old and still growing up. You have to build tough skin. You have to be resilient.” According to Lipa, it took her two years to get over the embarrassing ordeal. But she says she “got a real kick out” of eventually silencing her haters with a do-over performance. “It was November 2019 when ‘Don’t Start Now’ came out, and it dawned on me that I’m finally going to get up and dance in front of people after what they have thought about me for so long,” she shared. “And I went back, did that performance, and everyone was like, ‘Oh, we were wrong.’ I got a real kick out of that.” Lipa previously defended her dance moves, telling Rolling Stone earlier this year that she was too busy to hone in on her dancing skills at the time.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/madonna-free-concert-rio-brazil_n_6637de3be4b001bbb51008af,Madonna Attracts 1.6 Million Fans To Massive Free Concert In Rio De Janeiro,eléonore hughes,5/5/2024,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Madonna put on a free concert on Copacabana beach Saturday night, turning Rio de Janeiro’s vast stretch of sand into an enormous dance floor teeming with a multitude of her fans. It was the last show of The Celebration Tour, her first retrospective, which kicked off in October in London. The “Queen of Pop” began the show with her 1998 hit “Nothing Really Matters.” Huge cheers rose from the buzzing, tightly packed crowd, pressed up against the barriers. Others held house parties in brightly lighted apartments and hotels overlooking the beachfront. Helicopters and drones flew overhead, and motorboats and sailboats anchored off the beach filled the bay. “Here we are in the most beautiful place in the world,” Madonna, 65, told the crowd. Pointing out the ocean view, the mountains and the Christ the Redeemer statue overlooking the city, she added: “This place is magic.” Madonna performed her classic hits, including “Like A Virgin” and “Hung Up.” For the introduction to “Like A Prayer,” her head was completely covered in a black cape, a rosary gripped in her hands. The star paid an emotional tribute to “all the bright lights” lost to AIDS as she sang “Live to Tell,” with black and white photos of people who died from the illness flashing behind her. Later, she was joined on stage by Brazilian artists Anitta and Pabllo Vittar. Rio spent the last few days readying itself for the performance. An estimated 1.6 million people attended the show, G1 reported, citing Rio City Hall’s tourism agency. That is more than 10 times Madonna’s record attendance of 130,000 at Paris’ Parc des Sceaux in 1987. Madonna’s official website hyped the show as the biggest ever in her four-decade career. In recent days, the buzz was palpable. Fans milled outside the stately, beachfront Copacabana Palace hotel, where Madonna is staying, hoping to catch a glimpse of the pop star. During the sound check on the stage set up in front of the hotel, they danced on the sand. By midday Saturday, fans crowded in front of the hotel. A white-bearded man carried a sign saying, “Welcome Madonna you are the best I love you.” Flags with “Madonna” printed against a background of Copacabana’s iconic black and white waved sidewalk pattern hung from balconies. The area was packed with street vendors and concert attendees kitted out in themed T-shirts, sweating under a baking sun. “Since Madonna arrived here, I’ve been coming every day with this outfit to welcome my idol, my diva, my pop queen,” said Rosemary de Oliveira Bohrer, 69, who sported a gold-colored cone bra and a black cap. “It’s going to be an unforgettable show here in Copacabana,” said Oliveira Bohrer, a retired civil servant who lives in the area. Eighteen sound towers were spread along the beach to ensure that all attendees can hear the hits. Her two-hour show started at 10:37 p.m. local time, nearly 50 minutes behind schedule. City Hall produced a report in April estimating that the concert would vinject 293 million reals ($57 million) into the local economy. Hotel capacity was expected to reach 98% in Copacabana, according to Rio’s hotel association. Fans hailing from across Brazil and even Argentina and France sought out Airbnbs for the weekend, the platform said in a statement. Rio’s international airport had forecast an extra 170 flights during May 1-6, from 27 destinations, City Hall said in a statement. “It’s a unique opportunity to see Madonna, who knows if she’ll ever come back,” said Alessandro Augusto, 53, who flew in from Brazil’s Ceara state — approximately 2,500 kilometers (1,555 miles) from Rio. “Welcome Queen!” read Heineken ads plastered around the city, the lettering above an image of an upturned bottle cap resembling a crown. Heineken wasn’t the only company seeking to profit from the excitement. Bars and restaurants prepared “Like a Virgin” cocktails. A shop in the downtown neighborhood famed for selling Carnival attire completely reinvented itself, stocking its shelves with Madonna-themed costumes, fans, fanny packs and even underwear. Organization of the mega-event was similar to New Year’s Eve, when millions of people gather on Copacabana for its fireworks display, local authorities said. That annual event often produces widespread thefts and muggings, and there was some concern such problems might occur at Madonna’s show. Rio state’s security plan included the presence of 3,200 military personnel and 1,500 civilian police officers on stand by. In the lead-up to the concert, Brazil’s navy inspected vessels that wished to position themselves offshore to follow the show. A number of huge concerts have taken place on Copacabana beach before, including a 1994 New Year’s Eve show by Rod Stewart that drew more than 4 million fans and was the biggest free rock concert in history, according to Guinness World Records. Many of those spectators also came to see Rio’s fireworks show, though, so a more fitting comparison might be to the Rolling Stones in 2006, which saw 1.2 million people crowd onto the sand, according to Rio’s military police, the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo reported at the time. Ana Beatriz Soares, a fan who was at Copacabana on Saturday, said Madonna has made her mark across the decades. “Madonna had to run so that today’s pop artists could walk. That’s why she’s important, because she serves as an inspiration for today’s pop divas,” Soares said. “And that’s 40 years ago. Not 40 days, 40 months. It’s 40 years,” she said. ___ AP video journalist Douglas Engle contributed to this report.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernard-hill-actor-dead_n_6637d860e4b0e44cfb120087,'Lord Of The Rings' And 'Titanic' Actor Bernard Hill Dead At 79,brian melley,5/5/2024,"LONDON (AP) — Actor Bernard Hill, who delivered a rousing cry before leading his people into battle in “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” and went down with the ship as the captain in “Titanic,” has died. Hill, 79, passed away Sunday morning, agent Lou Coulson said. Hill joined “The Lord Of The Rings” franchise in the second film of the trilogy, 2002’s “The Two Towers,” as Théoden, King of Rohan. The following year, he reprised the role in “Return of the King,” a movie that won 11 Oscars. In one of the film’s most memorable scenes, Hill’s character fires up his overmatched forces by delivering a battle cry on horseback that sends his troops thundering downhill toward the enemy and his own imminent death. “Arise, arise, riders of Théoden!” Hill hollers. “Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered! A sword day, a red day, ere the sun rises! Ride now! Ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin and the world’s ending! Death! Death! Death!” In “Titanic,” Hill played Captain Edward Smith, one of the only characters based on a real person in the 1997 tragic romance starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The film also won 11 Academy Awards. As the doomed ship takes on water, Hill’s character silently retreats to the wheelhouse. As the cabin groans under the pressure of the waves, he takes a final breath and grabs the wheel as water bursts through the windows. Hill first made a name for himself as Yosser Hughes in “Boys From the Blackstuff,” a 1982 British TV miniseries about five unemployed men. He was nominated for an award in 1983 from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for the role, and the show won the BAFTA for best drama series. His death came the same day the second series of the BBC drama “The Responder” was to air, in which he played the father of the show’s star, Martin Freeman.

Tim Scott wouldn’t give a straight answer when asked if he would commit to accepting the result of the 2024 presidential election ― no matter who wins. During an appearance Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the South Carolina Republican repeatedly deflected questions about the election outcome, telling moderator Kristen Welker there won’t be any issues since former President Donald Trump is already the inevitable victor. “At the end of the day, the 47th president of the United States will be President Donald Trump,” said Scott, who is reportedly being considered as a vice presidential pick. Asked for a simple yes or no, he replied, “That is my statement.” Welker pressed several more times before Scott told her, “The American people will make the decision, and the decision will be for President Trump.” More back and forth did nothing to move the politician, who went on to accuse the left-leaning television network of bias. “This is why so many Americans believe that NBC is an extension of the Democratic Party,” Scott claimed. “At the end of the day, I said what I said,” he went on. “I know that the American people, their voices will be heard, and I believe that President Trump will be our next president. It’s that simple.” Trump, who continues to claim the 2020 election results were rigged, has also left open the possibility of challenging this cycle’s winner. “If everything’s honest, I’d gladly accept the results,” he told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel earlier this month. “If it’s not, you have to fight for the right of the country.” The next four years will change America forever.

In a new interview with The Wall Street Journal, the “Barbie” actor, 43, revealed that he no longer picks up “dark” roles in Hollywood to keep his family’s mental health intact. The Oscar nominee shares two young daughters, Esmeralda Amada and Amada Lee, with wife and fellow actor, Eva Mendes. “I don’t really take roles that are going to put me in some kind of dark place,” Gosling told the outlet in the story published Thursday. “This moment is what I feel like trying to read the room at home and feel like what is going to be best for all of us.” “The decisions I make, I make them with Eva, and we make them with our family in mind first,” he added. The Canadian actor went on to reflect on how starring in 2016’s “La La Land” just two years after he expanded his family was the starting point of his career shift. “I think ‘La La Land’ was the first. It was just sort of like, ‘Oh, this will be fun for [my daughters], too, because even though they’re not coming to set, we’re practicing piano every day or we’re dancing or we’re singing,’” he explained.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kristi-noem-addresses-kim-jong-un-book-anecdote_n_6637a15de4b03d2898dd3fbe,Kristi Noem Refuses To Deny Dubious Kim Jong Un Anecdote From Her Book,kelby vera,5/5/2024,"Kristie Noem dodged questions about whether she ever met Kim Jong Un during a weekend appearance on “Face the Nation.” The Republican South Dakota governor seemed unwilling to admit her error when CBS’ Margaret Brennan asked Noem about a dubious anecdote in her forthcoming book, “No Going Back,” on Sunday. The book has been under heavy scrutiny since a report from The Dakota Scout cast doubt on a passage where Noem reflects on when she was a member of the House Armed Services Committee, writing in “No Going Back”: Through my tenure on the House Armed Services Committee, I had the chance to travel to many countries to meet with world leaders. I remember when I met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. I’m sure he underestimated me, having no clue about my experience staring down little tyrants (I’d been a children’s pastor, after all). A high-level Capitol Hill staffer who used to work with Noem when she was a congresswoman told the Scout that the story was “bullshit,” and experts on North Korea said there wasn’t “any conceivable way” a single junior member of Congress would ever meet solo with Kim. When Brennan asked Noem, point blank, if she’d met the North Korean leader, she refused to fess up. “As soon as this was brought to my attention, I certainly made some changes and looked at this passage,” the governor said, adding, “I’ve met with many, many world leaders. I’ve traveled around the world.” “So you did not meet with Kim Jong Un? That’s what you’re saying,” Brennan pressed. “I’ve met with many, many world leaders. Many world leaders. I’ve traveled around the world,” Noem said. Trying to give her comments the air of plausibility, the politician went on to say, “I’m not going to talk about my specific meetings with world leaders. I’m just not going to do that.” Brennan wondered who Noem had confused for Un, noting how she’d never been to North Korea, and how South Korea’s leader was a woman during Noem’s tenure on the House Armed Services Committee. Noem countered, saying she had visited the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea but that there were “some specifics” she was “not willing to share with you.” Lol. Yikes pic.twitter.com/xLGKzfWbxn Unrelenting, Brennan asked how such specific references to “little tyrant” Un made it into the book, even after Noem clearly read the manuscript. “Do you have a question for me, Margaret?” Noem snapped, later calling Brennan’s line of questions what’s “so discouraging about politics in the media today.” “I’m just asking for why ― why am I being treated differently than every other person that you’ve interviewed?” she asked. “I’m quoting you,” the reporter replied. On Friday, Noem’s camp addressed “small errors” in the book in a statement to HuffPost. “It was brought to our attention that the upcoming book ‘No Going Back’ has two small errors,” spokesperson Ian Fury said. “This has been communicated to the ghostwriter and editor.” “Kim Jong Un was included in a list of world leaders and shouldn’t have been. ... The book has not been released yet, and all future editions will be corrected.” Noem has already been under fire for writing about how she killed her young dog, Cricket, due to his bad hunting behavior. “No Going Back” is due out May 7.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/usc-student-protesters-leave-encampment-police-israel-gaza_n_6637ad09e4b001bbb50ff89c,USC Protesters Forced To Leave Amid Police Raid On Rebuilt Encampment,"philip marcelo , denise la voie",5/5/2024,"Students protesting the ongoing war in Gaza left a pro-Palestinian encampment at the University of Southern California early Sunday after they were surrounded by police and told they could face arrest if they didn’t go. The move, days before commencement was set to begin, came after the university said campus safety officers, assisted by the Los Angeles Police Department, were clearing the area. “If you are in the center of campus, please leave. People who don’t leave could be arrested,” USC said on the social media platform X at about 4:15 a.m. Livestream video from student journalists showed the encampment had emptied out as police formed a line to move remaining protesters away and stop people from re-entering. The encampment had restarted after the LAPD first arrested 93 people on April 24. The atmosphere on the private university campus had largely remained calm since then, while attention turned to arrests at the University of California, Los Angeles. In Boston, commencement for Northeastern University began peacefully Sunday at Fenway Park. Some students waved Palestinian flags, but those were dotted among flags from India, the U.S. and other nations. Graduate students went first, with undergraduate commencement in the afternoon. Last month, police arrested about 100 protesters at Northeastern when they broke up an encampment on the Boston campus. At the University of Virginia, 25 people were arrested Saturday for trespassing after police clashed with pro-Palestinian protesters who refused to remove tents from campus, and demonstrators at the University of Michigan chanted anti-war messages and waved flags during commencement ceremonies. At the Art Institute of Chicago campus, police cleared a pro-Palestinian encampment hours after it was set up Saturday and arrested 68 people. Students, who attend classes in downtown buildings surrounding the museum, want the school to divest from companies profiting from the Israel-Hamas war, among other demands. The institute said the protest grew disruptive and Chicago police were called. Those arrested will be charged with criminal trespass to property, police said. USC, a private university, has been the subject of student protests over the war as well as the administration’s decision to cancel a commencement speech by the valedictorian, a Muslim student who had expressed support for Palestinians. The university made that decision last month, citing safety concerns after receiving threats. Some Jewish groups had criticized the student’s selection as speaker. Administrators later canceled the entire main-stage commencement planned for May 10, when 65,000 people were expected to gather. Other commencement activities, including graduation ceremonies for individual schools and colleges, are still scheduled from Thursday through Sunday. Access to the private campus has largely been restricted for people not affiliated with the university since late April. In Charlottesville, Virginia, student demonstrators began their protest on a lawn outside the school chapel Tuesday. On Saturday, video from WVAW-TV showed police in heavy gear and holding shields lined up on campus. Protesters chanted “Free Palestine,” and university police said on X that an “unlawful assembly” had been declared. As police moved in, students were pushed to the ground, pulled by their arms and sprayed with a chemical irritant, Laura Goldblatt, an assistant professor of English and global studies who has been helping student demonstrators, told The Washington Post. The university administration said in a statement the demonstrators were told the tents and canopies they erected were prohibited under school policy and were asked to remove them. Virginia State Police were asked to help with enforcement, the university said. It was the latest clash in several tense and sometimes violent weeks at U.S. colleges and universities that have seen dozens of protests and hundreds of arrests at demonstrations over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war; many of the encampments have been dismantled by police. Tent encampments of protesters urging universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread in a student movement unlike any other this century. Some schools reached agreements with protesters to end the demonstrations and reduce the possibility of disrupting final exams and commencements. The Associated Press has recorded at least 61 incidents since April 18 in which arrests were made at protests, with more than 2,400 people being arrested on 47 campuses. The figures are based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies. The University of Michigan was among the schools bracing for protests during commencement this weekend, including Indiana University, Ohio State University and Northeastern. More are slated in the coming weeks. In Ann Arbor, there was a protest at the beginning of the event at Michigan Stadium. About 75 people, many wearing traditional Arabic kaffiyehs along with their graduation caps, marched up the main aisle toward the stage. They chanted “Regents, regents, you can’t hide! You are funding genocide!” while holding signs, including one that read: “No universities left in Gaza.” Overhead, planes pulled banners with competing messages. “Divest from Israel now! Free Palestine!” and “We stand with Israel. Jewish lives matter.” Officials said no one was arrested, and the protest didn’t seriously interrupt the nearly two-hour event, attended by tens of thousands of people, some of them waving Israeli flags. At Indiana University, protesters urged supporters to wear their kaffiyehs and walk out during remarks by school President Pamela Whitten on Saturday evening. The Bloomington campus designated a protest zone outside Memorial Stadium, where the ceremony was held. At Princeton, in New Jersey, 18 students launched a hunger strike to try to push the university to divest from companies tied to Israel. One of them, senior David Chmielewski said in an email that the strike started Friday morning with participants consuming water only, and it will continue until administrators meet with students about demands including amnesty from criminal and disciplinary charges for protesters. Other demonstrators are participating in “solidarity fasts” lasting 24 hours, Chmielewski said. Students at other colleges, including Brown and Yale, launched similar hunger strikes this year before the more recent wave of demonstraitons. The protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants. ___ Marcelo reported from New York. Lavoie reported from Richmond, Virginia.

Ukraine’s air force said that Russia had launched 24 Shahed drones overnight, of which 23 were shot down. Six people, including a child, were wounded in a drone strike in the eastern Kharkiv region, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Ten more were wounded in an airstrike Sunday afternoon on the Kharkiv regional capital, also called Kharkiv, Syniehubov said, adding the city was attacked by an aerial bomb. Fires broke out when debris from drones that were shot down fell on buildings in the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk region. No casualties were reported. The Russian Ministry of Defense announced Sunday that its troops had taken control of the village of Ocheretyne, which has been in the crosshairs of Russian forces in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Drone footage obtained by The Associated press showed the village battered by fighting. Not a single person is seen in the footage obtained late Friday, and no building in Ocheretyne appears to have been left untouched by the fighting. Officials in Kyiv urged residents to follow Orthodox Easter services online due to safety concerns. Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv city administration, warned that “even on such bright days of celebration, we can expect evil deeds from the aggressor.” In his Easter address, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on Ukrainians to be “united in one common prayer.” In a video filmed in front of Kyiv’s Saint Sophia Cathedral, wearing a traditional Vyshyvanka embroidered shirt, Zelenskyy said that God “has a chevron with the Ukrainian flag on his shoulder.” With “such an ally,” Zelenskyy said, “life will definitely win over death.” A majority of Ukrainians identify as Orthodox Christians, though the church is divided. Many belong to the independent Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The rival Ukrainian Orthodox Church was loyal to the patriarch in Moscow until splitting from Russia after the 2022 invasion and is viewed with suspicion by many Ukrainians. In Moscow, worshippers including President Vladimir Putin packed Moscow’s landmark Christ the Savior Cathedral late Saturday for a nighttime Easter service led by Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and an outspoken supporter of the Kremlin. Eastern Orthodox Christians usually celebrate Easter later than Catholic and Protestant churches, because they use a different method of calculating the date for the holy day that marks Christ’s resurrection. ___ Morton reported from London. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-closes-aid-crossing-gaza-hamas-attack_n_66379ef8e4b03d2898dd3fa1,Hamas Says Latest Cease-Fire Talks Have Ended. Israel Vows Military Operation in ‘Very Near Future',"josef federman , kareem chehayeb",5/5/2024,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The latest round of Gaza cease-fire talks ended in Cairo after “in-depth and serious discussions,” the Hamas militant group said Sunday, reiterating key demands that Israel again rejected. After earlier signs of progress, the outlook appeared to dim as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to resist international pressure to halt the war. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant claimed Hamas wasn’t serious about a deal and warned of “a powerful operation in the very near future in Rafah and other places across all of Gaza ” after Hamas attacked Israel’s main crossing point for delivering badly needed humanitarian aid, killing three soldiers. Israel’s military said it believed Hamas was targeting soldiers massed on the Gaza border in preparation for a possible Rafah invasion. Hamas said it targeted soldiers in the area. But Israeli media reported that CIA chief William Burns, a main mediator in the talks, would meet with Netanyahu on Monday. An official familiar with the matter told The Associated Press that Burns was traveling to meet the prime minister of Qatar, which along with Egypt has been an intermediary dealing with Hamas. It was not clear whether a subsequent trip to Israel that had been planned would happen. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations. Israel didn’t send a delegation to the latest talks. Egyptian state media reported that the Hamas delegation went for discussions in Qatar, where the group has a political office, and will return to Cairo for further negotiations on Tuesday. Another threat to talks came as Israel ordered the local offices of Qatar’s Al Jazeera satellite news network to close, accusing it of broadcasting anti-Israel incitement. The ban did not appear to affect the channel’s operations in Gaza or the West Bank. Netanyahu, under pressure from hard-liners in his government, continued to lower expectations for a cease-fire deal, calling the key Hamas demands “extreme” — including the withdrawal of Israel forces from Gaza and an end to the war. That would equal surrender after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that triggered the fighting, he said. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in a statement earlier said the militant group was serious and positive about the negotiations and that stopping Israeli aggression in Gaza is the main priority. But Israel’s government again vowed to press on with a military operation in Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt where more than half of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents now seek shelter from Israeli attacks. Rafah is a key entry point for aid. Kerem Shalom, now closed, is another. The Israeli military reported 10 projectiles were launched at the crossing in southern Israel and said its fighter jets later struck the source. Israel’s Channel 12 TV channel said 10 soldiers remained hospitalized. It was unclear how long the crossing would be closed. The head of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, called for an independent investigation and “accountability for the blatant disregard of humanitarian workers.” He also said Israel this week denied him entry to Gaza for a second time. The closing of Kerem Shalom came shortly after the head of the U.N. World Food Program asserted “full-blown famine” in devastated northern Gaza, one of the most prominent warnings yet of the toll of restrictions on aid entering the territory. It was not a formal famine declaration. In the full NBC interview, WFP chief Cindy McCain said famine was “moving its way south” in Gaza and that Israel’s efforts to allow in more aid were not enough. “We have right now a mass on the outside border, about enough trucks and enough food for 1.1 million people for about three months. We need to get that in,” she said. Gaza’s vast humanitarian needs put pressure on cease-fire talks. The proposal that Egyptian mediators put to Hamas sets out a three-stage process that would bring an immediate, six-week cease-fire and partial release of Israeli hostages taken on Oct. 7, and would include some sort of Israeli pullout. The initial stage would last for 40 days. Hamas would start by releasing female civilian hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Netanyahu claimed that Israel has shown willingness to make concessions but “will continue fighting until all of its objectives are achieved.” That includes the stated aim of crushing Hamas. Israel says it must target Rafah to strike remaining fighters there despite warnings from the U.S. and others about the danger to civilians. In a fiery speech for Israel’s annual Holocaust memorial day, Netanyahu added: “I say to the leaders of the world, no amount of pressure, no decision by any international forum will stop Israel from defending itself.” An Israeli strike Sunday on a house in an urban refugee camp near Rafah killed four children, including a baby, and two adults, all from the same family, according to Abu Youssef al-Najjar Hospital. Another Israeli strike on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed at least five people, according to Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. Israel’s military said it struck a Hamas command center in central Gaza. It didn’t mention casualties. The Hamas cross-border attack on Oct. 7 killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel says militants still hold around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others. Netanyahu is under pressure from some hostages’ families to make a deal to end the war and get hostages freed. Israeli’s air and ground offensive has killed over 34,500 people, according to Palestinian health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up a majority of those killed. Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths, accusing it of embedding in residential and public areas. The Israeli military says it has killed 13,000 militants, without providing evidence to back up the claim. ___ Chehayeb reported from Beirut.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/germs-bacteria-bathroom-mat-curtain_n_66326769e4b0fc2b9527f244,Surprise! This Innocent-Looking Bathroom Item Is Actually The Germiest Part Of Your Bathroom,am i doing it wrong?,5/5/2024,"Pop quiz: What’s the germiest part of the bathroom? Chances are, you guessed the toilet. That makes sense, considering what goes in there, but you’re wrong. That’s what we — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast — discovered when we recently chatted with microbiologist Jason Tetro, aka “The Germ Guy,” about the microbes prowling in our bathrooms and how to vanquish them. Listen to the full episode by pressing play: “When we talk about germiest, we’re talking about the most number of microbes,” Tetro, the author of “The Germ Files” and “The Germ Code,” told us. Those can include bacteria, viruses and fungi, and they’re more likely to thrive in one particular spot. “We have to sort of think about where are the surfaces that have a lot of surface area,” Tetro said. “When you look at a bathroom and you look for something that has the highest surface area, you’re going to see something incredibly obvious ... the bath mat.” These innocent-looking little cloth rectangles are “designed to be nice and fluffy, and they have little pills, and within all that is surface area — that’s where we’re going to really start to see a lot of those microbes grow.” That’s especially true because bath mats are made to soak up water, and moisture encourages microbe growth. Even grosser, Tetro revealed that fecal matter can be launched up to six feet from a toilet when we flush and that a plume of droplets can land on our bath mat. “Those fecal microbes can potentially cause infections and other problems,” he said. So what can we do to keep our bath mats less microbial? First, make sure you’re always closing the lid of your toilet before you flush. That will help contain the plume and keep surfaces in your bathroom — including your tooth brush — less likely to be deluged by a fecal-filled spray. Towel off when you’re still in the tub so there’s less water for your mat to drink up, and hang it up on the side of the tub or shower before you leave the bathroom to promote quicker and more complete drying. Experts advise washing your mat at least once a week, which is probably way more than most of us are currently doing. Check the label for the best way to launder it — especially if it has a rubber or plastic backing. A wooden or stone mat is also a good option, as they are less likely to absorb moisture and foster microbes. Another spot that’s germier than your toilet? The shower curtain. “You probably are going to have more of a chance of your face touching a shower curtain than a bath mat,” Tetro said. “So while the bath mat might be the germiest place, the shower curtain is actually the one that you might want to be a little bit more concerned about.” He advised adding shower curtain maintenance to our regular cleaning routine. “What I tend to do is, when I’m cleaning my bathroom, I will use the disinfectant of choice, and for me, it’s bleach, because [I’m cleaning the] bathroom,” he said. “I’ll just spray my shower curtain [with the bleach because it’s] going to be resistant if it’s made of really good plastic. You can spray it on a regular basis, so every time I clean the bathroom, I clean the shower curtain as well with a disinfectant to make sure that I’m reducing the potential for microbes to show up.” Tetro chose a black shower curtain because hard water stains are clearly visible. “The reason that I want to see that is because when you have a hard water stain, you have a biofilm,” he said. “And when a biofilm starts to form ... that’s when you start to have problems.” Biofilms are caused by bacteria in the water, and, in addition to forming on our shower curtains, they can pop up in our toilet bowls and tubs, as well as on our shower heads. They’re incredibly sticky and hold onto microbes, including ones that can make us sick if we come into contact with them. Removing the biofilms in our bathrooms gives germs less of a chance to hang around. If you have a cloth curtain, consider using a plastic liner that you can frequently clean and replace, and launder the curtain itself on a regular basis. You can also look for a mold-resistant curtain. Tetro emphasized that the majority of microbes we encounter in the bathroom — or anywhere else — are not harmful to us, but we want to clean and disinfect to get rid of the ones that might be. “The bad ones always seem to get the headlines, whereas the good ones — I mean, no one talks about them,” he said. “That’s where me, as the ‘Germ Guy,’ comes into it, because I want to have a good relationship with these microbes, and I want you to think about all the others that aren’t going to cause you problems — as opposed to the ones that do. [Those are the ones I want to teach people] how to avoid and basically kill.” We also chatted about the one thing you might want to start doing before you go to the bathroom, how often we should be washing our towels (and the gross reason they start to smell funky) and much more.

David Trone, a white Democrat, knows the path to winning a Democratic nomination in Maryland goes through its Black voters. “All of my elections, I’ve always done fantastic in minority areas, because so much of what I stand for is people who are left behind,” said Trone, a three-term congressman from not far outside Washington, who became lavishly wealthy operating a national chain of discount liquor stores. That wealth has allowed Trone to spend an eye-popping $57 million of his own money to try and trample his opponent in Maryland’s Democratic U.S. Senate primary — who happens to be a Black woman. The May 14 contest between Trone, 68, and Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, 53, has put an uncomfortable spotlight on race for a party that prides itself on elevating women and people of color. Alsobrooks is overwhelmingly backed by the state’s top Democrats, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Maryland’s Black governor, Wes Moore, who called her a leader with “vision and intention.” But Trone, the founder of Total Wine & More, is spending boatloads to convince Maryland’s diverse electorate (nearly a third of the state’s population is Black) that he’s the progressive outsider and underdog. Trone has argued that “diversity is absolutely fantastic” while also telling voters to “leave color behind” and choose the best candidate. That pitch, delivered via more than two dozen unique TV ads, seems to be working, based on the very limited public polling of the primary. But it’s still enough of a wild card that both candidates are sweating the outcome. Trone argues his money, which he made over the course of three decades as he grew Total Wine & More from a small family business, frees him from the pressures of special interests. And he’s promised that if he wins the nomination, he’ll continue to tap his fortune to fund his campaign against Republican Larry Hogan, the state’s ultra-popular former Republican governor and the GOP’s best shot at winning this seat. “I think everybody who understands how politics works — that money helps drive it — realizes that having a candidate that can do an awful lot of self-funding is a big win,” Trone told HuffPost last Thursday, after an event with a group of mostly Black seniors in Baltimore, the heart of the state’s Black Democratic electorate. Many of the people behind Alsobrooks do not see it that way. “I find it appalling and out of touch that I can watch a woman stand on stage last week and be so stateswoman-like, and you can have an individual looking at her saying he’s the underdog,” shouted Sydney Harrison, a Prince George’s County council member, at a rally for Alsobrooks last Friday. “How can a billionaire who spends 10-to-1 look at a woman of color and say he’s the underdog?” Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the former House majority leader, told the same crowd: “If you want to be for inclusion, if you want to make sure that all people are included in the United States Senate, you need to be for Angela Alsobrooks.” Alsobrooks is running to be one of the few women of color ever elected to the U.S. Senate, where Black women are painfully underrepresented — and the optics of a white man trying to stop her is making this primary especially ugly for Democrats in a state they can’t afford to lose in November. “I think we’re all committed to dampening down the negativity, and preparing to support whoever wins with all we’ve got,” insisted Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, another member of the Maryland congressional delegation behind Alsobrooks. “This is really about the future of the country.” The 2024 election could give Democrats the opportunity to add not just one, but two Black women to the Senate next year. In Delaware, Lisa Blunt Rochester is likely to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Carper in November. But Alsobrooks, running to replace retiring Sen. Ben Cardin, would need to clear the primary against Trone and the general election against Hogan to join her. (A third Black female Senate candidate, Rep. Barbara Lee, finished fourth in California’s March all-party primary behind a pair of white male candidates: Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff — who is backing Trone — and Schiff’s GOP challenger.) Against this backdrop, Trone is arguing that race does not matter in his primary, though he’s made several unforced errors underscoring why it does. Last month, Trone apologized for using what is widely known to be a racial slur during a congressional hearing, claiming he simply reached for the wrong word. At a debate a few days later, Trone cited Reps. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) and Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.), both of whom are Black, as “great diversity candidates.” And last week, Trone ignited a barrage of criticism after he referred to some Alsobrooks supporters as “low-level folks.” “I didn’t even know what the word meant,” Trone told HuffPost, referring to the slur he used, instead of “bugaboo,” at the hearing. “We made one word that was a mistake in a budget hearing and we apologized for it immediately.” Joseline Peña-Melnyk, a Maryland state delegate backing Trone, said even though the slur incident troubled her at first, she believes Trone is a good person who’s using his money to help Marylanders. “You know, it does bother me,” she said. “But when I spoke with him, he apologized for it right away. He took ownership of it.” This week, Trone debuted his first attack ad against Alsobrooks, featuring several Black leaders from her county questioning whether she’s qualified to be a senator. “The U.S. Senate is not a place for training wheels,” Edward Burroughs, a member of the Prince George’s County council, says in an early cut of the ad, which was later reworked without this line. (Trone’s campaign told HuffPost it found more compelling footage to replace it with.) “You know, it does bother me. But when I spoke with him, he apologized for it right away. He took ownership of it.” But Trone also describes Alsobrooks, who was elected state’s attorney for Prince George’s County in 2010 before becoming county executive in 2018, as a career politician, seemingly undercutting his argument that she has no political experience. “Slowly, Angela, a state employee, state executive, county executive, just moved up the chain,” he said. None of this has helped Trone look any better to Alsobrooks’ backers, who see a clumsy candidate forcing a lopsided primary. “Money can’t buy you love. He’s using his wealth to elevate himself,” said Cheryl Landis, a former Maryland state lawmaker. “I’m thinking if I had $45 million, I would rather give that money to charity,” Landis added, citing the amount of money that Trone was thought to have given his campaign just a week ago, before financial disclosures revealed he had dropped another $12 million. Alsobrooks, meanwhile, has raised nearly $8 million, throughout the primary. Several of the Black seniors who heard from Trone last week in Baltimore told HuffPost they didn’t see anything wrong with Trone’s massive degree of self-funding. “He’s been successful at the American dream, that’s what we all want,” said Sarah Holley, a 76-year-old who voted for Hogan once previously, but plans to vote for Trone in the primary and general election. “How and why on earth would you try to find something wrong with the fact that he’s done what we all want to do?” Sarah Matthews, a Black woman who founded a Baltimore-based advocacy group for older adults, said she isn’t moved by Alsobrooks wanting to become the state’s first Black female senator. “Those sound like personal ambitions, and I’m not really interested in her personal ambitions.” Trone, who has a raspy voice and gruff demeanor, ensured the Baltimore audience they can feel good about his spending because he’s not an overnight success, having gradually expanding his family’s wine and beer store into a 30-state chain after his family chicken farm went under. “I’m a slow, slow success, and because I’ve been successful, I can use my finances to pay for this election,” he said. Trone says he doesn’t need the “buck-75,” or $174,000, annual salary that comes with being a congressman, and stresses he’s focused as a lawmaker on mental health and substance use disorder treatment and prison reform. “I don’t care about the bullshit that goes with” being in Congress and running campaigns, Trone told HuffPost, thumping his hand against a table for emphasis. “I actually hate it.” Alsobrooks, a young-looking Gen Xer who can quietly command a room, didn’t mention Trone by name to the group of volunteers clad in neon green campaign tees at her rally last Friday. But his presence hung over the event. “You know, there are some in this race who talk and it makes me so angry — the more I heard about the pandering, the talk about second chances,” said Alsobrooks, swiping at Trone’s push to employ formerly incarcerated people at his liquor stores. “I see all of us as people first.” Alsobrooks told HuffPost that Trone’s money advantage means she’s had to work “10 times as hard as him, but I’m accustomed to that.” She described her upbringing as the daughter of a receptionist and newspaper distributor in the same county where she’s now the top elected official. “I’ve never had it easy before,” she said. The Washington Post, in its endorsement of Alsobrooks over Trone for the nomination, lauded her stewardship of Prince George’s during the pandemic and through public-safety emergencies, and her push for the FBI’s new headquarters to be built in Greenbelt, Maryland. Those aspects of her record are also things she points to on the stump. The next four years will change America forever.

Alsobrooks wouldn’t go there. “I think his language is reflective of his mindset. I mean, you heard him refer to very talented congresswomen as ‘diversity candidates.’ … It’s a reflection of how he feels about women candidates generally. And I think more specifically, some of the other language that he’s used speaks for itself,” she said. Belinda Lindsay, a 61-year-old college professor who showed up to see Alsobrooks last week, said Alsobrooks is “hope” and “inspiration” for a generation of Black women, though she knows the odds right now are against her. “There are those who just don’t want women in there, forget that they’re Black,” she said. “I’m nervous about that, but I’m excited that it’s going to happen.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

And for that, I am sorry.”  In August 2020, it was also announced that executive producers Ed Glavin, Kevin Leman, and Jonathan Norman had been fired from the show. At the time, Ellen told the Hollywood Reporter that she was ending the talk show because it was no longer a creative challenge for her. Looking back on the public perception of her as “a one-dimensional character who gave stuff away and danced up steps,” Ellen said she would “try to avoid looking at the news” in the scandal’s aftermath.  “The hate went on for a long time,” she said after describing herself as “the most hated person in America” at the time. “The ‘be kind’ girl wasn’t kind. That was the headline.” “I’m giving stuff away…and I danced, then I was mean, and they didn’t like me again,” she said of the controversy. “It’s been such a toll on my ego and my self-esteem. There’s such extremes in this business, people either love you and idolize you or they hate you, and those people somehow are louder.” “She was watching it happen to me,” Ellen said, recalling the “funk” she experienced in the “hard” aftermath of the allegations. “She went through it with me.”  After saying she didn’t dance during the tough period because “it's hard to dance when you're crying,” Ellen reassured fans that she and Portia are both “dancing now.” “This was like, What is going on? It was so hurtful,” she said. “I couldn’t gain perspective. I couldn’t do anything to make myself understand that it wasn’t personal. … I just thought, ‘Well, this is not the way I wanted to end my career, but this is the way it’s ending.’” “It took a long time for me to want to do anything again,” she added. “I just hated the way the show ended.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/netanyahu-cabinet-votes-to-close-al-jazeera-offices-in-israel_n_66376c14e4b03d2898dd3929,Israel Orders Al Jazeera To Close Its Local Operation,"tia goldenberg , jon gambrell",5/5/2024,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel ordered the local offices of Qatar’s Al Jazeera satellite news network to close Sunday, escalating a long-running feud between the broadcaster and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s hard-line government as Doha-mediated cease-fire negotiations with Hamas hang in the balance. The extraordinary order, which includes confiscating broadcast equipment, preventing the broadcast of the channel’s reports and blocking its websites, is believed to be the first time Israel has ever shuttered a foreign news outlet operating in the country. Al Jazeera went off Israel’s main cable and satellite providers in the hours after the order. However, its website and multiple online streaming links still operated Sunday. The network has reported the Israeli-Hamas war nonstop since the militants’ initial cross-border attack Oct. 7 and has maintained 24-hour coverage in the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s grinding ground offensive that has killed and wounded members of its staff. While including on-the-ground reporting of the war’s casualties, its Arabic arm often publishes verbatim video statements from Hamas and other regional militant groups. “Al Jazeera reporters harmed Israel’s security and incited against soldiers,” Netanyahu said in a statement. “It’s time to remove the Hamas mouthpiece from our country.” Al Jazeera issued a statement vowing it will “pursue all available legal channels through international legal institutions in its quest to protect both its rights and journalists, as well as the public’s right to information.” “Israel’s ongoing suppression of the free press, seen as an effort to conceal its actions in the Gaza Strip, stands in contravention of international and humanitarian law,” the network said. “Israel’s direct targeting and killing of journalists, arrests, intimidation and threats will not deter Al Jazeera.” The Israeli government has taken action against individual reporters over the decades since its founding in 1948, but broadly allows for a rambunctious media scene that includes foreign bureaus from around the world, even from Arab nations. It also blocked the foreign broadcasts of the Hezbollah-affiliated, Beirut-based Al Mayadeen news channel at the start of the war. A law passed last month allows the government to take action against Al Jazeera, Netanyahu’s office said. Israeli Communication Minister Shlomo Karhi later published footage online of authorities raiding a hotel room Al Jazeera had been broadcasting from in east Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope to one day have for their future state. He said officials seized some of the channel’s equipment there. “We finally are able to stop Al Jazeera’s well-oiled incitement machine that harms the security of the country,” Karhi said. His office said it would bar Al Jazeera from operating in Israel for at least 45 days, a measure that can be renewed. The ban did not appear to affect the channel’s operations in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip, where Israel wields control but which are not sovereign Israeli territory. The decision threatens to heighten tensions with Qatar at a time when the Doha government is playing a key role in mediation efforts to halt the war in Gaza, along with Egypt and the United States. Qatar has had strained ties with Netanyahu in particular since he made comments suggesting that Qatar is not exerting enough pressure on Hamas to prompt it to relent in its terms for a truce deal. Qatar hosts Hamas leaders in exile in Doha. The sides appear to be close to striking a deal, but multiple previous rounds of talks have ended with no agreement. In a statement Sunday, Hamas condemned the Israeli government order, calling on international organizations to take measures against Israel. The Foreign Press Association in Israel criticized the order. “With this decision, Israel joins a dubious club of authoritarian governments to ban the station,” it said. “This is a dark day for the media.” The New York-based Committee to Project Journalists similarly warned the move represented an “extremely alarming precedent for restricting international media outlets working in Israel.” Omar Shakir, Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine director, criticized the Israeli order as “an assault on freedom of the press.” “Rather than trying to silence reporting on its atrocities in Gaza, the Israeli government should stop committing them,” he added. Israel has long had a rocky relationship with Al Jazeera, accusing it of bias. Relations took a major downturn nearly two years ago when Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh was killed during an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank. Those relations further deteriorated following the outbreak of Israel’s war against Hamas on Oct. 7, when the militant group carried out a cross-border attack in southern Israel that killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Since then, the Israeli military campaign in Gaza has killed over 34,000 people, according to local health officials there, who don’t break figures down into civilians and combatants. Israeli media largely has avoided the plight of those in the Gaza Strip, instead focusing on the Oct. 7 attack, the hostages held there and tales of Israeli military heroism. Meanwhile in December, an Israeli strike killed an Al Jazeera cameraman as he reported on the war in southern Gaza. The channel’s bureau chief in Gaza, Wael Dahdouh, was wounded in the same attack. Dahdouh, a correspondent well-known to Palestinians during many wars, later evacuated Gaza but only after Israeli strikes killed his wife, three of his children and a grandson. Al Jazeera is one of the few international media outlets to remain in Gaza throughout the war, broadcasting bloody scenes of airstrikes and overcrowded hospitals and accusing Israel of massacres. Criticism of the channel is not new, however. The U.S. government singled out the broadcaster during America’s occupation of Iraq after its 2003 invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein and for airing videos of the late al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden. Al Jazeera has been closed or blocked by other Mideast governments. Most notably in 2013, Egyptian authorities raided a luxury hotel used by Al Jazeera as an operating base after the military takeover that followed mass protests against President Mohammed Morsi. Three Al Jazeera staff members received 10-year prison sentences, but were released in 2015 following widespread international criticism. ___ Gambrell reported from Jerusalem.

Kristi Noem’s other dog (played by “SNL” cast member Marcello Hernández) took to “Weekend Update” to defend his “great” owner after a report on a dog-killing story in her upcoming memoir sparked backlash. Noem — who has reportedly been abandoned as a potential running mate pick for former President Donald Trump — has gone to bat for her move to shoot and kill her 14-month-old canine Cricket, one of her hunting dogs that she described as “aggressive” and “untrainable.” Hernández introduced himself as Cricket the VII and dismissed the others as “bad dogs,” referring to Noem as a “great” dog owner. “All this stuff about killing animals is just media spin,” Hernández said. “But she wrote about it in her own book,” replied co-host Colin Jost. “I can’t read, I’m a dog,” Hernández declared. “Right, but you know what media spin is?” Jost asked. Hernández went on to refer to her dog as the “problem” as he questioned why Cricket would bark and eat “all day.” “If she didn’t kill him, I would,“ Hernández said. “Wow, so you’re team Kristi?” Jost asked. “Team Kristi for life, for my very long life, please, I love you Kristi,” Hernández said.

Drake, in his most recent entry to the feud, dropped a 7 1/2-minute song titled “Family Matters” on Friday, only for Lamar to reply with a pair of diss tracks, including one called “Meet the Grahams,” where he alleged that the Canadian rapper is hiding another child on top of the one revealed by rapper Pusha T during his prior feud with Drake. “You got Kanye, Two Pack, Shoop Dog, As Soon As Possible Rocky,” said Day, who named the rappers that got mixed into the Drake-Kendrick beef “like they were chopped onions and cayenne pepper.” “And where does Wayne Brady stand? Has he responded?” Gardner asked. The two later brought in Lipa for a “deep dive” into the rap feud. “He calls Drake ‘crodie,’ which is a term used by the Crips, which according to Wikipedia is an alliance of street gangs based in Southern California,’” Lipa explained. “I think I know the Crips.

Alexis Vanessa Roberts better have her butt in class,” Thompson said. “Let me find out she in one of them damn tents instead of the dorm room that I pay for.” Thompson then told the other parents that he’s in favor of “y’all’s kids protesting, not my kids” and later remarked that he wasn’t worried about “five-o” on campus and said it wasn’t any of his business. “My business is Alexis Vanessa Roberts.

And it’s the only way they’re going to win, in their opinion, and it’s actually killing them. But it doesn’t bother me.” Trump launched multiple insults and attacks toward prosecutors, including special counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting the former president’s two federal cases. Trump called Smith a “fucking asshole” in his speech, The Washington Post reported. He reportedly labeled Smith as an “evil thug,” “deranged” and someone who is “unattractive both inside and out” as well. He also referred to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who is prosecuting Trump’s Georgia election interference case, as “Mrs. Wade,” a nod to her relationship with former special prosecutor Nathan Wade, as well as a “real beauty.” Trump, who faces 88 charges across four criminal cases, claimed that he went easier on Biden prior to getting indicted, but “now the gloves have to come off.” “Once I got indicted, I said holy shit, I just got indicted. Me, I got indicted,” said Trump, who likened getting indicted to Al Capone. Trump, who entered the event with his rendition of the national anthem featuring Capitol rioters, whom he refers to as the “J6 hostages,” reportedly received donations of $40,000 or more at the event. Recently, a Trump campaign official said Trump, along with the RNC, raised over $76 million in April. Previously, they raised $65.6 million in March, tens of millions less than the $90 million-plus that Biden’s reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee raised that same month. At another point during the event, Trump offered anyone who looked to give $1 million an opportunity to come up and address the crowd. Two people reportedly took him up on the offer, including one who declared that Trump is “the person that God has chosen” to lead. The next four years will change America forever.

In Virginia, student demonstrators began their protest on a lawn outside the school chapel Tuesday. On Saturday, video from WVAW-TV showed police wearing heavy gear and holding shields lined up on the campus in Charlottesville. Protesters chanted “Free Palestine,” and university police said on the social platform X that an “unlawful assembly” had been declared in the area. As police moved in, students were pushed to the ground, pulled by their arms and sprayed with a chemical irritant, Laura Goldblatt, an assistant professor of English and global studies who has been helping student demonstrators, told The Washington Post. “Our concern since this began has been the safety of our students. Students are not safe right now,” Goldblatt said. BREAKING NEWS: VSP forcing protestors away from the encampment with pepper spray and tear gas. Lots of physical altercations. @29NewsWVIR pic.twitter.com/Zv6HonL14w The university administration said in a statement that the demonstrators were told the tents and canopies they erected were prohibited under school policy and were asked to remove them. Virginia State Police were asked to help with enforcement, the university said. It was the latest clash in several tense and sometimes violent weeks at colleges and universities around the country that have seen dozens of protests and hundreds of arrests at demonstrations over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Tent encampments of protesters calling on universities to stop doing business with Israel or companies they say support the war in Gaza have spread across campuses nationwide in a student movement unlike any other this century. Some schools have reached agreements with protesters to end the demonstrations and reduce the possibility of disrupting final exams and commencements. The Associated Press has recorded at least 61 incidents since April 18 in which arrests were made at protests, with more than 2,400 people being arrested on 47 campuses. The figures are based on AP reporting and statements from universities and law enforcement agencies. Many encampments have been dismantled. Michigan was among the schools bracing for protests during commencement this weekend, including Indiana University, Ohio State University and Northeastern University in Boston. Many more are slated in the coming weeks. In Ann Arbor, the protest happened at the beginning of the event at Michigan Stadium. About 75 people, many wearing traditional Arabic kaffiyehs along with their graduation caps, marched up the main aisle toward the graduation stage. They chanted “Regents, regents, you can’t hide! You are funding genocide!” while holding signs, including one that read: “No universities left in Gaza.” Overhead, planes flew banners with competing messages. “Divest from Israel now! Free Palestine!” and “We stand with Israel. Jewish lives matter.” Officials said no one was arrested, and the protest didn’t seriously interrupt the nearly two-hour event, which was attended by tens of thousands of people, some of them waving Israeli flags. State police prevented the demonstrators from reaching the stage and university spokesperson Colleen Mastony said public safety personnel escorted the protesters to the rear of the stadium, where they remained through the conclusion of the event. “Peaceful protests like this have taken place at U-M commencement ceremonies for decades,” she added. The university has allowed protesters to set up an encampment on campus, but police assisted in breaking up a large gathering at a graduation-related event Friday night, and one person was arrested. At Indiana, protesters were urging supporters to wear their kaffiyehs and walk out during remarks by President Pamela Whitten on Saturday evening. The Bloomington campus designated a protest zone outside Memorial Stadium, the arena for the ceremony. At Princeton, in New Jersey, 18 students launched a hunger strike in an effort to push the university to divest from companies tied to Israel. One of them, senior David Chmielewski said in an email that the strike started Friday morning with participants consuming water only, and it will continue until administrators meet with students about demands including amnesty from criminal and disciplinary charges for protesters. Other demonstrators are participating in “solidarity fasts” lasting 24 hours, Chmielewski said. Princeton students set up a protest encampment and some held a sit-in at an administrative building this week, leading to about 15 arrests. Students at other colleges, including Brown and Yale, launched similar hunger strikes earlier this year before the more recent wave of encampments. Meanwhile in Medford, Massachusetts, students at Tufts University peacefully took down their encampment without police intervention Friday night. School officials said they were pleased with the development, which wasn’t the result of any agreement. Protest organizers said in a statement that they were “deeply angered and disappointed” that negotiations with the university had failed. The protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages.

Reese and Cardoso played in their first preseason game for the Chicago Sky on Friday night in a 92-81 loss to the Minnesota Lynx. The WNBA’s app had incorrectly listed the game as available to watch, leading to confusion from fans before the league clarified that only Caitlin Clark’s debut with the Indiana Fever was being broadcast. That’s when @heyheyitsalli stepped in on X. “Would y’all want me to try and stream the game on here??” the X user asked, “no promises on the quality but i can try.” would y’all want me to try and stream the game on here?? no promises on the quality but i can try Viewership numbers on the livestream varied, but on Saturday the video showed about 434,000 total views. The X user previously posted a screenshot showing that the stream peaked at 173,381 live viewers. “Y’all these are some of THE WILDEST numbers WOW,” the user tweeted. y’all these are some of THE WILDEST numbers WOW pic.twitter.com/DJF6Xloss1 Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve was asked about the stream after the game. She said @heyheyitsalli deserves “three bucks” per viewer. “Anybody that watched it should send three bucks to the person, I don’t even know who it is,” Reeve said. “I think that what I would say is that the growth is happening so fast. It’s so accelerated. And I’ve been saying this in our own organization — that business as usual isn’t going to work anymore. “You’re gonna get left behind and this is an example.” Cheryl Reeve had some good post game remarks on the decision NOT to stream Sky-Lynx game. Watch entire clip. ""Growth is happening so fast.. Business as usual is not going to work anymore. You're going to get left behind & this is an example of it."" #WNBA 🎥 @minnesotalynx pic.twitter.com/VIYfrzUteD Reeve said she understands that Clark’s game would be broadcast, and is “all for that.” “People want to see that, but they also want to see, you know, it’s not just about Caitlin,” Reeve said. “This isn’t Caitlin’s fault in any way. It’s more, you know, the recognition that there’s general excitement about the WNBA in ways that we haven’t seen before. And so we have to capitalize to really ensure that this is a movement.” Reese finished the game with 13 points and nine rebounds in 24 minutes. Cardoso had six points and four rebounds in 13 minutes. Sky coach Teresa Weatherspoon said she was pleased with the rookies’ debuts. “This is a learning process for all of us. ... And we’re going through that process in the right way,” she said. “We got our leaders leading them, pulling them along. Keeping them confident. That’s what matters.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/georgia-election-indictment-lawmakers_n_6636dcc2e4b001bbb50fc177,California Man Indicted For Allegedly Making Threats To Georgia Prosecutor In Trump Election Case,jeff amy,5/4/2024,"ATLANTA (AP) — A California man has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Atlanta for sending death threats to District Attorney Fani Willis, who is overseeing the prosecution of former President Donald Trump and 18 others on charges of illegally trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Marc Shultz, 66, of Chula Vista, is facing charges of transmitting interstate threats to injure Willis. Prosecutors alleged that Shultz posted comments to YouTube livestream videos in October 2023 that threatened Willis, including stating that the prosecutor “will be killed like a dog.” “Sending death threats to a public official is a criminal offense that will not be tolerated,” Ryan Buchanan, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, said in a statement Friday. The April 24 indictment was unsealed Thursday. A federal public defender listed as representing Shultz didn’t immediately return emails seeking comment. Records show Shultz appeared before a judge in San Diego on Thursday and was released on bail. Buchanan said Shultz would be formally arraigned in Atlanta in June. Also Friday, Fulton County leaders testified before a special state Senate committee that they had no legal power to control Willis’ spending or her hiring of former special prosecutor Nathan Wade. The Republican-led committee is probing Willis’ hiring of Wade to lead the team that investigated and charged Trump, lawyers and other aides in the Georgia case. Willis and Wade have acknowledged a romantic relationship with each other. Trump and some other defendants in the case have tried to get Willis and her office removed from the case, saying the relationship with Wade created a conflict of interest. Wade stepped down from the prosecution after Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case. But he ruled that Willis could continue prosecuting Trump only if Wade left. Trump and others are appealing that ruling to a higher state court. The allegations that Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Wade resulted in tumultuous months in the case as intimate details of Willis and Wade’s personal lives were aired in court in mid-February. The serious charges in one of four criminal cases against the Republican former president were largely overshadowed by the love lives of the prosecutors. Willis told reporters Friday that she had done nothing wrong. “They can look all they want,” Willis said. “The DA’s office has done everything according to the books. We are following the law. I’m sorry that folks get mad when everybody in society can be prosecuted.” Willis is running for reelection this year and faces a Democratic opponent, Christian Wise Smith in a May 21 primary. Early voting for that election is ongoing. But the lawyer who initiated the effort to remove Willis, Ashleigh Merchant, has also claimed that Wade’s firing violated a state law that required approval of the hiring of a special prosecutor by the county commission. Fulton County Commission Chairman Rob Pitts, a Democrat, and Fulton County Attorney Soo Jo both told the committee that while the law appears to require county commission approval, judges decades ago interpreted the law in such a way to give Willis the freedom to hire who she wants without approval. Jo, who represents the commission, cited three separate Georgia Court of Appeals cases backing up that point “What I have found is that the court has rejected the proposition that this particular statute requires a district attorney to obtain explicit permission from a county prior to appointing a special assistant district attorney,” Jo said. State Sen. Bill Cowsert, the Athens Republican who chairs the committee, disputed that interpretation when questioned by reporters after the hearing. “I think the clear language of the statute says that that requires county approval, and especially where it’s funded by the county,” Cowsert said. He went on to suggest the committee, which doesn’t directly have the power to sanction Willis, might change the law to give counties more control over spending by state officers funded by counties, including district attorneys and sheriffs. Fulton County officials said they don’t believe they currently can control how Willis spends money once it’s appropriated to her. The next four years will change America forever.

Log in to hide these messages. Cowsert said increased county oversight would be “extraordinarily complex” for district attorneys managing funds contributed by more than one county. While Willis and 15 other district attorneys in Georgia only prosecute cases from one county, others prosecute cases from as many as eight counties. Senate Democratic Whip Harold Jones II of Augusta said the hours of questioning over details of how Fulton County budgets money shows the panel is “on its last legs,” noting three of six Republicans didn’t appear for a committee meeting called on short notice. “They’re not even interested in this anymore,” Jones said. “There’s nothing else to talk about, quite frankly.

After social media users on X (formerly Twitter) slammed the lack of creativity among men’s fashion at Monday’s coveted New York City event, the Grammy-winning artist stepped into the chat to silence the internet. On Monday, the “Monaco” crooner, 30, hit the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a custom Maison Margiela navy pinstripe suit with white threads and red stripes. He nailed the evening’s theme of “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” and its “Garden of Time” dress code with the perfect accessory, a fabric floral arrangement, which he held with a leather-gloved hand. But what really stole the show were his black-and-white Bolero shoes, which resembled hoofs. Bad Bunny paired his sophisticated look with an oversized beret and diamond-shaped shades. Social media users on X gushed over the Puerto Rican singer’s bold style. Bad Bunny absolutely smashed it! Let’s make menswear great again! #metgala pic.twitter.com/jZzZqgsfW2 bad bunny wearing custom maison margiela at the met gala — I’M SO OBSESSED OMG!!!! pic.twitter.com/0Y2HiZv3rq bad bunny never misses #MetGala pic.twitter.com/NTZIV9elKf bad bunny in custom margiela for the #MetGala2024, ATE DOWNNNN pic.twitter.com/z9oHoGI6x8 The “Bullet Train” star’s head-turning look is just what the internet needed after many complained on X that the Met Gala should “ban” men from wearing basic suits.

The controversial “Kiss Me More” singer wore a white towel with a tag that said “dress” on it and a matching towel to cover her head as she exited The Mark Hotel to make her way to Monday’s big event. She paired her towels with sky-high acrylic platform shoes, jewels and glam makeup by Pat McGrath Labs that made it appear as though the singer had been crying. McGrath said that her team “painted enchanted chrome tears of joy streaming down her cheeks” to achieve the buzzy look. The entertainer had updated her getup by the time she walked the red carpet at the Met. She wore what appeared to be an actual wet T-shirt fashioned into a gown, though her makeup remained the same. The Grammy winner told Entertainment Weekly all about her unique look, created by Vetements. “I know that people were going to do flowers, so my flower of choice was the most-used flower, and it’s cotton, and so I wanted to do a white T-shirt because a white T-shirt is timeless and felt very poetic,” Doja said, adding that she really doesn’t “like to blend in.” She detailed how the design house achieved the dress’s “wet” effect. “I’m not supposed to give the secret, but it’s hair gel. It’s all hair gelr,” the entertainer said. Anna Wintour admitted to causing some “confusion” with this year’s theme and dress code, so perhaps Doja’s interpretation is to be expected. “Well, this exhibition broke my cardinal rule,” Wintour said in a Monday interview on “The Today Show.” “When we came up with the title ‘Sleeping Beauties,’ it’s wonderful and poetic and romantic, but it actually ― it could be many, many things.” Especially as Andrew Bolton, the curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, added an additional dress code instruction for guests to follow. “I said [to Bolton], ‘What are we gonna say to people to wear to this night?’ And he said, ‘Well, what about ‘Garden of Time’?” Wintour said, referencing a short story written by J.G. Ballard in 1962. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about. Join our loyalty program to support our work and go ad-free.

The “Mindy Project” star told Vogue that her structured gown was designed by the “incredible” Indian designer Gaurav Gupta. “It makes me so happy to rep such talented geniuses who happen to be from my community. It’s amazing,” Kaling said, before adding that her “gown had a name.” “It’s called ‘The Melting Flower of Time,’” Kaling told Vogue’s livestream host, La La Anthony. “If you look at the cape, you can see that it looks like a flower that was once blossoming and is now melting.” Kaling added that she loved that her dress “had a little bling.” “It’s me after all,” she said with a laugh. The co-chairs for this year’s festivities include Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya and Anna Wintour. The gala’s theme is “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.” Guests were instructed to follow a dress code based on “The Garden of Time,” which is the title of a 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard. “The most obvious interpretation would be to embrace the ‘garden’ part of ‘The Garden of Time,’” Vogue instructed followers and guests. “Think melancholic florals (as moody florals aren’t moody enough).” Wintour recognized that the theme and dress code could cause “confusion.” “This exhibition broke my cardinal rule,” Wintour said during an appearance on the “Today” show Monday. “When we came up with the title ‘Sleeping Beauties,’ it’s wonderful and poetic and romantic, but actually ― it could be many, many things.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But who’s really surprised? Fresh off gagging fans on the “Challengers” press tour with her viral tennis ball heels (a nod to her character, Tashi, a tennis star, in the sports film), the style chameleon made the world stop when she arrived at the highly anticipated New York event wearing an ethereal royal blue and emerald Maison Margiela mermaid gown. Zendaya — a co-chair of the event alongside Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Jennifer Lopez and Anna Wintour — fully leaned into the evening’s theme of “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion” and its “Garden of Time” dress code with her mesh-veiled headpiece and bold, smoky, gothic makeup.

For her second red carpet look, the Emmy-winning actress sported a massive lacy black gown and a multicolored floral crown. Adding to the wow factor of the “Euphoria” star’s outfits, her stylist and pal, Law Roach, revealed that her stunning looks were actually last-minute constructions. Speaking with The New York Times, Roach said her outfit concepts were still a distant dream just days before the event. “I haven’t seen Zendaya’s dress!” he told the Times on Thursday. “We’ve been on two press tours — ‘Dune 2’ and ‘Challengers’ — and doing two Vogue covers. The dress isn’t even made. They won’t fit until Saturday.” This year’s Met Gala marks the first time Zendaya, 27, has attended in five years. She last attended in 2019 when she went full princess in a magical, light-up Cinderella ball gown by Tommy Hilfiger for the gala’s “camp” theme. Zendaya previously spoke of her love for creating “characters” with her outfits. “I like to look at fashion as creativity,” she explained while appearing on an April 23 episode of “Live With Kelly and Mark”. “Even in press tours, it’s a way to continue the creativity from the film.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

(AP) — A Kansas City-area man who’s charged with killing his hospitalized wife told police he couldn’t take care of her or afford her medical bills, court records say. Ronnie Wiggs made his first appearance Monday on a second-degree murder charge and was referred to the public defender’s office. A hearing was set for Thursday to review his $250,000 bond. A phone message that was left with the public defender’s office wasn’t immediately returned. His wife was getting a new port for her dialysis when staff at Centerpoint Medical Center in Independence called a “code blue” Friday because she was unresponsive. Staff managed to get her pulse back, but they determined she was brain dead and made preparations to harvest her organs, according to the probable cause statement. His wife died Saturday. After the attack, Wiggs left the hospital. But the statement said the woman’s son brought Wiggs back to see her and he confessed. Staff heard him say, “I did it, I killed her, I choked her,” according to the statement. He then was arrested and told a detective that he covered his wife’s nose and mouth to keep her from screaming, the statement said. He said he was depressed and couldn’t handle the caregiving and bills. He said he also attempted to kill his wife while she was at a rehabilitation facility, but she woke up and told him not do that again, the statement said. He said he was going to try to kill his wife another time while she was hospitalized, but he didn’t get the chance because she was hooked up to several monitors.

On Monday, New York state Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan found Trump to be in contempt of court for again violating a gag order and warned the former president that future violations could mean a trip to jail. Trump suggested he was OK with that possibility when he spoke to the media outside the Manhattan courtroom. “This judge is giving me a gag order and said you’ll go to jail if you violate it,” Trump griped. “And frankly, our Constitution is much more important than jail. It’s not even close. I’ll do that sacrifice any day.” Trump: This judge is giving me a gag order and said you'll go to jail if you violate it. And frankly, our constitution is much more important than jail. It's not even close. I'll do that sacrifice any day. pic.twitter.com/TkbnLajOSt Social media was soon rife with posts from those who were OK with the possibility that Trump might go to jail for his repeated violations of the court order. In fact, many openly encouraged the former president to keep it up. I’m willing for Trump to make this sacrifice. https://t.co/uuUsDIEAUg All you gotta do is violate again. It’s easy enough to do.

The “Let’s Get Loud” singer wowed in a sheer, custom gown by Schiaparelli. The look took over 800 hours to hand embroider and features more than 2.5 million silver-foil bugle beads. She paired the haute couture creation with sky-high platform shoes and a clutch in matching tones. Lopez’s necklace, with nearly 100 carats of diamonds, was provided by Tiffany & Co., as were her earrings, bracelet and two rings. Lopez is a co-chair of this year’s esteemed event, alongside Bad Bunny, Chris Hemsworth, Zendaya and, of course, Vogue’s Anna Wintour. Guests at the gala will be able to preview the Costume Institute’s exhibition, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.” The dress code for Monday’s event was “The Garden of Time,” based on a 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard. When Vogue first announced the theme for this year’s gala, it described the dress code and accompanying exhibition as centering on “fleeting beauty.” “The most obvious interpretation would be to embrace the ‘garden’ part of ‘The Garden of Time,’” the fashion bible said, instructing guests and followers alike to “Think melancholic florals (as moody florals aren’t moody enough).” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/turtles-all-the-way-down-review_n_66390c06e4b00641c4962bec,'Turtles All The Way Down' Is A Moving Portrayal Of Life With A Mental Illness,sarah hunter simanson,5/6/2024,"Molly Turpin first read John Green’s young adult novel, “Turtles All the Way Down,” in 2018 when she was in an inpatient psych ward for treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. It was an emotional read because of how strongly she related to the novel’s protagonist, Aza, and her struggles with OCD and anxiety. “[I] was so moved by John Green’s portrayal of OCD because it was the most accurate portrayal I’ve seen in media,” Turpin, now 27, said. For many fans, like Turpin, Green’s novel feels personal. Whether they have a mental illness themselves or love someone with one, Aza’s story makes them feel seen and understood. This sentiment isn’t unique to “Turtles All the Way Down.” Green is known for writing stories — including “Looking for Alaska” and “The Fault in Our Stars” — about young adult characters grappling with a very specific scenario. In “Turtles All the Way Down,” Aza is searching for a missing billionaire who happens to be the dad of her crush, which ultimately leads to an internal revelation that touches at the very core of what it means to be human and to grow up. The love people have for these coming-of-age stories has resulted in a passionate fan base of readers who see themselves in the grace that Green’s books offer. This is especially true for fans of “Turtles All the Way Down,” with many pointing to the text as a key event in their mental health journeys. The deep attachment those fans have felt to the book has increased expectations for its new movie adaptation, which is directed by Hannah Marks from a screenplay by Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker and stars Isabela Merced as Aza. But can the movie really be as good as the book? Can it do justice to Aza and every reader who has felt like her or loved someone like her? The overwhelming consensus from fans is yes. The “Turtles All the Way Down” movie is a moving, accurate portrayal of what it feels like to live with a mental illness. Shannon Parry was diagnosed with OCD in the second grade. Like Turpin, Parry, now 34, was really struggling when she first read “Turtles All the Way Down.” In 2017, she was in therapy, and she credits Green’s novel with helping her as much as therapy did. “It was a matter of understanding that there were people out there in the world [like me] and [giving] me a language to be able to describe my OCD to the people around me,” Parry said. A large reason for that was the imagery and language that Green uses in the book to describe Aza’s thought spirals, which are a series of negative thoughts, feelings or actions that can escalate and become overwhelming. The trademark orange spiral on the cover, the allusion to a Raymond Pettibon painting of a spiral and the descriptions of Aza’s illogical but inescapable thought patterns all helped Parry. “I was able to describe thought spirals and point to certain imagery in the book and say that is what it feels like when I’m going down a thought spiral or I can’t get out of a series of thoughts,” Parry said. Patrick McGrath, the chief clinical officer for NOCD, an online platform that Green is partnering with because of its commitment to make exposure and response prevention therapy (the gold standard of OCD treatment) more accessible, said that everyone has intrusive thoughts, images or urges that interrupt their daily lives. For example, everyone could drive over a bridge and think to themselves, “I wonder what would happen if I drove off of it,” but “the difference between people with and without OCD is that people without OCD can go, ‘Oh, that was weird’ and move on, and people with OCD can get caught in a thought spiral ... then they do some kind of compulsion … to neutralize the intrusive thought or image,” McGrath said. He said this compulsion makes people with OCD feel safe, and they think that if they had not done that neutralization, something terrible would have happened. In “Turtles All the Way Down,” Aza’s intrusive thoughts are usually about germs, bacteria and her microbiome because she is terrified of getting an infection and dying. One of the ways she neutralizes this obsession is by fixating on the calloused pad of her finger: putting a band-aid on it, picking at it until it bleeds and cleaning it with soap or hand sanitizer. When Parry first saw Aza’s flashing, interrupting thoughts about microbes in the movie trailer for “Turtles All the Way Down,” she cried. On May 2, the day the film was released on Max, she woke up in the middle of the night to watch it and cried again. “The scene where I knew this movie fully understood and represented me was the first time Aza thought spirals about her cut,” Parry said. “The way the germs flash and she can’t stop thinking about the bandage. I go through something similar with my dermatillomania, or skin picking.” Because most depictions of OCD focus on people’s compulsions, McGrath, who has seen the film twice, believes it is especially important that the movie shows “the mental stuff” because “finally people will understand that internal torture that occurs with obsessive-compulsive disorder.” Kayla Miller, a 21-year-old college senior living in Indianapolis (where the film takes place), doesn’t have a mental illness herself, but she also thinks the movie can help people understand the challenges of supporting someone with one. She appreciates the way it shows Aza’s complicated relationships with Daisy (Cree), her best friend, Davis (Felix Mallard), her crush, and her mom (Judy Reyes). “People are affected by the mental and physical health of others that they love, too,” Miller said. She found the film to be affirming of the experiences that she’s been through with family members who deal with depression, anxiety and addiction. Parry said the book helped her parents “to understand in a very tangible way how I experience the world” and thinks the movie can do the same. As soon as she finished watching it, she tweeted, “…Texted my parents that, though my OCD is different than Aza’s, they should watch the movie to understand how I experience OCD.” Shortly after posting, Green retweeted her, saying, “This is our dream for the movie — that it can help not only people feel seen but also be a window for those who love and support people living with OCD and/or anxiety. (Plus, it’s funny.)” When Green retweeted Parry, she felt like it made her leap to be vulnerable — she wouldn’t normally tweet something like that — worth it. It also emphasized that while the book and movie are a form of entertainment, they are also part of a bigger movement that Green has led to destigmatize mental illness. Green has been very open about his own struggles with OCD and how a particularly rough period in his life inspired “Turtles All the Way Down.” Every fan interviewed for this article referenced Green’s openness about his mental health, saying it was inspiring and a contributing factor in why they were comfortable sharing their stories for this piece. And all of them hope that, like Green, they can use their experiences to help others know they aren’t alone and work to normalize broader conversations about mental illness. This is the reason that Ellie Bridges Greenfield read “Turtles All the Way Down” in the first place. It was a summer reading assignment before her sophomore year of high school, included as part of a larger initiative to destigmatize mental illness. When she first read the book, Greenfield didn’t know about her own mental health issues. She could empathize with Aza, but she couldn’t understand her yet. It wasn’t until a few years later, during her first year of college, that Greenfield received a diagnosis of anxiety and began therapy, leading to her empathizing with Aza more deeply. Like Aza, Greenfield feels like she is still at the beginning of a long journey. Her symptoms have been worse this spring, and she just started medication for the first time. She hasn’t even told her closest family or friends how bad things have been because she’s still learning to accept and manage her anxiety for herself. For some, like Greenfield, the movie wasn’t an enjoyable watch because the thought spirals were triggering. While she thought it did a good job of depicting what it’s like to have a thought spiral, she was uncomfortable during those scenes because she knows how upsetting it is to experience something like that. Although Greenfield thinks she will only watch “Turtles All the Way Down” once, she appreciates how hopeful its ending is. “There is this element of acceptance that we see at the end of the movie that I think is so true,” she said. “Your thoughts are there, but they don’t control you ... and that’s something I always have to remind myself. At the end of the day, I have to remember I have mental authority.” Without spoiling anything, the ending doesn’t downplay or sugarcoat Aza’s reality as someone with OCD or the challenges it may pose for her in the future. Instead, it reflects something McGrath hopes his patients can learn: mental illness will always be a “constant companion” for the rest of your life, but you can learn to live with it and it can be managed. The final scene was also Turpin’s favorite part of the movie. “[When] Daisy is telling Aza that she can be successful and she can build her life, and there will be times when it will be unbuilt but she’ll build it back up … I have found that is accurate in my own life,” she said. Miller also loves the movie ending with this lesson, finding it hopeful and applicable to everyone — whether they have a mental illness or are supporting someone through one. She also thinks the film, like the book, is comforting, saying that it’s “a safe place to land, to know that you’re going to struggle and you are going to face some hard things, but in the end there is still love, hope and people to support you through that.” For these fans, the “Turtles All the Way Down” movie successfully captures the lived realities of being a teen and having a mental illness. But, most importantly, it is a testament to the larger impact of Green’s openness surrounding his own journey with OCD and anxiety.

For Parry, Green has created a world “where it is OK to do something like have an interview like this and share about your own mental health, and it’s OK to have OCD [and be a] skin picker. It doesn’t make you less than or unworthy … and that in fact, by coming forward, you’re probably helping someone else.” Taken this way, “Turtles All the Way Down” begins to take on a new meaning. Maybe intrusive thoughts and anxieties do beget another turtle that’s sitting on the back of another turtle to create an infinite spiral. But maybe the way the movie and Green’s personal experience inspire fans to share their stories has a similar impact. Maybe self-acceptance and honesty can beget turtles all the way down, too. “Turtles All The Way Down” is streaming on Max.

Ole Miss said it was looking into “actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones” when demonstrators gathered on campus Thursday to protest U.S. support of Israel during the country’s ongoing war against Hamas. Footage of racist abuse being directed at a pro-Palestine protester quickly spread online, with a GOP congressman even going as far as to endorse their actions. “Ole Miss taking care of business,” Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) wrote Friday on the social platform X. He has since acknowledged there was “potentially inappropriate behavior.” The incident came amid a growing wave of demonstrations on university campuses around the country. Videos of the confrontation showed a small group of students chanting “Free, free Palestine,” and carrying signs with slogans including “Stop the Genocide” and “U.S. bombs take Palestine lives.” A larger group of counter-protesters were filmed surrounding and yelling at the demonstrators. At one point, a white student is seen making monkey noises directed at a Black woman as others taunt and cheer. On Friday, university Chancellor Glenn Boyce said that “university leaders are aware that some statements made were offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable,” and that the institution has launched an investigation into the conduct of one student. “We are working to determine whether more cases are warranted,” he added. “To be clear, people who say horrible things to people because of who they are will not find shelter or comfort on this campus,” he said. A fraternity member was kicked out of the organization after the encounter drew widespread condemnation online. “Phi Delta Theta General Headquarters is aware of the video regarding the student protest at the University of Mississippi,” the organization wrote in a statement on Sunday. “The racist actions in the video were those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter.” On Monday, Collins changed tack after facing a backlash, issuing a statement saying he does not condone racism or discrimination. He added that if a student was found to have “treated another human being improperly because of their race, they should be punished appropriately, and will hopefully seek forgiveness.” The next four years will change America forever.

And we’re not going to beat around the bush: This year’s theme is no bed of roses to interpret. The 2024 Met Gala, Vogue’s annual fashion extravaganza at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, traditionally takes place on the first Monday in May, and attendees on the star-studded guest list traditionally are tasked with wearing a themed ensemble. Co-hosting this year’s event are Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour Last year’s theme was pretty black and white and was “in honor of Karl” — or a tribute to the controversial but influential fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld, who died in 2019 at age 85. Due to the simplicity of the dress code, we didn’t get any campy outfits like Katy Perry’s chandelier dress, stunners like Blake Lively’s color-changing number, or straight-up head-scratchers like Kylie Jenner pairing a wedding gown with a baseball cap. Rather, we got a lot of Chanel, which is always chic but yawn-worthy enough that a cockroach that crashed the red carpet became the official star of the night. But this year’s theme is so convoluted that it likely will sow the seeds of some straight-up mess. The dress code is “The Garden of Time,” named after the 1962 short story by J.G. Ballard. In the story, an aristocratic couple living in a walled estate with a magical garden tries to stave off an unruly mob trying to break in. To keep the mob at bay, the husband picks flowers trying to turn back time until there’s no blooms left. The mob eventually breaks in, ransacks their place and the couple turns to stone. Due to this, Vogue told its guests that outfits should represent “fleeting beauty” and embody “the beauty of the natural world — its fragility and its inevitable decay.” As always, the dress code is inspired by the Met Fashion Institute’s annual spring exhibit. The whole point of the gala is to raise money for the Fashion Institute, which is the only department at the museum required to pay for itself. This year’s exhibit is “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” and it showcases outfits so old and delicate, they can’t be displayed on mannequins. Instead, the exhibit will involve AI and 3D recreations of the work. So, what does this all mean? We honestly have no idea — and we’re sure famous guests and their stylists are equally stumped. So, translations of this theme could run the gamut from floral prints, sustainable attire and suits made out of grass — to some celebrities missing the assignment and showing up in fairy tale garb thanks to the words “Sleeping Beauty” existing in the name of the exhibit. But here at HuffPost, we’re happy to dig up and present all the best, worst and befuddling looks from this year’s bash, which you can take a gander at below. So, in conclusion: Happy first Monday of May to all who celebrate!

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/new-york-crisis-pregnancy-abortion-lawsuit_n_6639234fe4b0f72991a71a91,New York AG Sues Anti-Abortion Groups Over Unproven Pill Claims,ryan grenoble,5/6/2024,"New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) on Monday announced that the state is suing Heartbeat International, an anti-abortion group, for making what she says are misleading and “incredibly dangerous” claims about medication abortion. The lawsuit also names 11 crisis pregnancy centers across New York as defendants. Prosecutors say the centers are falsely promoting what they call “Abortion Pill Reversal,” an unproven protocol that they claim can reverse a medication abortion. “Abortions cannot be reversed, and this treatment could be incredibly dangerous,” James said in a statement. “They claim the treatment is safe and effective, but there’s no scientific proof and medical experts warn that it’s unsafe.” Medication abortion typically requires a two-drug regimen: a dose of mifepristone, which blocks a pregnancy-related hormone called progesterone, followed 24 to 48 hours later by a dose of misoprostol, which causes cramping and empties the uterus. The lawsuit alleges that Heartbeat International and the other defendants seek to persuade pregnant people to skip the second drug and instead take progesterone to supposedly “reverse” the process. However, there’s no scientific evidence to support the procedure, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. An investigation by ACOG concluded that several studies cited by the groups relied on flawed data and highly imprecise methodology. The next four years will change America forever.

The camera ignited “without warning” during use at the George R. Vierno Center on Rikers Island on Friday, resulting in the unidentified captain suffering burns and smoke inhalation, DOC press secretary Annais Morales said in an emailed statement. “The safety of our staff is paramount, which is why I am removing all body-worn cameras from service out of an abundance of caution while we investigate how and why this incident occurred,” said Commissioner Lynelle Maginley-Liddie. The investigation into the DOC’s 3,480 cameras, identified as the Reveal Media D5 series, is expected to take one to two weeks. The DOC is in contact with the camera manufacturer to determine how the incident occurred, according to a DOC spokesperson. Reveal did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. In 2018 the NYPD suspended its use of certain body-worn cameras after one reportedly exploded during use. An investigation into the incident found that the battery had the potential to ignite inside of the camera, NBC New York reported at the time. The devices used by the DOC are similar to ones used by the NYPD ― which reports the nation’s largest body-worn camera program ― but they are not the same kind, a NYPD spokesperson confirmed to HuffPost. The city’s correctional facilities have a long history of abuse and negligence toward its inmates, resulting in the notorious Rikers Island complex being ordered to close by 2027 due to safety and humanitarian concerns. A federal monitor has also been appointed to review the prisons following a 2015 civil rights lawsuit alleging cruel and unusual punishment. That monitor described the DOC’s facilities last fall as increasingly “dangerous and unsafe” to both staff and those in custody. The next four years will change America forever.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-abortion-fertilization_n_66390772e4b001bbb5106897,"Trump Says Abortion 'Not That Big Of An Issue,' GOP Is 'Party Of Fertilization'",jennifer bendery,5/6/2024,"In one of his most bizarre interviews in recent memory, Donald Trump insisted abortion is “not that big of an issue,” claimed Republicans are the “party of fertilization” and said every legal scholar in the world supported overturning Roe v. Wade. During an interview last week with a local Michigan TV station FOX-2 Detroit, Trump repeatedly downplayed the significance of abortion rights on the national stage ― despite it being a driving factor in Democrats’ strong performance at the ballot box in the aftermath of the Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade in 2022. Recent polling shows many voters see the 2024 election as a high-stakes election for the future of abortion and contraception access. President Joe Biden has made the issue central to his campaign, as have countless Democratic candidates. “I think the abortion issue should be largely taken off the table because the individual states are doing what they’re doing,” the GOP presidential hopeful said. “It’s really not that big of an issue,” he added. Trump suggested it was actually a good thing for women that the 6-3 conservative-led court overturned a 50-year precedent guaranteeing women a constitutional right to abortion. He put three of those conservative justices onto the court when he was president. “I say, what the people decide, and whatever it is, it’s within the state and what the people decide, and it’s working out,” he said. “For many, many years, people have said we’ve got to bring this back to the states to decide, and that’s now working.” Trump also called the GOP the “party of fertilization,” apparently trying to make the case that Republicans have fought to ensure women’s access to in vitro fertilization, or IVF. But not only is that false, he lost that point completely in an indecipherable word salad. “We want to help the women because they were going to end fertilization, which is where, when the IVF, where women go to the clinics and they get help in having a baby, and that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. And we’re for it a 100%. They tried to say that they weren’t for it. They actually weren’t for it and aren’t for it as much as us, but women see that,” he said. Republicans in Congress have long opposed women’s access to IVF. The only reason it’s getting national attention now ― and that Trump is talking about it ― is because the Alabama Supreme Court ruled earlier this year a frozen embryo is “a child,” a decision resulting in IVF clinics halting their services around the state because they didn’t want to face prosecution or lawsuits by discarding unused embryos. Alabama Republican legislators soon scrambled to pass a new law to give IVF clinics immunity from lawsuits, but they did not take up a bill to revisit the state’s legal status of embryos. Elsewhere in the interview, Trump falsely claimed that women routinely have abortions in the ninth month of pregnancy, said women are somehow having abortions after the ninth month and are able to “kill the baby after the baby is born,” and that “every legal scholar … all over the world” supported overturning Roe v. Wade. “You have to understand, every legal scholar from all over the country, all over the world, they said, ‘You have to get abortion out of the federal government, you have to take it away from the federal government, give it to the states,’ and now that’s what we’ve been able to do,” he boasted of throwing out Roe v. Wade. “We’ve given it to the states, and some states have already decided, and people are satisfied with it.” Trump has made this claim before, and legal scholars have shot it down as “utter nonsense” and “patently absurd.” The next four years will change America forever.

Sign up to get the latest New York City news delivered to you each morning.” Harvey Weinstein is being kept in a private room inside Bellevue Hospital’s Intensive Care Unit on a floor away from all other detainees, THE CITY has learned. Almost all city detainees with serious medical issues are kept inside the Department of Correction’s medical unit on the 19th floor. But Weinstein currently has his own phone, bathroom, and television — a perk few, if any, other city detainees are afforded — in a different location in the hospital. He spends most of his day watching CNN and other television programs and talking in person or on the phone to Arthur Aidala, the attorney handling his appeal. The disgraced movie mogul was moved to the Manhattan public hospital hours after he was brought back to Rikers Island on April 27 when an appeals court tossed his 2020 rape conviction. Weinstein, 72, was transferred to the hospital following complaints of chest pain, according to a jail source familiar with his case. He has since been diagnosed with pneumonia, and his legal team says he’s dealing with a host of other serious medical conditions like constant chest and abdominal pain, another jail insider said. “He’s a sick man,” Weinstein attorney Donna Rotunno told THE CITY. “Harvey has multiple health issues and he’s never gotten the level of care that he received prior to going into custody.” A former therapist who worked on Rikers questioned why Weinstein has remained in the ICU for so long, noting he’s capable of shaving, showering, and moving out of bed. “He’s not supposed to be there,” said the clinician who asked to remain anonymous. “It’s special treatment.” The city’s Correctional Health Services, which oversees medical care for incarcerated people, did not respond to a request seeking comment. Jail officials briefly tried to move Weinstein to the 19th floor unit last week but he was sent back to his room in the ICU, according to the jail sources. The former Hollywood powerbroker is also being watched by four correction officers from the department’s Emergency Service Unit. A former top jail official questioned why he was being watched by four ESU officers. “Does he need ESU? No. Could two regular officers watch him? Probably. He’s certainly not an escape risk,” said Martin Horn, who served as commissioner of the probation and correction departments during the Bloomberg administration. Most high-profile detainees are housed in the department’s West Facility on Rikers. The jail was originally built to house people with contagious diseases. It is largely empty and detainees placed there, like former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, are typically given their own cells — away from other people locked up. The city Department of Correction has long struggled to properly treat incarcerated people with complex medical needs. Most are treated at medical clinics located in each of the 10 jail facilities on Rikers. The Board of Correction, the city jails’ oversight body, has repeatedly cited missed medical visits as a key factor in deaths behind bars since Mayor Eric Adams took over in January 2022. Most recently, on Friday, the board found that a Rikers detainee who died behind bars earlier this year was without a mattress for 18 hours and only got one outside recreation session in 15 days before he was found unresponsive in his cell. Manuel Luna, 30, was also not brought to a medical clinic to receive methadone eight times from Oct. 25, 2023, through Jan. 12, 2024, according to the Board of Correction. Luna, who was facing charges of stealing an e-bike, was found unresponsive inside his cell in the George R. Vierno Center on Jan. 19. Known as Panda to his friends, he was moved to that new housing area shortly before his death, the Daily News reported. The city Medical Examiner has not determined the cause of the death. Luna was a “loving person” who “always loved to make people laugh,” his brother, Angel Luna, told THE CITY. In jail, he and others are “not being treated like human beings,” he said. “If you can’t keep people alive, then close the jail down,” he added. “If a bakery can’t make bread, you close shop. The same for these jails. You can’t keep holding people there. They’re killing people, and they’re going to keep killing people. There is a trail of bodies left behind by the negligence and abuse.” The Department of Correction did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Weinstein’s situation isn’t totally different from those of other detainees in the hospital. The former movie mogul can eat only hospital food and must wear sweats issued by the jail. He was forced to remove a Yankees baseball hat and sweatshirt, according to one of the jail sources. His visitors also must first go to the 19th floor to be screened and searched before they are allowed to meet him, the jail insiders said. But it is still more convenient than the hours-long screening process that takes place on Rikers. Until last month, Weinstein was incarcerated at the Mohawk Correctional Facility, about 100 miles northwest of Albany. He was moved back to city custody after New York’s highest court vacated his conviction, ruling that a trial judge unfairly allowed jurors to see and hear evidence that was not directly related to the charges.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anti-abortion-laws-linked-to-increase-in-domestic-violence-deaths_n_663926fde4b00641c49638e5,"Anti-Abortion Laws Linked To Increase In Domestic Violence Deaths, Study Shows",alanna vagianos,5/6/2024,"Anti-abortion laws increase the likelihood that pregnant victims of domestic violence will be murdered by their abusive partner, according to a new study. The study, published Monday in a leading peer-reviewed health care journal Health Affairs, looked at data from 2014 to 2020 to analyze the link between anti-abortion laws and intimate partner violence before the Dobbs decision that repealed Roe v. Wade. The authors of the study were prompted to research this intersection because of one indisputable fact: Murder by an abusive partner is the leading cause of death for pregnant and postpartum women in the U.S. ― outpacing medical issues like sepsis and hemorrhage. For some victims of intimate partner violence, pregnancy can increase the severity of violence, while for others it can actually initiate abuse in a relationship that was not violent beforehand. Enforcement of just one targeted regulation of abortion providers, also known as a TRAP law, is associated with a 3.4% increase in the rate of intimate partner violence-related homicides, according to the study. Just over 24 domestic violence murders of women and girls between the ages of 10 to 44 during the timeframe analyzed were associated with TRAP laws. These laws often lead to clinic closures, which can completely cut off access to abortion care in a region. Even before Roe fell, TRAP laws made it difficult for many people to get abortions. If a victim of domestic violence can’t access an abortion because their local clinic closed, that victim stays pregnant and is exposed to more lethal violence throughout their pregnancy and the postpartum period. “We know that TRAP laws were some of the most commonly-enacted abortion restrictions across states for the past decade before the Dobbs decision came down,” Maeve Wallace, lead author of the study and a reproductive health care epidemiologist at Tulane University, told HuffPost. “TRAP laws lead to abortion clinic closures, therefore making it more difficult for people to get abortions, especially people without resources who might be in dangerous situations in terms of violence in the home,” she added, noting that TRAP laws are “politically motivated attempts to close clinics.” TRAP laws are state-level restrictions that are designed to make it harder for abortion clinics and staff to provide care. This type of legislation has been weaponized against abortion clinics since the 1992 Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which ruled that states were legally allowed to restrict abortion access as long as it did not impose an “undue burden” on patients. Under the guise of protecting women’s health, TRAP laws go far beyond what’s medically necessary and create a logistical nightmare for clinics to stay open. Some examples of TRAP laws include requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating that clinics be located a certain distance away from schools and forcing physicians to share private medical information to the state government. Most states, including pro-choice states, had some TRAP laws in effect pre-Dobbs, and many still do. Other research suggests that abortion access plays a critical role in reducing intimate partner violence. The Turnaway Study, landmark research published in 2020, found that abortion access can help reduce domestic violence because victims are able to choose whether they want to share a child with their abuser ― a link that lasts a lifetime and makes it harder to leave an abuser.

Although, she pointed to increased awareness and education around abortion, including access to medication abortion through the mail, as one possible reason to be hopeful. Since Roe fell, calls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline about reproductive coercion have doubled across the country.

Phillippe — the oldest child of Witherspoon and ex-husband and fellow actor Ryan Phillippe — shared a video on TikTok over the weekend to address the drama. “NBD but I just achieved a major milestone as a woman online,” her message reads as she begins applying red lipstick in front of the mirror. “I saw 2 different strangers commenting on my body. The first said I should get on Oz*mpic because I’m too fat…” she wrote, censoring the name of Ozempic, a diabetes drug that has become popular for weight loss. “The second accused me of starving myself because I’m too thin... My weight did not change in the time period between their comments. (& it wouldn’t be any of their business if it did!),” her message continued in the Friday post. The internet personality then smeared the lipstick across her cheek while rolling her eyes, adding, “It’s such bullshit.” Ava Phillippe captioned her post, “Pretty is as pretty does, babes … & bodyshaming is simply toxic behavior. 💋.” She went on to clarify that body-shaming isn’t confined to one gender. “P.S. I put ‘woman’ because I see this type of thing happening disproportionately to young girls & women, but let me be clear; body shaming is toxic no matter who the subject is,” she explained. “We all deserve to feel safe & at peace in the vessel we live in.” Ava Phillippe’s Oscar-winning mom took to the comments section to co-sign her message, writing, “Yes to all of this 💋.” The young star’s other TikTok followers also poured out support for her clapback in the comments section. “I have never understood why people think they need to make comments about other people’s bodies.. it’s so, so unnecessary. love you, and this message!!💚,” one person wrote. Another person said, “I wish I would have heard this message as a young woman. I am so impressed with your wisdom and compassion.” “This!!!! we as women do not need any of this toxicity/negativity,” someone else said. “We should be building each other up not tearing each other down. btw, you are a light in this world and absolutely gorgeous ❤️.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

A post shared by Noelia Voigt (@noeliavoigt) In a statement to HuffPost, the Miss USA organization said it supports Voigt’s decision to step down. “The well-being of our titleholders is a top priority, and we understand her need to prioritize herself at this time,” the statement reads. “The organization is currently reviewing plans for the transition of responsibilities to a successor and an announcement regarding the crowning of the new Miss USA will be coming soon.” Voigt won Miss USA in September when she was competing as Miss Utah.

The alleged pause in large shipment of offensive weapons appears to be the first instance of the Biden administration withholding U.S.-made arms from Israel since Oct. 7, when Netanyahu launched a military campaign on Gaza in response to an attack by Hamas militants that killed about 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage, roughly 100 of whom are suspected to still be alive in captivity. The delivery halt was first reported on Sunday by Axios, citing two unidentified Israeli officials who said the incident raised concerns internally, and led officials within Netanyahu’s government to try and figure out why the U.S. was holding the shipment. MSNBC confirmed the halt on Monday, citing two senior Biden administration officials familiar with the decision. The White House, the Pentagon and the Israeli government did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for confirmation of the alleged halt, and the State Department declined to comment. On Monday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby did not confirm nor deny to reporters the shipment hold. Since Israel’s current military campaign began seven months ago, health officials in the Palestinian territories say soldiers have killed more than 34,000 people, displaced most of the population, destroyed important infrastructure like hospitals and universities, detained and tortured civilians, and created a widespread famine by blocking most humanitarian aid from entering the enclave. Israeli troops and settlers have also been attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, which is not governed by Hamas. Since Oct. 7, the U.S. has given unconditional support to Israel, sending many of the weapons that soldiers end up using to bomb Gaza. President Joe Biden started a trend of warning Israel about its behavior in Gaza while imposing no consequences on the country for ignoring said warnings ― making this reported hold in weapons shipment a significant elevation in tensions between Biden and Netanyahu. Biden has faced strong opposition both domestically and globally for continuing to support Israel, even as the country stands accused before the International Court of Justice of committing genocide against Palestinians, an allegation it vehemently denies. Students across the U.S. have been met with police brutality for campus protests against Israel’s offensive and the Biden administration’s role in it ― demonstrations of a scale and intensity arguably not seen in the U.S. since the Vietnam War ― while a growing number of lawmakers are calling for the U.S. to put conditions on its billions in military aid to Israel. After more than a dozen senators demanded assurances that all countries receiving U.S. weapons comply with international and U.S. law prohibiting violence against civilians and attempts to block humanitarian aid, Biden issued a policy in February that requires federal agencies to report to Congress by May 8 on whether they believe Israel is violating those laws. Netanyahu has repeatedly made it clear that the Israeli military will move forward with its plan to launch a ground offensive on Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city where more than a million Palestinians are currently taking refuge. Soldiers have already been raining bombs on Rafah for weeks, but the prime minister said in recent days that Israel will invade the city regardless of whether his government reaches a deal with Hamas for the release of hostages and a temporary cease-fire. The U.S. and the international community have vocally opposed a Rafah invasion due to the high civilian casualties likely to result from such a siege, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken telling Netanyahu last week that a “major military operation” in Rafah would negatively affect U.S.-Israel relations and U.S. policy toward the offensive in Gaza. “In the terrible Holocaust, there were great world leaders who stood by idly,” Netanyahu said on Sunday in commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Day. “Therefore, the first lesson of the Holocaust is: If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us. And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

In an online interview with journalist Dan Wootton, Spacey said he has never done anything illegal and admitted that he has struggled to get back to work after being acquitted last year of criminal charges in a London court. “I can’t go through this again, allowing myself to be baselessly attacked without defending myself,” he said in the interview entitled “Kevin Spacey: Right Of Reply” which was aired late Friday on Wootton’s YouTube channel. Last July, a London jury acquitted Spacey on sexual assault charges stemming from allegations by four men dating back 20 years. The court victory was his second since he saw off a $40 million lawsuit in 2022 in New York brought by “Star Trek: Discovery” actor Anthony Rapp. The documentary “Spacey Unmasked” was set to be aired Tuesday and Wednesday and 7 on Channel 4 in Britain and streamed on Max in the U.S. The documentary is said to feature testimony from men regarding events between 1976 and 2013, the actor revealed during the interview. “I take full responsibility for my past behaviour and my actions, but I cannot and will not take responsibility or apologize to anyone who’s made up stuff about me or exaggerated stories about me,” said Spacey, who won Academy Awards for “The Usual Suspects” and “American Beauty”. “I’ve never told someone that if they give me sexual favors, then I will help them out with their career, never,” he added. Spacey, who served as artistic director of the Old Vic Theatre in London from 2004 to 2015, again admitted that he was a “flirt” with men in their 20s and that he made “clumsy” passes at times. “I’ve clearly hooked up with some men, who thought they might get ahead in their careers by having a relationship with me,” he said. “But there was no conversation with me, it was all part of their plan, a plan that was always destined to fail, because I wasn’t in on the deal.

That seems to be the approach South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem is taking regarding press interviews for her controversial new political memoir, “No Going Back: The Truth on What’s Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward.” Noem’s book is being released tomorrow, but the governor and her book have already come under fire. One of the anecdotes, a supposed meeting she had with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un while serving in Congress on the House Armed Services Committee has been called “bullshit” by people in the know on Capitol Hill. Noem refused to deny the anecdote Sunday on “Face The Nation,” and again on Monday during an interview on “CBS This Morning” where she continued to avoid giving straight answers. In the process, she frustrated CBS anchors Natalie Morales and Nate Burleson. It started when Morales noted that the passage where Noem claimed she met the North Korean dictator is now being removed from the book at the governor’s request. Noem tried to make it sound like it wasn’t completely sketchy to delete an anecdote from an already-published book saying that the content was changed when she “became aware of that.” She added: “And, you know, I appreciate that. I’ve met with many, many world leaders. I’ve traveled around the world. I should not have put that anecdote in the book. And at my request, they have removed it.” Burleson tried to pin her down. “That specific meeting didn’t happen?” he asked. “I’m saying that I’m not talking about that meeting. I’m not talking about my meetings with world leaders,” she said. Morales quickly noted that Noem actually does talk about meetings with world leaders in her book. “There are some that are in the book, and then there’s some that’s not in the book,” Noem said. Morales immediately pointed to two specific mentions of meeting Kim, and quoted a line from the book before asking, “Did you tell your ghostwriter to write them?” Noem didn’t give a straight answer, saying that over the past 30 years she has traveled around the world and met with various leaders. “And that anecdote, I’ve asked them to change the content, and it will be removed,” she said. “It’s a simple question,” Morales snapped. “Did you or did you not meet with Kim Jong Un?” Noem continued to dodge the question. “That’s the answer that I have for you, is that I’m― It will be adjusted. And as soon as I became aware of it, that content was removed,” she said. You can see the exchange below. Beyond parody: On CBS this morning, Kristi Noem still wouldn't provide a straight answer to the question of whether she ever met Kim Jong Un. She brought up other unspecified meetings she had with world leaders as though that justifies fabricating a meeting with the NK dictator. pic.twitter.com/REuhbIlp4x Noem’s insistence on continuing to avoid directly answering questions about the Kim Jong Un meeting resulted in much mockery on X, formerly Twitter. Why am I getting the feeling that she wanted to eat dog with Kim Jong Un https://t.co/y4SmqvubkI The lie is bad, and probably disqualifying from any position of public trust. The utter inability to construct a response is an indication of actual incompetence. https://t.co/BPtrMBZ2wK Maybe Kristi Noem should just stop going on tv. https://t.co/klylZKz4vU BREAKING: Kristi Noem continues to dodge questions about her imaginary meeting with Kim Jong Un.For someone who tried to cast herself as courageous, her refusal to admit she lied is craven and cowardly.pic.twitter.com/cXatxg958H Two days in a row she says this gobbledygook. Maybe it's me, but I think I'd be pretty dadgum certain I'd remember if I met with Kim Jung Un, who's fairly notorious. There's zero reason to equivocate. What the heck? https://t.co/8bzjkRwW4b She literally claimed she met with Kim(total lie), then said it was the fault of her ghost writer, but probably can’t account for why the lie is narrated by her in the audio version. Freaking mendacious nut job. https://t.co/mucH3JnCtG Here's the point: after she lied on @cbs yesterday why the fuck did these idiots on @CBSMornings put Kristi Noem on AGAIN this morning? #KristiGnome https://t.co/28QOtZt6Li The next four years will change America forever.

Basem Naim, the chief of Hamas’ political and foreign relations department and a member of its Gaza bureau, had told HuffPost that Hamas accepted ideas crafted by Qatar and Egypt amid intensive negotiations that involved the U.S. It was “early” to reveal terms of the plan, Naim said. Israeli officials quickly questioned the bargain to which Hamas was referring, suggesting it was nowhere near anything Israel had offered. Diplomatic sources told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that was untrue, saying the deal resembled an offer previously accepted by Israel. Shortly thereafter, the Israeli cabinet announced that it saw Hamas’ position as “far from Israel’s necessary requirements” and it would continue ratcheting up an Israeli assault on the Gazan town of Rafah, where 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering and remaining Hamas battalions operate. Israel will dispatch a team for discussions with their Egyptian and Qatari intermediaries with Hamas “to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to Israel,” the statement added. It’s unclear how seriously the Palestinian faction or other players involved in the negotiations will now take that effort: A U.S. official told Reuters that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his war cabinet ― including his rival, Washington favorite Benny Gantz ― “have not appeared to approach the latest phase of negotiations in good faith.” The talks address the release of Israeli hostages captured by Hamas and its allies in the Oct. 7 attack that began the war, a halt to Israeli bombing and deployments in Gaza and Israel freeing Palestinian prisoners. Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya told Al Jazeera the agreement his group accepted envisioned a three-stage truce, culminating in a full Israeli withdrawal from the strip.

He has rejected concerns from the U.S. and humanitarian groups over the devastating likely toll of invading the city, as well as U.S. suggestions to allow Palestinian self-governance in the region by entities other than Hamas. The fast-moving developments felt like whiplash for many of those most directly affected by the conflict. Palestinians in Rafah had been panicking after receiving Israeli evacuation orders earlier in the day, then celebrated when they heard about Hamas’ agreement of a cease-fire. In Israel, protesters against Netanyahu, many of whom see him as fixated on prolonging the war and insufficiently committed to bringing home Hamas hostages, led huge demonstrations urging him to accept the agreement, only to ultimately be disappointed.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced on Monday his intention to seek reelection to a fourth term in the Senate, citing the threats to democracy at home and abroad. The 82-year-old independent senator made the announcement in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter: Let me thank the people of Vermont, from the bottom of my heart, for giving me the opportunity to serve them in the United States Senate. It has been the honor of my life.Today, I am announcing my intention to seek another term. Here is why: pic.twitter.com/cfO8MF4Cep In the video, Sanders hit on familiar themes he has championed during his time in office, including doing more to address wealth inequality, climate change, health care, and abortion rights. He also called the 2024 presidential election “the most consequential election in our lifetimes.” “Will the United States continue to even function as a democracy, or will we move to an authoritarian form of government?” Sanders asked. Sanders currently serves as chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, where he has been focused on bringing down the cost of prescription drugs and expanding government support for seniors. A member of the Senate Democratic leadership team, the progressive senator has also been focused on Israel’s war in Gaza following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, advocating for conditioning U.S. aid to Israel unless it changes its military tactics. “Israel had the absolute right to defend itself against this terror attack, but it did not and does not have the right to go to war against the entire Palestinian people which is exactly what it is doing,” Sanders said.

He was also warned that, going forward, overstepping the bounds of the order could land him behind bars. Trump is accused of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in order to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan fined the former president $1,000 for attacking the trial’s jurors and the process of selecting them while speaking in the courthouse hallway after opening statements last month. “You know [the judge is] rushing the trial like crazy. Nobody’s ever seen a thing go like this,” Trump said in the offending comments, on April 22. “That jury was picked so fast — 95% Democrats. The area’s mostly all Democrat... just a purely Democrat area. It’s a very unfair situation, that I can tell you.” Merchan, writing in his order, found that Trump had “again raised the specter of fear for the safety of the jurors and of their loved ones.” The judge told the courtroom that he understands Trump’s consequential role as a former U.S. president ― and as the presumptive GOP nominee in the upcoming presidential election as well. “The magnitude of such a decision is not lost on me, but at the end of the day, I have a job to do,” Merchan said Monday. His job, he said, includes protecting the “integrity of the judicial system.” “Going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,” Merchan warned. Prosecutors have asked the judge to consider a total of 14 alleged gag order violations since Trump’s trial began last month. The judge has agreed on 10 of them, fining Trump $10,000 so far, or $1,000 for each violation. Other comments that got Trump in trouble included a reposted social media clip from Fox News host Jesse Watters claiming that “they are catching undercover Liberal Activists lying to the Judge in order to get on the Trump Jury.” The next four years will change America forever.

The comments that did not get Trump in trouble included certain attacks on the credibility of Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, and calling ex-AMI CEO David Pecker “a nice guy,” which, it was argued, could be interpreted as an attempt to sway or intimidate the witness. Cohen is expected to testify in the trial in the coming days, as he was responsible for carrying out the payment to Daniels. Pecker testified earlier in the trial about an informal agreement he had with Trump in which Pecker would use his tabloids to elevate Trump’s 2016 campaign, disparage Trump’s political enemies, and keep an ear out for information that might be harmful to Trump — such as Daniels’ story.

The chaos at the Jesus’ Dwelling Place Church in North Braddock took place Sunday while the service was being livestreamed, state police said in a news release. Bernard J. Polite, 26, of Braddock entered the church just after 1 p.m. and walked toward the front while the Rev. Glenn Germany was giving a sermon, police said. The pastor told WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh that Polite smiled at him and they made eye contact just before Polite pointed the gun at him. Germany then ducked out of the way as a male congregant tackled Polite. Germany and the congregant then worked together to wrest the gun away from Polite, who was soon subdued and held until state troopers arrived. Polite said “God told me to do it” and that he planned to shoot Germany and “wait to be arrested” so he could go to jail and clear his mind, according to court documents. He faces numerous charges, including aggravated assault and attempted homicide, and was being held Monday without bail at the Allegheny County Jail. State police said they they didn’t know if Polite has an attorney, and county court records did not list one. The body of a shooting victim was found in a home near the church where Polite had been shortly before going to the church, county police said. The county Medical Examiner’s office identified the body Monday as Derek Polite, 56, of North Braddock, but did not say if he was related to Bernard Polite. Polite was not known at the church, officials said. He wandered over to the church after hearing music coming from there, according to court documents.

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) uttered the obvious logic that he wanted progressives to hear in case they want to vote against President Joe Biden ― or not vote at all. (Watch the video below.) The lawmaker cited apathy and perhaps “voters voting against their own self-interest” as possible contributors to a Trump victory. In an interview on Sunday with public affairs expert Mathew Littman for MeidasTouch, Lieu pleaded with unconvinced liberals to look deeply at their self-interests and embrace them. Casting a vote for Trump or any other candidate besides Biden out of disgust, or sitting out the election altogether, is inviting disaster on a volatile scale, Lieu said. That includes a possibly continued right-wing shaping of the Supreme Court. Littman, a former speechwriter for Biden, noted the prospect of the Justice Department being gutted, opponents of the administration going to jail, and Trump’s extreme immigration crackdown if apathy prevails. Lieu took it from there. “Donald Trump incited an insurrection, an attack on our nation’s Capitol,” he said. “A hundred and forty law enforcement officers were assaulted and injured, some critically. And if he becomes president and he feels like he was rewarded for that behavior, what else do you think he’s gonna do? He can do quite a bit, because in his mind, he incited insurrection and the American people made him president again. You think there’s going to be anything to hold him back? I don’t think so.” Lieu: Trump incited an attack on our nation’s Capitol… If he becomes president and feels rewarded for that behavior, what else do you think he's going to do? He can do quite a bit. Do you think there's going to be anything that will hold him back?

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/john-hostettler-pro-israel-groups-gop-primary_n_6638117ee4b0e44cfb120fb4,Why Pro-Israel Groups Are Targeting An Indiana Republican,daniel marans,5/6/2024,"On Tuesday, a passionate opponent of American involvement in overseas wars squares off against pro-Israel groups who accuse him of antisemitism and have heavily outspent him in a contentious primary race. The catch? While virtually all of the big spending on U.S.-Israel policy in recent years has been in Democratic primaries, this time the candidate in question, former Rep. John Hostettler, is a Republican. Hostettler is vying for the GOP nomination in Indiana’s 8th Congressional District, a solid Republican seat in the Hoosier State’s southwestern corner which he previously represented from 1995 to 2007. Some pro-Israel donors also backed the conservative Democrat who unseated him in 2006. His chief opponent is state Sen. Mark Messmer, who has attracted the support of deep-pocketed outside groups concerned about Hostettler’s record on Israel and comments about the Jewish identities of policymakers involved in planning the Iraq War. Hostettler is defiant. In an April Facebook post that employed antisemitic tropes, the former congressman joked that the pro-Israel groups spending against him are “DEFINITELY NOT a cabal.” The Republican Jewish Coalition’s super PAC has spent nearly $1 million boosting Messmer on the airwaves. Matt Brooks, executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition, said that Hostettler’s out-of-print 2008 book, “Nothing for the Nation: Who Got What Out of Iraq,” promoted “centuries-old antisemitic tropes about the influence of Jews in politics.” “He was consistently one of the most anti-Israel votes in Congress,” Brooks added. “There’s not a lot of ambiguity there.” The American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s super PAC, United Democracy Project, has also spent nearly $1.3 million attacking Hostettler. Hostettler is the first Republican candidate to be on the receiving end of UDP’s money cannon since AIPAC created the group in 2021. Patrick Dorton, a spokesperson for UDP, likened Hostettler to Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), another libertarian-minded paleoconservative whose opposition to foreign aid, including to Israel, has earned him AIPAC and UDP’s ire. “Our focus is not letting detractors of the U.S.-Israel relationship of either party be elected to Congress.” “Hostettler was the Tom Massie of his era when he was in Congress, virulently anti-Israel,” Dorton said in a statement. “Our focus is not letting detractors of the U.S.-Israel relationship of either party be elected to Congress. Hostettler has a terrible record on Israel and doesn’t reflect the views of his constituents on the issue.” Although United Democracy Project’s goal is to elect candidates aligned with its pro-Israel mission, it has generally avoided mentioning Israel policy in its ads in Democratic primaries. That’s likely because Democratic primary voters in most districts would not base their vote on a candidate’s Israel record, and are generally more critical of Israeli policy than AIPAC or UDP. But in a Republican primary, where voters are staunchly pro-Israel and more likely to see it as a salient issue this year, the calculus is different. One of UDP’s TV ads focuses entirely on Hostettler’s Israel record. “What kind of Republican votes against supporting Israel?” the narrator asks as ominous music plays. “John Hostettler did.” In the 30-second spot, UDP highlights not only Hostettler’s annual votes against foreign aid spending, including to Israel, but also his status as one of nine House Republicans to vote against an October 2000 resolution condemning Palestinian terrorism and expressing support for Israel at the start of the Second Palestinian Intifada. Of course, the race has attracted outside money from other sources as well. Messmer, the preferred candidate of the pro-Israel groups, also has the support of the super PAC America Leads Action, a group funded by Walmart heir Rob Walton that has spent over $1.5 million attacking Hostettler. Hostettler has not been entirely without outside help either, though his funding pales in comparison to Messmer’s. The American Leadership PAC, whose top funder is Tom Klingenstein, chair of the Claremont Institute, an “America First” think tank, has spent over $230,000 on advertisements for Hostettler. And the Protect Freedom PAC, which is backed by pro-Israel private equity billionaire Jeffrey Yass, has spent nearly $500,000 on Hostettler’s behalf. Amid Israel’s invasion of Gaza, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, debate has raged over when Israel criticism veers into antisemitism. Although Israel supporters have mainly trained their fire at critics on the left, Hostettler is part of a long history of paleoconservatives whose statements about the U.S.-Israel relationship have gotten them in hot water. Like Massie, Hostettler has questioned Israel supporters’ loyalty to the United States. And like prominent paleoconservative Pat Buchanan, he believed that proponents of the Iraq War were promoting Israel’s interests over those of the United States. Hostettler’s 2008 book, “Nothing for the Nation,” is out of print, and not available for order at major online book retailers. Hostettler’s critics mostly reference excerpts of the book cited in a scathing 2008 column in the Jewish Standard about it by Abe Foxman, then-national director of the Anti-Defamation League. Hostettler zeroed in on Jewish Bush administration Pentagon official Douglas Feith’s founding of a law firm with “Marc Zell, who was a resident of Israel,” italicizing the words for emphasis, according to Foxman. Foxman also quotes Hostettler as recounting a time when he asked, “Why did Messrs. [Paul] Wolfowitz, Feith, [David] Wurmser, [Abram] Shulsky, and [Lawrence] Franklin fashion intelligence in support of the spurious claim of the presence of a WMD program in Iraq to draw the United States into a conflict that would lead to the demise of the regime of Saddam Hussein?” The answer he received was, “‘In the defense of the nation Israel.’” Many neoconservative proponents of the Iraq War were Jewish, but the top policymakers in charge at the time ― President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ― were not Jewish. Rather than seek to clarify his intentions, Hostettler doubled down on questionable innuendo in a Facebook post in early April. He was responding to an article in Jewish Insider about AIPAC’s super PAC launching an ad blitz against him. Hostettler repeatedly describes Foxman as a rabbi even though he is not, and mocks the ADL as the ADLF — “Anti-Defamation of Leo Frank.” Leo Frank, the sole Jewish person to be lynched in the United States, was kidnapped from his prison cell by a mob that murdered him in Georgia in 1915. The historical consensus is that Frank, a pencil factory superintendent in Atlanta, was wrongfully convicted of the murder of a young girl, but Hostettler is apparently sympathetic to revisionist histories of what occurred. (Frank’s trial was one of the reasons for the ADL’s founding in 1913.) Then Hostettler quotes a part of the Jewish Insider article recounting that a “loose network” of donors with “strong ties to AIPAC” supported the Democratic challenger who unseated Hostettler in 2006. “Friends, help me out here. I’m thinking of a word. That word is often used to describe the work of ‘a loose network’ of persons with ‘strong ties’ to an organization who ‘organize against’ one person to defeat that person’s goal,” Hostettler wrote sarcastically. “It’s on the tip of my tongue. I mean, it’s right there. Oh! Don’t worry. It’ll come to me, I’m sure.” “Who knows? Maybe they’ll be successful again,” he added. “And by ‘they’ I mean that ‘loose network’ — that doesn’t seem quite as ‘loose’ today as in 2006 — DEFINITELY NOT some ‘cabal.’” But the primary in Indiana’s 8th is not just about charges of antisemitism. The rival ad campaigns also reflect a Republican proxy war over foreign policy that extends beyond Israel. While both candidates emphasize their commitment to ending illegal immigration, and completing Trump’s border wall, the American Leadership PAC spot also notes Hostettler’s support for “ending billions in foreign aid to corrupt countries like Ukraine.” “America First conservative John Hostettler will partner with President Trump to defeat the radical left and the weak RINOs in D.C.,” the spot also says. “He was taking very unpopular views on foreign policy long before candidate Trump came along and made it OK to question the Iraq War.” A Protect Freedom PAC ad is narrated entirely by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a fellow anti-interventionist whose father, former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas), worked alongside Hostettler in the House. Hostettler and the elder Paul were two of the six House Republicans who voted against authorizing the Iraq War in 2002. As footage of Biden meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appears on-screen, Paul says he “trusts” Hostettler to “stop sending our taxpayer dollars overseas.” It’s unclear how much either Messmer or Hostettler have themselves brought up foreign policy on the campaign trail. Both candidates’ campaigns have limited social media presences and did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment about their positions. The one TV ad available on Messmer’s YouTube page highlights his background as a businessman and engineer, as well as his “plan” to end birthright citizenship and “stop Biden’s inflation.” Still, it’s clear from Hostettler’s record he represents the smaller, but growing wing of the Republican Party that sees anti-interventionism as an inextricable component of what it means to be a Trump-aligned, “America First” Republican. There is a long tradition of opposition to U.S. entanglements in foreign wars on the American right. The school of thought, dubbed “isolationism” by its critics, has its intellectual roots in the famous John Quincy Adams speech that the U.S. “goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy,” according to Kelley Vlahos, a senior adviser for the restraint-oriented Quincy Institute, and editorial director for Responsible Statecraft. “He warned that going out and trying to create little Americas everywhere would actually come back and boomerang against our own liberty at home,” Vlahos said. But the U.S.’s entry into World War II and the subsequent Cold War with the Soviet Union turned dovish conservatives into a minority faction within the Republican Party. The rise of the militant — and deeply pro-Israel — neoconservatives in the 1980s, and their prominence during the global war on terror in the 2000s, made figures like Hostettler dissenters — paleoconservatives hearkening to an older and less fashionable tradition. If Hostettler and Ron Paul kept the paleoconservative foreign policy flame alive in Congress, figures like Buchanan, a former Republican White House aide and presidential candidate, shepherded the movement’s intellectual arm. Buchanan was a bitter skeptic of the U.S.’s unconditional support for Israel, and a rare and outspoken conservative voice against the Iraq War. Trump’s nomination and election brought the foreign policy views of Buchanan and Hostettler back to the fore of the Republican Party. Once in office, the reality star-turned-populist commander in chief’s commitment to anti-interventionism was iffy at best, granting Ukraine lethal aid that former President Barack Obama had denied the country, tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, and backing Saudi Arabia’s brutal invasion of Yemen. But Trump’s broadsides against the Iraq War, his skepticism of NATO, his ambivalence about taking sides in the Russia-Ukraine war, and his general insistence on the primacy of narrow U.S. interests when considering action abroad have at least created the space for more Republicans in Hostettler’s mold. “Hostettler was a bit ahead of his time, so to speak,” Vlahos said. “He was taking very unpopular views on foreign policy long before candidate Trump came along and made it OK to question the Iraq War.” “Hostettler may be paying for it now,” she added. “But he has more company in the conservative base than he had before.” The intellectual strain that Hostettler represents is enough for some of today’s self-described “America First” conservatives to regard the current barrage of attack ads against him as a purely ideological vendetta.

McDougal shared a photograph of what appeared to be her legs inside a bubble-filled bathtub alongside a glass of red wine, a lit candle and a copy of Ronan Farrow’s 2019 book “Catch and Kill.” “#Reflecting,” she captioned the image. #Reflecting pic.twitter.com/BIX8j5Du5M Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Trump is currently on trial in New York for allegedly falsifying business documents to cover up a payment made to porn actor Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. The money was in exchange for Daniels’ silence over their earlier alleged affair. McDougal has said she had a monthslong affair with Trump from 2006 to 2007. Trump married his third wife, Melania Trump, in 2004. Trump has denied a relationship with McDougal. But the National Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc., has previously confirmed it paid McDougal $150,000 for the exclusive rights to her and Trump’s alleged romance as part of its “catch and kill” scheme to nix potentially damaging stories about Trump from coming out during his 2016 presidential run. Former Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified about the payment to McDougal, which is not part of the criminal case against Trump, during the first week of Trump’s trial. McDougal’s choice of bath-time reading was pertinent. Farrow’s book exposed how high-profile public figures and organizations tried to cover up damaging stories. It included details on the Enquirer’s alleged destruction of sensitive documents about Trump before the 2016 election. The next four years will change America forever.

Noting that the past few weeks have been “incredibly difficult” for the community, the school said in its announcement that it made the decision after discussions with students. “Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,” officials said. “They are eager to cross the stage to applause and family pride and hear from their school’s invited guest speakers.” Most of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take place about 5 miles north at Columbia’s sports complex, officials said. Columbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 100 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia’s green were arrested last month, and similar encampments sprouted up at universities around the country as schools struggled with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while maintaining safe and inclusive campuses. The University of Southern California earlier canceled its main graduation ceremony while allowing other commencement activities to continue. Students abandoned their camp at USC early Sunday after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest. The next four years will change America forever.

The protests stem from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced most of its inhabitants.

The stunt bared the Russian president’s “violent nature,” the colleague said he was told by Berlusconi, who died in 2023. Fabrizio Cicchitto, an ex-senator in Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party, told the newspaper Corriere della Sera on Sunday of the pair’s hunting trip in 2013 at one of Putin’s vacation homes. According to a translation by Politico, Putin spotted two deer and handed his rifle to novice Berlusconi, who declined to shoot. So Putin gunned down the two animals, quartered one of them and pulled out its heart as Berlusconi watched. “Vladimir showed me a violent nature that I didn’t imagine in such a kind and rational man,” Berlusconi said, per Cicchitto. A man from Putin’s entourage then served Berlusconi the bleeding organ on a tray and said it would be an exceptional meal. Berlusconi said the episode was perhaps “just a hunter’s custom,” Cicchitto recalled Putin has admitted in the past that some of his wildlife stunts have been staged, but his deer-hunting trip with Berlusconi appeared to linger in the controversial three-time premier’s memory.

The seven-time Super Bowl Champion, the subject of Netflix’s “The Greatest Roast of All Time” at the Kia Forum, objected to Ross’ wisecrack while the comedian reflected on Brady’s beginnings with his longtime NFL team. “So Tom became a Patriot and moved up to New England, and on the first day of training camp, that scrawny rookie famously walked into the owner Robert Kraft’s office and said, ‘I’m the best decision your organization has ever made. Would you like a massage?’” quipped Ross. The comedian’s joke refers to an incident in 2019 where Kraft was charged with soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Florida. The charges were later dropped against Kraft the following year. Brady exited his seat and approached Ross just as the comedian blew a kiss toward Kraft in the crowd and declared his love for the Patriots owner. “Don’t say that shit again,” Brady told Ross before turning to head back to his seat. “OK, OK,” replied Ross, who threw up his hands in response. “He’s having fun, look at him. I love what you do for the Jews, Robert Kraft. You’re incredible.” Kraft was later seen laughing on camera, and following Ross’ remarks at the roast, he shared a hug with the iconic quarterback on stage.

Cornell said sometimes it can be “slim pickings” when choosing what moment of the trial to commit to paper. “You see through this window.

Trump is facing 34 felony charges related to his purported efforts to conceal claims of extramarital affairs that emerged during his 2016 presidential campaign. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s case centers on $130,000 in hush money paid to adult film actor Stormy Daniels. It also focuses on the role of Trump and his team in a “catch and kill” scheme whereby the National Enquirer, then run by David Pecker, buried negative stories about Trump, including one regarding an alleged affair with Playboy model Karen McDougal. Daniels is testifying in the trial. Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who spent time behind bars over his role in the hush money scheme, is also expected to take the witness stand.

Relying on taped audio from one attendee and the accounts of others, The Post wrote that GOP presidential candidate Trump “complained about having to take so many pictures with donors and told people in the crowd that if they didn’t get a picture, it was because they didn’t give enough money.” He also told supporters that a wedding at his Florida estate got preference over them “because the wedding was paying more per person to be there.” The report indicated just how steep the price was for attention at the Republican National Committee function. “Anyone who makes a $1 million donation right now to the Republican Party … I will let you come up and speak,” Trump declared, per The Post. Two donors went on stage and one proclaimed: “Donald J. Trump is the person that God has chosen.” The fundraiser followed a profitable April for Trump’s presidential campaign and the RNC. The two said they raised more than $76 million, Reuters reported, despite the former president’s ongoing trial for allegedly disguising hush money payments to a porn star as business expenses.

Baja California state prosecutors said the relatives had viewed the corpses recovered from a remote well about 50 feet (15 meters) deep and recognized them as their loved ones. Thieves apparently killed the three, who were on a surfing trip to Mexico’s Baja peninsula, to steal their truck because they wanted the tires. They then allegedly got rid of the bodies by dumping them in a well near the coast. The well was located some 4 miles (6 kilometers) from where the foreigners were killed, and also contained a fourth cadaver that had been there much longer. Three suspects are being held in connection with the case, which locals said was solved far more quickly than the disappearances of thousands of Mexicans. The three men were on a camping and surfing trip along a stretch of coast south of the city of Ensenada, posting idyllic photos on social media of waves and isolated beaches, before they went missing last weekend. Chief state prosecutor María Elena Andrade Ramírez described what likely would have been moments of terror that ended the trip for brothers Jake and Callum Robinson from Australia and American Jack Carter Rhoad. She theorized the killers drove by and saw the foreigners’ pickup truck and tents and wanted to steal their tires. But “when (the foreigners) came up and caught them, surely, they resisted.” She said that’s when the killers would have shot the tourists. The thieves then allegedly went to what she called “a site that is extremely hard to get to” and allegedly dumped the bodies into a well they apparently were familiar with. She said investigators were not ruling out the possibility the same suspects also dumped the first, earlier body in the well as part of previous crimes. “They may have been looking for trucks in this area,” Andrade Ramírez said. The thieves allegedly covered the well with boards. “It was literally almost impossible to find it,” Andrade Ramírez said, and it took two hours to winch the bodies out of the well. Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers expressed sympathy for the Robinson family. “I think the whole country’s heart goes out to all of their loved ones. It has been an absolutely horrendous, absolutely horrific ordeal and our thoughts are with all of them today,” he said at a news conference Monday in the capital, Canberra. The site where the bodies were discovered near the township of Santo Tomás was near the remote seaside area where the missing men’s tents and truck were found Thursday along the coast. From their last photo posts, the trip looked perfect. But even experienced local expatriates are questioning whether it is safe to camp along the largely deserted coast anymore. The moderator of the local Talk Baja internet forum, who has lived in the area for almost two decades, wrote in an editorial Saturday that “the reality is, the dangers of traveling to and camping in remote areas are outweighing the benefits anymore.” But in a way, adventure was key to the victims’ lifestyle. Callum Robinson’s Instagram account contained the following slogan: “If you’re not living on the edge, you’re taking up too much room.” At the news conference, Andrade Ramírez was questioned by one reporter who expressed approval that such a massive and rapid search was mounted for the foreigners, but asked why, when local people disappear in the area, little is often done for weeks, months, or years. “Do you have to be a foreigner in Baja California in order for there to be an investigation if something happens to you?′ asked the reporter, who did not identify herself by name. ”Every investigation is different,” Andrade Ramírez replied. As if to underscore that point, dozens of mourners, surfers and demonstrators gathered in a main plaza in Ensenada, the nearest city, to voice their anger and sadness at the deaths. “Ensenada is a mass grave,” read one placard carried by protesters. “Australia, we are with you,” one man scrawled on one of the half-dozen surf boards at the demonstration. A woman held up a sign that read “They only wanted to surf — we demand safe beaches.” Gabriela Acosta, a surfer, attended the protest “to show love, solidarity and respect for the three lives that were lost.” Acosta said that surfers in Baja are aware of the dangers. “We are women and we would sometimes like to surf alone,” Acosta said. “But we never do that, because of the situation. We always have to go accompanied.” “I think that what happened to them is just an example of the lack of safety in this state,” she said. Surfers later performed a “paddle-out” ceremony where they formed a circle on their boards in the ocean. Baja California prosecutors had said they were questioning three people in the killings, two of them because they were caught with methamphetamines. Prosecutors said the two were being held pending drug charges but continue to be suspects in the killings. A third man was arrested on charges of a crime equivalent to kidnapping, but that was before the bodies were found. It was unclear if he might face more charges. The third suspect was believed to have directly participated in the killings. In keeping with Mexican law, prosecutors identified him by his first name, Jesús Gerardo, alias “el Kekas,” a slang word that means “quesadillas,” or cheese tortillas. Andrade Ramírez said he had a criminal record, and that more people may have been involved. The next four years will change America forever.

Robinson said Callum and Jake had not been heard from since April 27. They had booked accommodation in the city of Rosarito, not far from Ensenada. Robinson said Callum was diabetic. She also mentioned that the American who was with them was named Jack Carter Rhoad, but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City did not immediately confirm that. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of a U.S. citizen missing in Baja, but gave no further details. In 2015, two Australian surfers, Adam Coleman and Dean Lucas, were killed in western Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California — also known as the Sea of Cortez — from the Baja peninsula. Authorities said they were victims of highway bandits. Three suspects were arrested in that case.

Protesters gathered to voice their opposition to the U.S.’ support of Israel during the country’s ongoing war against Hamas following the Oct. 7 attacks, part of a growing wave of demonstrations on university campuses around the country. As a small group of students chanted “Free Palestine” and “Stop the Genocide,” they were confronted by a far larger bloc of counter-protesters. Videos of the encounter showed the counter-protest group growing aggressive, surrounding and yelling at the demonstrators. In a disturbing moment, a white student is seen making monkey noises directed at a Black woman as others taunt and cheer. Videos of the counter-protesters were shared widely on social media and prompted support and adulation from Republicans. Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) said the response “warms my heart.” Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) added his own cheers as the Black student was jeered, writing: “Ole Miss taking care of business.” Ole Miss taking care of business. pic.twitter.com/JiL9hs2pHz Jaylin Smith, 24, told CNN she was the woman in the video. The Daily Mississippian, the university’s student newspaper, reported she was called “Lizzo” and various obscenities, with some chanting “Lock her up.” “One thing that will never break me is people taunting me or making monkey noises at me,” Smith, a graduate student at Ole Miss, told CNN. No one was arrested on Thursday. The university said it had opened an investigation into student conduct following the protests, adding it would look into the “hostility and racist overtones.” “While student privacy laws prohibit us from commenting on any specific student, we have opened one student conduct investigation,” university chancellor Glenn Boyce wrote to students and staff on Friday. “We are working to determine whether more cases are warranted.” The next four years will change America forever.

Judge Juan Merchan, who found nine violations and fined Trump $9,000, warned the former president that he could face jail time if he continues to violate the gag order. Prosecutor Christopher Conroy, who argued on Thursday that Trump’s violations were “deliberate,” noted that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office isn’t seeking jail time for the former president as it prefers “to minimize disruptions to this proceeding.” “I think Donald is doing exactly what he’s being given permission to do and what he’s always been doing,” Mary Trump told MSNBC’s Ali Velshi, who noted that the former president’s attacks have continued against Merchan and Bragg and added the two are not protected by the orders. Trump continued: “Nothing stops him because nobody is stopping him. It seems absolutely absurd to me that the prosecution is going out of its way to argue that there should not be an incarceratory penalty at this point. Because what is that financial fine going to do? Nothing.” She added that the judge himself pointed out that a fine is “not a deterrent” for her uncle, noting that “he’ll pay that fine all day long” as $1,000 per offense is the maximum fine allowed by law. “So the offenses will keep piling up unless and until something serious is done,” Mary Trump said.

Sore feet and legs are par for the course at the end of a hike, especially if you’re doing long-distance trails, but you don’t have to grin and bear it — and in fact, you shouldn’t. When your muscles are strained or stressed, they can form small, painful knots called trigger points. According to WebMD, trigger point massage therapy can improve blood flow and muscle relaxation, as well as encourage the release of contracted muscle fibers. The good news is you don’t necessarily have to see a professional every time your muscles are giving you grief: You can manage your trigger points at home through massaging them with your hands or elbows, or by using a tool like a massage ball. Massage balls help increase blood flow and release muscle tension as you roll them over trigger points, and their small shape can help you reach areas of your body you might not be able to massage as easily with just your hands, like your back muscles. Having one in your pack can be a godsend during a hike, and luckily for you, I’ve found one that reviewers swear by: the Rawlogy cork travel masssage ball, available on Amazon now for under $15. You can buy this massage ball in multiple diameters, depending on the areas you want to massage. The extra-small 0.75-inch is ideal for hands and wrists, while the 1.4- or 1.9-inch are the perfect size for your feet. If you want to massage your back muscles, the largest size of 2.5-inch will help you reach all those muscles. No matter the size(s) you choose, the ball can easily fit in your backpack so you don’t have to worry about lugging around a big, bulky tool on your hike. Reviewers are obsessed with how lightweight the recycled cork ball is, too. Multiple reviewers have also pointed out that the Rawlogy ball has been helpful in for their plantar fasciitis and chronic pain. With 4.7 stars across over 1,200 reviews, why not try massaging your trigger points with this ball the next time you’re out on a hike? Take it from the reviews below — just like supportive walking shoes and quick-dry pants, this ball is a must-have for hikers. Check out some informative reviews below or just scroll all the way down to add this nifty little tool to your own Amazon cart. “Came recommended to me to carry along for use after long walks / hiking. Just the right size for carrying along and super light. Feels good to roll under your feet and actually along legs and your back for those tired muscles!” — esola “After seeing a post about how these RAW cork balls helped an AT hiker’s feet on the trail feel better, I instantly purchased a pair for myself. I’ve been struggling with foot pain related to Posterior Tibial Tendonitis. After rolling my foot on these balls several times a day for a week the pain has been decreased immensely. After long hikes my feet used to be INCREDIBLY painful to walk on. It would take ice and ibuprofen and elevation to make them feel better by the next morning. The firm pressure that the raw cork balls provide gets to the pressure points that help release the tight tendons and make the recovery process so much faster. I now roll my feet for 15-20min and ice for 30 min and they feel better instantly. They are lightweight which makes them a backpacker or hiker dream. I plan on taking these with me on all my hikes and rolling my feet at least once during the hike to see if that will help prevent the end of hike pain I am now experiencing. I highly recommend them. Well worth the cost!” — KM “I wish I bought this sooner! I took this along on my recent 4 day trip into the White Mountains. At the end of each day it was great to be able to roll out sore muscles. It made the soreness the following day much better than any of my past overnights. I would highly recommend this to any backpacker doing multiple day hiking. Well worth the minimal extra weight in my opinion.” — l0standw0ndering “Perfect for camp after a long day of hiking. You can rub the sore muscles out or use it on your feet. Ultralight, and takes up almost no room in my pack.” — Joe S “This little cork ball was recommended by the hiking community. This is a very dense cork ball. Much harder then the ones you use on wine bottles. I love using it on the bottom of my feet. Its also small enough to roll between the soft tissues of you’re hand. Its really light weight and amazing for the hiker or anyone with arthritis. I would recommend buying a larger Rawology to roll on the backside. Nothing better then a long day of hiking. Take those shoes off and roll it all over. The reduction in the lactic acid buildup will greatly enhance the ability to hike further. I also was a long time varsity runner and wished I had this years ago.” — Rober P By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. You may have heard of Bobbi Brown’s latest makeup line, Jones Road, whose cream blush Miracle Balm wowed the Internet with its glowy finish and multipurpose usage. The catch? It’s nearly $40. Yet while researching Miracle Balm, I found a doppelgänger blush on Amazon which retails for three times less and which reviewers are positively raving over. Fans insist that this Bayfree glow balm is a great substitute for the Jones Road version. The result? A cheaper, easily blendable, positively glowy balm-blush hybrid that doesn’t feel greasy and sticky on the skin. Reviewers are literally calling it “delightful” and a “dynamite” swap, declaring that the Bayfree balm has essentially won the war between the two beauty products. “Sorry, Bobbi Brown,” wrote one reviewer. “I tried you first, and BayFree wins in the end.” Older reviewers especially appreciate this beauty product, which adds a subtle, “slightly iridescent” glow to the skin while still looking pleasantly natural due to its sheer, buildable formula (and without looking glittery). “I’m 71 years old and still want to look good, but I no longer want to wear all the makeup I used to,” explained one reviewer named Judith. After trying the BayFree balm, she reported that “it works like a dream...at a recent party, everyone wanted to know what I had done to look so good NATURALLY.” Folks also love it for helping them quickly look put together when they’re busy and short on time, with little effort. “If I want to run someplace quick and don’t feel comfortable without some makeup, a little of this across the bridge of my nose and cheeks and what a difference!” a reviewer named Taylor wrote. The trick to making this multi-use blush work its magic? “Smash your thumb into it,” according to one reviewer. In other words, break the waxy seal to get to the cream pigment. Once you’ve broken the seal, you’re good to go. The balm is designed for easy application using just your fingertips, makeup brush or blending sponge optional. Just tap it onto lips, cheeks, eyelids or the bridge of your nose for a pop of healthy, natural color that melts into the skin. You can grab it from Amazon in five different shades: Dewy, a sheer baby pink; Pink Sakura, a cherry blossom hue; Nude Gardenia, a pink-brown hybrid; Pink Camellia, a deep neutral pink and Rose Crystal, a red-brown shade. Grab a pot from Amazon now (you can snag an additional 10% off by clipping the coupon!) or read on for reviewers’ impassioned reviews: “I’m 71 years old and still want to look good, but I no longer want to wear all the make-up I used to. I tried a face balm made by Jones Road. Quite pricey, smells bad, but looks pretty good. Then while browsing thru Amazon I found this Bay Free face balm. It works like a dream! At a recent party, everyone wanted to know what I had done to look so good NATURALLY. I like this product way better than the Jones Road balm. It’s smoother, less expensive, and smells way better. You should try it.” — Judith McEwen “When looking at this, there was a blurb that said this was frequently returned, but yet it has so many good reviews. So I talked myself out of it. Came back a few days later and decided to do it as it’s way cheaper than jones road. I am so impressed. If I want to run someplace quick and don’t feel comfortable without some makeup, a little of this across the bridge of my nose and cheeks and what a difference! It’s really beautiful. Don’t sleep on this. I wish they had some without shimmer as you only need one shade. I don’t think you could use two Without looking too shimmery.” — Taylor “This balm is fantastic. Spreads easily and covers as advertised. I got some Jones Road and was frustrated with how thick and difficult to spread it was, even over moisturizer. Bayfree fixed those issues. I have the green primer, silk smoother, and dewy, still using the Jones Road I have as blush/toner, since I have 3 ounces of the clearly overpriced stuff. DO NOT USE SOMETHING MORE EXPENSIVE WITHOUT TRYING THIS. It’s absolutely amazing.” — Amy Wilson “I have 5 different colors of the JR Balm…they are sticky on your face, any longer hair that is flying around will stick to wherever you put Jones Road Balm. This Dusty Rose dup from BayFree is NOT sticky at all! Yet, all the other features are there: spread beautifully, sheer, staying power, delivers a glow, but NOT greasy and no glitter. For a third of the price, and a better match for my skin for everyday use,a dyomite dup! Highly recommend in place of Jones Road! Sorry, Bobbi Brown. I tried you first, and BayFree wins in the end.” — Janet Allen “This is a delightful product. The consistency is creamy and it melts into the skin. The pinky color and the slight iridescence add a glowy look to my cheeks. It takes such a small amount that this container will last a long time. I feel that it is a great dupe for jones road. Great product!” — julie NC By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bet-app-new-tv-series_n_6632ea0ae4b0fc2b9528309b,BET+ Has So Many Good Shows That Deserve Bigger Audiences,michael arceneaux,5/6/2024,"In the aftermath of the writers and actors strikes, there has been a noticeable contraction in Hollywood, which — to the surprise of no one that knows the industry — has already affected Black-led television shows far worse than their white-led counterparts. As depressing as the state of Black television might feel right now, there are some bright spots. However, they are on a platform I worry not enough people even know about: BET+. Last week, “Diarra from Detroit,” a hilarious dark comedy and mystery series helmed by its star, Diarra Kilpatrick, concluded its delightful eight-episode first season in satisfying fashion. The series follows Diarra Brickland, a public school teacher in the midst of a divorce from her husband Swa (Morris Chestnut). After deciding to hit the dating scene by way of Tinder, she meets a handsome man, they hit it off, and just as she’s looking forward to their second date, he vanishes. Refusing to believe she had been ghosted, she soon finds herself embroiled in a decades-old mystery. For fans of old mysteries like “Murder She Wrote,” “Columbo” and “Perry Mason,” “Diarra from Detroit” plays true to the whodunit format with a voice and wit that is contemporary, and yes, very Black. Or, as the Washington Post’s Helena Andrews-Dyer put it: “What if Nancy Drew were a chic Black woman? That’s ′Diarra from Detroit.’” As I watched the pilot, I did think to myself how nice it was to see Black folks, often solely depicted as the victims in crime shows, drive the narrative ourselves. For better or worse, Americans have developed a collective insatiable appetite for all things murder. “Diarra from Detroit” proves that we, too, can do well with the format, and if anything, can bring hilarity to amateur detective-focused art. More pointedly, the show proves that when it comes to mysteries, Black women don’t just have to be the victims. And while I don’t want to give too much away about the show, believe me when I tell you that you want to see Phylicia Rashad play a character who claims to have slept with the entire original lineup of The Temptations. The show has received rave reviews from critics, and as I’ve noted in recent months, has garnered some impressive press attention via outlets like NPR’s Fresh Air, New York’s Vulture and the Grio. (HuffPost also covered the series as one of the standouts at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2023.) However, when I tried to tell some of my friends — the target demo of Black folks — about the show, I ran into familiar questions: “What’s that?” or “Where can I watch it?” Followed by the usual, “Oh, I’m not paying for that,” or, “I’ll sign up when there’s another BET+ sale,” and of course, “Well, gimme ya password and I’ll check it out.” I heard the same thing about other BET + favorites of mine like, the dark comedy “Average Joe,” created by Robb Cullen and starring Deon Cole, which premiered last June. The series follows a plumber who learns that his recently deceased father stole $10 million from the Russian mafia. My beloved “American Gangsters: Trap Queens” is a docuseries that features Black women accused of all types of crimes, ranging from drug dealing to scamming to public corruption, narrated by Lil’ Kim. There’s “Bigger,” created by Felischa Marye and produced by Will Packer, which follows “five thirty-somethings living in Atlanta as they try to build professional and personal lives they can be proud of.” It wrapped in 2021 following two seasons. And there’s “The Family Business,” helmed by the playwright Carl Weber, a show I would describe as “secular Tyler Perry with a family devoted to drug dealing.” Don’t take that as shade; it is a compliment. In fact, when my mother died last October — though there is no such thing as distraction from a loss like that — I found myself focusing on that show weeks later and binged all of the episodes on Netflix. I mean, where else can you see LisaRaye, Tami Roman, Ernie Hudson, Sheila E. and seemingly half of Black Hollywood all on the same show? I’ve since discovered his other show, “Carl Weber’s The Black Hamptons,” led by Vanessa Bell Calloway as the siddity-but-cutthroat matriarch. There’s the recently released “Churchy,” created by Kevin Fredericks, which chronicles the son of a megachurch pastor who moves to Texas to start his own ministry. For all the criticism BET has garnered over the years — namely about its original programming, or lack thereof — I find the content on the app more interesting than it’s often given credit for. In many cases, the series on the network’s streaming service are arguably more interesting than what’s airing on TV. I enjoy the judge show “Ms. Pat Settles It” on BET, but I sure hope more folks know how well “The Ms. Pat Show” — starring actor/comedian Patricia “Ms. Pat” Williams as a former drug dealer and convicted felon turned suburban mom — works with the old multi-camera sitcom format. When I poll people about the BET+ platform, they usually know Tyler Perry is all over it (I admittedly watch all of the Madea plays on there), but they don’t know much else. Typically, I loathe when people play laptop label-head — or in this case, Google Docs television executive — but I do hope there becomes more symmetry between BET, the cable network, and BET+, the streamer.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-clog-shoes-podiatrists_l_66325f77e4b0fc2b9527ed74,The 1 Shoe Podiatrists Say You Should Try If You’re On Your Feet A Lot,haley zovickian,5/6/2024,"Most footwear trends come and go, but one style that’s garnered a community of lifelong enthusiasts? The ever-practical, stylish yet quirky clog. This stalwart group — of which I am a proud member — can rattle off a plethora of reasons for our devotion to the clog. The comfort! The ease! The support and understated functional chic (which many of us lovingly refer to as “ugly chic”)! But of course, the best person to ask about whether clogs are really worth their salt is a professional — namely, a podiatrist. Huffpost spoke to podiatrist Dr. Saylee Tulpule about her professional take on clog fandom. Tulpule is based in Washington, D.C. and Maryland and is active on Instagram as @thesoledoctor. Tulpule explained that folks who spend a lot of time on their feet often enjoy clogs because of their built-in arch support, their frequently added comfy cushioning and the easy-on, easy-off slip-on style. That’s why “clogs are traditionally worn by professionals who stand all day: nurses, teachers, doctors, chefs, etc.,” she wrote. Clogs are also often slip-resistant and waterproof, an added benefit for active professionals, Tulpule added. The beloved shoes can also be beneficial for those with certain medical conditions. In particular, “Clogs can be comfortable for people that suffer from flat feet, heel pain, tendonitis or even lower back issues due to the degree of arch support and cushion,” Tulpule said. That said, you may want to avoid fashion clogs with high heels over three inches, which can lead to tripping and potentially strain your Achilles tendon, Tulpule noted. In addition, clogs with overly firm wooden soles will not provide the same cushiony support and thus can “aggravate flat feet,” she added. As long as you stick to a practical style without high heels and wooden soles, clogs are one of the best comfy, supportive all-day shoes you’ll find. The best ones to stick to, according to Tulpule? Those from Dansko, Birkenstock and Sanita brands. She noted that the Dansko brand also carries the American Podiatrist Medical Association’s Seal of Approval. Based on Tulpule’s recommendations, we rounded up some of the bestselling Dansko, Birkenstock and Sanita clogs for you to check out, below. And, if you do fall in love with the clog as I once did, congratulations — you’re now part of one of the best footwear fandoms around. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. ""The brands that I advise my patients to research are Dansko [which has the] American Podiatrist Medical Association's Seal of Approval, Birkenstock and Sanita,"" Dr. Saylee Tulpule, a podiatrist based in Washington, D.C and Maryland, told HuffPost. ""For my patients that are professionals, I [recommend] a closed back clog for additional support and minimal risk to 'coming out of the shoe,'"" Tulpule added.Based on Tulpule's recommendation, we selected this bestselling slip-on, closed-back Dansko clog. I own and have walked miles upon miles in this clog. Once sufficiently broken in, this thing proved unparalleled to any other shoe I've owned due to its long-lasting comfort and built-in arch support (which I especially appreciate for my wide, flat feet). This classic Dansko style is available in dozens of designs and colors at Amazon, but I love its oiled black and antique brown styles; they provide a put-together vibe that's served me well everywhere from formal work environments to running errands and drinks out. I even wore these clogs out clubbing once, and while admittedly I was the only one there in clogs, I'll bet I was the happiest and certainly the most pain-free. Needless to say, these Danskos have been a true love affair for me.The style also sports a two-inch heel, which gives my 5'2"" frame a fun height boost.The shoe, pictured left in oiled black and right in blue damask, is available in women's sizes 5-15 and in wide and narrow sizes. Even though I have wide feet, I opted for the regular sizing and was just fine. For the best fit, aim for a pinky-length gap between the back of your foot and the shoe's heel. This quintessentially ugly-chic clog (a compliment, according to clog lovers!) is as resilient and practical as it looks. It's designed to literally repel dirt, oil and grease, plus is water-resistant. The clog's squishy cork-latex footbed is designed to anatomically match the foot for maximum comfort and support. The shoe is also lined with moisture-wicking fabric to minimize stench. You can even throw this in the washing machine up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Even I, a longstanding Dansko lover, am impressed. This might just be my next pick for myself.The Birkenstock Super-Birki clog is available in up to 10 colors, including neutrals and vibrant brights like yellow, green and pink, in women's sizes 4-12.5 and in men's sizes 6-15.5. If you prefer an open-back clog, that's just fine, according to Tulpule. ""It's really one's preference whether to wear a mule-type clog vs a closed toe,"" Tulpule wrote. ""A backless clog will be easier to slip into and reduce chances of friction at the heel counter."" Folks are absolutely obsessed with this open-back Birkenstock style, which you'll find everywhere from college campuses to startup offices and your favorite local walking trail. Birkenstock admits it's the brand's ""most sought after clog,"" no doubt due to the pillowy soft footbed which molds to your foot as you wear it. Plus, the shoe is notoriously lightweight, so you'll feel energized instead of weighed down as you go about your day.The Birkenstock Boston clog has a soft suede leather upper and a luxurious suede leather lining. It's available in up to six colors, regular/wide and medium/narrow widths, women's sizes 4-12.5 and men's sizes 6-17.5. Completely lined with real shearling, Birkenstock's Tokio clog is like if your favorite slippers turned into actual shoes. The clog's deliciously cozy lining — paired with the brand's notoriously comfy contoured footbed — will make you never want to take these off. Equipped with a suede upper and adjustable front and back straps, the clog comes in two colors, men's sizes 6.5-13.5 and women's sizes 4-12.5. Dansko's Ingrid clog balances functional versatility with a classically stylish look. Its chic strap can be worn across the shoe's front (as pictured) for an understated professional vibe, or swung behind the heel for extra support while you're on the go. Plus, as with Dansko's other footwear, the open-back clog has great anti-stub protection thanks to its reinforced toe box, a comfy padded instep and a shock-absorbing bottom that conveniently helps propel you forward as you walk. (I love the rocker-bottom feature in particular: I find it does help propel me forward when I'm getting tired from walking!) Grab the Ingrid clog in two colors and in women's sizes 4.5-12. With a thick shearling cuff and a sweater-like lining, Dansko's Magda clog is a great choice for folks looking for the arch support clogs are known for — with some extra warmth and comfort. The cozy clog is made with a bouncy cork midsole and a non-slip rubber outsole that'll stand the test of inclement outside weather. Grab it in two colors and in women's sizes 5.5-12. This classically stylish sling-back mule features a cushioned leather footbed, a comfy cork sole and a moisture-absorbing lining specifically designed to minimize foot odor. It's available in up to eight colors and women's sizes 5.5-12. These fun Sanita hues let you express your bold personality without saying a word — while delivering all the comfort and arch support that makes clogs so beloved. They're available in up to six colors, including bright red, fuschia and olive, and in women's sizes 3.5-12. This closed-back, patent leather style from Sanita offers a shock-absorbing outsole and a comfy cushioned footbed. It also sports built-in arch support designed to prevent foot and back fatigue, plus a moisture-wicking insole to help cut down on sweat and foot odor.The fixed strap adds some understated personality and style to this foot-loving style.It's available in four colors and in women's sizes 4.5-11. This Sonja mule from Dansko sports a reinforced toe to protect you from stubbing your feet and a unique rocking-bottom sole that's designed to propel you forward as you walk. The clog helps minimize heel friction due to its backless style, plus is made with a wide heel for added stability and a comfy padded instep. To no one's surprise, I also wore this backless Dansko for many years. Beyond its practical features — of which there are delightfully many — I loved the laidback vibe its open-back style provided, plus the opportunity to show off my collection of fun socks (which are usually obscured by closed heels). I also found that the shoe did propel me forward as I walked — a great feature for when you get tired!It's available with leather and fabric uppers, in up to five colors and in women's sizes 4.5-12.

In a Time magazine interview published last week, the presumptive GOP nominee said his acceptance of the 2024 election result would depend “on the fairness of an election.” Trump still refuses to accept his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden with his baseless claim that it was rigged against him. Steele suggested during an interview on MSNBC that “of all the elections that we have had in the history of this country, that your [Trump’s] election is the least honest and the most corrupt, it just shows the fallacy of what the man is laying out there.” Trump “is afraid of losing because it strikes at the core of the thing that is most important to him, and that is his ego,” Steele continued. The four-times-indicted ex-POTUS “doesn’t want to do the work to actually win” but instead just “wants to goad and cajole and bully people into believing something about our system because he is too weak of a man to actually go out and campaign like any other normal candidate would go out and campaign,” he added. “So that is your truth, Donald Trump,” said Steele. Trump is trying to “game the system as he did in ’16 and ’20, to say that, ‘If I don’t win, then the system is corrupt.’ No, Donald Trump, if you don’t win it’s because more people voted against you than for you and our electoral system confirm that,” he added.

They are “making a huge mistake in going after Michael Cohen the way they have,” Conway told MSNBC’s Joy Reid on Friday. “I mean, obviously, they feel the need to. It fills an emotional need for Donald Trump but it does not really help him.” Cohen was sentenced to prison for his role in the hush money scheme that Trump is now standing trial for. Trump is accused of falsifying documents, in the run-up to the 2016 election, that covered up a hush money payment to silence porn actor Stormy Daniels for an alleged earlier sexual encounter. Cohen now “fully admits” his crime and is a massive Trump critic, noted Conway. But Trump’s team is trying to paint Cohen as an unreliable witness because of his conviction. Conway acknowledged Cohen, whom he has known for years, can be “like a bull in a china shop or a dog with a bone, pick your metaphor” and that he was loyal to Trump but ultimately “got screwed for it” and has owned up to it. Trump’s legal team will try to provoke Cohen when he is on the stand, said Conway, but Cohen will be a good witness if he “just chills and just plays it straight and doesn’t let them get on his nerves.” The next four years will change America forever.

One woman at last month’s rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, told Davram Stiefler that “foreigners” have special phones and “when someone gives them the OK, they’re gonna come for us.” Another attendee who said he’s a fan of right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, warned of “Joseph Starling” when speaking with Jason Selvig. Still another Trump supporter claimed that John F. Kennedy Jr. ― who died in a plan crash in 1999 ― will return as vice president. “It’s happening now,” she said, and predicted there won’t be an election at all, but couldn’t explain any of it. “When you know, you know,” she said. Another man declared that certain leaders, such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), are “illegal politicians.” But he also couldn’t explain it. “No one voted for ’em, they were appointed,” he said, saying of Schumer specifically: “He didn’t run. People think he ran for office, but it was his turn to be put in.” The next four years will change America forever.

Former Trump spokesperson Hicks sat down with then-Obama White House communications director Psaki to talk about the mechanics of the president’s media team. “And of all the things she could have asked us about, and granted it was two days after kind of a shocking outcome of an election, she had one major question,” Psaki remembered on “Inside with Jen Psaki.” Hicks asked her: “How do you get the president to approve every statement that goes out in his name?” Psaki explained to Hicks how, “If we need a statement to commemorate, say, National Pancake Day, the president doesn’t have to approve it. Obviously if it’s a more significant one, he does, he works with us on it.” Hicks’ response “was interesting,” Psaki said. She reportedly said Trump “will want to approve everything.” “It made clear to me that when it came to all things PR, her boss was the definition of a micromanager,” Psaki said. “Fast forward to Friday and that’s exactly how Hope Hicks portrayed Trump” in her testimony at the presumptive GOP nominee’s hush money trial when, said Psaki, Hicks essentially depicted him as “obsessed and controlling when it comes to his media coverage” and said he was “very involved” with his 2016 campaign. The takeaway, Psaki said, was Trump was “intimately involved in minutiae of his 2016 campaign” and “if he was aware of the small things, how could he not be aware of the big things” such as payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged affair.

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) declared that Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake’s rhetoric could get people killed on Sunday after she called on supporters to “strap on a Glock” ahead of the election in November. Lake, an election-denying conspiracy theorist, predicted an “intense” period leading up to the election at a rally last month before encouraging voters to arm themselves “just in case.” “Meet the Press” host Kristen Welker brought up Lake’s remarks to Kelly before referring to former President Donald Trump, who recently told Time that it “depends on the fairness” of the election when asked about violence around it. “What’s your reaction when you hear language like that?” asked Welker, who noted that the former astronaut’s wife — ex-Rep. Gabby Giffords — survived a shooting at a constituent event in 2011. “It’s dangerous. What Kari Lake said could result in people getting hurt or killed. Same thing with the former [president],” Kelly replied. “You say words can translate into violence?” Welker asked. “Absolutely, especially when they come from somebody in a leadership position,” he responded. Kelly noted that Lake has yet to be elected “to anything,” but he doesn’t expect that to change as she looks to face off against Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) to fill an open U.S. Senate seat. “When you’re a candidate for the United States Senate, you need to be careful with your words.

On Thursday, the trial of the presumptive GOP nominee included information about how attorney Keith Davidson, on election night 2016 as it became increasingly apparent that Trump would win, texted then-National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard to ask: “What have we done?” Trump allegedly falsified business documents to conceal making a hush money payment, before that election, to porn actor Stormy Daniels to prevent her from talking about their alleged earlier affair. Davidson represented Daniels at the time. The Enquirer, meanwhile, deployed a “catch and kill” initiative to bury potentially damaging stories about Trump. Davidson all but acknowledged that his actions may have impacted the result of the 2016 election, Kirschner said on a new episode of “The Legal Breakdown” podcast with MSNBC contributor Brian Tyler Cohen. “That was a bit of testimony that was pretty breathtaking and it actually undercuts one of the defense assertions that they’re trying to use to wiggle out of Trump’s criminal responsibility for this,” he explained. Davidson testified to engaging “in this hush money payment and covering these things up and then, come election night, or the next day, when it looked like Donald Trump is going to win the election, Keith Davidson said, ‘Oh my God, what did we do?’” noted Kirschner. It showed “they recognized the potentially dramatic damage they had done to the country by engaging in conduct that may have actually facilitated Donald Trump getting elected,” he added.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/israel-military-evacuate-parts-rafah-expected-assault_n_66387e31e4b03d2898dd8efe,Israeli Leaders Have Approved A Military Operation Into Rafah,"sam mednick, josef federman , bassem mroue",5/6/2024,"JERUSALEM (AP) — After Hamas on Monday announced its acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal, Israel said its leaders approved a military operation in the southern Gaza town of Rafah and began striking targets in the area. Still, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would send negotiators to continue talks on the deal. The high-stakes diplomatic moves and military brinkmanship left a glimmer of hope alive — but only barely — for an accord that could bring at least a pause in the 7-month-old war that has devastated the Gaza Strip. Hanging over the wrangling was the threat of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move that the United States strongly opposes and that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there. Hamas’s abrupt acceptance of the cease-fire deal came hours after Israel ordered an evacuation of Palestinians from eastern neighborhoods of Rafah, signaling an invasion was imminent. Netanyahu’s office said that the proposal Hamas accepted was “far from Israel’s essential demands,” but that it would nonetheless send negotiators to continue talks on a deal. At the same time, the Israeli military said it was conducting “targeted strikes” against Hamas in eastern Rafah. The nature of the strikes was not immediately known, but the move may aim to keep the pressure of the Rafah threat on as talks continue. President Joe Biden spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reiterated U.S. concerns about an invasion of Rafah, telling him a cease-fire was the best way to protect the lives of Israeli hostages, according to a National Security Council spokesperson, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the call before an official White House statement was released. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said American officials were reviewing the Hamas response “and discussing it with our partners in the region.” An American official said the U.S. was examining whether Hamas agreed to a version of the deal that had been signed off on by Israel and international negotiators or something else. Details of the proposal have not been released. Touring the region last week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had pressed Hamas to take the deal, and Egyptian officials said it called for a cease-fire of multiple stages starting with a limited hostage release and partial Israeli troop pullbacks within Gaza. The two sides would also negotiate a “permanent calm” that would lead to a full hostage release and greater Israeli withdrawal out of the territory, they said. Hamas had been seeking clearer guarantees for its key demand of an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal in return for the release of all its hostages, according to Egyptian officials. It was not immediately known if any changes were made. Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have repeatedly rejected that trade-off, vowing to keep up their campaign until Hamas is destroyed after its Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war. Israel says Rafah is the last significant Hamas stronghold in Gaza, and Netanyahu said Monday that the offensive against the town was vital to ensuring the militants can’t rebuild their military capabilities. But he faces strong American opposition. After the Israeli evacuation order was issued, Miller said the U.S. has not seen a credible and implementable plan to protect Palestinian civilians. “We cannot support an operation in Rafah as it is currently envisioned,” he said. The looming operation has raised global alarm. Aid agencies have warned that an offensive will bring a surge of more civilian deaths in an Israeli campaign that has already killed 34,000 people and devastated the territory. It could also wreck the humanitarian aid operation based out of Rafah that is keeping Palestinians across the Gaza Strip alive, they say. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk on Monday called the evacuation order “inhumane.” “Gazans continue to be hit with bombs, disease, and even famine. And today, they have been told that they must relocate yet again,” he said. “It will only expose them to more danger and misery. Israeli military leaflets were dropped ordering evacuation from eastern neighborhoods of Rafah, warning that an attack was imminent and anyone who stays “puts themselves and their family members in danger.” Text messages and radio broadcasts repeated the message. The military told people to move to an Israel-declared humanitarian zone called Muwasi, a makeshift camp on the coast. It said Israel has expanded the size of the zone and that it included tents, food, water and field hospitals. It wasn’t immediately clear, however, if that was already in place. Around 450,000 displaced Palestinians already are sheltering in Muwasi. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said it has been providing them with aid. But conditions are squalid, with few bathrooms or sanitation facilities in the largely rural area, forcing families to dig private latrines. The evacuation order left Palestinians in Rafah wrestling with having to uproot their families once again for an unknown fate, exhausted after months living in sprawling tent camps or crammed into schools or other shelters in and around the city. Mohammed Jindiyah said that at the beginning of the war, he had tried to hold out in his home in northern Gaza under heavy bombardment before fleeing to Rafah. He is complying with Israel’s evacuation order this time, but was unsure now whether to move to Muwasi or another town in central Gaza. “We are 12 families, and we don’t know where to go. There is no safe area in Gaza,” he said. Sahar Abu Nahel, who fled to Rafah with 20 family members, including her children and grandchildren, wiped tears from her cheeks, despairing at a new move. “I have no money or anything. I am seriously tired, as are the children,” she said. “Maybe it’s more honorable for us to die. We are being humiliated.” Jan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, condemned the “forced, unlawful” evacuation order and the idea that people should go to Muwasi. “The area is already overstretched and devoid of vital services,” Egeland said. He said that an Israeli assault could lead to “the deadliest phase of this war.” Israel’s bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 34,700 Palestinians, around two-thirds of them children and women, according to Gaza health officials. The tally doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. More than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, and hundreds of thousands in the north are on the brink of famine, according to the U.N. Tensions escalated Sunday when Hamas fired rockets at Israeli troops positioned on the border with Gaza near Israel’s main crossing for delivering humanitarian aid, killing four soldiers. Israel shuttered the crossing. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes on Rafah killed 22 people, including children and two infants. The war was sparked by the unprecedented Oct. 7 raid into southern Israel in which Hamas and other militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 hostages. After exchanges during a November cease-fire, Hamas is believed to still hold about 100 Israelis as well the bodies of around 30 others. ___ Mroue reported from Beirut.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/traumatic-birth-experience-what-to-know_l_66352a51e4b05f96b018526b,I Had A Traumatic Birth Experience. Here's What I Wish I Had Known.,stephanie hallett,5/6/2024,"Throughout my pregnancy, I fantasized about the “golden hour” — the first hour after birth — that I’d share with my baby when he arrived. I pictured myself smelling his head, stroking his tiny back and whispering “Happy birthday” and “I love you” as I gently encouraged him to latch and begin breastfeeding. But because I spiked a fever during labor, hospital policy required my son to go directly to the NICU for a precautionary stay where they’d monitor him for signs of infection. Instead of a golden hour, I got just a few precious minutes before a nurse pried his little fingers from my hospital gown and whisked him away. That was just one moment among many that added up to a traumatic birth experience. There was the nurse who tied the band of a fetal heart-rate monitor so tightly around my belly I could barely breathe. Another rolled her eyes and tossed a barf bag at me when I pleaded with her to raise the head of my bed before I threw up. Then there was the NICU nurse who grabbed my baby from me and force-fed him a bottle of formula because I wasn’t “doing it right.” I was devastated by all of it. I’m far from alone when it comes to birth trauma. Some estimates suggest up to 44% of birthing people experience trauma during childbirth, including physical or psychological injury and serious health complications. That can lead to relationship issues, disrupt the joy of having a baby, impact future family-planning decisions and cause long-term mental health concerns. All of that was certainly true for me. Maya Jackson, the founder and executive director of Mobilizing African American Mothers through Empowerment, a pregnancy and birth services organization that Jackson said has served over 700 families since its founding in 2018, sees the medicalization of birth as a key reason for high levels of birth trauma. “We have medicalized birth as treating a disease rather than caring for a person,” she said. “It’s less about the person’s lived experiences, things that may have impacted them over the span of their lives, and more about getting the baby out — and getting the baby out by any means necessary.” Sometimes trauma during childbirth is hard to avoid. A medical emergency, for example, where your providers have to act fast to save your life or your baby’s, will be stressful no matter what. But other times, advocating for yourself when something feels wrong, or having someone else advocate for you, can prevent a bad experience from becoming worse. Childbirth experts say there are a few things you can do, before and during birth, to have the best experience possible and stand up for yourself if you feel you aren’t being heard. The first step to advocating for yourself is knowing yourself. That’s why Jackson advises her clients to get to know their own bodies and health histories — including family health histories — before getting pregnant. That might mean monitoring your body so you know your baseline — for example, your typical energy levels and what “healthy” feels like for you — paying careful attention to things that trigger your anxiety, and asking your relatives about their medical histories so you know of any illnesses or issues that could come up during pregnancy. In doing so, pregnant people will “have a blueprint of how their body works and functions, and if things do arise, they are able to articulate, from their lived experience, what they know to be true about themselves,” Jackson said. “I think a lot of times, when we’re receiving care from medical providers, we’ve been taught that they’re the only experts in the room. But the first expert is you.” When you’re thinking about the kind of birth experience you want to have, the providers and location you choose will be critical. Kayleigh Summers, a licensed clinical social worker who founded The Birth Trauma Mama after her own near-fatal childbirth experience, said choosing providers who understand informed consent and collaborative decision-making is the first step. “I would want a provider that truly believes that I am the expert on my own body and they are the expert on everything on the medical side of birth — and that both of those expertises are equally important,” she said. Jackson recommended that families learn as much as they can before deciding where to give birth, such as the hospital’s cesarean section rate, as well any policies that might affect your birthing experience, like whether you’re allowed to eat during labor, if monitors must be worn at all times, and if a doula is seen as a visitor or member of the medical team. And speaking of doulas: Summers and Jackson agreed that they can be wonderful additions to your birth team, in part because they can offer a continuity of care that you might not get in a hospital setting, where you may not even know the nurses and doctors delivering your baby. While doulas are not a silver bullet — they’re not going to eliminate the possibility of birth trauma, for example — they can be a critical resource, providing information and explaining medical terms while you’re in labor. And though a doula can’t speak for you, they can help you refocus and find your voice. “When you’re in the midst of trauma, when you’re already being traumatized, it’s really difficult to access this advocacy part of you,” Summers said. A doula can help guide you in those moments. Sometimes birth trauma happens because decisions are made too quickly and patients feel like they didn’t have a say in their own care. One way to catch your breath in those moments is to ask your medical team to stop and pause the room. Start by asking if it’s a medical emergency — if that’s the case, you might have just seconds to make a decision. If it’s not, there’s typically some time to take a breath. You can say, “I need everything to stop right now,” Summers explained — your doula can help advocate for a pause, too — and then get your bearings. Jackson said families can ask questions to find out why a certain treatment or intervention is being recommended, request to speak to another provider or have someone else perform a procedure, or ask for the charge nurse (the chief nurse on duty) if you feel your nurse isn’t listening to your needs. You also have the right to decline care and have your reasons documented. Simply put, sometimes the reason your birth experience is going sideways is bad vibes from your nurse or doctor. If that’s the case, see if you can shift that energy. “If you have a grumpy nurse who’s not being kind — which I hope is a rarity — I will sometimes have patients just say, ‘Hey, can we talk for a second? I feel like there’s something that’s off here. Am I upsetting you in some way? Because I’m not getting the warm and fuzzies. What can we do to have a better partnership here?’” Summers said. “It doesn’t always work, but I do think it can disarm nurses.” If you’re still having issues, talk to the hospital’s patient navigator or the charge nurse on duty about your options (or ask your support person to do it for you). Be sure your concerns are documented by the hospital. No matter how your birth goes, you’re entitled to your feelings — whatever they may be, Summers said.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/activities-causing-anxiety_l_66327d92e4b0fc2b952801c6,6 'Soothing' Activities That Are Secretly Causing You More Anxiety,sarah bourassa,5/6/2024,"When you’re overwhelmed with stress, you may feel like curling up in a ball and not know how to pull yourself out of the funk. From watching hours and hours of TV to pretending the stress isn’t there, there are common “soothing” behaviors that we do to unwind that can cause more harm than good. “I do things that exacerbate my stress,” Niro Feliciano, a psychotherapist and author, told HuffPost. “And I know that I’m doing them, but it’s natural as humans.” Even therapists can fall into these stress traps, she said. But if we work on how we handle stress even just 50% of the time, it can drastically help. We asked therapists about the one thing that they try to avoid for relieving stress because it can actually aggravate tension — and what they try to do instead. “The one thing I try my hardest not to do when I’m stressed is get stuck in patterns of binging anything — Netflix, retail therapy, junk food, etc.,” Sadaf Siddiqi, a psychotherapist and content creator, told HuffPost. “As humans, we all need occasional moments of escape and indulgence, but this is not the same as creating coping mechanisms out of them.” These types of behaviors are often a form of avoiding emotions, which can lead to even more stress. “Research shows that suppressing … difficult thoughts for long periods of time can lead to poor mental health as well as physical health,” Siddiqi explained. “Strong emotions need to be felt, processed and managed.” Instead of binging something, Siddiqi tries to focus on techniques that immediately relieve stress, such as going for a walk, dancing to a playlist or talking to a friend. Another option is to use breathing exercises, like breathing in through the nose, holding it, exhaling through the nose, and repeating until you feel a shift. Even taking a quick shower may help; warm water can relax your muscles and reduce tension, while cold water can improve your circulation and lower cortisol levels. For long-term stress management, Siddiqi recommended creating a routine that includes movement, healthy sleep, meditation, whole foods, hydration and therapy. “When I have catastrophic thoughts that something will turn out really badly … I do not avoid these thoughts,” said Calvin Fitch, a licensed clinical health psychologist. He said this can lead to the “pink elephant problem,” in which a thought becomes more intense because you’re trying to avoid it. (For example, if you’re asked not to think about pink elephants for 30 seconds, it’s difficult to avoid.) Alternatively, Fitch likes to imagine his thoughts as “boxes on a conveyor belt” that he can choose to open or not. “When a catastrophic thought has no evidence to support it and/or there’s nothing I can do [about it] right now, I let that box pass because I know opening it and sifting through the contents is not useful and actually prevents other thoughts or boxes from passing,” he said. Learning not to overcontrol your thoughts doesn’t just relieve stress, but can also help with mental health conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder, according to Fitch. “Sometimes when we’re facing a challenge, our tendency is to want … to consult [with other] people about it [and] get all sorts of opinions and feedback,” explained Tamika Lewis, the clinical director and founder of Women of Color Therapy. “And sometimes that can actually complicate things.” Getting lots of different advice from others can distract from what you’re actually feeling. Instead, Lewis tries to sit in silence with the feeling and listen to what’s coming up in her body. “I try … to trust that body wisdom, which usually is a better guide than other folks’ input,” she said. “It takes a lot of discipline to be still, but there’s a lot of wisdom in stillness and silence.” She said it can also be helpful to let out stressful energy by moving the body, whether that’s through breath work, stretching or walking. “Usually that will lead you to more clarity than just stagnating,” she said. “For me, [white noise] causes my anxiety to increase,” said Priya Tahim, a licensed professional counselor and the founder of Kaur Counseling. “I find that the sounds leave my thoughts spiraling, almost like my thoughts are on a caffeine kick.” Though white noise can help some people unwind when used with meditation, others may find its higher-pitched frequencies too stimulating, according to Tahim. She prefers to listen to her “calm” playlist, which includes “songs with a mellow or romantic vibe” and allows her brain to relax. Listening to music with slow, calming tempos can help physically relax and quiet the mind, she explained. “When I’m stressed, I [try to] never take on additional things,” Feliciano shared. “When we begin to say ‘yes’ to things that we don’t have time for or don’t have the emotional or mental bandwidth for, we … start to feel resentful.” This can increase stress levels and cause more anxiety, panic and depressive symptoms, she said. Instead, Feliciano focuses on setting firm boundaries and prioritizing. “I start to say ‘no’ to the things that are nonessential,” she said. “I look at things that can be postponed and delayed and make more bandwidth in my life for self-care. … If we don’t intentionally make time for self-care, no one has time for it.” For her, self-care can include walking with a friend, spending time in nature, meditating or practicing deep breathing (even just for five or 10 minutes a day). As for the tasks that she needs to get done, she makes lists to rank them in order of priority. This helps organize her thoughts and reduce the pressure of remembering them. “When we’re stressed, we’re in fight-or-flight mode and … our cognitive abilities become impaired,” Feliciano explained. “We actually use a lot of neurological energy just to remember a list. And when we write it down on a piece of paper, that energy can be directed to actually doing the thing.” “Avoidance never works. It just compounds the situation,” Jeffrey Barnett, a professor of psychology at Loyola University Maryland, told HuffPost. Barnett has found that pushing through stress like it’s not there only makes it worse. Alternatively, he tries to give himself permission to take a break to do something relaxing or rejuvenating. He also emphasized the importance of stress prevention practices, like exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy diet, getting adequate rest and not being too hard on yourself. Leanna Stockard, a licensed marriage and family therapist at LifeStance Health, agreed that the longer she ignores her stress, the more it lingers in the back of her mind. “Even the ‘smallest’ things [begin] to feel overwhelming,” she said. “This [leads] to a cycle of continued procrastination and amplified stress, until [I’m] at my breaking point and [need] to address it.” Instead, she tries to acknowledge her feelings and identify if she’s able to control any of her stressors (for example, by taking smaller steps toward a larger goal). For stressors that are beyond her control, she uses coping skills like deep breathing and journaling. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/job-hunting-over-50_l_66269df8e4b04378c08b05b8,People Are Sharing What It's Like To Job-Hunt Over 50 — And It's Harrowing,monica torres,5/6/2024,"Since she got laid off from her job in December, Donna Kopman, 57, has sent out over 300 job applications. From Sunday through Tuesday, the Lake Oswego, Oregon, resident spends eight hours a day at her computer applying for jobs. The rest of the week, she focuses on researching jobs she will submit applications for the following week. So far, she has gotten only one job interview with a recruiter. “It’s really frustrating,” Kopman said. “I’m not trying to shoot for the moon at this point in my career. I just would like gainful employment until I retire.” Before her layoff, Kopman was a sales operation manager at software company Milestone Systems. She had two decades of sales experience and made $110,000 at her last job. Now she is applying for jobs that earn $60,000 and has broadened her search to include administrative or contract work, in order to get affordable health insurance. Kopman said she regularly experiences highs and lows with her job search. First, she will get excited by a job and spend hours crafting a personalized application based on how the role aligns with her direct experience. Then, she will have those hopes dashed by an automated rejection 24 hours later. “It’s like, did anybody even look at my résumé?” she said. That’s when Kopman questions: “Well, is it ageism?” Kopman is right to be concerned. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act protects U.S. workers who are 40 and older from being discriminated against on the basis of age, but the odds are stacked against older job seekers. If you’re over 50, you are more likely to lose ― or be pushed out of ― your job. Once this happens, it takes much longer for older job seekers than their younger counterparts to land a job again, let alone a job that pays them what they are used to earning. In fact, half of people in their 50s are laid off at least once and only 1 in 10 of these workers will ever again earn as much as they did before this setback, according to a 2018 data analysis by ProPublica and the Urban Institute of the Health and Retirement Study. One major reason it’s so hard to get rehired? Because of machines that rank an older job seeker’s job application. When older workers apply for a job, they often get rejected by automatic tracking systems that can sort out their résumé based on dates used and skills that they do not list, said Carl Van Horn, a public policy professor and director of the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. He gave the example of digital skills not being listed, even though they can be easily taught. Employers “make this assumption and say, ‘Well, they probably don’t know how to do X, Y, and Z.’ Now, of course, on the other side, what we know is that [those] people have been successful in the labor market for a long time. They’re probably good workers,” he said. “But it flies against some people’s attitude about older people and what they can and can’t do.” And as more employers adopt generative artificial intelligence into their workflow, Van Horn said he expects older job seekers to face potentially more rejections. The common advice you’ll get as an older job seeker? Hide any suggestion of your mature age. That’s because hiring managers can make instant judgments based on what you share. In one experimental study, economist Joanna Lahey sent out 8,000 fake résumés of candidates to hiring managers and tracked what they looked at with an eye-scanning lab. Hiring managers’ eyes were pausing at years of employment history and the year candidates got their education, and ultimately spent more time scanning the résumés of younger candidates. Kopman said she no longer bothers applying to jobs that ask for a graduation date in their online applications. Nina, a 55-year-old Allentown, Pennsylvania-based job seeker, said she keeps her 1987 college graduation date off her résumé and, when possible, she avoids including the years she worked at past jobs. Nina, who asked to be identified by her first name since she is currently employed, said she also purposefully colors her hair for interviews. “I want to go gray so bad, but like our society, they just write you off as invisible anyway, so I’m still coloring my hair,” she said. On top of these appearance biases, some employers still hold ageist beliefs that older employees are “too stuck” in their ways and that they will not adapt to new business needs, Nina said. To fight against the assumption that older workers are unfamiliar with technology, Nina posts her LinkedIn and Instagram information on her résumé to show she is up to date on social media. Kopman is aware of how her long-term unemployment is eating into her savings. She has not taken a break since her layoff. Her unemployment insurance will expire in November. She is currently paying $900 a month to retain her health insurance from her past job through COBRA. “I’d love to take advantage of this opportunity of not working to enjoy myself and do things. But you can’t psychologically allow yourself to do that, because you have no idea what your next real paycheck is going to be,” she said. To stay positive, Kopman said she takes walks. People keep working and looking for work into their 50s through their 80s both because they want to and because they have to, for their budgets. If you were born between 1943 and 1954 in America, you will not get full retirement benefits until you turn 66. And many older workers do not have enough saved up to retire comfortably. About 43% of people between 55 and 64 do not even have a retirement savings account, according to a 2022 survey of consumer finances from the Federal Reserve. Washington, D.C.-based Elizabeth White, who is now 70, is the author of “55, Underemployed, and Faking Normal: Your Guide to a Better Life,” which is based on her experiences looking for work. After losing consulting jobs amid the 2008 Great Recession, White said she faced challenges with re-entering the job market, despite her advanced degrees and accomplished employment history. To make ends meet, she got a roommate and started taking a Greyhound bus at times for job interviews in New York, among other cost-cutting measures. “It was humbling to have the kind of background that I have and to have this whole thing [happen]. I felt like I had stepped on a banana peel,” she said. And she’s not alone with experiencing financial insecurity as an older adult. White said a lot of older workers will eventually give up searching for the types of jobs they once had and start looking for what she calls “a casserole of work.” “So they might [get] a little bit of Social Security, they might rent out a room in their place on Airbnb ... that older guy you see at Trader Joe’s bagging groceries is probably not there because he wants to be,” she said, as an example of what this series of money-making opportunities might entail. So if you’re an older job seeker, it helps to “get off your throne” and be open to changes and pivots, White said: “Sometimes you have to ... go back a couple of steps before you can go forward.” Mark Gyurina, chief program officer for job training nonprofit Operation ABLE, said a common challenge people in their 50s and 60s face is the reality of being single or widowed and needing to get back to work to support themselves. Darla Jelley is a 57-year-old single mom of a 17-year-old teenager who lives in Boston. Now that her daughter is almost an adult, Jelley wants to re-enter the workforce full time after taking part-time jobs doing eldercare. In April, she graduated from Operation ABLE’s 12-week job training program for older job seekers who meet federal low-income guidelines and are interested in working for medical offices. Jelley said the program taught her computer skills like how to craft a résumé and how to use Excel and PowerPoint. But more important than teaching her how to save files, the program boosted her confidence, Jelley said. Before the program, Jelley didn’t have much contact with the outside world except for her home-care clients. “I didn’t think I had anything to offer,” Jelley said about her skills. Studying to become a nurse has always been Jelley’s dream that she has not been able to afford doing. But through Operation ABLE, she has a few interviews lined up to be a hospital front office coordinator and a pharmacy technician that have tuition reimbursement programs. Recruiters came to her classes, which gave participants “a foot in the door for interviews,” Jelley said. Jelley said she once used to view her goal of becoming a nurse at 61 as “crazy.” But after her job training, “I don’t consider that at all. Like, I would do it in a heartbeat,” Jelley said. “People over 50 are not ready to be put out to pasture.” Even talking with fellow older job seekers can be a much-needed balm. When Greg Bailey lost his job at 56 in 2020, he joined an online job search support program called Who Ya Know four months into his search. He said ageism was one of the most common shared issues people talked about. “That was a huge lifesaver for me, because it does get very painful, it gets very lonely, especially when you’re not interacting with other people,” Bailey said. “The things that I was feeling, they were feeling too.” Bailey has since found a new sales job. Research finds that once you have been out of work for more than six months, it gets significantly harder at any age to find a job, but particularly for older job seekers. That’s why it’s critical for older job candidates to network to get past long-term unemployment biases on top of ageism. “Emailing résumés is not going to get you employed, you really have to be out there in the community,” Gyurina advised older job seekers. He said older job candidates should network extensively through internships, volunteering and part-time work to avoid résumé gaps and build references, and that they should take advantage of help that family or neighbors offer. You never know who might lead you to your next job opportunity, so make time to invest in your relationships. “I often find that people in their 30s and 40s are much more knowledgeable about where the jobs are, who are the rising stars, where’s the money, where are the opportunities,” White said. “I’m applying for something now that I would not have heard of, but somebody told me about it.” White gave a past career success as an example. She said she got into an entrepreneurial incubator, because someone in their 40s who was already in the incubator and had worked with her years ago, told her, “Oh, this would be a good opportunity for you.” If you’re not finding success with getting a regular 9-to-5 job, it might be time to forge your own path. White, who is now the founder of NUUage Coliving, which seeks shared affordable housing solutions for older adults, also pointed to entrepreneurship as a growing alternative path older job seekers can take. She cited 2019 research from the job nonprofit Kauffman Foundation, which found that more than 25% of new entrepreneurs were ages 55-64 ― a number up from about 15% in 1996. Ultimately, older employees are an asset to any company. Research backs up that older workers are less likely to quit and are more likely to have higher performance ratings than younger colleagues. And at their best, multigenerational teams can share their unique knowledge, networks and experiences for better ideas. But more hiring managers need to believe in this, too. Until then, don’t count out people just because of their age, older job seekers implore. “At this stage of the game, I have no kids at home,” Nina said. “I don’t have to be home at 5. I can stay late, I can come in on the weekends, I’m not running out to drive anybody anywhere. To me, it seems like a no-brainer, like, ‘Give me this job.’” Nina said losing out to job candidates who are 20 years younger than her can make her feel self-doubt, but ultimately, “It’s your age, and ... it’s their loss.“ Nina is currently the oldest person at her video production job, and when she started, she believed she got “OK grandma” vibes from certain younger colleagues who avoided interacting with her. But the teammates who did take the time to know her now “lean on me for everything.” “You’ve got to be a trailblazer at a certain point,” Nina said.

I Wanted To Push Against That.',emily laurence,5/6/2024,"Born in South Korea and raised in New Jersey, Deuki Hong is the executive chef and owner of The Sunday Family Hospitality Group in San Francisco. A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, Hong has worked in some of the most prestigious restaurants in the country, including Centrico, Momofuku and Jean-Georges. His cookbook, “Koreaworld,” co-written with food writer Matt Rodbard, was released in April. In this edition of Voices in Food, Hong shares in his own words his journey of self-discovery, including rebelling against negative stereotypes of Asian American men, to become a compassionate leader in the kitchen who aims to bring people together over really good food. I started working in restaurant kitchens when I was 15 years old. The dad of a buddy on my baseball team was Michael Bonadies, who helped create Nobu and many other legendary restaurants. He heard that I was interested in cooking and gave me the opportunity to be in one of his kitchens. My first job was at chef Aarón Sánchez’s restaurant Centrico. I worked there in the evenings until midnight and got up at 7 a.m. the next day for school. But I loved it! The kitchen just felt like a natural place for me to be. As I continued to come up in the restaurant industry, I thrived on negative reinforcement — the kitchen turned out to be a great mix of mentorship and negative reinforcement. I also was willing to work really hard at something until I got it right. When you want to become a great chef, you have to practice technical elements over and over. You have to work long hours. You have to be able to take really hard criticism. I wasn’t overly confident in my skills, but I was willing to stick it out. There’s a stereotype that Asian American men are weak, and maybe deep down — or not even that deep down — I wanted to push against that. Weak people definitely aren’t cut out for the restaurant industry. I wanted to prove I could make it. I rebelled against that stereotype in other ways that definitely weren’t good — for anyone. As I rose through the ranks and became an executive chef and owner of restaurants myself, I had to figure out how to make people take me seriously. Again, I didn’t want to appear weak. I also look really young for my age. I overcompensated by yelling and projecting a lot of confidence. I was “playing chef.” By that I mean that I projected this image of having all the answers and never being wrong. I think it’s what people call “toxic masculinity.” No one knew what I was struggling with internally. I didn’t show any vulnerability. Then, a turning point came. It was at one of the first restaurants that I owned in San Francisco. One day, five of the chefs just didn’t show up. That sent a huge message to me that something wasn’t right. I had to face my team and own up to the parts of being a leader I wasn’t good at. It forced me to be vulnerable, point out my flaws and delegate to people who were better at those tasks than me. That taught me that being a good leader requires vulnerability. “I projected this image of having all the answers and never being wrong. I think it’s what people call 'toxic masculinity.' No one knew what I was struggling with internally. I didn’t show any vulnerability.” That moment was a huge shift for my team. It went from me yelling at everyone to everyone working together. It had a ripple effect, too. Other people came forward and said, “You know, this part of work isn’t my strength, and I’d love to get better at it,” and someone else would show them how to do it. This experience was eye-opening to me and taught me that it’s OK to tell people about the areas you need help in. HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.

Log in to hide these messages. I’m still marinating on how the stereotypes that Asian Americans face played into the mistakes I once made when trying to lead. I’ve done a lot of work self-reflecting. Thank you, therapy. Thank you, COVID-19. Part of the overconfidence I used to project didn’t have to do with my cultural background at all; I was just young and still learning. And I’m still learning about myself. When I was working on my book, “Koreaworld,” I spent two years in Korea. I was born in Korea but I left when I was 1 year old, so I’m really a kid from Jersey. It was a weird feeling, being there. Even though I’ve never lived in Korea, it feels like home. In Korea, I felt very American. But in America, I feel very Korean. I’m in such a unique position being able to have both of those perspectives. Self-discovery is a vulnerable process, but it leads to the quiet strength of understanding who you are. That’s where my confidence comes from now, which is a lot more authentic and useful than the overconfidence I used to fake.

Kennedy Jr. spends the first minute and change of his new promotional video trashing an unexpected candidate: himself. The new 30-minute spot features the independent presidential candidate reading attacks on himself, almost like the “Mean Tweets” segment on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” Instead of criticism from randos on social media, Kennedy reads attacks from analysts, pundits and media critics. “He’s nuts and clearly disturbed, The Standard,” Kennedy reads. “Kennedy is a humorless bully living in a paranoid fantasy, Vanity Fair. What the fuck is wrong with Bobby Kennedy?” Kennedy reads critics slamming him as a crank and conspiracy theorist. “I wouldn’t vote for that guy, either,” says Kennedy. Much of the rest of the video is narrated by actor Woody Harrelson, who attempts to reintroduce the candidate by painting him as an environmentalist and outdoorsman ready to take on corporate interests. “He was kinda like Erin Brockovich,” Harrelson says, referring to the environmental activist. “But a Kennedy.” The New York Times reported that links to Kennedy’s promotional video were initially blocked by Facebook and Instagram, leading to accusations of censorship. Meta, which owns both social media platforms, told the newspaper it was a mistake that has been corrected. Most of Kennedy’s own family has endorsed President Joe Biden, as have a number of his environmentalist colleagues. An ad from the Natural Resources Defense Council says Kennedy has been “spinning anti-vaccination conspiracy theories, denying science” and urges him to drop out of the race. But it’s the wild opening minute of his new video that has people talking on social media: RFK Jr. is so close to getting it pic.twitter.com/etG86ASr4i I can't believe RFK Jr. actually released this… pic.twitter.com/jm2FpEMf6T The worst political ad ever made.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lara-trump-election-lawsuit_n_66385dcce4b03d2898dd7362,Lara Trump Slammed Over 'Immensely Stupid' Election Lawsuit Claim,ed mazza,5/6/2024,"Lara Trump is being blasted on social media for bragging about a Republican lawsuit that could disenfranchise huge numbers of voters. “You cannot have ballots counted, Maria, after elections are over,” Trump, who is the daughter-in-law of Donald Trump and co-chair of the Republican National Committee, told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. “And right now, that is one of the many lawsuits we have out across this country to ensure that just that happens, that we have a free, fair and transparent election.” The lawsuit filed by the RNC in Nevada doesn’t seek to stop counting ballots after Election Day, but rather seeks to prohibit counting any mail-in ballots received after that date, even if they were postmarked in time. Under the state’s current law, ballots received up to four days after Election Day are counted, as long as they are postmarked before the end of the day on Election Day. But RNC Chairman Michael Whatley claimed to The Associated Press that the deadline “violates federal law and undermines election integrity.” Other Republicans ― including Donald Trump ― have gone even further, arguing against counting any ballots at all after Election Day. Trump in 2020 infamously demanded that states “STOP THE COUNT!” as election officials worked for days to count an unprecedented number of absentee ballots after millions of Americans opted to vote by mail due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics on social media tore into Lara Trump over her claims on Fox News: These are immensely stupid people. If the Military and Veterans Service Organizations are doing their jobs they will sue Trump and the RNC for disenfranchising military voters who vote by absentee ballot from overseas and across the country...by law. https://t.co/7J9BkC7flL I have a super weird counter ………. An election can’t be over until the votes are counted. So …. This entire segment is a mess. Here is what you need to know. Republicans are in court trying to make it harder to vote and easier to cheat.My legal team is fighting back. https://t.co/OZJpbGJxIt I assume she means don’t count ballots received after Election Day. If we didn’t tabulate anything after Election Day, that would be devastating for Republicans in Arizona. In both 2020 and 2022, Republicans accounted for more of the early ballots dropped off on Election Day… Republicans don’t want your vote counted. https://t.co/AfU4BgkaxJ A number of states formally *prohibit* the counting of any votes until after polls close on Election Day.And a bunch of those laws were enacted by Republican-controlled state legislatures. https://t.co/as3XnTk11G That isn't how that works.That isn't how any of that works.jfc https://t.co/PQLp4yJL2g Well, you can. And we have for the entire history of our country. There's no principle that says votes must be *counted* by Election Day. There might be a stronger argument for votes being *cast* by Election Day, but that's a different topic of discussion. The Republican party is literally sueing to prevent legal votes from being counted. https://t.co/Bs0XNRepZc Or you can count all the votes https://t.co/rSF7G2Bglv The next four years will change America forever.

The presumptive GOP presidential nominee, in remarks to a private Republican National Committee donor event at his Mar-a-Lago estate, hurled attacks at prosecutors in his legal cases before likening the Biden White House to a “Gestapo administration” on Saturday. “And it’s the only thing they have,” said Trump, according to audio obtained by The New York Times. “And it’s the only way they’re going to win, in their opinion, and it’s actually killing them. But it doesn’t bother me.” Trump has previously faced backlash for echoing the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini when he pledged to “root out ... vermin” political foes. Biden’s reelection campaign slammed him for parroting Hitler with his “poisoning the blood of our country” comments last year, as well. His recent event reportedly led to donations of $40,000 or greater from attendees. A Trump campaign official recently said that the former president and the RNC raised over $76 million last month. CNN’s Jake Tapper questioned North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who is among Republicans eyed as a potential 2024 running mate for Trump, over whether he’s “comfortable” with Trump’s comparison on Sunday.

European carmakers are losing ground to subsidized Chinese electric vehicles. Diplomats fret about alleged Chinese spies in European capitals. And China’s continued defense trade with Russia worries anyone in Europe who supports war-ravaged Ukraine and fears that the Russian army won’t stop there. But Europe and China have hefty economic ties — EU-China trade is estimated at 2.3 billion euros per day — and Xi appears determined to rebuild and deepen relations with European leaders after a prolonged absence prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Xi started Sunday in France, whose president wants Europe to have more economic and strategic independence from other world powers. Then the Chinese president heads to Serbia and Hungary, both seen as China-friendly and close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and recipients of substantial Chinese investment. Xi’s trip will be closely watched in Washington for signs of diminishing European support for its key foreign policy goals. At the same time, there’s increasing uncertainty in Europe about future U.S. support for trans-Atlantic allies. Xi was greeted at Paris’ Orly Airport by French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal — and by protests by groups demanding that France pressure China to respect Tibetan and Uyghur minority rights. Activists seeking a free Tibet attempted to unfurl a banner Saturday beneath the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and protested in the French capital around the same time as Xi’s plane landed. After arriving, Xi said he hoped the visit would bring ’’strategic convergence″ between China and France, and that further developing their relations would contribute to ’’stability and positive energy in an turbulent world,″ according to a text provided to reporters at the airport. On Monday French President Emmanuel Macron will treat the Chinese leader to formal honors of a full state visit. They will also meet with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who is expected to join Macron in pushing for fairer trade policies and for China to use its leverage with Russia to push it toward ending the war in Ukraine. The EU launched an investigation last fall into Chinese subsidies and could impose tariffs on electric vehicles exported from China. The next four years will change America forever.

Godwin was appointed to the post in 2021 after ABC poached her from rival CBS News. But her tenure was rocky and some within the network raised concerns about her leadership style and more hands-off approach compared with her predecessors. She later ousted many senior leaders at ABC News in an effort to address reports of a toxic work environment. Jonathan Karl, the chief White House correspondent for ABC News, rejected any claims Gordon was disengaged in her role in an interview with the Journal in February, saying she was a “crazy workaholic” and that he had never had a stronger relationship with a news boss. And while others at the network credited her with working to create a culture of inclusion, Disney, ABC’s parent company, installed a new boss over Gordon earlier this year that effectively stripped her of some authority. That executive, Debra OConnell, said Sunday she would lead ABC News “for the time being” in her own email praising Godwin’s work. No formal successor has been named. “Kim has navigated this team through consequential times in our world, and she did so with respect for the brand and profession — and for that and more, we thank her,” OConnell wrote. The National Association of Black Journalists on Sunday cheered Gordon’s work while adding it was distressed by reports that appeared to undermine her landmark role.

Here Are All The Wild Accusations They've Hurled.,taiyler s. mitchell,5/5/2024,"Drake dropped his latest diss track against Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar late Sunday night, adding more fire to their ongoing feud. In the track “The Heart Part 6,” Drake denies Lamar’s previous accusation that the Toronto rapper had sex with teenage girls and is part of a sex trafficking ring through his OVO Sound record label. But that’s not the only alarming allegation stemming from their ongoing feud. The two rappers have accused each other of a wide and wild range of insults and behavior, spanning from fake abs and shoe size to violence against women. DRAKETHE HEART PART 6OUT NOW pic.twitter.com/6PIYX2aeJw The Lamar vs. Drake beef reached a boiling point this spring when Lamar, whom fans already suspected had ongoing tension with Drake, tried to distance himself from Drake and J. Cole, claiming in the song “Like That” that there was no “Big Three — it’s just big me.” Cole then dropped a now-deleted diss track called “7 Minute Drill” on April 5, going after Lamar in response. Not long after, Cole apologized and then deleted the track. Since then, Lamar and Drake have hurled numerous tracks at each other, making damning accusations, several of which focused on their alleged mistreatment of women and children. The battle has caught the attention of the rap world, providing listeners with beaucoup gossip and music, some of which came from artists like Rick Ross and Kanye West. Of course, neither rapper’s claims have been verified. And since verification isn’t necessarily a requirement in rap beef, these diss track accusations are just that: accusations. Here’s a list of the stand-out disses and accusations Lamar and Drake have put in their tracks: “The Heart Part 6” by Drake (May 5) By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

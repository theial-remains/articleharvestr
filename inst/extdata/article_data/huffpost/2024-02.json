    "title": "19 Unexpected Benefits Of Having Just One Child",
    "text": "As a parent of one child, you’re often met with surprised, dismissive or pitying comments from others. The assumption is that anyone with one kid must be unable to have more children, is unhappy with their family arrangement or will eventually change their mind. It’s true that there are many only-child parents out there who do long to have more kids but ultimately can’t because of infertility or other medical or financial reasons. But there are also plenty of folks who happily chose the “one-and-done” path. And there are those who always figured they’d have more kids, but end up being quite content with one. Many negative stereotypes about only children persist — that they’re lonely, spoiled or socially awkward — even though “most contemporary studies don’t find any notable disadvantages for only children,” writer Chiara Dello Joio wrote for The Atlantic. People also tend to think of parents who do not “give their child a sibling” as selfish. But not enough has been said about how having one kid has many unexpected upsides for families. Below, our readers share the overlooked perks of having one kid. Responses have been lightly edited for clarity and length. “For me, it’s about the quality of life I can provide. I grew up very poor with five siblings. I am much better off now, and I can afford nice things for my son. He doesn’t have to pick between music lessons and sports. He can try a new one each year until he finds what he loves! If I had multiple children, I know I wouldn’t be able to offer that to all of them. We can also afford to go on better vacations because there’s always only two of us traveling. I didn’t get to travel when I was a kid because my family couldn’t afford it. When my son and I travel, oftentimes we experience the same places and things for the very first time. Having only one child does mean you can afford more ‘things,’ of course, but it also means we can afford more experiences that we can share together, and it’s brought us closer.” — Alicia M. “Waking up all night, diapers, terrible twos, etc. Once and done. And no holding an older kid back for the limits or needs of a younger one.” — Gabrielle N. “We sit three across on planes without having to divide and conquer, we can share a single piece of luggage for all of us and we don’t have to be considerate of a second child’s naps or bedtime and instead follow our daughter’s needs. Riding in taxis is easy, we’ve put an extra chair at a table for two, and we fit in all hotel rooms and sleeping train cars. It’s also, of course, that much more affordable.” — Rachael H. “As a teacher, coming home and decompressing from the day is key. My 12-year-old son feels this way, too. Sometimes, we just sit together on the couch or in my bed doing our own things, like phone games or something. We are able to calm ourselves and be there for each other. If there were siblings, the house would be much louder.” — Maricia S. “When my daughter was younger, it was easy to find a babysitter for just one kiddo — especially when my husband and I wanted to take a grown-up trip. So much easier to talk the grandparents into watching one kid for several nights than two or more!” — Megan R. “For me, the most important thing is a better chance to balance my mental and physical health with the needs of my husband and child. Even though it’s easier with her at 5 years old versus when she was an infant or toddler, there are still days when carving out 20 minutes for me seems impossible. Add more kids to the mix and there’s no way I could carve time out for myself even monthly. I am a much better mom to my only, and I would not change a thing.” — Liz C. “Building close and intentional connections with other families. Starting when our son was 8 or so, we would invite a friend of his to join us for outings large and small — trips to the museum or day hikes, ski trips, camping trips, a weekend in NYC doing museums and shows. While we often enjoyed ourselves as a small family, we also realized that our son would probably have more fun with a friend around. So we got to spend some quality time with several of his friends over many years, and I consider a few of these guys, now in their 20s, my ‘bonus boys.’” — Elizabeth E. “We trade doing bedtime and morning routine, so we don’t have to both do all the things. Built-in rest periods equals better parenting when we’re on! We love having our one and only awesome kid.” — Eva Z. “Not splitting time between multiple extracurriculars and schedules. I get to be all in at my daughter’s activities and never have to decide whose practice or game I’m attending due to conflicting schedules.” — Megan J. “One is my mental, emotional and physical limit. It’s exactly what I can handle and still be a good mom.” “We were able to take family trips, save for one college education, didn’t have a super high grocery bill during the teen years, etc. Don’t get me wrong, there are definite downsides, but a huge upside is the cost.” — Katie M. “Only paying for day care for one. I don’t know how families with multiple kids manage it.” — Erica L. “I grew up with my younger sister being only two years younger. We fought constantly over everything. My mom gave up on stopping the fights and let us figure things out on our own.” — Audrey K. “My daughter and I are truly best friends. My life revolves around her, raising her to be the best version of herself and supporting all her interests. We authentically explore everything she shows interest in. I have the time and mental space to jump from cooking to art to bugs to science — anything! — since it’s just her.” — Alexandra V. “We are comfortable in a smaller home, smaller vehicle, and smaller RV, which often equals more affordable. As an only child myself, my parents are able to help out without feeling like one grandchild is preferred over another. I can’t imagine it any other way.” — Megan C. “We didn’t plan to have one, but that’s how it worked out, and I love it. It made me realize that one is my mental, emotional and physical limit. It’s exactly what I can handle and still be a good mom.” — Megan R. “You don’t get to say, ‘Go play with your siblings,’ which means you truly spend more time with them. Our daughter gets one-on-one time with each of her parents very often. Daddy/Mommy and daughter date nights happen a lot where we can talk and enjoy one another’s company. I get to know her a little more every day, and I love that!” — Laura L. “I also feel like only having one has helped me to savor all of the tiny moments that are actually really big because I realize they aren’t going to come around again.” — Liz S. “When she has a sleepover or other event out of the house, it’s de facto ‘me time’ or a date night with the hubs.” — Megan R. “Not dividing yourself at bedtime. I think that’s what really made me stop and think. I couldn’t imagine two wanting me and needing me. Now I just get to snuggle with my little guy knowing we both have what we need.” — Raven K. “Definitely the tight bond. Being able to tell her straight out she’s not only my favorite child, but my favorite person ever. She’s not just my sun and stars. She’s the whole damn solar system.” — Meg C.

    "text": "This Black Queer Community Is Starting A Revolution Of Self-Love The Blackyard Collective allows people recovering from an addiction to show up just as they are. by Delano BurrowesPublished Feb. 13, 2024 Twenty-five Black queer folks walking down a Provincetown street come with celebrity-level attention. The Massachusetts tourist town is a queer wonderland and also very white, so mouths gaped and eyes narrowed as onlookers tried to figure out who we were and why we were there. I was annoyed watching them watching us — and especially irritated by their sexualized comments. But I surprised myself by not being angry. Only later at our guesthouse did I realize why I wasn’t mad. Despite the ugly stares, we were being seen on our terms. We were loud, blackity Black and unapologetically queer. We were showing up and showing out despite being conditioned that love and acceptance meant making those parts of ourselves smaller. “It felt like we were in a circus,” Jose told me of that day. “But it was also empowering — like a radical invasion.” That was in 2021 on a weekend retreat with a group of Black queer people recovering from addiction, who are all members of The Blackyard Collective. We are Black queer folks allowing ourselves to be seen, and that is a revolution in self-love. That weekend, we were invading not just a town but also places deep within each of us. And it was just the beginning. Last year, we became an official nonprofit organization where “Black queer joy is revived and renewed.” Our online series of workshops, Blackyard Collective Conversations, starts this month; Dr. Alfonso Ferguson will facilitate the first workshop about cultivating self-love. In 2025, we plan to host our first national conference, and we want to organize mutual aid funds for people in need. We live in a country that has pathologized and criminalized certain identities, and it’s impossible not to absorb some of that conditioning. We are told that our Blackness or queerness or transness — and sometimes all of them at once — is bad. We’re always conscious of how we’re being seen and interpreted, and we learn to wear masks for survival. Our common solution for escaping that internal conflict is what brought us together. Fifteen years ago, recovery spaces, even in New York City, were very white, and it was rare to see other Black faces in these programs. In traditional 12-step programs, there’s often a one-size-fits-all attitude that assumes equal playing fields for recovery. A common saying in these recovery spaces instructs us not to bring “outside issues” to the recovery room. But that’s challenging when you encounter daily reminders that your existence is seen as a problem. “It is necessary to constantly remind ourselves that we are not an abomination,” wrote Black queer filmmaker Marlon Riggs. Maybe my default is believing I’m an abomination. In recovery, I was told to be vulnerable, but there was only so much I could share with the same people who objectified, fetishized and refused to see me as human. A few of us decided to create a space for recovering Black queer folks to get together in a space cultivated for us and by us. In February 2016, about six folks gathered in a Harlem backyard, and it seemed like we would never break the ice. We tip-toed around our issues and were afraid to tell our true stories. We all wore masks, and it was hard to remove them; it was almost harder to let in the people who knew the truth behind the facades. But we kept going. On the first Sunday of each month, we debated whether sugar belongs on grits (it doesn’t) before talking about internalized bias. We shared our favorite episodes of “A Different World” and our struggles with interracial dating. Each revelation brought nods of recognition. And those seeds of understanding helped The Blackyard Collective become what it is today. “The Blackyard Collective is ‘Drag Race’ and James Baldwin. Breonna Taylor and double-dutch. Black-eyed peas and chitlins on New Year’s Day. Desiring love but not knowing how to start with ourselves.” The Blackyard Collective is “Drag Race” and James Baldwin. Breonna Taylor and double-dutch. Elijah McClain and Miss Mary Mack. Black-eyed peas and chitlins on New Year’s Day. Wanting to disappear and wanting to be seen. Desiring love but not knowing how to start with ourselves. During the pandemic, the brunches became virtual meetings, and people from all over the world — Switzerland, Canada, England and Germany — started popping in. The first look was often wide-eyed wonder. “All those Black faces on the screen — I had to turn off my camera ’cause I started crying from the beauty of it,” Rob said. When quarantine ended, we began hosting annual Juneteenth celebrations and P-town retreats, and people were opening up in new ways. Black queer joy was a new sober tool helping people recover. “The challenge with self-love is looking in the mirror,” Jose said. As a child, mirrors betrayed me. I was polite with a high, non-threatening voice, but my mahogany skin and wide nose told me why people treated me differently from white friends. My eyes were the biggest betrayer. No matter how wide the grin, my eyes looked defeated, on guard to disarm perceptions of me. “Mirrors are still hard for me,” Asherve agrees. “The mirror can tell me, ‘You’re too Black, not good, unworthy of love. You should just go back to using drugs.’” Recovery isn’t about never wanting to use drugs or drink. Instead, I accept that using may be my default solution to emotions. But I also know that part of recovery is being able to pause, consider the consequences and explore what’s going on below the surface. The Blackyard Collective exists in that pause. I can replace feelings of rejection and pause to remember seeing the brilliant Black queer musical “Strange Loop” when creator Michael R. Jackson and the cast came out to take photos with us. “That was my first time seeing a Broadway show, and there were people that looked like me up there. It was magical,” Jamie remembers. When I hear an inner dialogue of unlovability and disconnection, I can pause and see Jamie twirling her fan on Fire Island or Carlos imitating Jenifer Lewis in a Provincetown lounge chair. The deaths of Michael and Chris’s moms are also in the pause, but so is Damian’s marriage and Tyrone and Henian’s acceptance into graduate school. The pause is where self-love begins. I’ve allowed myself to let in those who see me and hold me up when I want to run or pick up my calls when I want to cry. “To look in the mirror today, my eyes have gotten kinder,” Damian said. When I reflect on that day, we were walking through Provincetown, and I now know that they stare at us because they’re used to seeing Black pain. But with The Blackyard Collective, we’re bringing Black-on-Black love that’s not dependent on their approval — and it feels real real good.",

    "title": "Iran's Protests Enter Fifth Day Amid Reports Of Deaths",
    "text": "DUBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - A protester shot and killed a policeman during demonstrations in Iran, police said on Monday, the first reported fatality among security forces struggling to contain unrest challenging the clerical leadership. Demonstrations continued for a fifth day, after 13 people were reported to have been killed on Sunday in the worst wave of unrest since 2009 when huge crowds took to the streets to condemn the re-election of then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The protests put pressure on the clerical leaders in power since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, as well as President Hassan Rouhani who made a televised call for calm on Sunday, saying Iranians had the right to criticize but must not cause unrest. The killing of the police officer happened when a demonstrator opened fire with a hunting rifle in the central city of Najafabad, police spokesman Saeed Montazer al-Mahdi was quoted as saying by state TV. Three policemen were wounded. It was not clear when the incident took place. State TV said armed demonstrators on Sunday had tried to seize police and military bases but were stopped by “strong resistance from security forces.” It gave no further details and there was no independent confirmation. Ten people were reported killed in protests on Sunday, a death toll that rose on Monday when the deputy governor of the western Hamadan Province, Saeed Shahrokhi, told ISNA another three protesters were killed on Sunday in the city of Tuyserkan. “NO TOLERANCE” Hundreds of people have been arrested, according to officials and social media. Online video showed police in the capital Tehran firing water cannon to disperse demonstrators, in footage said to have been filmed on Sunday. Protests against economic hardships and alleged corruption erupted in Iran’s second city of Mashhad on Thursday and escalated across the country into calls for the religious establishment to step down. Some of the anger was directed at Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, breaking a taboo surrounding the man who has been supreme leader of Iran since 1989. Video posted on social media showed crowds of people, some chanting “Death to the dictator!,” walking through the streets. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the footage. The Fars news agency reported “scattered groups” of protesters in Tehran on Monday and said a ringleader had been arrested. “The government will show no tolerance for those who damage public property, violate public order and create unrest in society,” Rouhani said in his address on Sunday. Unsigned statements on social media urged Iranians to continue to demonstrate in 50 towns and cities. The government said it was temporarily restricting access to the Telegram messaging app and Instagram. There were reports that internet mobile access was blocked in some areas. TRUMP, NETANYAHU VOICE SUPPORT Iran is a major OPEC oil producer and regional power but frustrations have grown at home - where youth unemployment reached 28.8 percent last year - while the country is deeply involved in Syria and Iraq as part of a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia. Those foreign interventions are resented by many Iranians who want their leaders to create jobs instead of engaging in costly proxy wars. Among the reports of fatalities, two people were shot dead in the southwestern town of Izeh on Sunday and several others were injured, ILNA news agency quoted a member of parliament as saying. “I do not know whether yesterday’s shooting was done by rally participants or the police and this issue is being investigated,” Hedayatollah Khademi was quoted as saying. Regional governor Mostafa Samali told Fars that only one person was killed in an incident unrelated to the protests, and the suspected shooter had been arrested. Almost nine years since the “Green movement” reformist protests were crushed by the state, Iran’s adversaries voiced their support for the resurgence of anti-government sentiment. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: “The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the “brave Iranians” taking to streets to protest at a regime that “wastes tens of billions of dollars spreading hate.” “I wish the Iranian people success in their noble quest for freedom,” he said in a video posted on his Facebook page. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel urged “all sides (to) refrain from violent actions.” (Reporting by Dubai newsroom; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Robin Pomeroy) By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "2017 Saw A Record High Of Insurance Claims Due To Natural Disasters",
    "text": "FRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - Insurers will have to pay claims of around $135 billion for 2017, the most ever, following a spate of hurricanes, earthquakes and fires in North America, according to a report published on Thursday. German reinsurer Munich Re, in its annual natural catastrophe review, also said last year’s total losses, including those not insured, were $330 billion, the second-worst in history after 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc in Japan. Although individual events could not be linked directly to climate change, global warming is playing a role, Munich Re said. It expected more frequent extreme events in future. “We have a new normal,” said Ernst Rauch, head of Munich Re’s Corporate Climate Center, which monitors climate change risks. “2017 was not an outlier,” he said, noting insured losses have surpassed $100 billion multiple times since 2005. “We must have on our radar the trend of new magnitudes.” Last year’s hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the United States and Caribbean, wildfires in California and earthquakes in Mexico destroyed homes, infrastructure and numerous lives. The disasters also rocked global insurers. Munich Re and Hannover Re both issued profit warnings. That dealt a blow to a sector already struggling with thin margins, stiff competition and falling prices. Munich Re’s tally for the industry comes on the back of other estimates that underscored the severity of 2017. In December, Swiss Re estimated global insured losses from catastrophes would hit $136 billion in 2017, the third-highest on record for the sector, with the United States hardest hit. That figure is not directly comparable to Munich Re’s estimates as it includes man-made disasters. Reinsurers, which are in the business of insuring insurance, are experts in managing risk and rarely get caught off guard. Analysts have said reinsurers may need to take a fresh look at their risk models as the planet warms and storms become more intense. A big question for the industry has been whether the run of catastrophes would allow them to achieve higher prices for their coverage, which have been in decline for years. Early indications suggest modest increases. Global property reinsurance prices rose less than expected in the key Jan. 1 renewal season, with strong competition limiting increases to single digit percentages, brokers said this week. A turnaround in prices would be the first major reversal since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

    "text": "Can You Believe? Can you believe Trump’s needing to brag that his nuclear button was bigger than Kim Jong-un’s? Reminds me of the “missile envy” of Cold War days. Can you believe that the fate of the world is in the hands of those two? Can you believe the war between Trump and Bannon? Can you believe that a major American political party could be hijacked by two such aberrations while Republicans in Congress do nothing to stop them? Hits and Misses – the week’s best and worst moves Hit of the Week: The timely release of excerpts from Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. Miss of the Week: Trump lawyers’ demand that Wolff’s publisher “immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release or dissemination of the book” – another of Trump’s endless assaults on the First Amendment. Hot House Race of the Week Democrats’ top targets in California are 7 House Republicans whose districts voted for Hillary Clinton. Another race to watch is Devin Nunes. As Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes has been Trump’s chief attack dog in the Russia scandal. After being forced to recuse himself for disclosing classified information, Nunes has come roaring back with wild charges of corruption in the FBI and special counsel’s office. His constituents may prefer that he work for them instead of Trump and Putin. Will they dump him in 2018? There’s grounds for hope: Between 2012 and 2016, Nunes’s margin of victory fell by 4%, and Republican registration in his 22 Congressional District fell by 7%. A Democratic wave could help us knock this guy out in November, and the country will gain by his loss. Finally… Living through the Trump era one day at a time is bad enough, but looking back at a year of Trump and his gang is just appalling. It’s as if a hostile army had invaded our country, draining the Treasury for billionaires while plundering our public lands, our rivers and oceans, the very air we breathe and water we drink. Beyond our natural heritage, they’ve plundered our national heritage: the democracy we cherish, the social fabric that binds us together as Americans, the social safety net that protects the most vulnerable among us and any of us who fall on hard times. Now Paul Ryan has announced new targets: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. We must stop this. Future generations will ask us how we stopped this, and we’ll have an answer: We can say that after suffering through the year of Trump in 2017, we made 2018 a year of triumph for our nation by doing all we could to resist Trump and replace his allies and enablers in Congress.

    "title": "The DOJ Wants A Citizenship Question On The Census. That Could Blow Up The Whole Survey",
    "text": "The Department of Justice’s recent request to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census has sparked concerns that such a move would lower response rates within immigrant communities. An inaccurate Census would have severe consequences. The survey helps determine the allocation of nearly $700 billion each year in federal money, the number of representatives each state has in the U.S. House and how other electoral districts are drawn. Even before ProPublica reported the Department of Justice request to the Census Bureau for the citizenship question, officials already faced significant challenges in getting people to respond. Among those is convincing people that the Census Bureau, which is overseen by the Commerce Department, won’t share data on individuals with other government agencies, said Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund. “What has happened in the past year or so, given the political environment, is that immigrants have become much more fearful” of contact with the federal government, Vargas told HuffPost. “These are not just undocumented immigrants. They’re legal permanent residents, they’re U.S. citizens who have family members who are immigrants.” Vargas, who also is a member of the Census Bureau’s National Advisory Committee on Racial, Ethnic, and Other Populations, said part of this fear arises from the policies and “new tone” of the Trump administration toward immigrants. “So adding the citizenship question to [the census] is going to exponentially increase that hurdle to convince everybody that nothing’s going to happen to you if you answer this survey,” he said. “The U.S. Census Bureau is evaluating the request from the U.S. Department of Justice and will process it in the same way we have historically dealt with such requests. The final list of questions must be submitted to Congress by March 31, 2018. Secretary [Wilbur] Ross will then make a decision. Our top priority is a complete and accurate 2020 Census,” the bureau said Thursday in a statement. The Justice Department, in its Dec. 12 letter to the Census Bureau, said it needs data on non-citizens to better enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That provision prohibits the drawing of electoral maps in such a way to dilute the influence of minority votes. DOJ said the data on non-citizens would ensure districts are drawn in a way that fairly represents minority citizens. Voting rights lawyers question that rationale, noting that the Census Bureau already asks people if they are citizens through the American Community Survey (ACS), which every year goes out to about 3 million households and extrapolates information about the U.S. population. The Justice Department said in its letter the ACS data was insufficient for voting rights enforcement and that the citizenship question should be included on the formal census, something that has not been done since 1950. John Yang, the president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC, told HuffPost that asking about citizenship on the census would hinder the government from collecting accurate data. “Putting it in the minds of the immigrant, they will have a certain paranoia,” he said. “Even if they are a citizen themselves, they will say, ‘Well, does this mean that they are asking me about my relatives that are here? How will this information be used against me.’ Just by its nature, because this is something that goes to the core of someone’s presence in the United States, they are going to be fearful.” He added that among immigrants who are not English proficient, the citizenship question would “raise in them a whole host of questions of ‘I don’t want to lie, I don’t want to misstate anything, so it’s easiest just not to answer.’” John Thompson, the former Census Bureau director who resigned in May, said he would not advise adding a question about citizenship because census officials hadn’t had a chance to measure how it would affect the response rate. “From a census point of view ... you don’t do things until you understand the effect,” he told HuffPost. Census officials don’t understand the effect (of adding the citizenship question. Without being able to measure it and trying to understand how this would affect the census and the census environment, for me, it would be hard to make that recommendation.” Some lawmakers have previously tried to pass legislation requiring a citizenship question on the census. Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) last year unsuccessfully sought to withhold funding for the Census Bureau unless it added such a question. Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said in December he wants the census to count citizens separately from non-citizens and then use only the count of citizens to determine the apportionment of congressional seats. The U.S. Constitution requires congressional seats to be apportioned based on a count of all “persons,” not just citizens. Terri Ann Lowenthal, who worked as staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee from 1987-1994, said that adding a question about citizenship would produce inaccuracies that would have far-ranging consequences. Asking about citizenship “will depress response rates and just lead to a completely inaccurate census in many areas,” she said. “Those same data must be used for redistricting, as well as the allocation of hundreds of billions of dollars a year for federal funds for vital services, as well as state funds for community purposes.” Census researchers conducting tests in preparation for 2020 already have been raising concerns about the impact of harsh immigration rhetoric on response rates. In a September memo, the researchers said field representatives and supervisors were seeing an unprecedented amount of concern about the confidentiality of census data, particularly among immigrants. The officials observed test respondents “falsifying names, dates of birth, and other information on household rosters.” In focus groups conducted in several languages to test messages for the census, respondents expressed concern about opening their door for a census-taker out of fear they could be deported.

Respondents talked about having received advice not to open the door if they fear a visit from Immigration and Customs Enforcement” agents, the memo said. The researchers called the responses “eye-opening” because many of the respondents had participated in previous census-related testing and not expressed similar nervousness or hesitation about sharing information.

    "title": "29 Things To Give A S**t About In 2018",
    "text": "2017 was a hard year for many Americans ― it was a year full of fury, resistance and exhaustion. It was also a year in which it became obvious how much collective action and empathy matter. In 2018, we resolve, as we did last year, to care more, even when it’s overwhelming. We resolve to care more about the people around us and the people we’ve never met, to embrace joy in the face of hate and light in the face of darkness. Below are 29 things, big and small, that we’ll be giving a shit about in 2018. Consider joining us. 1. Difficult conversations. Not only are they essential if we ever want to tackle our nation’s deep polarization, but they can also be beautiful. 2. Showing up ― for friends, family members and, perhaps most important, communities that you’re not a part of. 3. Dreamers. They make America great. 4. So-bad-it’s-good and so-good-it’s-good TV. Indulge your escapist tendencies once in a while, because everyone deserves to turn their brain off sometimes. 5. Seeing the world. Travel abroad if you can, and when you can’t, connect with the rest of the world virtually. America is not, in fact, the center of the universe, and it’s healthy to remind yourself of that. 6. The women in your life who know you so well that you can communicate with one look. (See: “Big Little Lies.”) 7. Books ― the kind that sit with you for weeks after you turn the last page. 8. Doughnuts. 9. Coffee ... 10. ... and wine. Because life is all about balance. 11. Tiny acts of kindness. Give that stranger directions, donate $5 to that canvasser you pass every day, lend that girl in the bathroom line your ponytail holder. 12. The people of Puerto Rico. 13. The Olympics! And the Paralympics! The human body is an amazing thing. 14. Mental health days. 15. Men who step back, listen and follow women in the fight for gender equality. (Note: No gold stars are to be given out for this one.) 16. Gun control legislation, because it’s about fucking time. Or, rather, way past fucking time. 17. Black women. (Here are ways to show you give a shit.) 18. Truly cozy PJs. Everyone should have one pair. 19. Gerrymandering. 20. The midterm elections. Get educated, get activated and get out the vote. 21. Carly Rae Jepsen’s forthcoming album. (Take your pure delights where you can get them.) 22. Storytellers ― especially those who are not rich, cis, straight, white men. 23. The bodily autonomy of women and gender nonconforming people. 24. The Earth. It’s the only home we’ve got. 25. Believing women. #MeToo. #HerToo. #ThemToo. 26. Democracy. 27. Facts. 28. Rage. 29. Love.",

    "title": "3 More Women Accuse Director Paul Haggis Of Sexual Harassment And Rape",
    "text": "A total of four women have accused screenwriter and director Paul Haggis of some form of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault and rape. In a Friday afternoon report from The Associated Press, one woman alleges that Haggis sexually harassed her, another says that he sexually assaulted her, and a third claims he raped her. The fourth woman, Haggis’ former publicist Haleigh Breest, accused Haggis in December of raping her in 2013. Also in December, Breest sued Haggis for $9 million and he sued her for intentional infliction of emotional distress. All of the alleged incidents took place between 1996 and 2015. In a statement to HuffPost, Haggis’ attorney Christine Lepera vehemently denied all four allegations. She noted that Haggis believes these accusations may stem from Scientology. Haggis has long-been a vocal critic of the religion and its affiliated organizations. Lepera’s full statement said: Mr. Haggis denies these anonymous claims in whole. In a society where one of a person’s fundamental rights is the ability to confront an accuser, that right has now been eviscerated when it comes to anyone being charged in the press with any sort of sexual misconduct. Notably, no one has reached out to anyone on Mr. Haggis’ team other than the press to report this. He views the fact that these reports appear to be spearheaded from the law-firm representing Ms. Breest, as a further tactic to try to harm him and continue their effort to obtain money. Mr. Haggis also questions whether Scientology has any role here, which he notes has been attacking him for years with false accusations. We reiterate our claim against Ms. Breest, and note again that we initiated the legal proceedings, not Ms. Breest. All three of the new accusers, who chose to stay anonymous, told the AP that they were just starting out in the movie business when Haggis allegedly took advantage of his position in power. The first woman alleges that Haggis sexually assaulted and raped her when she was a 28-year-old publicist working on a TV show he was producing in 1996. According to her account, Haggis wanted to review photos from the show in the young woman’s office when he began forcibly kissing her. “I just pulled away. He was just glaring at me and came at me again. I was really resisting. He said to me, ’Do you really want to continue working?’” the woman told the AP. “And then he really forced himself on me. I was just numb. I didn’t know what to do.” She said Haggis then made her perform oral sex and raped her on the office floor. The second accuser told the AP that Haggis sexually harassed her in the late 2000s in Los Angeles when she was trying to sell him on a new TV show. The woman said that Haggis attempted to kiss her during a late-night meeting, telling her that he and his wife had an arrangement where he could have sex with other people. The woman quickly realized what was happening and ran for her car. Although she says Haggis ran after her, she got home safely. The third woman told the AP that Haggis forcibly kissed her multiple times and followed her into a cab when the two were in Canada in 2015. When the cab arrived at her apartment, the third accuser says Haggis chased her to her door and forcibly kissed her until she was able to escape into her home. Breest, the first woman to accuse Haggis of assault, says that the “Million Dollar Baby” screenwriter and “Crash” director raped her in his Manhattan apartment in 2013. According to Breest’s lawsuit, Haggis became “sexually aggressive” and forced her into a bedroom. She reportedly told him “no” but she says Haggis then forced her to perform oral sex and raped her. The three new accusers told the AP they were inspired by the recent #MeToo movement to come forward and tell their stories. They came forward to Breest’s lawyers after she filed her lawsuit against Haggis on Dec. 15, 2017.

    "title": "30 Important Things I've Learned By 30",
    "text": "I blame the movie 13 Going on 30. When it was released, I was 16, closer to the 13-year-old protagonist than the 30-year-old. Despite the movie’s tagline for 30 (flirty and fun), I couldn’t help but think 30 was an endpoint in my journey. I imagined by 30, I would be settled into a predictable, stable life. I’d have everything figured out. In short, I felt like 30 was old. Now, my 30th birthday is in a few days. I’d like to say I’ve grown wiser and am excited for those 30 candles. But I can’t lie—30 scares the hell out of me. I shudder with panic just typing that number. How did I get here? How am I already the age of Jennifer Garner’s character? And why the hell didn’t I figure out the flirty and fun part? In truth, I’m scared because, like so many women, the thought of aging is terrifying. It isn’t the superficial fear of wrinkled skin and gray hairs that panics me. I think it’s more the fear of time going so quickly, of the opportunity for dreams seeming to slip through my fingertips. The clock ticking and decades slipping by, I now realize the adage about time going too fast is the truest truth I’ve heard. The other part of me is scared because there’s so much I haven’t figured out. My 16-year-old self imagined the 30-year-old me to be sophisticated, to be graceful, and to have all the answers. I now realize a sad reality: I don’t know if I have any of the answers, and I certainly don’t feel graceful or sophisticated. My life isn’t a constant stream of dinner parties, laughter, expensive wine, and classy outfits. It’s a messy concoction that’s part clawing my way out of dilemmas and part hanging on for dear life. Still, after a deep breath and some reminders that life will go on after I blow out those 30 candles in a few days, I can acknowledge that even if I don’t have all the answers, I’ve figured out a few things along the way. Valid or not, here are 30 important things I’ve learned in these first 30 years. 1. Friends really do come and go, and that’s okay. 2. No one’s house is sparkling clean all of the time. At least this is what I’m telling myself as the dishes stack up and the vacuum desperately needs run. 3. You really are your own best friend. It’s something my dad told me in Kindergarten that made me cry, but I’ve come to see the truth in it. You have to be your own cheerleader, advocate, and friend sometimes. 4. But dogs are good best friends, too. With my big best friend, Henry 5. Love doesn’t make life perfect, but it does heighten the experience. 6. The honeymoon does last; it just changes a lot. Your visions of love and romance will change. It’s not going to be roses, candles, and sexy all the time—but that’s okay. 7. You really do need to find a job you love. 8. Never underestimate your impact on those around you. 9. Sometimes a smile can change everything. 10. Surprises are the best parts of life. Sometimes the unexpected things in life turn out to be the best. 11. Failure can be a good thing because it can lead you to a more fulfilling place. 12. Don’t be afraid to dream big because wild dreams can come true. 13. There’s no timeline for your life. There’s no age-limit for getting married, buying a house, having kids. There’s also no requirement to have those things. Live in the moment. Enjoy your life as it is, and only seek to change it when you’re ready. 14. Crying over what-ifs is never productive. 15. Tell him what you’re upset about. It will save so much time and energy to just admit to him you’re mad. 16. Your body will change over the years...embrace it. And buying SPANX doesn’t hurt, either. 17. Wear what you love because the trends will come back around. 18. Don’t be afraid to say “I love you” often. 19. Your true friends will celebrate your success and support you in your failures. 20. Don’t be afraid to say “no.” To things you don’t want to do, to events, to tasks. Own your time and life. 21. It’s okay to accept your weaknesses—like cooking in my case. 22. Put the phone down and take in life around you. 23. Winged eyeliner is hard. Seriously. 24. Always set a timer when cooking. 25. Red lipstick can overshadow a bad hair day. 26. Leggings are pants. End of story. 27. Never forget where you came from. 28. Take lots of photographs so you don’t forget. 29. It’s a fine line between being nice and being walked all over. Tread carefully. 30. The most valuable thing in life? Time. I’ve accumulated money, shoes, makeup, and some successes over the years. As I stand here on the precipice of a new decade, however, I’ve come to realize the one thing that matters most—time. It’s the one thing we get such a finite amount of that we need to treasure it. We need to budget it wisely. And, in the next 30 years, I plan to do just that. At 30, I’ve still got so much to learn... but I guess that’s the beauty of it. I won’t lie... I’m a scared of turning 30. Still, I know that like the first 30 years of life, these next 30 will be filled with lessons, good and bad. They’ll be filled with memories and laughter, love and loss. They will be the years that maybe I can get closer to figuring out who I am, what I want, and how to make the most of this crazy journey.

    "title": "7 Secrets Self-Made Millionaires Teach Their Kids",
    "text": "What do you teach your kids about money, prosperity and how to get rich? If you’re like most parents, the answer is probably: not much. If you ever needed a reason to start the conversation about money with your kids, here it is: the median savings balance among working households aged 50 to 55 is $8,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. For households aged 56 to 61, the median savings balance isn’t much better, at just $17,000. The only way we can combat this great financial plague and help ensure our younger generations don’t continue to struggle is to teach them from a young age the right ways to make the big money. Over the past 34 years, I’ve had the chance to interview and observe more than 1,200 self-made millionaires. The lessons I watched the self-made rich teach their kids were mind blowing, and the polar opposite of what we are taught about money in middle-class America. Here are seven of the secrets self-made millionaires teach their kids: You deserve to be rich Most people believe that you can only be rich if you were born into the right family, attended the best school or possess uncommon talent. While these advantages certainly help, they are by no means required to be rich. In a free market economy like America, if you serve enough people and solve enough problems, you deserve to be rich. This is capitalism at its best. Wealth creates freedom The best thing about wealth is the freedom it offers you. It’s the freedom to live life on your own terms. Being rich allows you to live anywhere you want, do anything you want and be anything you want to be. If you want to start a business, take up a new sport, learn a language, donate to your favorite charity or anything else, all that’s required is the decision to do so. Most important, having money eliminates financial worry and allows you the freedom to choose and enjoy life. You’re not entitled The world owes you nothing. No one is entitled to anything. It’s up to you to create your own future. The idea of entitlement seems to be growing in popularity, yet it’s based on the delusion that we are born with certain rights. We’re not. We’re just born. The rest is up to you. Teach your kids the opposite of the entitled mentality, which is self-reliance. The irony of this is that the more you exhibit your self-reliant attitude and don’t act as if you need help, the more people want to help you. Get rich solving problems The world wants you to be rich because it has a lot of challenges to solve. If you want to be rich, solve a problem. If you want to be very wealthy, solve a bigger problem. The larger the problem you solve, the richer you get. In a free market economy, that’s all there is to it. I’m not implying that getting rich is easy, but it is that simple. Match your unique talents, abilities and passions with a problem-solving idea, and you’ll be on your way to wealth. Think for yourself The average person is taught what to think. The millionaire in the making is taught how to think. Your kids will learn many great lessons from well-intentioned and well-educated individuals, but odds are that most of these people won’t know the first thing about acquiring wealth. Teach your kids to think big, reach their own conclusions and blaze their own trail no matter who may criticize their ambition, doubt their ability and laugh at their vision. Raise your expectations Many psychologists believe that people should lower their expectations so they won’t be disappointed if they fail. They believe people will be happier expecting and settling for less. This is another mass oriented formula for failure. Teach your kids to stop living in fear, and instead, live in a world of possibilities, potential and opportunity. Let the middle class be satisfied with mediocrity while you reach for the stars. Remember, many of today’s biggest success stories were mocked by doubters at one time. Believe in yourself As a striver and achiever, you will attempt many great things. The odds are that some will be successful, and others won’t. The road to world-class success is usually paved with setbacks, disappointments and failures. The secret to survival: never abandon yourself. No matter what happens in your life, you must always believe in yourself and your ability to handle whatever life throws at you. You may lose the popular vote, but never allow yourself to lose your own support. Always believe in yourself and your ability to comeback, even if everyone else gives up on you. The takeaway Children learn from their parents, so start having conversations with your kids about money early on. Even parents who haven’t been the most financially successful can see to it that their kids really understand what it takes to become wealthy. Imagine growing up being tutored on how to become a self-made millionaire. The advantages would be difficult to deny.",

    "text": "When I had first heard of the oil cleansing method, my eyes rolled just thinking about removing dirt or makeup off my oily skin with another oil-based product. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not one to shy away from trying any new skincare trend, whether that be jade rollers, derma-rolling, squalane, or even snail serum. But because I have more oily skin, I naturally thought that a water-based cleanser was my best option because it would help remove all shininess. What I failed to realize was that my cleanser was actually drying out my skin, causing it to go into oil-production overload and exacerbating the issue to begin with. Oil cleansing is a gentler but just as effective way to dissolve those bad oils on our face, while also softening, nourishing, and brightening our skin because it’s less harsh than your average cleanser. Whether you have combination, oily, or sensitive skin, oil cleansing is worth trying out, especially during winter when our skin tends to be drier.

    "title": "A Day Of Liberation In The Golden State",
    "text": "For the third day in a row, marijuana is legally available for both purchase and consumption in California, for purely recreational purposes, to any adult age 21 or older. Also, for the third day in a row: the sky did not fall, the sun still rose in the east, and people are not rioting in the streets. Astonishingly, it turned out to be only an acorn that beaned Chicken Little, and none of the dire hellscapes predicted ― for almost a century ― by the government, the Puritans, and the likes of Nancy Reagan has yet come to pass. It’s just another day, in fact, little different from all the tens of thousands of days when marijuana was prohibited. Of course, this was obvious to anyone who has been paying the slightest bit of attention, since California was not the first such state to take such a radical step. Colorado and Washington have enjoyed legal recreational marijuana sales for years now, and Oregon and Alaska weren’t far behind. California is part of the third wave of states to fully legalize, along with Nevada, Massachusetts, and Maine. Over 21 percent of the nation’s population lives in these eight states ― over one-fifth of American citizens can now buy marijuana without fear of legal consequences or retribution, in other words. All of these states are now openly defying federal law, which states that marijuana is still always illegal, for all purposes, everywhere in the United States. Much like Prohibition (of alcohol) before it, though, this is becoming increasingly nothing more than a scofflaw, to varying degrees. It is now easier to keep track of the states which have not legalized at least medicinal marijuana, since there are fewer of them than those that have (21 versus 29 that have legalized some form of medical use). This strikes to the very core of the federal law against marijuana which states that marijuana (or sometimes “marihuana,” reflecting the increasingly ancient nature of these federal laws) “has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.” When almost six out of ten states have medicinal marijuana laws on the books, that statement is now nothing short of patently and laughably absurd. Of course, it is still possible for you to get arrested in California for smoking a joint, but you’ve really got to try hard for it to happen. If you were stupid enough to travel up to Yosemite National Park and spark up a doobie in front of a park ranger, you would get arrested and tried under federal law for doing so, since the park is federal land. They’ve even got their own jail and federal judge, so you wouldn’t even have to leave to park for this to happen. But short of blatantly smoking weed in front of a federal law enforcement officer on federal land, nobody in California has to fear such a prospect again. Of course, there are still state and local laws banning consumption in public, but it’s hard to see the cops caring much except in the most egregious cases (“Please just put out the joint, sir or ma’am, and move along” is much more likely). The federal government might also conceivably attempt to bust growers, middlemen, or retailers, but the sheer size of the market means it would be absolutely impossible for them to even make the attempt at arresting people for merely possessing or consuming marijuana ― hopefully, ever again. Adults in the Golden State can now buy marijuana with only slightly more hassle than it takes to buy a sixpack of beer, a bottle of antihistamines, or a pack of cigarettes. Which is as it should be. Everywhere. Our country’s founding document ― the first time we put on paper what our country and our government should be ― spells this out in no uncertain terms. Governments simply cannot legitimately attempt to take away from anyone the right to live your life, the right to be free, and the right to pursue happiness in any way you choose which does not harm others. Period. Any government which attempts to take away such rights is, by definition, tyrannical and illegitimate, because these rights are guaranteed to all at birth and you can never be separated from them for any reason. If further proof is needed, please look up the dictionary definition of “unalienable.” In fact, it wouldn’t surprise me in the least to see bumperstickers begin to appear which warn politicians “I smoke marijuana ― and I vote.” The People have spoken, by the direct democracy of a ballot initiative, and it is now impossible to ignore their will. The mainstream media doesn’t really know what to make of it all. They run bemused stories which still fall back on stoner humor, or they offer sober assessments of how the new marijuana economy will change things, or they still attempt to warn of the direst of consequences. Almost none of these stories hinge on the aspect of sheer liberation, however. There is a big difference between marijuana legalization and two other historic political battles for liberation, of course. Both the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and the leaps and bounds gay rights have made in the past decade or so were also struggles for liberation ― both of which have not fully been realized, even today. These fights for equality, though, ran a whole lot deeper than the fight to be left alone to smoke a joint in peace. You cannot change the color of the skin you were born with, and as Lady Gaga will tell you, people don’t choose to be who they are sexually, they are born that way. But nobody is a born pot smoker. It’s just not an inherent part of a person at birth. But, much like defeating Prohibition before it, it is indeed a fight for liberation from government tyranny and overreach. Citizens used to regularly be locked up in prison for merely possessing even a trace amount of what is, in essence, just a plant. People were routinely given decades-long prison sentences for having natural plant matter in their possession. Those lucky enough to escape the hoosegow still faced steep fines, the destruction of careers, disqualification for student loans or government housing, and repossession of houses, cars, and money on the momentary whim of police officers ― on a daily basis. Marijuana is reportedly supposed to induce paranoia in its users, but how paranoid is it to be worried about such things when the consequences were so drastic for getting caught? To put it another way: Are you truly paranoid if they really are after you? In California, people have been wary for decades, of even such a simple thing as discussing marijuana over the phone. So much for freedom of speech, when the cops can tap a dealer’s line and record it to use as evidence. Your personal electric bills were open to inspection by the cops as well, to catch “grow houses” using an inordinate amount of electricity for halogen lights. Cops would roll up on houses with heat-vision devices to see which houses were glowing too hot ― another sign of a grow house. Growers had had to move inside due to the thousands of flights of helicopters overhead, searching for illegal farms. They even tossed out the federal Posse Comitatus Act when they formed “CAMP,” or the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting, which was a cooperative effort by local, state, and federal troops. In fact, the heavy-handed efforts and outright legal abuses of CAMP were largely responsible for California leading the initial legal pushback against the entire War On Weed. In 1996, California became the first state in the nation to legalize medicinal marijuana, which was the tipping point down the slippery slope towards full legalization we are traveling on today. Adults in California ― the state’s citizens and visitors alike ― now no longer have to worry about their car being confiscated for buying some pot. They no longer have to worry about their license plate being photographed outside a store selling hydroponic equipment. They no longer have to worry about their house being seized for growing a plant or two in the back yard. They no longer cringe when helicopters fly over. They no longer fear arrest, fines, or even imprisonment for possessing this plant. That is indeed a story of liberation. It is a story of freedom. The freedom from fear. The freedom to say the word “marijuana” on the phone without cops showing up to ask you about it. The freedom not to worry about what the mailman sees when you open the front door to sign for a package. The freedom from any paranoia at all, in fact, whether legitimate or imagined. As F.D.R. might have said: the fear itself of possessing marijuana is no longer to be feared. It’s a new day in California, just as it was a new day in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska a few years ago. A day when every adult is totally and utterly free to pursue happiness through the medium of marijuana, should they so choose. And, as I began, the sky has yet to fall. January 1, 2018 has entered the history books in California as a day of liberation for millions, because they no longer need fear the racist, misguided, and tyrannical attempts by government to limit the freedom the Declaration of Independence says we are all born to enjoy. The times they certainly are a-changing, out here in the Golden State.

    "title": "A New Year’s Resolution That Counts",
    "text": "Enshrined in the U.S. Constitution, the “decennial census” has critical fiscal and political implications at every level of government. It is also one of the most fundamental examples of our government in action. This once-a-decade effort by the federal government attempts to accurately count every person living in the United States—and 2018 marks the year that the U.S. Census Bureau conducts an end-to-end census test, a sort of dress rehearsal for the real thing. While Census Day will not officially take place until April 1, 2020, the advance work must be done this year, and early signs indicate that the next census is off to a rocky start, and needs our collective and immediate attention. In January 2017, the U.S. Government Accountability Office sounded an early alarm when it placed the 2020 Census on its “high-risk” list of vulnerable programs and agencies due to fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement. A year later, and a year closer to Census Day, the challenges are greater and the time to solve them grows less. The U.S. Census Bureau, currently without a dedicated director since last June, is trying to prepare for 2020, which will be the first census conducted largely online rather than by mail. But the Census Bureau is beset by budget cuts, cost overruns and a mandate by Congress to hold the 2020 Census to the same $13 billion price tag as the last census in 2010. Budget constraints and a lack of operational readiness have led the agency to cancel field tests meant to assess the Spanish-language capabilities of the system as well as targeted tests to evaluate rural and Native-American districts. The one and only census test will take place in Providence County, Rhode Island, a microcosm of sorts in the smallest state in the country. Growing concerns are being raised that a lack of leadership, administrative inefficiencies, and an underfunding of the 2020 Census will only lead to an undercount that will have lasting consequences. An accurate headcount of the population will set the table for congressional apportionment and the redrawing of the boundaries for legislative districts at the state and federal levels. These new legislative districts and the reapportionment of the House of Representatives rely on accurate census data as the baseline of determining political power and electoral votes in presidential elections. The U.S. Census must count all residents regardless of age, race, ethnicity, gender, and includes citizens and non-citizens. Census data is used to annually distribute, per capita, billions in government grants and subsidies to state and local governments. Hundreds of federal financial assistance programs rely on census data to accurately guide the geographic distribution of government funds to support Medicaid, and everything from highway and transportation construction to school lunch programs. Because the census literally involves every single person living in the United States, we all should be asking ourselves, and more importantly our elected officials, “What are you doing now to ensure an accurate census in 2020?” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Trump Lawyer Moves To Block Explosive Book On White House From Publication",
    "text": "A lawyer representing President Donald Trump sent a cease-and-desist letter this week to journalist Michael Wolff and publisher Henry Holt & Co. seeking to stop distribution of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, the Washington Post reported Thursday. A section of the book has already sparked a public feud between the president and his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is quoted voicing criticisms of Trump and his family. According to the Post, media attorney Charles J. Harder demands that the publisher “immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release or dissemination of the book,” including excerpts and summaries. Harder also requested a full copy of the book, which is set for release Jan. 9. Bannon claims in Fire and Fury that Trump was not only aware of Donald Trump Jr’s meeting with Russian operatives at Trump Tower in June 2016, but that he met with them, too. The president has repeatedly claimed no knowledge of the meeting, which Bannon mocked and labeled “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.” In response, Trump released a statement slamming Bannon, whom he said “has nothing to do with me or my Presidency.” “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind,” Trump said in the statement. A representative for Henry Holt & Co. confirmed to HuffPost that the publisher received the letter. “We see ‘Fire and Fury’ as an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse, and are proceeding with the publication of the book,” read a statement. Late Wednesday, Harder sent a cease-and-desist letter to Bannon for his incendiary comments. The lawyer claimed Bannon broke the terms of a “confidentiality and non-disparagement agreement” he signed when he joined Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016 by “making disparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements” to Wolff. In the letter, Harder suggested he would soon be taking legal action against Bannon, who appeared to backpedal his criticisms of the Trump administration on his Breitbart radio show Wednesday night. Referring to Trump as “a great man,” the former White House strategist said he supports the president “day in and day out.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "This Rap About Authentic Ethnic Food Is The Asian-American Anthem We Need",
    "text": "We Asian-Americans take serious pride in our cultural foods. Now, there’s a banger that sums up so many dishes that we love. Rappers Lyricks and JL, the duo behind Year Of the Ox (YOX), released a music video late last year for the song “A-Zn Foods.” Created as an ode to their favorite Asian cuisine, the song goes through an alphabet’s worth of dishes and foods. Beware: You WILL get insanely hungry while listening to it. The track’s title is a play off “Azn,” commonly used as shorthand for “Asian.” And as the two chow down throughout the video, the pair spit fire rhymes about beloved foods like Vietnamese banh mi, Japanese ikayaki, and Filipino longanisa. There’s also that perfect “got rice, bitch?” line. In addition to rattling off a ton of must-eat foods, the two drop truth bomb (cyclones?) about the appropriation of our Asian cuisine, underscoring why people need to support authentic, unadulterated ethnic food. “Before I learned to talk, I learned the hand-water ratio,” the pair rap. “I get mad as fuck when I see our foods getting gentrified for the mass to love. Why they selling kimchi for 30 bucks at the Gastropub?” Boom. The track is particularly poignant under the backdrop of a rising culinary phenomenon in which non-Asian chefs pose as the authority on Asian food and proclaim the cuisine as “trendy” or fail to honor the original dishes made by people from the actual culture. Oftentimes, they’re applauded for their “cultural awareness” and profit off of ethnic food while avoiding the prejudice and ridicule immigrants are subjected to when they make food from their homelands. “This cultural appropriation stings because the same dishes hyped as ‘authentic’ on trendy menus were scorned when cooked in the homes of the immigrants who brought them here,” Ruth Tam wrote in the Washington Post. YOX’s song could use the addition of some South Asian dishes. But it stands as a great starting point for everything we have to remember to eat this year.

    "title": "Why Progressives Shouldn't Assume Republicans Will 'Move On' From ACA Repeal",
    "text": "Figuring out how Republicans plan to approach health care this year isn’t easy. A little more than a week ago, just before Christmas, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that his party would “probably move on” from full repeal of the Affordable Care Act now that Republicans have eliminated the individual mandate, which is a key piece of the law’s architecture. But just a few days later, some conservative House Republicans said they aren’t ready to back off: Repeal is “still on the table,” insisted Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.). Of course, this back-and-forth should feel pretty familiar by now. In March, after an initial effort to pass repeal legislation in the House failed, GOP leaders indicated they were ready to focus on other priorities. But some determined members of the Republican caucus kept at it. Within a few weeks the full House was voting on, and approving, new legislation. In July, after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) cast a dramatic and decisive third vote to kill Obamacare repeal in the Senate, McConnell said “it’s time to move on” ― yes, the same phrase he used last week. But two Republican senators, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, had other ideas. They got to work on their own bill, rallying support among colleagues and eventually persuading McConnell to try again ― although that proposal, like the Senate’s previous effort, never got the votes it needed to pass. This time could be different. By eliminating the mandate, which requires those who opt out of coverage to pay a penalty, Republicans have finally notched a significant legislative victory in their years-long crusade against Obamacare. President Donald Trump has taken to saying that Republicans have “essentially repealed” the 2010 health care law and polls show 44 percent of Republicans believe him. Plenty of progressives seem happy to encourage that notion, if only because it might keep Trump’s gaze focused elsewhere. But progressives also know that, substantively speaking, Trump happens to be wrong. The law’s Medicaid expansion remains in place, as do its health insurance tax credits and protections for pre-existing conditions. That means there’s still plenty of Obamacare for Republicans to repeal. And if it’s easy to construct a coherent theory for why Republicans won’t seriously take up their campaign again this year, it’s just as easy to construct a coherent theory for why they will. Probably the single biggest impediment to another run at full repeal is the vote count in the Senate ― and how it’s about to change. The closest Republicans came to passing one of their bills was that late July vote, when McConnell and his lieutenants brought several measures to the floor in a desperate attempt to pass anything that could lead to negotiations with the House. The final attempt was on a “skinny repeal” bill that would have eliminated the individual mandate and done little else. It failed because, with Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joining McCain in voting no, Republicans were one short of the 50 votes they needed for a bill to pass. (Vice President Mike Pence would have broken the tie.) Now, in theory, Republicans are two votes short because they lost one of Alabama’s Senate seats in the recent special election. With Democrat Doug Jones in the seat that Luther Strange had occupied, passing repeal would require flipping two votes (among Collins, McCain and Murkowski) to yes. Flipping just one of them was going to be hard enough. That’s especially true now that the individual mandate will be disappearing. The mandate has played an important role in the newly reformed health insurance system by giving healthy people more incentive to get coverage. Without that penalty in place, insurers will have to raise premiums. But the mandate has also been among the least popular features of the Affordable Care Act, creating a serious political liability for the program as a whole. Now that liability is gone, leaving only the law’s more popular provisions. There’s the Medicaid expansion, through which millions have gotten coverage and on which states have to come to rely in their fight against the opioid epidemic. There are the guarantees of insurance for people with pre-existing medical conditions. And there are tax credits worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year to people who use them. Voting to undermine these provisions was difficult for many Republicans the first time around. Voting to undermine them now, with Republicans down in the polls and midterm elections much closer, is bound to be harder. In normal political times, that combination of factors would all but guarantee Republicans stay far away from repeal in 2018. But these are not normal political times, as 2017 has made clear. It’s not like repeal proposals were ever popular. House Republicans approved their bill anyway, while Senate Republicans came within just one vote of doing the same with theirs. Even those senators from the states most dependent on Medicaid for opioid treatment, Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, were willing to support cuts to the program under some circumstances. Nor is it clear that any given Republican who voted against repeal previously will do so again, even if the circumstances are similar. When Collins, Murkowski and McCain voted against the skinny bill, all three cited, among other reasons, the rushed process that got legislation to the floor ― without full committee hearings, final cost projections or serious efforts to engage Democrats in negotiation. But Collins and Murkowski voted for the GOP tax cut bill, whose provision to repeal the mandate was functionally the same thing as the skinny repeal bill, and McCain would have done so if present ― even though Republicans were once again rushing legislation to the floor without the usual committee hearings, without a final cost projection and without serious efforts to engage Democrats. An X-factor in all of this is how ending the mandate actually affects insurance markets going forward. It’s unlikely to cause a true unraveling because the biggest incentive in getting healthy people to sign up for coverage turns out to be those premium tax credits, and the discounts they produce, rather than the penalty for going without coverage. That guarantees a sizable market that will entice some insurers to stay in the program. It also protects people who qualify for the subsidies (who represent the majority of people buying insurance on their own) from having to pay more as premiums go up. But people who make too much to qualify for tax credits will face much higher premiums, to the point where many if not most simply cannot pay for comprehensive coverage anymore. That’s already true in a handful of places, but, without the mandate, it’s likely to be true in more areas. Consumers will find out about this right before the midterm elections, because that is when insurers will finalize premiums for 2019 ― the first year that the mandate won’t be in place. Republicans might feel compelled to act, if not before consumers learn about the premium hikes than afterward, although whether they’d use that as an excuse to try repeal again is difficult to say. Less ambiguous is the GOP’s determination to focus again on cuts to Medicaid ― not because the program has problems but because tearing it down is such a defining cause for Republican leaders in general and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) in particular. One possibility is that Republicans go after Medicaid but in a different way than they have so far this year. Instead of calling it Obamacare repeal, they could call it “welfare reform,” which Ryan has already said will be a priority for House Republicans in 2018. This is not a fight that progressives need to fear. Arguably the most surprising revelation of the repeal fights this year was the popularity of Medicaid, a program that has been a political afterthought for most of its half century in existence. Until this year, the conventional wisdom about Medicaid, which is primarily for low-income Americans, was that it lacked the deep public support of Medicare, which is primarily for seniors. But polls now show Medicaid to be almost as popular as Medicare, perhaps because many of the people who qualify for Medicaid are working people who have become newly eligible because of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion. The program also includes many seniors and people with disabilities who use it to pay for services, including nursing home care, that Medicare does not cover.

While the national media was (understandably) focusing on the character and conduct of Republican nominee Roy Moore, Jones in his ads and speeches was focusing more on bread-and-butter issues ― among them, why Alabama should join the majority of states that have expanded eligibility. Progressives can also look back on 2017 and feel confident their efforts played a big, possibly decisive role in stopping repeal. One year ago, GOP efforts to wipe away the 2010 health care law seemed almost certain to succeed. But the program is still operating, and, by the official end of open enrollment for HealthCare.gov, nearly 9 million people signed up ― nearly as many as last year, despite huge cuts to enrollment outreach and other efforts by the Trump administration to sabotage the program. The public remains divided on the program, but for the first time clear majorities approve of it, according to polls. All of these signs suggest that the Affordable Care Act, despite its very real problems that need very real attention, is more resilient than most people realized a year ago. But if 2017 has shown anything, it’s that the program’s critics are relentless. The surest way to stop them is to assume they won’t stop trying.

    "title": "Aging, Undocumented And Uninsured Immigrants Challenge Cities And States",
    "text": "Most older undocumented people lack health insurance. The Affordable Care Act doesn’t cover them, and they don’t qualify for Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security. At 65, Marcos, who is undocumented, does not have health insurance. Whenever he is sick, he says, he stays at home and waits it out. Across the U.S., the aging, undocumented population is growing rapidly. By Teresa Wiltz WASHINGTON, D.C. — Early on a recent morning, men huddle in the Home Depot parking lot, ground zero for day laborers on the hunt for work. Cars pull into the lot, and the men swarm. Among them is Marcos, at 65, wiry and bronzed with a silvery smile. He’s been in the country illegally for 20 years, working construction and landscaping, doing whatever he can get, whenever he can get it. When he’s sick, he just rests, because — like most undocumented workers — he doesn’t have insurance. “I don’t know if I have high blood pressure,” he said, laughing ruefully, “Because I don’t check. Doctors, you know, are expensive.” For decades, the United States has struggled to deal with the health care needs of its undocumented immigrants — now an estimated 11 million — mainly through emergency room care and community health centers. But in the coming years, that struggle will evolve. As with the rest of America, the population of people living here illegally is aging and beginning to develop the same health problems that plague senior citizens generally and are a lot more expensive to treat: chronic diseases, cognitive disorders and physical injuries. Many undocumented adults lack health insurance, and even though they’re guaranteed emergency care for acute problems such as heart attacks, senior citizens without documentation don’t have access to care for chronic issues such as kidney disease and high blood pressure. What’s more, experts predict that many will — like Marcos — forgo primary preventive care even when it is available, likely making their chronic health problems worse — and more expensive to treat. “They’re hosed. If you’re an undocumented immigrant, you’re paying into Social Security and Medicare, but can’t claim it,” said Steven Wallace, associate director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. When uninsured people go without preventive health care and end up in the hospital, someone has to pay. Since most of these patients are low-income, much of their bill ends up as bad debt, which then pushes up rates for those who have insurance, or are billed to public programs like Emergency Medicaid, which is paid for out of general taxes. This contributes to a game of shifting costs. Hospitals that don’t cover their costs go bankrupt and close, so indigent care costs that end up as unpaid bills are covered by other payers, such as insurance companies. When insurers pay more, they raise insurance premiums, passing on the costs to consumers, Wallace said. “It’ll place a strain on the entire health care system, from primary care to hospitals,” Wallace said. Growing Numbers Approximately 10 percent of the undocumented population is over 55 now, according to the Migration Policy Institute, but researchers agree that the percentage and the raw numbers almost certainly will rise. “The unauthorized immigrant population has become more settled in recent years, and as a result is aging,” said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of global migration and demography at the Pew Research Center in Washington. (The Pew Charitable Trusts funds both the Pew Research Center and Stateline.) Estimates vary on how many undocumented immigrants lack insurance. The Kaiser Foundation estimates 39 percent of undocumented immigrants are uninsured, while the Migration Policy Institute, which analyzes U.S. Census data, estimates as many as 71 percent of undocumented adults do not have insurance. Like Marcos, older undocumented people tend to be poor. The Affordable Care Act doesn’t cover them, and they don’t qualify for Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security, even though many pay taxes. They can buy private insurance, but few can afford it. That means most must turn to emergency rooms or community health centers, federally funded clinics that provide primary health care to poor people on a sliding scale, regardless of their immigration status. But community health centers were originally created to provide maternity care to women and aren’t equipped to provide extensive care to undocumented seniors, Wallace said. And because Congress has yet to fund them this year, their future is precarious. Leighton Ku, professor and director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, said immigrants, both authorized and unauthorized, are much less likely to use health care than are U.S. citizens. This is partly because of language barriers, and partly cultural, Ku said. “They get sick, and grin and bear it.” Until, that is, they’re quite ill. Many also fear running afoul of immigration authorities, health officials say, which means that by the time they get to the doctor, they’re even sicker. “Their numbers are going to grow and we’re going to have an epidemic on our hands,” said Maryland state Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk, a Democrat whose district has one of the highest rates of undocumented immigrants in the state. “Who’s going to pay for it?” Already, there have been some indications as to who will have to foot the bill. A 2014 report by the Texas Medical Association found that undocumented immigrants with kidney disease face considerable barriers to care. By the time they do get help, they need dialysis, costing Texas taxpayers as much as $10 million a year. Stepping in to Help Many cities have tried to step in. A 2016 Wall Street Journal story noted that 25 counties with large undocumented populations provide some non-emergency health care to these immigrants, at a combined cost of what the paper estimated is more than $1 billion each year. Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and San Francisco are among the places where immigrants can usually get access to some kind of routine care, no matter their immigration status, thanks to locally funded health care programs. In Los Angeles, Dr. Christina Hillson, a family practice doctor at the Eisner Health Clinic, said she’s seeing a growing number of undocumented patients in their 60s to 80s, whom she’s treated for everything from ovarian cancer to amputations resulting from untreated diabetes. Her clinic is part of My Health LA, a Los Angeles county program that provides free primary care to low-income patients, including some undocumented patients if they qualify. Patients who are critically ill are classified as emergencies and are able to get treated through the hospital system, she said. Sometimes, when patients aren’t as sick, Hillson will still refer them to the ER, because it’s the only way she can get their testing for a potentially deadly illness covered and get them connected to a specialist. She recently had to refer a 68-year-old undocumented patient with rapidly growing breast cancer to the ER, because that’s the only way she would be treated. Snapshot of a Population Most undocumented immigrants came to this country as young people and tended to be healthier than native-born citizens, Wallace said. But as they age, they lose that advantage, he said. This may be due to a combination of factors, from poverty to tough working conditions to adapting to American-style bad habits such as increased consumption of junk food and decreased physical activity, he said. Of the country’s aging immigrants living here without documentation, women are more likely to have family in the U.S. who can help care for them as they age, said Randy Capps, a director of research at the Migration Policy Institute. But men, like Marcos, are more likely to be single and without a family support system. Because they often work as manual laborers, they’re more likely to be disabled from on the job injuries, Capps said, a number that’s likely to increase in the coming years. “They’re going to age faster and become disabled at higher rates,” Capps said. “It’s going to make for a much tougher old age.” There’s no one easy solution to helping older residents who live in the United States illegally, health and immigration experts say. “The policy solution for illegals is to enforce the law and encourage them to return home, thereby avoiding the problem,” said Steven Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative think tank that favors limiting immigration. “If someone wants to sponsor an elderly parent, making sure the sponsor has insurance for them before they come would solve much of the problem.” Joe Caldwell, director of long-term services and supports policy at the National Council on Aging, an advocacy group, said community health centers could possibly provide acute care to undocumented seniors. And federal immigration legislation that provides a pathway to citizenship would put seniors in line to receive Medicare and Medicaid, he said. Such legislation is unlikely any time soon. Outside the Home Depot, Marcos and his friends gather in the cold sunshine, talking animatedly. He’s been paying taxes for years, Marcos said, and he’s got pages of documents to prove it. He’d love to become documented, “but that’s practically impossible,” he said. A year ago, Marcos said, he had tightness in his chest. Could’ve been a pulled muscle, could’ve been a heart attack. He’s vague about the details. Without health insurance, he said, he had no choice but to go to the ER, but he hasn’t followed up since then. He’d rather stalk the parking lot here, looking for work. “No work,” Marcos said, “no money.” Stateline home page Sign up for exclusive state policy reporting and research By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Alyssa Milano Demands Trump Be Held Accountable For Sexual Assault Accusations",
    "text": "Alyssa Milano is coming for President Donald Trump amid the #MeToo movement. The actress and activist wrote a powerful essay published in Rolling Stone on Thursday discussing how the #MeToo movement has affected her and why she decided to join the recent Time’s Up initiative. Milano wrote that the powerful movement ― which took the internet by storm for nearly three months ― has deeply impacted her. “Every fiber of who I am on a cellular level has been changed since I sent that tweet. It would be impossible not to be affected or impacted by the stories that people have shared with me,” she wrote. “It is powerful when a woman uses her voice. But to hear it over the last three months and have it be such a sadly common phenomenon has changed me.” Milano sparked the #MeToo movement in October when she asked her Twitter followers to share their stories of sexual harassment and assault. The movement was originally created by youth organizer Tarana Burke in 2007. “Our daily vernacular of the #MeToo movement is right there in front of us every day leading our country.” In the wake of the #MeToo movement, Milano added that the president needs to answer for the multiple sexual misconduct allegations that have been made against him. “We must hold Trump accountable. If we’re asking senators to resign because of sexual misconduct, what message does it send that we are allowing a man who has had 19 women come forward and accuse him of misconduct, to be our president?” Milano wrote. “How are we not holding him accountable for this? ... Our daily vernacular of the #MeToo movement is right there in front of us every day leading our country. How do these criminal abuses of power not apply to him?” Trump has been publicly accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape, by 21 women. The president has repeatedly denied all of the allegations, most recently tweeting that women he didn’t know were making “false accusations” and calling those allegations “fake news.” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested in October that all of the president’s accusers were lying.

    "title": "Missing Daughters Of Slain Texas Woman Found Safe (UPDATE)",
    "text": "UPDATE: Jan. 4 ― The two missing daughters of a woman who was found dead in her Texas home over the weekend were found safe on Wednesday in Trinidad, Colorado. Allen Banks, police department chief in the Texas city of Round Rock, reported on Twitter Wednesday that suspect Terry Allen Miles had been apprehended in Colorado. Lilianais Griffith, 14, and Luluvioletta Bandera-Magret, 7, the daughters of Tonya Bates, were found safe. Banks said in a press conference Wednesday that Colorado’s Las Animas County Sheriff’s Office had received word that the girls were in the area. Authorities located the suspect’s vehicle and began to follow it, then noticed the suspect began to drive erratically. Banks told reporters that once backup arrived, the police initiated a “high-risk traffic stop” and Miles was taken into custody “without incident.” “The two girls were located inside the vehicle. They both were unharmed and safe at that time,” Banks said at the press conference. “The girls will be transported to the hospital and checked medically.” Banks said two Round Rock detectives would fly to the Trinidad area on Thursday morning to conduct interviews. Child Protective Services in both states will coordinate to return the girls home. “Obviously we still have a lot of work to do in regards to this case, we still have a lot of questions to be answered,” Banks said. “Hopefully we will have those questions answered. PREVIOUSLY: An Amber Alert was issued on Sunday for the two missing daughters of a woman who was found dead in her Texas home over the weekend. Round Rock police officers conducting a welfare check at a residence on the 2600 block of Leslie Court found the body of Tonya Bates, 44, on Sunday. Cause of death was not released. Police are now searching for her daughters: Lilianais Victoria Cake Griffith, 14, and Luluvioletta Mariposo Bandera-Magret, 7. The girls were last seen on Saturday and police believe they are in grave or immediate danger. Lili is Hispanic, 5 feet tall, weighs 100 pounds, has brown eyes, a right nose stud and braces. Lulu is Hispanic, 4-feet 5, weighs 75 pounds, and has curly brown hair and brown eyes. Police are also searching for Terry Allen Miles, 44, who’s considered a person of interest in the suspicious death of Bates, Round Rock Police Chief Allen Banks said at a press conference. He is white, 6-feet 2, weighs 200 pounds, has hazel eyes, wears glasses and has a beard. Although Miles was living in Bates’ home as a roommate, the two were not involved romantically, Banks said. “We believe that the two daughters are in the presence of Terry Allen Miles,” said Banks. “Our concern and our focus is bringing the two girls home safe. We ask for the public’s help in locating the two young girls.” Miles has a long criminal history in Louisiana, including previous arrests for suspected domestic abuse, KPLC reported.

    "text": "America Ferrera has yet to reveal any possible names for her future child, but there’s at least one that’s already out of the running. The “Superstore” actress stopped by the “The Late Show” on Wednesday, just days after she and husband Ryan Piers Williams announced on New Year’s Eve that they were expecting their first child. During the interview, host Stephen Colbert asked Ferrera whether she’d consider naming her baby “after a land mass or an idea” like she was. “I’m going to go with no,” Ferrera said in response. “I love my name now, but growing up with the name America is not easy. I don’t want to put that on my child because I know what that feels like, so I’m going to go with something that is more a name.” Colbert also asked the actress about the recent reunion of “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” cast, showing the audience the photo Ferrera posted on Tuesday of Alexis Bledel, Blake Lively and Amber Tamblyn touching the star’s pregnant belly on a couch. A post shared by America Ferrera (@americaferrera) on Jan 2, 2018 at 2:31pm PST The host had just one question about the famed jeans, which Ferrara said that Lively was wearing in the photo: “Would the traveling pants fit you through all nine months of your pregnancy?” “Do you know what magic means, Stephen?” Ferrera answered. “Yes, they’re magic, they would fit me all times.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "American The U.S. Holds 'Incommunicado' Wants ACLU To Challenge His Detention",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ―An American being held by the U.S. government overseas for his alleged involvement with the so-called Islamic State wants the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge his detention. The unnamed man has been held “incommunicado” for four months in Iraq, according to the judge who ordered the U.S. government allow the man to speak with ACLU attorneys last month. Now, the civil liberties group is pushing to represent the man they say has been illegally detained. The ACLU said in a court filing on Friday that its attorneys were able to speak with “John Doe” via a video conference on Jan. 3. “John Doe informed counsel for the [American Civil Liberties Union Foundation] that: (1) he wishes to continue this habeas corpus action; and (2) he wishes for the ACLUF to represent him in this action,” attorneys wrote. “The Trump administration illegally denied an American his rights to access a lawyer and a court for nearly four months, but those efforts have finally failed,” ACLU attorney Jonathan Hafetz said in a press release. “Now that our client has secured the judicial review that the government attempted to block, he looks forward to establishing the illegality of his detention.” The man, who still doesn’t wish to be identified, reportedly surrendered to the Syrian militia back in September and was handed over to the U.S. military. After the ACLU filed suit on his behalf, the Trump administration tried to argue that the ACLU couldn’t challenge his detention. The government’s arguments were met with heavy skepticism from U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan. The judge said she was not sure it was “conscionable” to allow the U.S. government to continue holding an American, essentially “incommunicado,” without allowing him to challenge his prolonged detention. Last month, she ordered the government to allow the man to speak with the ACLU. The detention of the unnamed man, who is being held in Iraq, was first reported by The Daily Beast back in September. The Daily Beast noted the video conference interview took place on the man’s 114th day of detention.

    "title": "U.S. Politicians Can Afford To Grow A Spine On Saudi Arabia",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― On the morning of Sept. 10, 2016, aircraft bombed a remote area in western Yemen where workers were drilling a well for a nearby village. After the first strike, villagers came to remove bodies and see the damage. The planes returned and bombed the rescuers. All told, the assault eventually killed more than 20 people, including three children. Two months later, Human Rights Watch investigators visiting the site found two bomb fragments that showed the explosives were made in the United States. Congress had its best chance to prevent a further shipment of bombs likely to be used in Yemen this past June, when senators proposed a resolution to block a $500 million sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are bombing Yemen along with the United Arab Emirates, another U.S. ally, which in May 2015 bought 600 of the kind of bombs used in the September attack. The resolution failed. Five Democrats voted against the measure and expected Republican support for it never materialized. The final tally was 47-53, with Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) endorsing President Donald Trump’s decision to let the Saudis buy the munitons. Despite incessant criticism of the U.S. role in the Yemen war, a change in Washington policy sometimes seems impossible. But it doesn’t have to be. The sheer horror of the Saudi-UAE intervention, which has killed thousands of civilians with its airstrikes and left millions more diseased and hungry because of assaults on infrastructure and shipping routes, has galvanized politicians and rights groups across Western countries that count as those Arab governments’ most important foreign friends. The U.S. could play catch up. In Britain, the resurgent Labour opposition party in its 2017 manifesto said that if elected lead the nation’s government, it would block huge British weapons shipments connected to the Yemen war until the United Nations conducts a full inquiry into the coalition’s behavior. Labour’s popular leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is a former anti-war activist; now he’s got the rest of the party onboard and is speaking about its new position regularly. In Sweden, one of Europe’s top weapons producers, the parliament will soon debate making a foreign government’s record on democracy and human rights a key consideration in any negotiations for armaments. Supported by major parties on the left and right, the new policy is expected to pass ― and to have a particular effect on the UAE if correctly implemented. And stateside, activists and some lawmakers are challenging old assumptions about U.S. politics and foreign policy. Yes, politicians from Republican-leaning states can afford to defy the military-industrial complex. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) did so by voting in June to block the arms sale, joining lawmakers from purple states that went for Trump in 2016 like Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), as well as hawkish Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Republican Sens. Todd Young (Ind.) and Dean Heller (Nev.). No, American arms deals are not guaranteed jobs programs. Research shows that the taxpayer dollars sustaining the defense industry could create more and better-paying jobs if invested in other sectors. And there’s increasing awareness about “offsets” ― promises of investment in foreign countries that U.S. defense companies make in many arms deals, essentially funding jobs and advances in technical expertise abroad. In 2018, Democrats and interested Republicans have the energy, the contemporary examples and the constitutional ability to reshape an American system that supplies more than 30 percent of global arms exports — particularly by focusing on Yemen, where the U.N. says the ongoing conflict could result in the worst famine in many years and which national security experts see as a gift to al Qaeda and the self-described Islamic State. Can U.S. politicians seize their moment? When Sweden’s new “democracy clause” on arms exports goes into effect in the spring of 2018, it will be the culmination of a long debate in a country that built a major domestic arms industry during the Cold War because it did not want to rely for its defense on either the U.S. or the now defunct Soviet Union. Lawmakers first seriously considered the idea in 2003, said Lucie Béraud-Sudreau, a defense economics researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Parliament and rights groups focused on it more intensively after 2011, when the Saudi and UAE governments ― then top customers for Swedish equipment ― violently suppressed Arab Spring-related protests in Bahrain. The following year, Sweden’s Sveriges Radio revealed that Swedish officials were secretly negotiating to build an arms factory in Saudi Arabia, eventually prompting the resignation of the defense minister. That scandal and broader concern about how Swedish weaponry was being used was front-page news “for a long time,” Béraud-Sudreau said. In 2012, the Swedish parliament began an inquiry into how best to tighten export controls. The study was published in 2015 ― by which point Yemen was in the news too, helping activists boost public anger and pressure on the government to make a change, according to Béraud-Sudreau. Critics of the existing Swedish export policy ranged across the political spectrum; the right-wing Christian Democrats, the Greens and the Left Party are especially enthusiastic about cutting military supplies to Saudi Arabia. This past October, the government released its “democracy clause” proposal to support from most factions in the legislature. And Béraud-Sudreau said weapons suppliers have had to be muted in their criticism lest they alienate the public. The measure has already won international applause. Stockholm’s argument is that it is a win-win. “The proposal involves a tightening of the rules for arms exports, while at the same time securing the long-term prospects for the Swedish armed forces ― and providing the business sector with predictable export conditions,” Marinette Nyh Radebo, the press secretary at the Ministry of Defense, wrote in an email to HuffPost. In Britain, the parliament has flexed its muscles on the arms issue to less success. Two top committees recommended an immediate halt to U.K. sales to the Saudis in a 2016 joint report, but the Conservative-led government and its allies in Westminster responded that complaints should be considered in court ― where a judge this summer announced on the basis of secret evidence that he would let the exports continue. Activists have pinned their hopes on an appeal, Human Rights Watch researcher Kristine Beckerle told HuffPost, noting that the British press is paying close attention to ongoing accusations that the Saudi-led coalition is committing war crimes in Yemen. Meanwhile, Labour’s striking unity on its weapons sales stand ― and recent electoral success on a platform that included it ― suggests voters and future governments will prioritize the issue. There remains reason to doubt that countries like Sweden and the U.K. ― which are deeply committed to defense sales ― will overnight stop aiding campaigns like those in Yemen. “We are worried that the [democracy] clause is not strict enough,” Agnes Hellström, the president of the Swedish Peace and Arbitration Society, told HuffPost in an email. Her organization and others would prefer a full ban on sales to non-democracies rather than case-by-case assessments of countries’ democratic credentials. Sam Perlo-Freeman, an expert at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and World Peace Foundation, believes loopholes in the new regulation permit Sweden “to sell arms to dictatorships when it really wants to.” Frustration over crises like Yemen does not need to force changes of heart on arms sales, some prominent British critics of the war argue. Andrew Mitchell, a member of Parliament critical of the Saudi-UAE intervention, told HuffPost he opposes the idea of an arms embargo on multiple grounds. “Saudi Arabia is a rich country surrounded by many enemies and therefore they will always be able to purchase the weaponry,” Mitchell said. He argues that the U.K.-Saudi arms trade enables London to pressure the Saudis to follow international agreements on the law of war. He also expresses concern about the domestic economic effect of ending the weapons deals. “I’ve always been a bit neuralgic about Westminster politicians waving their moral conscience at the expense of livelihood and jobs in the northwest of England,” he said. Some governments supplying arms to Saudi Arabia simply avoid high-level accountability. In Canada, for instance, activists charge liberal darling Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with evading tough questions about Canadian support for the Yemen intervention and for Saudi internal repression. Canadian equipment was used in assaults on a persecuted minority community inside the kingdom this past summer, video footage appears to show, and there’s no sign of progress on a promised investigation. “So far as I am aware, they have not briefed anyone on the findings. Instead they have switched from saying they will take action if there is ‘evidence of human rights violations’ to ‘evidence of serious human rights violations,’” said Peggy Mason, a former top Canadian diplomat and president of the Rideau Institute think tank. She also said she believes Canadian regulation of arms sales is too weak because it does not require consultation from third-party groups or parliamentary approval, resulting in a huge majority of requests being granted. Foreign inspiration has yet to strike U.S lawmakers. Even progressives who might be expected to lead the charge against arms deals that might shame or threaten the U.S. for the sake of the Democratic Party’s credibility on foreign policy or their electoral prospects, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have yet to call for a full end to arms shipments that might be used in Yemen ― though both did vote against the bomb sale in June. Warren cited the crisis in a recent hearing and wants to use American leverage to prompt a ceasefire, an aide told HuffPost. And Sanders has excoriated American support for the Saudi-led coalition, comparing it to Russian and Iranian support for brutal Syrian President Bashar Assad in his main foreign policy speech of the year. But aides to both senators declined to specify whether they want the U.S. to just stop selling the bombs prolonging the war in Yemen. Speaking to HuffPost after the failed June resolution that he co-sponsored, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said it was a challenge to unite Democrats ― even with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on his side. “I was definitely disappointed. But the issue of arms sales is not a foundational issue for the Democratic Party, so it’s not like it naturally unites us. I had to work for every single one of those votes,” Murphy said. That was clear to activists who lobbied senators to oppose the sale, two told HuffPost on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. One said none of the five Democratic senators who eventually voted with Trump and Saudi Arabia even accepted requests for meetings with their group. This source said at least some of these senators likely wanted to show voters they are independent of Schumer and the Democratic Party line. The second source who did have contact with some of the offices of the five Democrats said familiar concerns were raised about supporting the resolution: Wouldn’t the Saudis simply buy weapons elsewhere? What about the reaction of the defense industry? And wouldn’t the Senate look weak on Iran, which has supported the Saudi-UAE coalition’s rivals in Yemen? Warner, one of the five, told HuffPost after the vote that “I have concerns about some of the Saudis’ actions in Yemen, but I felt in terms of the precision-guided armaments, that might improve their actions.” He added that his “patience” with the crisis in Yemen “is wearing thin.” McCaskill was more enthusiastic about her vote, saying through a spokeswoman that the deal would help an important partner threatened by Iran. Aides to Manchin, Nelson and Donnelly did not respond to requests for comment. For the Saudis, the closeness of the June vote and increasing congressional complaints about the Yemen situation meant it was time to remind lawmakers of certain basics. “The kingdom is committed to prevent any gap in its defense requirements, therefore if one source of weapons is blocked it will seek other suppliers,” Prince Khalid bin Salman, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., told HuffPost in a recent email. He noted that the kingdom seeks weapons in responses to threats it shares with partners like the U.S., and that Saudi aircraft bought in the West contributed significantly to the U.S.-led air campaign against ISIS. For all that, efforts continue to have Congress grapple with the arms sale issue. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who successfully pushed for a recent House resolution acknowledging the U.S. role in Yemen’s suffering, said he is working on legislation to stop sales to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain ― another coalition partner ― until the nations ease restrictions on aid and trade to help Yemenis. “I think there is a great concern in Congress, even from those people who care about a relationship with Saudi Arabia strategically,” Khanna told HuffPost. He believes he can rally Republican support for his effort, noting that even Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.), the pro-Saudi chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently indicated Congress should help pressure the Saudis. Lawmakers and officials could also try to better enforce current export controls on American-made weapons, experts say. The U.S. has rules intended to prevent uses of its weapons that would violate international humanitarian law, but there’s no guarantee officials will make realistic and accurate judgments about the risk of misuse, according to Daniel Mahanty, a former State Department official now with the Center for Civilians in Conflict. For all the worry about the influence of the weapons lobby in Congress, there’s a different kind of vested interest that might be even more important in U.S. approvals of arms sales, Mahanty said. In both of the two processes by which American arms are sold abroad ― the foreign military sales and commercial military sales frameworks ― U.S. personnel at embassies are deeply involved in vetting the foreigners receiving the weapons. “Overwhelmingly, the interest is to advance sales, not to restrict sales,” he said. Officials with that kind of thinking cite two reasons for it: the importance of helping U.S. industry and the so-called “partnership dividend” that accrues from these kinds of deals with other countries. Mahanty was involved in Obama administration conversations about cutting bomb sales to Saudi Arabia over Yemen as reports came in of strikes on civilian targets. A major challenge was investigating those claims and monitoring the use of weapons after they’re shipped, because it’s unlikely American officials can secure all the relevant information ― including access to sensitive decision-making processes by governments like Saudi Arabia. He said it would be wiser to more deeply consider countries’ past behavior and records before approving export licenses. In January, he plans to release a report co-authored with researcher Annie Shiel explaining how that and a number of other steps ― like more congressional oversight ― could mean fewer U.S.-made bombs kill foreign civilians. Mahanty and others also are challenging the main narrative about weapons deals. The U.S. has no real need to worry about dominating the global arms trade, given how far it outstrips its closest competitor, Russia, and other governments’ desire to be interoperable with the American military, he said. “I don’t have a problem saying we’re going to forego a fraction of total arms sales if we’re not going to find a piece of a U.S. precision-guided munition in a Yemeni hospital,” Mahanty said. “I think the dividend from giving up that percentage point pays itself back it in spades in that the U.S. can say its exercising some self-restraint.” Bill Hartung, a researcher at the Center for International Policy, said he plans to continue his work that disputes the claim of arms deals bringing jobs. “The bottom line is that the jobs issue is far less important than Trump, the Pentagon, or the arms manufacturers would have us believe,” he wrote in a recent email. The activism continues, and its advocates say it is already delivering. Khanna noted that U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres recently took time to speak with him about efforts to draw attention to Yemen in Congress, and that Trump himself has begun criticizing the humanitarian effects of the Saudi-UAE campaign. This and other signs “show that Congress can assert its role on foreign policy,” Khanna said. “Imagine if Congress were to awaken from its stupor and actually engage in foreign policy pronouncements and deliberation on every place around the world.”",

    "title": "Mother Of Innocent Man Killed By Police In 'Swatting' Hoax Wants Officer Charged",
    "text": "The family of an unarmed man killed last week by Wichita, Kansas, police after a fake 911 call led them to his location wants the officer who fired the fatal shot to be criminally charged, the family’s attorney told HuffPost Wednesday. Andrew Finch, 28, was killed Thursday evening in a suspected “swatting” hoax, a dangerous prank associated with online video games like “Call of Duty” where someone tries to draw large numbers of police officers to an address by telling emergency responders a made-up story. None of the Wichita officers involved were SWAT members, Police Chief Gordon Ramsay told The Wichita Eagle. “Our perspective is there needs to be a thorough investigation into the unjustified shooting of Andy Finch,” said Chicago civil rights attorney Andrew M. Stroth, who is representing the family. “When the family thinks of justice, they think the officer should be held accountable for his actions that evening,” he continued, adding that the Wichita Police Department and the city of Wichita are also “liable” for the death. A 25-year-old Los Angeles man, Tyler Barriss, was arrested Friday on suspicion of making the call, which involved a fake hostage situation. Barriss appeared in a Los Angeles court Wednesday to say he would not fight efforts to extradite him to Kansas, where a case against him was presented to the Sedgwick County District Attorney’s Office on Tuesday. Lisa Finch, Andrew’s mother, wrote a letter Tuesday to local government officials including Ramsay and pleaded to see her son’s body, which had not been released, The Associated Press reported. Stroth confirmed the Finch family has still been unable to retrieve Andrew Finch’s body. In her letter, Lisa Finch said the city of Wichita was “compounding our grief and sorrow” by holding the body of her son, whom she wanted to give a “proper funeral service and burial.” “Please let me see my son’s lifeless body,” she continued. “I want to hold him and say goodbye. Please immediately return his body to us.” Finch also demanded to know when police would return items taken from the family’s home for investigation, including the front door, a computer, two cellphones and a video game. She previously called for authorities to hold the officer accountable directly after her son’s death, telling The Wichita Eagle, “That cop murdered my son over a false report.” A representative for the Wichita Police Department told HuffPost he was unaware of the letter. The incident is believed to have stemmed from an argument between two “Call of Duty” players on Twitter that escalated when one player gave the other an address that wasn’t his own. Finch, however, was not part of the argument. His family said he doesn’t play video games. A 911 call played for reporters detailed a made-up situation in which someone had an argument with his mother, shot his father in the head, and was holding his mother and two siblings hostage as he considered setting the house on fire. When police responded, Andrew Finch answered the door. Officers ordered him to raise his hands in the air, Wichita Deputy Police Chief Troy Livingston said at a news conference last week, but Finch kept lowering them to his waist. An officer fired at him when he moved his hands upward, as directed, but more quickly than expected. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "FBI No. 2 Targeted By Trump Had No Conflict In Clinton Probe, Documents Show",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, a frequent target of President Donald Trump’s Twitter tirades, did not have any role in the Hillary Clinton email investigation while his wife was running for Virginia state senator, according to documents disclosed Friday. Trump and congressional Republicans have alleged that the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state was tainted because the campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe received nearly half a million dollars from a political action committee tied to Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close ally of the Clintons. The FBI documents made public Friday show that McCabe had no oversight of the Clinton email investigation when it began in July 2015. At that time, McCabe was in the FBI’s Washington Field Office and the Clinton inquiry was being run out of FBI headquarters. His wife lost her election in November 2015. McCabe didn’t begin overseeing the Clinton investigation until months later, when he became deputy FBI director in February 2016. The newly disclosed records indicate an effort to do things by the book. An April 2015 memo indicated that McCabe “consulted with individuals within [the Washington Field Office] and FBIHQ to identify limitations on his participation in her campaign and to identify areas where Dr. McCabe’s campaign may present potential conflicts of interest” for [McCabe] in the field office investigations or operations before his wife’s candidacy was publicly announced. Out of an “abundance of caution,” McCabe was excluded from “all public corruption investigations arising out of or otherwise connected to the Commonwealth of Virginia,” according to the documents. The documents were posted Friday on the FBI’s Vault website, which publishes high-profile records released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. As USA Today noted, the documents support what the FBI has long publicly asserted about McCabe’s role in the Clinton investigation. McCabe served as acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey, and he contradicted the White House claim that Comey had lost the faith of the FBI’s rank-and-file. McCabe told members of Congress in May that Comey “enjoyed broad support within the FBI, and still does to this day.” Trump interviewed McCabe for the position of FBI director after he fired Comey, but he has lashed out against the deputy director in recent months as he has pushed back on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s alleged collusion with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election. Trump continued going after McCabe after reports emerged that the deputy director planned to retire in the coming months once he fully qualifies for pension benefits. Read the memos below.

    "title": "'Hamilton' Doesn't Define Anthony Ramos, King Of The Side Hustle",
    "text": "NEW YORK ― People tend to assume that the original stars of “Hamilton” walked away from the groundbreaking musical with a hefty paycheck. After all, the average ticket price for their acclaimed show eventually hit well above $1,000. And everyone from President Barack Obama to Beyoncé and Meryl Streep attended performances, beginning all the way back in 2015. It was, and still is, a phenomenon of a theater production. In actuality, actor Anthony Ramos ― who originated the roles of statesman John Laurens and Hamilton’s eldest son, Philip, in the Tony Award–winning show ― said he and his co-stars made just enough money to cover their rent, bills and daily expenses. “On Broadway, we had to negotiate with our producers to share some [earnings]. That was an ongoing process, but everybody came to an agreement,” he told HuffPost. “But we didn’t ... the show didn’t financially make any of us rich. It provided for us and helped open doors to create other opportunities that helped us make money. But the show itself didn’t necessarily change my life or most people’s lives in the cast [financially]. The checks we get after that long negotiation for profit share have helped us after.” Ramos didn’t divulge exact salaries. The typical minimum salary for a Broadway star, he said, is around $1,800 a week, though people can reportedly negotiate up to $10,000 or even $20,000. Off-Broadway rates are anywhere between $300 and $1,000 a week, depending on the number of seats in a theater. Like in any other industry, Ramos believes success in the theater world hinges on an ability to fight for what you feel you deserve. “People don’t take into consideration that you won’t be in the show forever. You’re doing it eight times a week. You don’t get paid when you get hurt. You have to earn every single dollar,” he said. “Plus, when you leave the show, you don’t get any of that money. That’s it. You pay out your agent, your manager ― 10 percent, depending on what you’re doing. After paying taxes, and after it all adds up, you’re making good money, but you’re making just enough to live in New York City.” At the end of the day, Ramos said he can only hope that the projects he takes on now create “an opportunity to do something better that will hopefully pay you more and also be just as creatively fulfilling or more creatively fulfilling than the last thing. A lot of the times that doesn’t happen. It can take people years to get another great job. This entertainment game is a gamble.” I met Ramos at Primrose Cafe in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn late last year, not long after his new show, the Spike Lee–directed series “She’s Gotta Have It,” hit Netflix. In it, he plays the lovable Mars Blackmon, easily the fan favorite among the suitors for the series’ protagonist, Nola Darling. The role is one of several “great jobs” Ramos has taken on since he strolled off the stage of “Hamilton.” Ramos was chatting with Kate Fenneman Stokes when I arrived ― the woman, I would later learn, who helped secure him a college scholarship just a few years ago. “I had applied to schools, but my applications had gotten withdrawn,” he told me as he sipped a water at our corner table, “because we had some issues at home and we couldn’t fax or get the applications in in time.” Back then, Ramos was an 18-year-old baseball player living with his two siblings and single mother in one of Brooklyn’s housing projects. As a member of a low-income family, Ramos never saw college as a practical possibility, but the theater director at his high school, Sara Steinwess, encouraged the naturally talented Ramos to try out for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) in Manhattan anyway. She guided him through the audition process, helped him with his essays and paid for the application for the Seinfeld Scholarship Program, which Fenneman Stokes was overseeing at that time. “If there was any time in my life to be honest with someone, it was then,” Ramos said of his first meeting with Fenneman Stokes. “I just told her everything: I grew up in the projects, my dad was on drugs, my family’s got a history of alcohol and drug problems. No pun intended, but I was like, all I need is one shot. I just need somebody to give me a shot. The next thing you know, she’s crying, I’m crying, and a few days after that AMDA is calling me.” Despite his poor grades at the time, Fenneman Stokes gave Ramos the scholarship, which funded his tuition, fees, and room and board for four years. “Anthony was so special, it’s hard to explain,” Fenneman Stokes told me over email. “He had a deep passion and love for performing, and he just needed someone to support him. It’s hard to meet Anthony and not want to be that person.” Once at AMDA, Ramos said he worked harder than he’d ever worked before. “Always hustling,” as he described it. In between spending hours upon hours in rehearsal spaces, Ramos was “cleaning toilets, mopping, vacuuming, anything to make money.” He even worked in Victoria’s Secret part-time on top of his gig as one of the academy’s orientation leaders, in the midst of trying out for, and finally landing, a position in the school’s dance workshop. “Mars is kind of the voice of people from New York. All the side hustles, that was my real life. Spike made the character half-black, half-Puerto Rican. He sort of wrote the character with me in mind and developed it.” After putting his best foot forward, he graduated from a two-year program, got an agent and started going on any open call he could find, whether it was in New York or Ohio. The first role he booked was Paul San Marco in “A Chorus Line” at a summer stock theatre in New Bedford, Massachusetts. His audition was so memorable, in fact, that the producer offered him the part right then and there. He accepted, then turned down the role a few days later. “You got to be there all summer for $250 a week and I had just gotten agents at the time and they were like, ‘We don’t think you should do this job,’” Ramos explained. “I’m super green. I didn’t really know anything about the business or whatever. So I was like, ‘All right, my agent said I can’t really do this job,’ and the producer at that theater was super mad at me. Calling me, yelling at me, like, ‘You can’t say yes to a job and then back out!’” That was the first of many valuable lessons Ramos learned about the life of a flailing actor. Two or three months later, his agents dropped him. “You got to tell your agents when you’re going to Canada. You can’t just go to Canada,” he smirked. Ramos was cast in a few low-paying “hanky” shows before he joined a regional production of Miranda’s “In the Heights” at the Pioneer Theater Company in Salt Lake City in 2012. He went on to appear in Radio City’s Christmas Spectacular in New York City and book a job as a singer on a cruise ship. The latter gig had him preoccupied for nearly 10 months. “It was summer camp,” he said of the overseas adventure. “I was 21. I was in Europe for six months. It was wild.” When he finally returned to NYC, and another job with the Radio City Spring Spectacular fell through, Ramos was eager for any new opportunity. “I went to audition at [talent agency] Telsey for a show that was at a signature theater,” Ramos explained. “In an email, after I finish that open call, the casting director’s like, ‘We’re about to call you in for this thing called “Hamilton’s Mixtape.”’ And I was like, ‘“Hamilton’s Mixtape”? OK, cool, yeah, sure.’” Ramos auditioned for musical supervisor Alex Lacamoire and director Tommy Kail. Clearly, it turned out well. “They gave me the part that I eventually originated on Broadway,” Ramos said. “We did the four-week lab and then we had six months off. I worked at a bakery and a preschool. I shot my first super low-budget indie film in that time, too. Then, we were off-Broadway for six months, had a month off, and then we went on Broadway.” All in all, Ramos played his dual roles at the Richard Rodgers Theatre for 17 months before taking his final bow on Nov. 20, 2016. I told y'all @Anthony_Ramos1 would be a star. Now he goes to conquer the next world. pic.twitter.com/r8Ryu6yB6A Ramos was still acting in “Hamilton” when Spike Lee ― who apparently saw the Lin-Manuel Miranda creation seven times ― approached him about “She’s Gotta Have It.” “Spike came to the Public Theater [where the production ran off-Broadway] and after the show, he stands up, in the second row, and is just clapping really aggressively and pointing and clapping and pointing,” Ramos described. “And my boy Chris Jackson, next to me, whispered through the side of his mouth, ‘He ain’t pointing at me!’” Lee greeted Ramos backstage that night and called him a month or so later to set up a meeting. Ramos went to his office and they got to know one another. (“It’s a slow burn with Spike, he’s really got to be sure,” Ramos said.) The two kept in frequent contact over the next few weeks until Lee made a proposal Ramos couldn’t refuse. “We sat down again, he gave me a copy of the script for ’She’s Gotta Have It’ and he told me he was thinking about me for Mars Blackmon.” Mars is the role Lee himself played in the original 1986 film, so Ramos, appropriately, freaked out. Fueled by nervous excitement, he began working with Lee on his tape for Netflix, who was backing the series. “This all happened over the course of like six to eight months,” he said. ”[I was] still in ‘Hamilton,’ super on the low, wasn’t talking to anyone about it until it was real.” Well, it got real. Ramos booked the role. Sadly, he said, he couldn’t devote himself to both a high-profile musical and a highly anticipated TV show. “I think my zeal for [‘Hamilton’] and my heart for the show wasn’t as full as I’d like it be or how I wanted it to be,” he said. “My bank account was thanking me, but my heart was like, ‘Yo, my man, what are you doing?’ Creatively, I wouldn’t be my best in both places.” He decided to focus 100 percent on the Netflix series, which follows one woman (DeWanda Wise) and her varied relationships with three lovers. As a guy from Brooklyn, playing a character from Brooklyn, representing the people of Brooklyn, Ramos was stoked. “Mars is kind of the voice of people from New York,” Ramos said. “All the side hustles, that was my real life. Spike made the character half-black, half-Puerto Rican. He sort of wrote the character with me in mind and developed it.” “He didn’t tell me that until after we started filming,” Ramos added. The 26-year-old, who also recently had a cameo in “Will & Grace” and is set to appear in big-budget films like “A Star Is Born” and “Godzilla: King of Monsters,” is just happy to be working on stories that say something, particularly “She’s Gotta Have It.” “There’s a lot of content out there that, unfortunately, I don’t feel is saying a lot,” he said. “This show talks about issues that are going on in New York and all over the world: sexual harassment, verbal abuse, physical abuse, gentrification, the one percent, the tax break, all sorts of things. It speaks for a lot of people who feel like they can’t speak up or don’t know what to say or don’t know how to express what they’re feeling or can’t quite define what they’re feeling. I’m proud to be a part of a piece of art that’s not only doing that but also giving people the courage to step out a little more and educate themselves on music, culture and political issues.” Ramos himself is attempting to say something in his own art. He’s gearing up to release an EP of songs he wrote directly following the 2016 election. The “vibe” he was sensing from people around him inspired tracks including “Freedom” and “Common Ground,” which touch on graver topics like immigration. Sitting with me in the cafe, Ramos spoke his lyrics: “I was told that a life has no price, you see / but the hate in your eyes put a price on me.” He’ll drop the record on the one-year anniversary of President Trump’s inauguration later this month. “You can’t just think that things will get better — it takes work,” he said. “Hard things bring great humility and we need humility in this country. I’m grateful that we’re having hard conversations and dealing with each other. Even if it doesn’t seem like we’re dealing with each other well, we’re dealing with each other. We’re actually hitting things head-on.” This kind of faith has helped the actor progress in both his life and career, and has allowed Ramos to envision himself as something more than just a “Hamilton” star. “It’s tough to get out of that box,” he said, explaining that he must “take the chains off” in his own mind before anyone else can see him in a new light. “My identity doesn’t lie in ‘Hamilton.’ My identity is not in Mars. It doesn’t lie in ‘Godzilla’ or whatever else I’ve been blessed to be a part of. People can label me however they want, but I know who I am at the end of the day and anyone who cares to come on the journey or get to know me will get to know me as an individual, and that’s all I really care about.” Thankfully, Ramos has a great support system, which includes a partner who understands exactly what he’s going through. Jasmine Cephas Jones also starred in the original cast of “Hamilton” as Peggy Schuyler and Maria Reynolds, and Ramos says she’s there for him every step of his post-show journey. “She keeps it real,” he told me. “You have someone who you can bounce off of who’s there constantly or someone who understands your point of view or where you’re coming from or can rebut your point of view. Having someone who is supportive is number one.” As our nearly two-hour conversation came to an end and we got up to leave, Ramos informed me that he’d be heading to Puerto Rico to help out in any way he could after Hurricane Maria devastated his family’s homeland. He’s since returned from that visit, calling the experience “the most overwhelming, inspiring and beautiful thing I think I’ve ever seen.” Alongside Miranda, who’s reprising his role in “Hamilton” for a three-week run on the island, Ramos also took part in the all-star single “Almost Like Praying,” which raised money for relief. He said he’ll “do anything” he can to let Puerto Rico residents know they’re not alone. “The only thing you leave in this world is a legacy,” Ramos said. “Eventually, your money gets spent. Eventually, your house gets sold. So what is your legacy going to be?” This piece has been updated with further comment from Ramos on his “Hamilton” income.",

    "title": "UN Secretary-General Puts World On 'Red Alert' In Somber New Year's Eve Address",
    "text": "United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres issued a grim warning as 2017 drew to a close. In a somber video address posted to Twitter on New Year’s Eve, he cautioned that the globe was on “red alert” following a year marked by deepening conflicts and “new dangers.” “When I took office a year ago, I appealed for 2017 to be a year for peace,” Guterres said in the clip. “Unfortunately, in fundamental ways, the world has gone in reverse. ... Global anxieties over nuclear weapons are the highest since the Cold War, and climate change is moving faster than we are. Inequalities are growing, and we see horrific violations of human rights. Nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise.” Facing such challenges, Guterres said he was “not issuing an appeal” but a “red alert for our world.” Only international unity and cooperation, he stressed, could now help solve these many crises. As we begin 2018, I am issuing a red alert for our world. I call for unity – our future depends on it. pic.twitter.com/fWtTa1irM3 “I truly believe we can make our world more safe and secure. We can settle conflicts, overcome hatred and defend shared values but we can only do that together,” the U.N. chief said. “I urge leaders everywhere to make this New Year’s resolution: Narrow the gaps. Bridge the divides. Rebuild trust by bringing people together around common goals. Unity is the path. Our future depends on it.” Hours after Guterres’ message, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a New Year’s Day speech, in which he spoke of a “nuclear button” on his desk, ready for use if the hermit kingdom is threatened. “The entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons, and a nuclear button is always on my desk. This is reality, not a threat,” he said, adding that he was “open to dialogue” with South Korea and emphasizing that “these weapons will be used only if our security is threatened.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Apple Eyes Fix For Chip Flaw Leaving Consumers Without Secure Web Browsing",
    "text": "FRANKFURT/BENGALURU, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Security issues with Intel Corp microchips are only slowing computers slightly, technology companies said, as researchers played down the need for mass hardware replacements to protect millions of devices from hackers. Google and other security researchers this week disclosed two major chip flaws - one called Meltdown affecting only Intel Corp chips and one called Spectre affecting nearly all computer chips made in the last decade. That raised the prospect of Intel being on the hook for lawsuits claiming that software patches to fix the issue would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware, driving the company’s shares down. But Intel said in a statement after U.S. stock markets closed on Thursday that the performance impact of the recent security updates should not be significant and would be mitigated over time. It said Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Google and Microsoft Corp had all reported little to no performance impact from security patches. “Intel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workload-dependent and, for the average computer user, should not be significant,” it said. The company confirmed that the flaws reported by the researchers could allow hackers to steal information from computers, phones and other devices, but insisted that the issue was not a design flaw. The chipmaker said it would require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix the issue. Microsoft and Google have said they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers. Apple said in a separate statement late on Thursday that its tests showed patches would not significantly affect processing speeds. “Our testing with public benchmarks has shown that the changes in the December 2017 updates resulted in no measurable reduction in the performance of macOS and iOS ... or in common Web browsing benchmarks,” the California-based firm said. CERT, the cyber security project at Carnegie Mellon University sponsored by the U.S. government, on Friday withdrew its recommendation for the replacement of the central processing units (CPUs) of affected systems. In the updated guidance, CERT said “operating system and some application updates mitigate these attacks.” Daniel Gruss, the 31-year-old information security researcher and post-doctoral fellow at Austria’s Graz Technical University who discovered the Meltdown flaw, welcomed Intel’s white paper on the issue. “This looks much more professional now,” Gruss said in comments emailed to Reuters. On the change in recommendation from CERT, Gruss said, however, that there were no replacements yet that could address the flaws in processors that he and other researchers have found. “All CPUs are affected, also very recent ones,” Gruss said. “Furthermore, software updates can fix most of the problems, leaving only a small remaining attack surface.” Browser makers Google, Microsoft Corp and Mozilla Corp’s Firefox confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that the patches they currently have in place do not protect iOS users. With Safari and virtually all other popular browsers not patched, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users may not have secure means of web browsing until Apple issues its patch. Apple said it would release a patch for the Safari web browser on its devices within days. It said that there were no known instances of hackers taking advantage of the flaw to date.

    "text": "Things to look forward to in 2018: midterm elections and new music from Ariana Grande. It’s coming up on two years since the ponytailed pop princess has blessed us with a fresh song, and fans have been patiently waiting for a sign that Grande is back in the studio. On Monday, the singer shared a snippet from what may be a new single. Even though we only hear seconds, it’s already a certified bop. “You can feel it, feel it,” Grande sings in the clip, captioned, “See you next year.” A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Dec 31, 2017 at 8:00pm PST Back in 2016, Grande revealed that her next album was close to completion, but we’ve heard little from the singer regarding new music since. “Oh yeah, and I’m almost done with an album… which is pretty crazy,” Grande said at the time in a Snapchat video. “I didn’t mean to make an album, and I don’t know if it’s done at all, but I just have a bunch of songs that I really like. I’ve just been working and creating and inspired.” Later, she told Billboard she was planning to “take my sweet ass time” after a tumultuous 2017 before dropping another album. Grande’s last album, “Dangerous Woman,” which boasted hits like “Into You” and “Side to Side,” took the singer on an global tour that was marred by a terrorist attack after a concert in Manchester, England, claiming the lives of 22 people.

    "title": "Arie's Season Of 'The Bachelor' Is Off To The Races",
    "text": "A checkered flag, a bumper sticker reading “NICE BUTT,” a girl’s heart racing: Nearly every minute of the season 22 premiere of ABC’s “The Bachelor” included a cunning little reminder that our new old Bachelor, Arie Luyendyk Jr., is a race car driver. (He’s also a realtor, of which we were reminded slightly less often.) Arie is the Bachelor who very much needs an introduction, because when he was last part of the franchise ― on Emily Maynard’s season of “The Bachelorette” in 2012 ― a huge contingent of today’s “Bachelor” audience hadn’t even started watching the show yet. A healthy number of his contestants, like Maquel and Bekah, were still teenagers when he wooed Emily and earned the skin-crawling nickname “The Kissing Bandit.” So, in an incredibly bland premiere, we took another turn around the Arie track, and were reminded that he was in love with Emily, drives race cars, sells property and kisses very photogenically. The women vied for his attention by playing it astonishingly safe: The only risky limo exit was probably Ali’s request that he smell her armpits (in service of a bad pun about “pit stops”). HuffPost’s “Bachelor” podcast, “Here to Make Friends,” recapped night one of Arie’s race toward love on Tuesday. Co-host Claire Fallon and guest Brett Vergara, a community strategist at BuzzFeed, dissected the night in bad racing references, ineffective pickup lines and Laurens (so many Laurens). One of many unsurprising moments: Arie sped to his first kiss of the season, planting one on Brittany T. early the first night ― after a racing competition, no less. Here’s what we thought: Claire Fallon: Brittany T. has a surprise activity for Arie. Brett Vergara: Which is quite the activity. Claire: It’s tiny race cars! Brett: I’m here for tiny race cars. Claire: I know this is not how it happens, but I love the idea of her getting ready for the night and packing up a huge crate with two tiny race cars and tossing it in the trunk. Brett: It’s like, I’ve only got two suitcases, and I’ve gotta make sure I’ve got my racing gear in one. Claire: Use them both on tiny race cars. They bet a kiss, and he basically lets her tie him, as far as I can tell, and then they kiss. Brett: Yeah, first kiss. Claire: Off to the Kissing Bandit races. She says it was amazing.

Claire: It really looked like she was letting a delicious chocolate truffle dissolve on her tongue. Brett: There was so much emotion in that one look.

    "title": "Arkansas Mosque Pays Fines For Man Who Helped Vandalize Its Building",
    "text": "An Arkansas mosque has paid off the remaining court fines of a man who helped vandalize their sacred space ― doing its part to make sure he doesn’t have to serve any more jail time for the crime. Hisham Yasin, social director of the Masjid Al Salam in Fort Smith, told HuffPost on Tuesday that his congregation had forgiven the convicted vandal, Abraham Davis, long ago. Paying the more than $1,700 in fines Davis still owed was a way to put that forgiveness into action. Now, Yasin wants Davis move on with his life. “He needs to keep going, don’t even look back. The back is gone,” Yasin said. “I look forward to seeing him work and study and become something in the future. And at that time, he’ll talk about what happened with him ... how he flipped his life from bad to good.” Davis was one of three men arrested after the mosque was vandalized in October 2016. He drove to the mosque in his mother’s minivan and reportedly stood watch as one of his friends drew swastikas, curses, and the words “Go Home” on the building. Mosque vandalized in Fort Smith https://t.co/CVRCSwX0Tp pic.twitter.com/gxqzmpwVtd Davis has expressed deep regret for the crime, writing the mosque a letter of apology from jail. The mosque leaders decided not to press charges against the men ― not wanting the act to destroy their futures. Still, Davis was convicted of a felony and burdened with about $3,200 in fines. The story gained national attention after Davis and mosque leaders were profiled in a New York Times story in August. Al Salam received letters and pledges of support from their local interfaith community and from across the country. Yasin said one organization, the Jay Pritzker Foundation, gave the mosque a $25,000 donation. The amount took the congregation by surprise ― and re-energized its desire to help Davis. Meanwhile, Davis was worried about paying his fines. And failure to meet the monthly payments could have resulted in more jail time, according to a follow-up story in the Times last week. Part of his debt was reportedly paid off by a Times reader. But the remaining $1,731 was donated by the mosque. Yasin said he brought a cashier’s check for that amount to the Sebastian County Courthouse on Dec. 11. “I was honestly super happy,” Yasin said. “When we start something good, we have to finish it all the way.” In last week’s Times’ story, Davis was described as being dumbstruck by the news that his debt had been paid. “It’s a great weight being lifted off of my shoulders,” Davis told the Times. “And I don’t deserve it, but this act of kindness, it’s just, wow.” For Yasin, reading about Davis’ shock was a confirmation that the congregation’s decision was the right thing to do.

    "title": "Around the World In Tinder Dates",
    "text": "I conquered the world of “internet strangers” with small steps. I knew that meeting up with anyone who didn’t already know some of my close friends, or with whom I wasn’t in the same high school, meant at least “stretching” the rules I was raised by. My whole childhood, my mom had repeatedly told me not to talk to strangers, whether I had met them online or in person. For her, anyone was a potential attacker. And- given that I grew up in Bucharest, Romania, in the 2000s, in a hectic transition from communism to capitalism, where nothing seemed safe or stable enough, her rules made a lot of sense. I even remember taking part in an “Internet Safety” contest in middle school, for which I made a very moralizing (and cliché) video about a little girl talking to a creepy stranger online. A few years after making that video I had been so proud of, however, I ironically ended up talking to (an increasing number of) online strangers myself. Queer Graffiti from my trip to Albania. I obviously didn’t feel very comfortable the first time I went out with someone I had met online, in 10th grade. After realizing I was gay, I had felt the need to meet other gay guys, whether to date them or simply to talk to them about our experiences. I started talking to D. on Facebook, through a (distant) mutual friend. We went out on some kind of date. Now that I think about it, it was probably the worst date of my life, because we were both scared to meet each other and scared by the potentially homophobic people around us, whom we didn’t want thinking we were gay. In a failed attempt to be romantic, I brought him a muffin the second time I saw him- but the second time was also the last time, because he never texted me again. D. thus became the first person I met online- yet it was far from being as scary as my mom warned me it would be. I downloaded Tinder much later, when I moved to the US. It was my freshman year at Harvard, and I hadn’t been single in a long time. I was also just feeling alone, without my family and friends back home, in Bucharest, and I wanted to meet people. I had tons of social anxiety and everything around me seemed overwhelming. Tinder worked for me because I knew that the other people on the app were there for the same purpose as I was- we all wanted to meet other people. And talking to them online before meeting them in person significantly helped reduce my anxiety. I don’t remember being nervous when I started going out, and it soon became a habit to meet someone new once every three or four weeks. To me, at Harvard, everything was new, strange and uncertain. The people I was meeting on Tinder were just a bunch of other strangers that fit into that picture. I enjoyed talking to people: I loved hearing their experiences and sharing my own; beyond that, I was also open to going further with them, if we ended up developing a sexual or romantic connection. But I think my desire to have sex or find a boyfriend were much less prominent than my desire to stop feeling alone. Rainbow crossing in the Netherlands. Starting with my second semester at Harvard, I slowly got used to life in the US- I had already made a few friends and I was already feeling much more comfortable. I also started being more open towards my parents related to the people I was hanging out with and dating. My mom always asked where I met the people I was going out with, and she would never be too happy to hear “I met them on Tinder”. Her response would always be: “be careful not to meet someone dangerous, you don’t know those people”. I would think to myself: if I didn’t meet up with them in person, how could I ever actually get to know them? Her fears, however, decreased with time, and meeting G. off Tinder, with whom I was in a serious relationship for around 6 months, helped a lot with that. It seemed like Tinder had outgrown my expectations, and that the people I would meet there could actually have potential as either friends or boyfriends. During the summer, I started traveling, and had to develop new strategies to face the unknown. I had to face what was left of my fear of meeting strangers in order to, somehow, face the strangeness of the places I would travel to. I first went to Chile, with a summer abroad program offered by my college, and the following year I studied abroad in the Netherlands and in Morocco. Visiting Vietnam, Serbia and Albania followed. Loneliness seemed even more overwhelming during the first few weeks of being in these places than it was at Harvard. Once again, I didn’t know anyone, and thus I would often go on Tinder to find people I could become friends with, or people that could show me around. And it worked. With the help of different “strangers”, the cities I was visiting became much more friendly themselves. In Amsterdam, F. helped me understand EDM for the first time, explaining it sound by sound during a party. In Ho Chi Minh City, D. picked me up with a motorcycle in front of a mall and took me to his unusually white apartment on the 15th floor of a huge apartment building, from where you could see the whole city. In Serbia, I met V., who took me to a huge queer party (probably the best I’ve ever been to) in the historical Kalemegdan fortress, built in 279 BC.

I think the only time I was actually afraid to meet up with a “stranger” was in Morocco, because homosexuality is illegal there. I started talking to A. on Tinder, in Rabat. He seemed to have a “real” profile, and to be a student, just like myself. He was really friendly, and we decided to go watch a horror movie together. I wasn’t particularly nervous, but I became more and more so after talking to some of my friends. My roommate told me (and I’m still not sure if it was a joke or not) that he wanted to say his final goodbyes, because he thought he would never see me again- he seemed convinced that the guy would either be an undercover cop who would arrest me or a homophobe who’d potentially beat me up. I admit- I kept thinking about what my roommate had told me throughout the meeting, but nothing bad actually happened. The movie was fun to watch, and afterwards we went to eat some ice-cream at a nearby McDonald’s, where A. told me about what it’s like to be gay in Morocco, and I told him about my experiences in Romania. A. and I still text sometimes- he moved to France, to continue his studies, and now lives there. I’m not trying to create some kind of catalogue of the people I met off Tinder or Grindr. After telling them a lot of Tinder stories, my parents got used to the idea of “the unknown”, and they understood that not all “strangers” are dangerous. My mom doesn’t panic anymore- she keeps her comments to: “oh, another guy you met off Tinder…”, when I tell her about a new friend or date. I’m also not trying to say that every Tinder or Grindr date I go on is successful. Far from being so, I myself have probably not kept in contact with two thirds of the people I met from these apps. Plus, it’s impossible to be perfectly compatible with everyone, and impossible to keep in touch with tens of people whom you might never see again. Finally, I’m not trying to say it’s safe to meet up with anyone. I know that it can be risky sometimes, but, for me, it has been worth the risk so far. Busy boulevard in Vietnam. The “strangers” I met on Tinder have always been much more friendly, at least in my mind, than the loneliness and the scary unknown of the places I have travelled to. The people I met (and some of them are amazing people who have stayed my friends until today) somehow humanized places that seemed so foreign to me- they helped humanize the extremely busy and humid Ho Chi Minh City and the ubiquitous communist apartment buildings in Albania. I realized I sometimes share many more experiences than I could’ve imagined with people all over the world. From talking about being busy with schoolwork or sharing a passion for horror films, it sometimes felt so easy to create bonds. On top of that, being queer was always something that connected us in a strong way, across many other cultural differences- from talking about how much we enjoy watching Sex and the City to sharing coming out stories. While trying to still be aware of the risks, my mom’s presumption, the one I grew up with, that everyone is a potential attacker slowly changed to a presumption (or at least a desire) to believe that the people I meet have the potential to be my friends. An assumption that we can both learn from our interaction with each other and that, if we dig deep enough, we will always find something in common, a way we can relate to each other even though, apparently, we are complete strangers.

    "title": "Trans Activist Who Called Caitlyn Jenner A 'F**king Fraud' Is Running For Office",
    "text": "A transgender activist who made waves last year for confronting Caitlyn Jenner is running for public office. Following the resignation of California Assemblyman Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, Ashlee Marie Preston announced Dec. 30 that she plans to run for the District 54 seat. If elected, she would represent Century City, Westwood and a number of other Los Angeles neighborhoods. Running is never an option; unless I’m running for California State Assembly District 54...🏆✨💫 #Ashlee4Assembly #ItsTime #Preston2018 pic.twitter.com/4WZ695BuKk “As someone directly impacted by the issues that often diminish the quality of life, I have an acute understanding of which policies must be put into play in order to move progress forward for the constituents of the 54th district and beyond. I believe in prioritizing people over politics,” Preston, who previously served as the editor-in-chief of Wear Your Voice magazine, said in a press release cited by The Advocate. “We are more than poll percentage points; we are real people with real stories.” “I fully intend to continue honoring those experiences, and advocating for those who don’t have a seat at the table,” she added. Preston gained widespread attention after she was seen confronting Jenner at a Trans Chorus of Los Angeles event in August. The activist blasted Jenner, a longtime Republican, for her support of President Donald Trump. “You’re a fucking fraud,” Preston told Jenner at the time. “It’s really fucked up that you continue to support somebody ... that’s erasing our fucking community. And you support it!” A video clip of the confrontation has since been viewed over 520,000 times. In an interview with HuffPost after the incident, Preston said she believed that Jenner “owes the [transgender] community an apology” for backing Trump, who has rescinded federal guidance on protections for trans students against discrimination and attempted to ban trans recruits from the U.S. military. “Caitlyn Jenner is a text book case on cognitive dissonance and her vote against her own supposed interests made that evident,” Preston said. “Her commentary and actions have carried real consequences for the transgender community; people who aren’t afforded the same protections and privilege as she has.” In September, Preston was named one of The Root’s 100 Most Influential African-Americans of 2017. If elected, she has said she plans to address issues of police brutality, trans discrimination and immigration.

    "title": "Asian-American Creatives Are Coming Together On A New Hashtag And It's Damn Beautiful",
    "text": "In the spirit of the new year, Asian-Americans are amplifying one another’s voices. Asian-American actors, writers, filmmakers and other creatives on Twitter have been sharing their various projects using the hashtag #AsAmCreatorRollCall. Comics writer Greg Pak launched the social media campaign last month so that those in the community could support each other in 2018. With Pak’s original post receiving hundreds of retweets, people were clearly eager to honor the work of their fellow Asian-Americans. Asian American creators -- writers, artists, filmmakers, poets, actors, comics people, everybody! What are you working on? Let's all talk it up and support the hell out of each other in 2018! #AsAmCreatorRollCall Writing on his website Dec. 21, Pak recalled an encounter 15 years ago, when he was taking his sci-fi anthology film “Robot Stories” to festivals. “I remember a distributor telling us to our faces that it seemed weird to him that the film had all these Asian people speaking English without accents. I think we just stared at him in astonishment,” Pak wrote. “He didn’t say it in a rude manner; he wasn’t trying to be offensive. He just totally didn’t get it... Even though he [was] literally talking to real live Asian Americans, he didn’t seem to understand that Asian Americans exist or could tell stories that other people could relate to.” But with the help of grassroots Asian-American film festivals, Asian-American cultural groups and other organizations, Pak says they were ultimately able to play the film across the country. It won dozens of awards, and was eventually picked up on DVD. The story serves as proof of the power of community support, he noted. In the past couple of weeks, using Pak’s hashtag, people have been sharing news of their upcoming work. Some big names like blogger Angry Asian Man, writer Melissa Hung and actor Yoshi Sudarso have chimed in with their own additions. Judging from the hashtag, 2018 looks like it’s going to be an incredible year. I have new geeky podcast idea — other than the ones I currently host — that I hope to launch in 2018.

    "title": "Astronaut John Young, Who Walked On The Moon, Dead At 87",
    "text": "(Reuters) ― Veteran U.S. astronaut John Young, who walked on the moon and even smuggled a corned beef sandwich into orbit during one of his six missions in space, died Friday night at age 87 following complications from pneumonia, NASA said on Saturday. Young, a former U.S. Navy test pilot, in 1972 became the ninth of 12 people ever to set foot on the moon. “We’re saddened by the loss of astronaut John Young,” the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said in a statement on Twitter. We remember our most experienced astronaut, John Young. “Today, NASA and the world have lost a pioneer.\" Full statement from our Acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot on the passing of Young: https://t.co/WI6BDpbQ7e pic.twitter.com/WeRxkBGAZB Young became one of the most accomplished astronauts in the history of the U.S. space program. He flew into space twice during NASA’s Gemini program in the mid-1960s, twice on the Apollo lunar missions and twice on space shuttles in the 1980s. He retired in 2004 after 42 years with the U.S. space agency. The Apollo 16 mission in April 1972, his fourth space flight, took Young to the lunar surface. As mission commander, he and crewmate Charles Duke explored the moon’s Descartes Highlands region, gathering 200 pounds (90 kg) of rock and soil samples and driving more than 16 miles (26 km) in the lunar rover to sites such as Spook Crater. Recalling his lunar exploits, Young told the Houston Chronicle in 2004: “One-sixth gravity on the surface of the moon is just delightful. It’s not like being in zero gravity, you know. You can drop a pencil in zero gravity and look for it for three days. In one-sixth gravity, you just look down and there it is.” Young’s first time in space came in 1965 with the Gemini 3 mission that took him and astronaut Gus Grissom into Earth orbit in the first two-man U.S. space jaunt. It was on this mission that Young pulled his sandwich stunt, which did not make NASA brass happy but certainly pleased Grissom, the recipient of the snack. Astronaut Wally Schirra, who was not flying on the mission, bought the corned beef sandwich on rye bread from a delicatessen in Cocoa Beach, Florida, and asked Young to give it to Grissom in space. During the flight, as they discussed the food provided for the mission, Young handed Grissom the sandwich. NASA later rebuked Young for the antics, which generated criticism from lawmakers and the media, but his career did not suffer. His May 1969 Apollo 10 mission served as a “dress rehearsal” for the historic Apollo 11 mission two months later in which Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon. Young and his crew undertook each aspect of that subsequent mission except for an actual moon landing. Young’s fifth space mission was as commander of the inaugural flight of NASA’s first space shuttle, Columbia, in 1981. He became the first person to fly six space missions in 1983, when he commanded Columbia on the first Spacelab trek, with the crew performing more than 70 scientific experiments. He never went to space again. Young had been due to command a 1986 flight that was canceled after the explosion of the shuttle Challenger earlier that year. He ended up as the only person to fly on space shuttle, Apollo and Gemini missions. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Women Fight Back After Assaults At Music Festivals Down Under",
    "text": "Women in Australia and New Zealand are winning praise for fighting back against sexual assault at New Year’s Eve music festivals, with one apprehending her attacker until security arrived and another punching a man who grabbed her breast. Music festivals are popular in Australia and New Zealand around the new year, when warm weather hits the Southern Hemisphere. However, celebrations in recent years have been marred by a string of unsavory incidents, including a reported rape and several incidents of sexual assault and groping at the Falls Festival in Tasmania, among others. As the world prepared to welcome 2018, at least three women reported they were sexually assaulted at Falls Festival, despite efforts to increase awareness by organizers, who run events in four Australian states over the New Year’s period. A 32-year-old man was charged with indecent assault after police said he grabbed a woman’s breast in the festival mosh pit around 9:30 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. “Whilst we would rather have no incidents at all, I can tell you that with that particular one the woman involved, the person involved, and her friend actually apprehended the male and then handed them to security, who then handed them to police to be investigated,” said Tasmania police Senior Sgt. Darren Latham. “So it is encouraging that people are taking positive action, but we would of course wish that this didn’t happen at all.” Police continued investigating other incidents at the festival, including a second report of groping in the mosh pit, and one of an assault in the campgrounds. In New Zealand, a woman at the Rhythm and Vines festival dished out some revenge to a man who grabbed her breast. The incident ― captured on video and posted to Facebook, where it racked up tens of thousands of views and comments ― saw a man approach two young women from behind. He appeared to grab a shirtless woman whose chest was covered with glitter, then quickly turned and ran away. The two women walked angrily toward the man, with the victim landing several hits to his head and her friend pouring her drink on him. Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, the victim ― a 20-year-old woman visiting from America ― said the incident was “shocking”. “I was walking to my campsite and saw this hand come up. He got a handful of my boob. I went over and hit him,” Madeline Anello-Kitzmiller said. “It was quite shocking. I’m used to love and kindness, freedom of expression, equality.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "text": "Former U.S. President Barack Obama has been closing out 2017 by trying to lift Americans’ spirits. Earlier this week, Obama tweeted a list of uplifting news stories to remind Americans about “what went right” in 2017 ― a year that saw political upheaval, natural disasters and some of the worst mass shootings in modern American history. On New Year’s Eve, Obama took a moment to share the best books he read and songs he listened to over the past year. “During my presidency, I started a tradition of sharing my reading lists and playlists. It was a nice way to reflect on the works that resonated with me and lift up authors and artists from around the world,” Obama wrote in a post shared on Facebook. “With some extra time on my hands this year to catch up, I wanted to share the books and music that I enjoyed most.” Take a look at the list below: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "'Moonlight' Director Barry Jenkins Drunkenly Live-Tweets 'Notting Hill'",
    "text": "We’re just a news site, standing in front of an Oscar winner, asking him to live-tweet more rom-coms. “Moonlight” director Barry Jenkins settled in on a Delta Air Lines flight home Wednesday when he realized his seatmate was watching the 1999 romance “Notting Hill.” So, with the help of some trusty Woodford Reserve, he decided to live-tweet the entire film from over her shoulder. In other news, the woman next to me is watching NOTTING HILL. A few choice folks will get the irony of this happening on my last flight of this sojourn. Also... Julia Roberts is STUNNING in this film. And holy shit Lester Freamon is in this?! The lack of audio did present a challenge to Jenkins, who was left with only visual cues to interpret the chance encounter that brings Julia Roberts’ and Hugh Grant’s characters together. Okay so I can’t actually hear the movie, somebody help me, what’s up with Hugh’s character? He just made out with Julia Roberts and I’m like... HUH? Julia just looks waaaaaaaay too much for his character in this! But I can’t hear it so maybe he got game? Like English cat game??? Nevertheless, Jenkins managed to deliver quite incisive commentary, turning the improbable home size of Grant’s character into an indictment of the current economic system. Clearly a period piece BTW: what kind of bookstore owner has a flat like THAT in NOTTING HILL? This one actually isn’t a joke, what we’ve done to our neighborhoods, to property values and the VALUE of certain jobs is so damn sobering, depressing And he managed to nail one of the major “Notting Hill” plot holes. WHY IS THERE A SCENE OF HUGH GRANT SHAVING?! Everybody knows HUGH GRANT DONT SHAVE!!!! That dude ain’t NEVER NOT BEEN CLEAN SHAVEN!!! I doth protest!!! English cat game means HUGH AIN’T TO SHAVE BRUH!!!!! Flag on the play Coach Michell!!! Jenkins’ running commentary attracted the attention of “The Mindy Project” star Mindy Kaling, who was up late feeding her newborn baby. “This man has given us creative treasures in many forms,” Kaling wrote. For the record I am reading Barry Jenkins tweets while feeding my child at 3:30 in the morning. The man has given us creative treasures in many forms https://t.co/LdrLFCWgVv The outpouring of appreciation didn’t stop with Kaling, however. Twitter users showered Jenkins’ thread with praise. Barry Jenkins drunk-tweeting an over-the-shoulder aeroplane watch of Notting Hill is approx 1,000 times more fun than Notting Hill. https://t.co/SRYTqKgoRL Barry Jenkins live-tweeting his silent watch of Notting Hill is: 1. Everything2. Giving me life https://t.co/4nYuWMbUQj IF YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING BARRY JENKINS LIVE-TWEET HIS SEAT MATE WATCHING NOTTING HILL ON A PLANE I TRULY FEEL SAD FOR YOU. https://t.co/wIESlMaTGa Jenkins finished his live-tweeting triumph on a somewhat abashed note. “I hope this isn’t embarsssing [sic] tomorrow...” Jenkins wrote.

    "title": "Bernie Sanders Holds Up New York City Mayor As Model For The Trump Opposition",
    "text": "NEW YORK ― At a ceremony to swear in New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio for his second term, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) held up his hometown as a bastion of progress and a template for what Americans should strive for in the face of the Trump administration’s policies. “We have an administration in Washington which, instead of bringing us together, is trying to divide us up to appeal to our very worst prejudices,” the Brooklyn-born Sanders said Monday afternoon on the front steps of New York City Hall. In the time since Sanders attended the inauguration of President Donald Trump last January, he said, the White House began “eviscerating environmental legislation and making us more dependent on fossil fuel and not less.” The Republican-controlled Congress attempted to “throw 32 million people off of the health care they have.” And the president signed a sweeping tax bill providing “the billionaire class with hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks while raising taxes on millions of working-class families.” “In this city, the largest city in our country, the people of New York under Bill de Blasio have chosen to move government in a very different direction than what we’re seeing in Washington,” Sanders told the crowd. The senator praised the 56-year-old mayor, considered one of the most progressive in the country, for running on a populist platform to increase affordability for working-class families. He especially touted the city’s universal preschool program ― a signature achievement for de Blasio that serves about 70,000 kids. “While many politicians don’t even talk about the crisis of child care, the de Blasio administration has taken a major and important step forward in leading this country toward universal pre-K education,” Sanders said. New York is still plagued by an affordable housing crisis, with rents rising twice as fast as wages. Scott Stringer, the city’s comptroller, and Public Advocate Letitia James ― both of whom were also sworn in for second terms on Monday ― railed against rent hikes in speeches ahead of Sanders and de Blasio. But Sanders commended the efforts of de Blasio’s administration, which went to court last year to defend the city’s decision to bar landlords from raising prices on rent-stabilized apartments. Sanders also highlighted the mental health initiative of New York City’s first lady, Chirlane McCray, as well as de Blasio’s promise to defend the approximately 175,000 so-called Dreamers in the city who were given legal status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that Trump repealed in September. “The issues go on and on again,” Sanders said. “The bottom line is what Mayor de Blasio and his administration understand is that in this country, in the home of Ellis Island, our job is to bring people together with love and compassion and to end the divisions and the attacks that are taking place.” “The people of New York under Bill de Blasio have chosen to move government in a very different direction than what we’re seeing in Washington.” In a short speech capping off his inauguration on Monday, de Blasio thanked Sanders and his wife, Jane, for spearheading a populist campaign that galvanized a long-dormant leftist movement across the country. “These two proud Brooklynites have changed America in a profound way,” de Blasio said. “Bernie and Jane, you have proven that the voices of the people are what matter most, and the political process in this country will never be the same. It will be better, it will be more democratic, because of what these two have done.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

The mayor said last month that meeting Sanders was the highlight of his first term, an example of what the New York Daily News described as an “emerging bromance” between the two men. Yet de Blasio supported former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is also a former New York senator, in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, and campaigned for her in Iowa. Some progressive activists have speculated that Sanders threw his support behind de Blasio to bolster the mayor against centrist Democrats such as Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who is being discussed as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), a loyal Clinton ally with whom de Blasio has long feuded.

    "title": "What The Bernie Sanders Winter Coat Controversy Gets Wrong About Socialism",
    "text": "It’s been 2018 for less than a week, but that’s apparently long enough to gin up a faux scandal about Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ allegedly lavish spending habits. This time Sanders is in trouble for sporting a winter coat at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s swearing-in ceremony on New Year’s Day that a gumshoe reporter at the conservative Daily Wire discovered retails for $690. Mainstream news outlets were quick to jump on the item with their own well-perfected sanctimonious outrage. “Socialist Bernie Sanders wears a $700 jacket while complaining about rich people,” a Newsweek headline blared. Sanders’ supposed hypocrisy is a favorite topic of Newsweek, which used a similar formulation in June to call out Sanders for raking in more than $1 million in 2016, largely thanks to book royalties. Back in August 2016, we were meant to be absolutely furious that Sanders and his wife Jane O’Meara Sanders purchased a $600,000 summer home on Lake Champlain in Vermont. The point of all of the handwringing is to claim that a person with modest wealth effectively has no right to denounce the greedy behavior of America’s wealthiest people or indict the economic and political system that generates vast income and wealth inequality. As it turns out, Sanders received the coat as a gift from his stepson Dave, who used to work for the Vermont-based clothing company Burton, according to Sanders’ staff. But even if he hadn’t, this subgenre of journalism gets progressive politics, let alone Sanders’ brand of democratic socialism, all wrong. When Sanders asks “how many yachts do billionaires need?” he does so in the context of attacking a billionaire-funded GOP political program that would cut taxes for the wealthy even as it deprives millions of Americans of health insurance coverage. It is not so much that Sanders is attacking wealth per se, as he is attacking those who prioritize extravagant wealth above ensuring that all people have access to a decent living standard. “This is sort of in the category of the press looking obsessively at what Hillary Clinton wears and buys,” said Christine Riddiough, a member of the national political committee of the Democratic Socialists of America. “What’s important is not having a debate about that but about why so many people are not getting health care is this country.” More to the point, democratic socialism is an ideology that seeks systemic change and rejects the idea that individual consumer choices can correct a system centered on economic exploitation. In a capitalist economy, the small class of people who finance and own industries pay workers less than the value of their labor and take the “surplus value” ― the value left over ― as profit. No amount of progressive purchasing habits ― whether it’s buying a Toyota Prius or fair-trade coffee ― can change that. “There is no ethical consumption under capitalism,” said Micah Uetricht, associate editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin. “Exploitation is baked into the system.” In fact, Uetricht, a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America, argues that dwelling on individual consumption decisions could serve as a “distraction” from more meaningful forms of political struggle. Riddiough offered a largely similar assessment. She nonetheless included the caveat that if “company X is exploiting child labor, then a concerted consumer boycott might have an impact, but that’s a whole different story.” The society Riddiough, Uetricht and their fellow democratic socialists are fighting for is one in which, as Uetricht puts it, there is broad worker ownership of industries “rather than investment being determined by a small handful of people who are running it for their own enrichment.” “There is this idea that some people seem to have that socialists believe we should all be walking around wearing burlap sacks. That’s not true.” To get there, democratic socialists often spend their time helping workers form unions and low-income tenants fight eviction, as well as electing left-wing politicians, including some Democrats, who they believe move the country closer to their vision. Uetricht and many of his colleagues at Jacobin also believe that social democracy ― a free-market capitalist system with a more robust social welfare state akin to the ones that exist in Scandinavia ― is a necessary waystation on the road to a society where worker-owned industries predominate. But democratic socialists emphasize that the ideal world they envision is not some kind of ascetic space bereft of pleasant material objects. Instead, they merely want to democratize access to those nice things. “There is this idea that some people seem to have that socialists believe we should all be walking around wearing burlap sacks,” Uetricht said. “That’s not true.” “Everyone deserves to be wearing a nice coat like Bernie Sanders,” he added with a chuckle. Although Uetricht is living on student loans as he pursues a masters degree in sociology, he revealed that he too enjoys occasional luxuries. He recently splurged on an “incredibly fresh” pair of $70 red, suede Nike sneakers, and a $180 pair of Timberland boots. In that sense, Sanders’ much-lauded $16 New Year’s eve dinner date in Manhattan is as irrelevant to the struggle against global capitalism as his $700 coat. HuffPost asked Uetricht whether there wasn’t still some level of personal extravagance that would undermine Sanders’ message as a crusader against inequality. Perhaps buying a new Lamborghini (which sells for upwards of $200,000)? “Nobody needs a Lamborghini. If Bernie bought a Lamborghini, I might have to reconsider my support for him,” he said.

    "title": "The Best Mocktails To Order At The Bar",
    "text": "Mocktails. Virgin cocktails. Whatever you want to call them, the terms used for nonalcoholic drinks can feel ... impotent. Or at the very least, they’re embarrassing to shout out loud to a bartender. But some nonalcoholic drinks can actually stand up to the real thing. If you’re participating in Dry January, it’s tough to quit your favorite cocktails cold turkey and it’s only natural you’d want to replace them with something that gives you a decent level of satisfaction. But the options aren’t always the best, since most virgin cocktails simply replace alcohol with fruit juices, resulting in a saccharine drink. There’s a growing push for more bars to offer nonalcoholic drinks that offer a little more creativity, but in the meantime you can get your own creative juices flowing. Regardless of whether you’re taking part in Dry January, you have every right to skip the booze, no explanation necessary. And if you don’t feel like ordering another Coke or a virgin strawberry daiquiri, we’ve got some alternatives that you can order from just about any bartender. Cheers to that. This sounds weird, but you’ve got to give it a try. Most bars serve coffee, and many will pour it over ice for you. Toss in a little mint syrup, and the intermingling bitter, sweet and fresh flavors will punch you in the mouth. Even though it’s not usually on the menu, bartenders often keep tea bags behind the counter. Ask for a hot toddy made with tea instead of booze, and you’ll get a mixture of tea, lemon, honey and spices like cinnamon and cloves. You can interpret “soda” as any type you like ― club soda, cola, ginger ale, or any other soda the bar offers ― but stick with club soda if you’re cutting back on sugar. You’ll notice most bars carry a variety of flavored sugar syrups ― vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut and peppermint are among the most common. Create a combination of any of the above soda and syrup pairings and you’re good to go. Recommended combinationsHoney + club sodaCoffee syrup + club soda or colaGinger syrup + cola There’s a catch to this one: Bitters are alcoholic, but the amount of alcohol is minuscule. So if you’re cutting out alcohol entirely, skip the bitters. If you’re OK with a negligible amount of alcohol making its way into your drink, we can promise you won’t feel any effects. Just about every bar has Angostura bitters (they’re the foundation of a good Old-Fashioned), and some bars will carry other flavors, including rhubarb, celery and even chocolate bitters. Add just a few drops to a club soda, and you have a fantastically herbaceous flavor. The presence of quinine in tonic makes it taste a little bitter, which is why tonic is sweetened. So if you add a little acidity in the form of lemon, lime, orange or grapefruit juice, you’ve got a perfect balance of bitter, sweet and sour flavors. Most bars have tons of fresh mint, and if you’re lucky they’ll also have rosemary and thyme. Ask the bartender to muddle your favorite herbs with some citrus and toss it into an ice-cold glass of soda water. It’s heaven. Recommended combinationsRosemary + ginger aleThyme + lemon-lime soda Just make sure you’re asking for the nonalcoholic kind of ginger beer, because an alcoholic version does exist. Ginger beer packs a more powerful fresh ginger punch than your typical ginger ale.

    "text": "In the wake of a wonky political year and the overwhelming fallout surrounding sexual misconduct in Hollywood, this Oscar season has felt long and trivial. But the show must go on, so we’ve still dutifully logged predictions for the Academy’s top six categories. If anything, this year’s awards are an opportunity to address the state of the industry and, at the risk of sounding grandiose, the state of the world we live in. The stars in attendance will rise to the occasion: They’ve already banded together to wear black at Sunday’s Golden Globes to protest harassment. With Oscar ballots opening Friday, studios’ multimillion-dollar campaigns are near the finish line. That leaves less than three weeks until the nominations are announced on Jan. 23 ― and yet this year’s Best Picture contest is still undecided. Any number of movies could land the big kahuna, though I suspect “Get Out,” “Lady Bird,” “The Post,” “Dunkirk” and “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” are the true pacesetters.

    "title": "Dedicated Volunteer Pilot Vanishes During Dog Rescue Mission",
    "text": "An Oklahoma volunteer pilot conducting an operation for an animal rescue group is missing after veering his aircraft hundreds of miles off course on his way to a Texas airport. Dr. Bill Kinsinger, a 55-year-old anesthesiologist, was flying a Cirrus SR22T from Oklahoma City Wednesday, according to The Associated Press. He was supposed to land in Georgetown, Texas, for a mission with Pilots N Paws, a nonprofit that helps volunteer pilots connect with animal shelters and rescue groups in need of transportation. Kinsinger was on his way to pick up an 11-year-old male husky named Masaru and fly him to Oklahoma. Kinsinger hadn’t yet picked up the dog when his flight went off course. His plane was last seen on radar more than 200 miles northwest of Cancun, Mexico, the AP reported. Kate Quinn, executive director of Pilots N Paws, told HuffPost that Kinsinger has been involved with the group since 2014. “He’s an incredibly active PNP pilot often flying a mission each week,” she said, adding that he also has fostered dogs in his own home when they needed temporary places to stay. “Rescuing animals is Bill’s passion,” Quinn said. “He’s always very upbeat and positive. Very empathetic to everyone he volunteered with, encouraging us to ‘save some more.’” Kinsinger’s Wednesday mission involved flying Masaru from Texas, where the dog was slated for euthanasia at an animal shelter, to Oklahoma City. From there, Masaru would be driven to Las Vegas where he would be cared for by Anchors Up Rescue Group, according to a statement from Anchors Up. On Thursday, a group of other volunteers with Pilots N Paws completed Kinsinger’s mission in his honor. As of Friday, neither Kinsinger nor his aircraft had been located, Coast Guard Petty Officer Travis McGee told HuffPost. McGee said the Coast Guard was continuing to search an area about 118 nautical miles north of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. On Wednesday, The North American Aerospace Defense Command launched aircraft to monitor Kinsinger after he stopped making contact with air traffic control. NORAD pilots flew near Kinsinger and attempted unsuccessfully to get his attention, using tactics like dropping flares and performing “military maneuvers,” the AP reported.

When NORAD pilots had to return to base ― which a spokesman told the AP was because of both darkness and because the pilots were getting too close to Mexican air space ― the Coast Guard took over monitoring the plane using tracking software. McGee told HuffPost that the Coast Guard was unable to continue tracking the plane after it stopped transmitting its signal. The Coast Guard noted in a news release that based on NORAD’s report, Kinsinger was likely suffering from hypoxia, meaning a lack of oxygen.

    "title": "Billions From VW Settlement Boost Push To Clean Vehicles",
    "text": "School buses await students at a York, Maine, middle school. Clean-energy advocates say school buses are likely targets for state programs for diesel replacement. By Martha T. Moore South Carolina wants to replace aging school buses. Colorado plans to electrify Denver’s bus system. And Washington wants electric ferryboats for Puget Sound. As part of a 2016 federal court settlement after Volkswagen admitted programming its diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests, the automaker agreed to pay $2.8 billion to states to be used to reduce diesel pollution. And with money arriving as early as June, states are already deciding how to spend their share of the funds. The infusion of money comes at a time when states are struggling to meet air quality standards and believe they won’t be able to do it without widespread adoption of low- and no-emission vehicles, from the Nissan Leaf in someone’s driveway to propane-fueled city buses and electric freight locomotives in public and corporate fleets. The VW funds — ranging from $8 million to $423 million per state, depending on the number of diesel VWs sold — could jump-start a viable market for alternate-fuel and electric vehicles, clean energy experts and state officials say. “The hidden value of the VW settlement is creating an interest and appetite [among] agencies that might not otherwise have been participating in clean-vehicle technologies,” said Dan Welch of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit that advocates for clean energy. Under the settlement, negotiated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, states can spend the VW money on grants to both public agencies and private businesses. Each state has named a lead agency — whether environmental, energy or transportation — to oversee the projects, and 11 states (Arkansas, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Vermont and Washington) have already released draft plans outlining their proposed grants to replace engines that spew nitrogen oxide, or NOx. States can spend as much as 15 percent of their payout to subsidize construction of public charging stations for electric cars. Most states are likely to spend the full amount, said Nick Nigro of Atlas Public Policy, a transportation electrification consulting firm: 17 states have already said they will do so. (Under a separate part of its court settlement, Volkswagen is spending $2 billion to build electric car charging stations and $10 billion to buy back diesel cars from consumers.) Dirty Buses Clean-energy advocates say public transit and school buses are likely targets for state programs for diesel replacement. Parents like the idea of getting rid of diesel fumes at the school bus stop. And the VW funds are arriving at a time when transit systems around the country are increasingly trying out electric and hybrid buses. “There’s an enormous amount of public interest on the school bus side,” said Will Toor, transportation program director at the nonprofit Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, a regional advocacy group. In New Mexico, a group of voters rallied in November to demand the state devote its $18 million settlement to zero-emission school buses to protect children with asthma. In South Carolina, the Department of Education wants to use all of the state’s $34 million payout to begin replacing the state’s 5,600 diesel buses, which average more than 15 years old. In July, the Los Angeles Metro public transit system pledged to convert its fleet of 2,200 buses from compressed natural gas to electric power by 2030; the first purchase of 95 electric buses, to be on the road beginning in 2020, will cost $138 million. In Seattle, King County Metro has committed to buy only electric buses after 2020. Still, just over half of the 71,000 transit buses in the U.S. remain diesel-powered, according to the federal Alternative Fuels Data Center. In Colorado, the state’s proposed plan calls for about one-quarter of its payout, or $18 million, to subsidize new electric and compressed natural gas transit buses. “What this [VW settlement] can do is make it easier for more transit agencies to try more electric buses on a greater number of routes, and become familiar with them and see that they really work for them,” Toor said. In California, which has perhaps the nation’s most extensive, and complex, air quality mitigation programs, much of the $423 million in VW settlement money will likely go to existing programs to reduce diesel emissions in neighborhoods near warehouses, industries and seaports, said California Air Resources Board spokesman David Clegern. Those programs include vouchers to offset costs of businesses buying hybrid and zero-emission trucks and buses, and demonstration projects for electrification of forklifts, refrigeration units and yard trucks at freight facilities. While the state has made strides in making cars cleaner, trucks haven’t reached the same standard, Clegern said. “There’s just a lot of trucks there, and a lot of trucks that sit and idle. If you’re at a port and your truck is moving six inches every 30 minutes, you’re putting out a lot of stuff.” Clean Diesel or Zero Emissions? One difference in states’ approach to diesel replacement has already emerged: how hard to push private and public fleet owners to replace old diesel engines with electric, rather than newer “clean” diesel, engines. (VW’s “clean” diesel engines were the ones that got it into trouble.) “There’s a tension in a way between wanting to get the most immediate thing for your buck by going for the low-cost diesel, the newer diesel vehicles, and going all the way to zero emission,” said Max Baumhefner of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an electrification advocate. New diesel vehicles cost less than electric or alternate fuel vehicles, and don’t require charging infrastructure or new fueling stations. But zero-emission vehicles are cheaper and cleaner long-term, said Nigro of Atlas Public Policy. “It’s clearly a lot of work up front. It’s a lot easier to swap out an old diesel bus for a new diesel bus. But that’s not going to move the needle on emissions, particularly NOx emissions.” Colorado, which will receive $69 million from the VW settlement, will only offer subsidies for truck and bus owners to replace old diesel engines with alternate-fuel or electric vehicles. For private businesses, it plans to pay $100,000 toward the cost of a new electric dump truck, or $36,000 for a dump truck powered by propane. For government-owned fleets, subsidies are higher: $200,000 for an electric heavy-duty truck or $50,000 for a propane-powered one. Only small businesses with fewer than nine trucks can apply for reimbursement for replacing old diesel trucks with newer “clean” diesel. In all cases, the old diesel-powered trucks must be scrapped. Connecticut, which is eligible for $56 million, will allow public and private fleet owners to replace old diesel engines with newer, cleaner diesel engines without restriction. “We’re not limiting ourselves in any way shape or form,” said Paul Farrell, assistant director of air planning for Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. “We want to see what the projects are out there.” Connecticut also plans to subsidize new electric vehicles at a higher rate than replacement with new diesel. But proponents of electric transportation say allowing new diesel engines at all is a poor use of mitigation trust money. “If you spend your money on buying new diesel to replace old diesel, five years from now you’ll never know the settlement happened,” Toor said. Electric vehicle technology is evolving quickly with improved reliability and battery life. Electric automaker Tesla, for instance, recently introduced an electric tractor-trailer truck with a 500-mile range and a price tag of $180,000. School bus makers Blue Bird and Thomas Built Buses have both introduced electric models. “If this was five years ago, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation because there weren’t electric options even on the horizon’’ for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, Toor said. The swift evolution of alternate-fuel transportation is partly why Colorado plans to put 18 percent of its settlement money — $12.2 million — in a “flex fund,” to be allocated after it becomes clear which programs will be most successful, said Chris Colclasure, deputy director of the air pollution control division of Colorado’s Department of Public Health and Environment. “We didn’t want to decide everything up front and lock ourselves into spending everything in a certain way,” he said. States’ money from the Volkswagen settlement may be least effective at combating nitrogen oxides from long-haul trucking, a major source in many states. A tractor-trailer heading through Pennsylvania and Ohio on Interstate 80, for instance, may be owned by a company headquartered elsewhere and not eligible to take part in either state’s diesel replacement program. “While significant, the VW money is not enough to tackle all of the sources of diesel pollution out there,” Baumhefner said. “The good news is that there’s still plenty of bad air to go around. There’s no shortage of opportunities here to get dirty diesel off the road.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Heavy Snow And High Winds Pound The East Coast",
    "text": "By Gina Cherelus and Scott Malone NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - The first major winter storm of 2018 bore down on the U.S. Northeast on Thursday, closing schools and government offices and disrupting travel as work crews scrambled to clear roads of snow before plummeting temperatures turn it to treacherous ice. After bringing rare snowfall to the southeast a day earlier, the storm carried rapid accumulation and high winds to New York, where subway systems appeared less crowded than usual as many commuters heeded officials’ warnings to stay home. Blizzard warnings were in place along the coast from North Carolina to Maine, with the National Weather Service forecasting winds as high as 55 miles per hour (89 kph) that may bring down tree limbs and knock out power. More than a foot (30 cm) of snow was forecast for Boston and coastal areas in northern New England. The storm is the product of a rapid and rare plunge in barometric pressure that some weather forecasters are referring to as bombogenesis, or the so-called “bomb cyclone.” The term comes from the merging of two words: bomb and cyclogenisis, according to private forecaster AccuWeather. On Wednesday, the storm dumped snow on Florida’s capital Tallahassee for the first time in 30 years, and was expected to last through the day. About 3,000 airline flights within, into or out of the United States were canceled ahead of the storm’s arrival on Thursday, with New York’s three major airports and Boston’s Logan International seeing as many as three out of four flights called off, according to tracking service FlightAware.com. Federal government offices planned to delay opening for two hours on Thursday, while state officials in Connecticut and Massachusetts ordered non-essential workers to stay home. In Maine, Governor Paul LePage ordered state offices closed for the day. “Travel conditions are expected to be treacherous,” LePage said in a statement. “Avoiding unnecessary travel will keep accidents to a minimum and allow state and municipal road crews to safely go about their work.” The snow storm brought a break in extreme cold temperatures that have gripped much of the region since Christmas, frozen part of the Niagara Falls, played havoc with public works and impeded firefighting in places where temperatures barely broke 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6 centigrade). But forecasters warned temperatures would drop sharply on Friday and into the weekend. That left work crews scrambling to clear snow off roadways and sidewalks on Thursday before it freezes to ice and makes conditions more treacherous for pedestrians and drivers alike. “These are tough conditions to move around in, so if you don’t need to be on the road ... you shouldn’t,” said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Twitter. “Everyone needs to take this weather very seriously.” Schools were ordered to close in New York, many parts of New Jersey, Boston and other cities through the region. Private forecaster AccuWeather said snow would fall quickly during the day, at a rate of several inches per hour, with the storm intensified by the bombogenesis effect. The phenomenon occurs when a storm’s barometric pressure drops by 24 millibars in 24 hours. As a result, the accumulation of snow and winds intensifies, which can cause property damage and power outages. More than 35,000 customers were without power in Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia early on Thursday, utilities reported online. A part of US-13 at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in Virginia was closed due to high winds early on Thursday while state transportation departments throughout the region reported dozens of delays due to deteriorating roads conditions. Late on Wednesday, a baggage car and two sleeper cars on an Amtrak train traveling from Miami to New York, with 311 passengers aboard, derailed as it was slowly backing into a station in Savannah, Georgia. No one was injured, an Amtrak spokesman said. The cold has been blamed for at least nine deaths over the past few days, including those of two homeless people in Houston.

    "title": "This Is The Man To Blame For The Term 'Bomb Cyclone'",
    "text": "The man who helped invent “bomb cyclone” ― the meteorological term used to describe the intense weather system gripping the East Coast right now ― doesn’t use it anymore. McGill University meteorology professor John Gyakum said he avoids analogies to incendiary weapons in an era where terrorist attacks and major weather events both regularly make headlines. “When I talk about these explosively developing storms, I go through the trouble of mouthing the terms ‘explosively developing,’ and I don’t use ‘bomb,’” Gyakum told HuffPost. “It’s somewhat inappropriate when you consider other aspects of the world right now.” But Gyakum, along with the revered late Massachusetts Institute of Technology meteorologist Fred Sanders, first coined the term in a paper they published in 1980. They used the phrase to describe powerful cyclones that get their energy from rapid drops in pressure caused by hot and cold temperatures colliding. The once-obscure piece of meteorological jargon entered the popular lexicon this week as a monster storm, set to pummel the East Coast on Wednesday night into Thursday, formed over the Atlantic Ocean. “Bomb cyclone” surged in popularity after The Washington Post published an article Tuesday afternoon comparing the storm to a winter hurricane, warning that winds could reach 70 mph in some parts of New England. A bomb occurs when an extratropical surface cyclone undergoes “bombogenesis,” meaning the central pressure drops 24 millibars in 24 hours. As pressure decreases, the storm’s strength intensifies. The name describes the topography of a weather map during such a cyclone. In a high-pressure system, the isobar lines are far apart. But when the pressure suddenly plummets in the middle of a cyclone, the lines are close together, indicating a deep depression. Scientists began toying with combining the terms “bomb,” “bombogenesis,” “weather” and “climatological” in the 1940s, according to Earther. However, Mary Cairns, the Glossary of Meteorology’s chief editor, told HuffPost that the term was absent from the first edition of the American Meteorological Society glossary in 1959. Lance Bosart, Sanders’ first Ph.D. student at MIT, said Sanders used the term “bomb” in 1964. “That was the first use I had ever heard of the term,” said Bosart, a professor of atmospheric and environmental science at SUNY Albany. “At the time, I never thought to ask him where it came from. But the term was confined to MIT. When you went somewhere else, it wasn’t used.” Sanders, who died in 2006 at age 83, was a giant of synoptic meteorology ― a field that specializes in large-scale weather events, such as cyclones, fronts and jetstreams ― and is now considered the father of the term “bomb cyclone.” In September 1976, Sanders and Gyakum, a student at the time, began a three-year study on the process of bombogenesis. They were building on the work of Tor Bergeron, a Swedish meteorologist who in the 1930s theorized how precipitation forms in clouds. Sanders and Gyakum published their research under the title “Synoptic-Dynamic Climatology of the ‘Bomb’” in March 1980. The widely cited paper catapulted “bomb” into mainstream meteorology. When the American Meteorological Society updated its glossary in 2000, the term made the cut because it was so commonly used by scientists, professors and National Weather Service officials. “If the term itself — ‘bomb’ — helps to spur more constructive research, then I’m happy.” Although he avoids using the term himself, Gyakum, 64, said he hopes its newfound popularity will raise awareness about the dangers of bomb cyclones. “A lot of focus in coastal areas is on hurricanes in the summertime,” he said. “A lot of time during winter, people say it’s easy, the season is over, we don’t have to worry about hurricane-force winds. But a place like Hilton Head, South Carolina, which had been threatened earlier this year and impacted by a few hurricanes, is particularly prone today to the effects of an explosively developing cyclone.” The number of bomb cyclones varies from year to year. About 40 such events can occur off the northern Atlantic and Pacific coasts each year, according to the National Weather Service. But climate change threatens to make them stronger and more frequent. Despite the planet warming overall, northern regions have been hit with a growing number of extreme cold snaps over the past four decades, according to research published last September in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. Scientists believe that is because the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and reduced sea ice in the region is allowing the ocean to release more energy. The heat escaping from the surface water is causing the weakening of polar vortex winds that swirl above the Arctic, which normally keep air contained to the polar region. That, as InsideClimate News noted last year, allows the cold polar air to slip southward more often. “These cold air masses, when they travel over warming waters, the possibility, the probability, of more of these explosively developing cyclones, particularly in populated coastal areas are going to get much more severe,” Gyakum said. In 2014, global sea levels were 2.6 inches above the 1993 average, and continue to rise at a rate of about one-eighth of an inch per year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That amplifies the destructiveness of bomb cyclones. “Climate change is having a potentially big impact on not only the potential strength of these cyclones but also the impacts along coastal areas,” Gyakum said. “Even an ordinary storm is much more dangerous than it was, say, 50 years ago, simply because ocean levels have risen.” Those effects, he said, require more research. “If the term itself ― ‘bomb’ ― helps to spur more constructive research,” he said, “then I’m happy.” But not everyone agrees the term’s sudden popularity is so harmless. “In terms of trying to convey meteorological features to the general population, putting in words like that could confuse people more, or, for some people, alarm them,” National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini told HuffPost. “These storms are very dangerous,” he added. “They can cover a large area as they move across the ocean. It’s really important to understand the impacts of these systems.” All day Thursday meteorologists are going to be glued to the new GOES-East satellite watching a truly amazing extratopical \"bomb\" cyclone off New England coast. It will be massive -- fill up entire Western Atlantic off U.S. East Coast. Pressure as low as Sandy & hurricane winds pic.twitter.com/6M4S3y75wT Another problem is that attention-grabbing phrases often lose their technical meaning when they become part of popular dialogue. “It’s important to understand a bomb cyclone has a very specific meaning,” said Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgia’s atmospheric program and a former president of the American Meteorological Society. “Not all nor’easters, and not even all strong nor’easters or blizzards, are bombs.” The National Weather Service defines a blizzard as a storm containing large amounts of snow with winds of 35 mph and visibilities of less than one-quarter of a mile for at least three hours. Yet “you see people use ‘blizzards’ for every snowstorm,” Shepherd said, noting that same thing has begun to happen with the phrase “polar vortex” ― a technical term that gained widespread prominence in early 2014 when the phenomenon brought record cold temperatures and heavy snowfall across the United States and Canada. Then there’s the peacenik objection to the term “bomb.” In the early 1980s, a meteorology professor in West Germany publicly scolded Sanders for applying the word to science, according to Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT. “Fred’s retort was, ‘If you don’t like that, what about “front”? That’s been around for a long time,’” said Emanuel, Sanders’ close friend and colleague since 1981. Then he laughed. “That opinion was not widely shared.” “Bomb cyclone,” however, appears to be sharing far and wide. “All my social media contacts are asking me about it on Facebook,” said Eric G. Hoffman, a Plymouth State University meteorology professor who co-authored a paper with Sanders in the early 2000s. “It seems to have caught wildfire today.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Bouncing Around Colorado Springs In The Dead Of Winter",
    "text": "Mention Colorado Springs and you probably think of Pikes Peak, the highest mountain in the southern Front Range of the Rockies, or the Broadmoor Hotel, the historic resort nestled in the hills overlooking the city. But what happens when you take both of those out of the picture, plus most of the other tourists? On a recent visit to the Springs in the dead of winter, we discovered the surprising answer. The famous Pikes Peak Cog Railway was closed for the season and the Broadmoor was booked solid, so my kids and I found ourselves an Airbnb in a quiet residential neighborhood near North Cheyenne Cañon Park, and we set out to discover the rest of Colorado Springs. Turns out there's more -- much more -- to this place than an enormous resort hotel and a mountain. We found miles and miles of impressive hiking trails, a great museum, and one of the most overlooked service academies in America. Colorado Springs is built around hiking, literally. The city is surrounded by 1,200 acres of open spaces designed to be part of the community. These parks are not the tended gardens you'd expect back East, in New York or Savannah, Ga. They are often swaths of undeveloped land teeming with deer and an occasional black bear. Our favorite open space was the Garden of the Gods, a National Natural Landmark with miles of hiking trails and 300-foot sandstone formations. On a weekend, you can stroll through here and watch climbers hone their skills on Cathedral Rock's vertical face. The Garden also takes a great picture from almost any angle. My kids, who grew up mostly on the East Coast, tried to wrap their heads around the fact that this was, in fact, not a wilderness area. \"If this is a park,\" my 12-year-old son, Iden, asked, \"then where's the city?\" Perhaps the best part of Garden of the Gods is that admission is completely free. That's how I like it. But it's not the only free activity in town. If you like historical museums, you'll love the Colorado Springs Pioneers Museum, located in the old El Paso County Courthouse. I've seen plenty of other pioneer museums that celebrate a town's historical roots, but this one's a standout. There's a large exhibit with historical photos that includes a section on the history of photography, which carefully explains the various technologies used to capture images. The museum even has a small studio with vintage clothing, where kids can take photos of themselves in pioneer dresses and top hats. Since it's a former courthouse, the museum also meticulously preserved one of the courtrooms. Alas, part of the room is roped off, but I think my daughter really wanted to slide under the ropes in her borrowed pioneer dress, climb into the judge's seat, and point at random people in the courtroom, shouting, \"Guilty!\" Maybe she shouldn't watch so much Law & Order. And then there's the U.S. Air Force Academy, just outside of town. Spending an afternoon on a college campus might not be your idea of fun, but the Air Force Academy isn't just any any campus. It's one of the finest examples of mid-20th-century Modernist architecture in the United States: a minimal style that uses glass, aluminum and marble. The centerpiece is the United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel, a towering A-frame designed by Chicago architect Walter Netsch. Its bold lines capture the Air Force's forward-looking, innovative culture. It also stands in sharp contrast to the more popular East Coast service academies in Annapolis, Md., and West Point, N.Y., which have longer traditions and more conventional architecture. There's a helpful visitors center where you can learn more about the institution and watch a short movie about a year in the life of a cadet. After sitting through it, my kids had a very different view of Air Force life and the meaning of leadership. Even if they never serve in the military, they can take some of those academy values home with them -- specifically, the academy's Honor Code, \"We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does.\" My son asked if the code applied to everyone who visited the academy. I considered my answer for a moment. How long could I persuade him that he had to live by the Honor Code before he found out that it only applied to the cadets? A week? An hour? (And, ahem, wouldn't misleading him technically be a lie?) \"No,\" I finally sighed. \"But it would be nice if it applied to our elected representatives.\" Colorado Springs is one of those rare destinations that offers a lot even in the dead of winter and without breaking your budget.

    "text": "A young Texas boy’s touching tribute to his late baby sister is striking a chord around the world. Stephanie and Samir Deais, from San Antonio, filmed 4-year-old son Alexander singing “Remember Me” from the animated movie “Coco” to a photograph of his sibling Ava Lynn on what would been her first birthday on Saturday. “Remember me, though I have to travel far, remember me,” the youngster sings in the clip, as he strums his toy guitar. My son singing \"Remember Me\" from the movie \"Coco\" to his baby sister, Ava, who we lost this past May.He's only 4 years old and he understands. He didn't even know he was being recorded. He just wanted to sing to her for her 1st birthday! Happy Birthday mamas, we miss you!💕 pic.twitter.com/EoVLjju0bJ Samir Deais shared the tender footage to Twitter, above. “He’s only 4 years old and he understands,” Deais wrote. “He didn’t even know he was being recorded. He just wanted to sing to her for her 1st birthday.” The video had garnered more than 1.3 million views as of Wednesday morning. Ava Lynn died in May 2017 after being diagnosed with the kidney condition hydronephrosis. The reaction to Alexander’s tribute was “nothing short of beautiful,” Samir Deais told MySanAntonio.com. “All this ugly in the world and these kinds of things make it still seem beautiful in the dark times,” he said. “All these blessings for our small family make us very humbled and thankful and blessed.” My wife and were literally brought to tears seeing how much love Alex and Ava and our family has received.

    "title": "Broadway Actor Ben Vereen Accused Of Sexual Assault In 2015 'Hair' Production",
    "text": "Multiple women have accused Broadway star Ben Vereen of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault, according to a Friday morning report from the New York Daily News. The alleged sexual misconduct happened during Vereen’s tenure as director of the 2015 production of “Hair” at the Venice Theatre program outside of Tampa, Florida. Vereen, who was 69 at the time, held open auditions for the production and later managed the 32-person volunteer cast. Four female cast members told the New York Daily News that Vereen repeatedly and forcibly kissed and hugged them without their consent. Several other cast members corroborated their experiences, telling the New York Daily News that Vereen routinely made degrading comments about female cast members’ bodies during rehearsals and one time stripped naked with the cast during what he called an acting exercise. Two of the four women alleged that Vereen invited them separately over to his home in September 2015 for “private rehearsals.” During these two incidences, Vereen allegedly coerced the women into getting naked and asked them to join him in the hot tub. According to the two accounts, Vereen pressed his erect penis into the women’s legs and made unwanted sexual advances. “He was acting as my mentor, asking me about my parents, then that same night, he put me on his lap while I was crying, and I felt his erection,” Kaitlyn Terpstra, who was 22 at the time, told the New York Daily News. “He asked me, ‘Feel that?’ It was terrifying. I said, ‘Feel what?’ I wanted to act like I didn’t. I pushed myself off with a laugh,” she continued. “Then later, he asked, ‘Do you think I want to fuck you?’ I said ‘Yes,’ and he got angry. He said, ‘Well, I don’t, and that’s unfortunate.’ He made me feel like I had my mind in the gutter.” The other woman, identified only as “Kim,” told the New York Daily News Vereen asked her to perform oral sex while they were in his hot tub. Kim, who was only 23 at the time, said she acquiesced and recalled feeling “confused.” “I didn’t feel like I had a choice,” she said. Kim said she willingly entered into a relationship with Vereen after that first encounter. Now, however, she believes it was because he manipulated and took advantage of her. Vereen starred in the original Broadway production of “Hair” between 1968 and 1972, alternating between the roles of Claude and Hud. Many of the 2015 cast members (all of whom were volunteers looking to jumpstart their acting careers) said that they were in awe of Vereen’s iconic role and subsequent successful career, which made it easier for him to take advantage of them. In a statement to HuffPost, Vereen did not deny the accusations and apologized for his actions: I would like to apologize directly to the female cast members of the musical Hair for my inappropriate conduct when I directed the production in 2015. While it was my intention to create an environment that replicated the themes of that musical during the rehearsal process, I have since come to understand that it is my conduct, not my intentions, which are relevant here. So I am not going to make any excuses because the only thing that matters here is acknowledging and apologizing for the effects of my conduct on the lives of these women. Going forward, my having come to terms with my past conduct will inform all my future interactions not only with women, but with all individuals. I hope these women will find it in their hearts to accept my sincere apology and forgive me. Murray Chase, executive director of the Venice Theatre, told New York Daily News that the theater is “working to strengthen our sexual harassment policies and procedures, including the reporting of them, to prevent any future occurrences.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "It's So Cold That A Canadian Zoo Took Extra Precautions To Protect Its Penguins",
    "text": "Frigid temperatures in Alberta, Canada, have caused zookeepers to take extra precautions to keep their penguins safe. King penguins at Calgary Zoo are typically able to waddle into their outdoor enclosure as they please. But as temperatures in the region dipped below -13 degrees Fahrenheit, they were moved into their indoor enclosure several times, zoo curator Malu Celli told the Canadian Press. While these king penguins are accustomed to freezing subantarctic climates, they are less hardy than their relatives, emperor penguins. There’s also a young chick in the zoo’s flock, a fact that encouraged zookeepers to be extra cautious over the past few weeks. “It’s kind of like you can bundle up your kid, but then there’s a point you’re going to say, ‘I know you’re good, but I’d rather you stay inside now,’” Celli said. A spokesperson from Calgary Zoo told HuffPost that weather conditions in the area have since improved and the penguins are “happily outdoors again.” It’s not unusual for the zoo to pull its king penguins in from their outdoor enclosure during Calgary’s extreme winter conditions. The zoo’s guidelines suggest that the penguins should be kept indoors if temperatures fall below -25 C (-13 F). Celli told the Canadian Press that temperatures in the region have recently remained around -28 C (-18.4 F). Early Monday morning, the weather in Calgary dipped down to -30 C (-22 F), according to Globalnews.ca. “It’s not necessarily that it’s too cold for them,” Celli said. “I believe that physiologically, they can withstand colder weather than what we have here, but these are not wild birds.” Record-breaking cold temperatures in the United States this week have led some U.S. zoos to prepare to take extra measures to protect their animals too. Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, which recently had its coldest New Year’s Day on record with a high of 1 degree Fahrenheit, is remaining vigilant. General Curator Dave Bernier told HuffPost that the zoo’s facilities are designed to protect animals even in extremely cold weather. While zookeepers prefer to let animals roam freely between their indoor and outdoor spaces, the staff closely monitors those decisions when temperatures reach these extremes. “We always prefer to give [animals] access to both indoor and outdoor exhibits but will verify that they are making good [decisions] or using the spaces appropriately in extreme weather conditions such as these,” he said. “If there is concern, then they would not be given access to the outdoor space.” The zoo’s African penguins, a temperate species, tend to choose to be indoors most of the time when the temperatures dip into the single digits ― even though the zoo has provided them with heated water outside. John Davis, curator of mammals at South Carolina’s Riverbanks Zoo and Garden told HuffPost that his organization hasn’t needed to take any unusual precautions to ensure the safety of the zoo’s animals. If anything, it’s the human caretakers who are really bearing the brunt of the cold weather. “All of the animals at the zoo are doing well and managing through the southern cold snap,” Davis said. “Staff are the ones enduring most of the discomfort, a testament to their dedication.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Anti-Immigrant Signs Pop Up On California Highways As State Becomes A Sanctuary",
    "text": "As California officially became a “sanctuary state” at the start of the new year, fake signs with anti-immigrant messages appeared near the state’s borders. “Official sanctuary state. Felons, Illegals and MS13 Welcome!” the signs read. “Democrats Need The Votes!” The messages had been papered over existing signs, California Department of Transportation spokesman Mark Dinger told HuffPost on Wednesday. They referred to a new law, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown (D) in October and effective Jan. 1, that limits local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal immigration officials and prohibits police from generally inquiring into people’s immigration status. The California Values Act does not, however, bar police from working with immigration officials in the cases of people convicted of a wide range of felonies. The signs suggested that undocumented immigrants are dangerous criminals. OMG! Look at this sign someone put up on the 15 Freeway between LA and Las Vegas! It reads :Welcome to California. Official Sanctuary State. Felons, Illegals and MS13 WelcomeDemocrats need the Votes! #NewYearsDay pic.twitter.com/pc5xRnqZIB Conservative leaders, including President Donald Trump, have repeatedly and falsely portrayed immigrants as more likely to commit criminal acts. Trump and others have pointed to MS-13 ― a gang started in Los Angeles that spread to other U.S. cities and to Central America ― as a reason for stronger immigration enforcement. Five of the prank signs were reported around the state, but Caltrans employees have found and taken down only two, spokesman Dinger said. One on I-15 near the Nevada border was removed on Monday, and another on I-40 near the Arizona border came down Tuesday. Caltrans was not able to locate at least three other signs reported near the Oregon and Arizona borders. Caltrans did not know who was behind the signs, Dinger said, and would not be investigating the incident as it is not a law enforcement agency. Photos of the signs were circulated largely by conservative accounts on Twitter, with former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin tweeting about them and other apparent opponents of the sanctuary law appearing amused by the prank. Oh, wow.

Before the statewide law went into effect, several major cities there, including San Francisco, already had their own sanctuary policies. Critics of sanctuary laws, including anti-immigration hard-liners like Trump, argue that limiting local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal immigration officials makes cities more dangerous. Supporters say that sanctuary laws make communities safer by encouraging undocumented residents to trust and cooperate with local police.

    "title": "What Do California's Pot Outlaws Do Now?",
    "text": "From a stage in the heart of America’s most important marijuana-growing region, a DJ named Eden pleaded for unity. “Yo, give me some Hum-love,” she said. “We’ve been through tougher times than this, y’all.” She was presiding over the Golden Tarp Awards, a contest to celebrate and promote the storied cannabis of Humboldt County, California. Humboldt is one of three counties that make up the Emerald Triangle, the epicenter of the country’s cannabis production. It begins north of wine country, in northern Mendocino County, and continues up the “Lost Coast” to encompass Humboldt County and, inland, Trinity County. It’s a landscape of misty, old-growth redwood forests and jagged cliffs that plunge into choppy, gray seas, like something out of Tolkien. It was mid-November, a few weeks before the dawn of legal recreational weed in California, and for small independent growers, legalization was beginning to look like a disaster. California’s thousands of outlaw pot farmers have long been ambivalent about full legalization, given the potential disruptions to their lucrative, tax-free businesses. Now it looked as if their worst fears had been realized. California had just released emergency rules for the legal market, which opened Monday, Jan. 1. In earlier iterations, the state had agreed to hold off on licensing large, industrial-scale grows until 2023, giving small farmers time to adapt. The new rules reversed the position to immediately allow huge industrial farms to depress prices even further. So it was under a cloud of another kind that much of Humboldt’s cannabis community had gathered for the Golden Tarps. The award ceremony was being held at a community center in Redway, a forest town, population 1,225. After the DJ came Kevin Jodrey, the event’s impresario. “It’s people like us who built this industry,” Jodrey said. “We’re getting financially beaten to death.” Jodrey began the Golden Tarps in 2014, naming them for the covers used to deprive pot plants of sunlight and force them to flower. A self-described “career drug dealer,” Jodrey arrived in Humboldt 27 years ago. He told me he grew up in Rhode Island in an extended family connected to organized crime, and he came to Humboldt after a stint as a diver in the Coast Guard. Now 51, he’s scruffy and compact with shoulder-length silver hair. He talks nonstop in an East-Coast-wiseguy accent unmellowed by decades in the woods and God knows how much dope. Jodrey has done well for himself. His farm is on top of a mountain surrounded by forest, and he likes walking with his family beneath the redwoods. Among Humboldt growers he seems better prepared than most for the transition to a legal market. One of his dispensaries has received its county license, and his mountaintop farm, Wonderland Nurseries, has passed all its inspections. He said he hasn’t been locked up since high school. The Golden Tarps are one of many efforts to promote small-farm, organic-style pot in a market in which larger farms will enjoy significant advantages. In Mendocino, a project is underway to create cannabis appellations, akin to the French wine classification system. But bigness is coming for the Emerald Triangle. Deep-pocketed individuals — many of them Bulgarians — are buying up land to capitalize on Humboldt’s hallowed terroir. “Maybe people don’t understand the difference between good pot and bad pot yet, and hopefully we’ll show ’em,” Jodrey said to the crowd. “I saw some gorgeous cannabis come across the desk, and most of my judges are laid out.” At the first Golden Tarps, four years ago, the winner declined to identify himself. This year the event was accompanied by a livestream, and in a further effort at publicity, they’d invited an industry reporter, me, to serve as a “celebrity judge.” “We used to be silent,” Jodrey said. “Now we’re loud.” Judges had a six-hour window to blindly evaluate 16 strains grouped into categories by smell: floral, fuel, earth and fruity. Lab results for THC content (potency) and other variables determined the finalists. For judges, the hard part is discerning between the sensations evoked by the third sample and the sixth, or the sixth and the 10th. Pot judging is inherently suspect, but the results matter. A Golden Tarps victory is a credential, and thus one of few ways for growers to distinguish their weed from their neighbors’. Some cannabis users can spend hours discussing with Talmudic fervor the microvariations in cannabis scent and “expression,” but I can’t. So it was with some relief that a travel delay forced me to give up judging duties, allowing me to sample the finalists strictly for research purposes. This year’s winner was a sample of the strain Gorilla Glue #4. It went unremarked that a company that claims to have invented the strain had recently settled a trademark infringement lawsuit filed by the Gorilla Glue company, an adhesives maker based near Cincinnati. Jodrey hopes to see the Golden Tarp winner get some “juice” out of the win, but the settlement could complicate promotion efforts. “Infringement.” Lawsuits. Settlements. Artisanal pot. The weed business isn’t what it used to be, and some of the old outlaws of Humboldt want to know what they’re supposed to do now that the industry they pioneered seems to be done with them. Every grower believes he grows amazing weed. Wendy, a Humboldt County grower who asked to be identified only by her first name, isn’t a braggart, but she has a stronger claim to greatness than most. Two of her strains beat out hundreds of competitors to finish in the top 20 at the 2016 Emerald Cup, a prestigious post-harvest festival and farmers’ market in Sonoma County. For growers accustomed to the illegal market, legalization has presented tough choices. They can try to join the legal market with its taxes, regulations and other burdens, or try and brazen it in the shadows. Wendy said the choice was made for her when her Emerald Cup wins lit up Instagram. “They just said my name from the stage,” she recalled thinking. “I guess I’m out of hiding.” The airy home Wendy shares with her husband, two daughters and their dogs is in a clearing in a live oak forest. To find it, drive north across the Golden Gate Bridge and continue for four hours or so. Exit the highway and follow a series of increasingly winding and narrow roads to the bottom of a dirt trail. Park out of view of the road, by the “No Trespassing” signs, and Wendy can fetch you for the bumpy ride up the hill. In November, she sat on her couch, a bandana holding back her hair, as she trimmed her last outlaw harvest. In front of her she had a plastic tub the size of a coffee table. Every few minutes, she pulled out a few stalks and laid them on the big tray in her lap. Wearing rubber gloves, she cut the nuggets away from the stems and then snipped the extra foliage off the dense little topiaries. They wholesale for $800 a pound. Wendy trimmed with spring-loaded shears, occasionally brushing a bud’s rogue hairs into place with a practiced gesture reminiscent of an oyster shucker. She set aside the “smalls” for her line of skin creams, and scraped up the excess leafage, called “trim,” to sell to edibles manufacturers. Not long ago, Humboldt’s cannabis professionals were much more reticent to discuss their work, even among themselves. “You just assumed” people in Humboldt grew weed, Wendy said. When they shook hands, trimmers could recognize each other by their steroidal thumbs. Behind her, one corner of the house appeared to be piled with familial clutter — more tubs of cannabis, in fact, and clear plastic bags of sheared bud. A wood-burning stove squatted nearby. One grower I met said she uses her discarded stems as kindling, and the dogs get stoned. When one of Wendy’s daughters asked how the family made money, she replied that lots of people “need medicine or like medicine, and [the region] grows the best.” In the late 1970s, Wendy’s parents joined the back-to-the-land movement and relocated from Washington to Humboldt. She was an infant at the time. At first the family lived in a tiny cabin with kerosene lamps and a battery powered CB radio. Her father did well as a contractor and cannabis grower, and when she was 10 or 12 they moved into a gorgeous mountaintop house. At the time, there were tensions between growers and loggers who felt the new arrivals were the embodiments of the environmental regulations they blamed for the timber industry’s decline. “Everyone was outlaws. We all had someone’s back.” But these communities discovered a mutual interest in making lots of money and not paying taxes on it. The hippies and rednecks cross-pollinated, and a new subculture, sometimes called hipneck, emerged. Hipnecks are gun-loving farmers who drive pick-ups and roll joints as thick as tennis ball cans. (Similar communities took root in Appalachia.) They developed their own slang and customs. Without access to banks, growers buried their cash in the woods. Now they say the money is all dug up. Humboldt’s farmers pride themselves on their ultra-competence and their “balls” – an attribute not limited to men ― but also on their strong community ties. No grower could survive alone. When Humboldt’s community radio station, KMUD, alerted listeners to police convoys, Wendy’s father chainsawed down trees to block the forest roads. “Everyone was outlaws. We all had someone’s back,” Wendy said. This isolated criminal society had an undeniable allure, as well as its share of disturbing aspects. Every fall, travelers flock to Humboldt to trim the harvest, and stories have emerged that suggest, at some farms, a toxic environment rife with sexual harassment and assault. These were workplaces awash in cash, drugs and guns, and without cell reception, and the bosses were often semi-reclusive men. “I’ve always wanted to fuck out of my league,” a man with a history in the industry told me. “And the only way I can do it is with drugs and money.” Occasionally, Humboldt became a low-grade war zone. In the mid-1980s, California and the federal government created the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting (CAMP), a partnership to eradicate illegal growing. (It subsequently expanded to all 50 states.) Among other tactics, CAMP flew U-2 spy planes over the Emerald Triangle to locate farms. In summer 1990, 200 Army and National Guard troops and law enforcement agents rappelled out of helicopters, confiscating plants and arresting locals at gunpoint. Called Operation Green Sweep, it was the first time active-duty troops were used domestically against marijuana farmers. Locals responded with protests. The military raids were terrifying but not always effective. In its initial phase, Operation Green Sweep confiscated only about 1,200 plants, roughly a third of what Wendy grows annually on her small seasonal farm. Plus, some enforcement helped keep prices healthy. Wendy said her family took the precaution of not growing on their own property. They were never raided, but their neighbors were. “Their whole family, including the children, were zip-tied and made to sit on the floor of the living room while the cops ransacked their house and stole things,” Wendy wrote in an email. She planted her first guerrilla cannabis grow a few years later when she was in high school. It was as easy as throwing down some grow bags on a remote spot on a neighbor’s property. After hiking in soil and manure, she returned once a week for watering. Together the plants yielded only 12 ounces, but at $5,000 a pound, tax-free, it was all she needed for gas and spending money. Wendy studied at College of the Redwoods and then transferred to one of the University of California schools, where she took environmental science courses. Not long before graduation, she flew to Maui for a friend’s wedding and stayed for four years, working at a hotel and a dive shop. She met her future husband there. Eventually they moved back to Humboldt. Smoking cannabis can make Wendy paranoid. But she had developed chronic pain problems and found that juicing the leaves of a strain rich in cannabidiol, a non-psychoactive chemical found in cannabis, helped her pain and helped her to kick Vicodin. She ran a trim crew for a few years until she was able to acquire property in a “Humboldt land deal,” a local term of art implying transfers of cash and/or weed that don’t appear on a contract. When she was in high school, Wendy could offload her carelessly grown pot for $5,000 a pound, and it was almost all profit. Now she gets $800 for her prize-winning flower. After taxes and costs — labor, workers’ comp, etc. — her margin per pound has dropped below $300. She trimmed her own crop this year in part because she couldn’t pay trimmers anything close to the $200 a pound she used to command. With full legalization, small farms will have to compete against indoor grow facilities larger than football fields, many of them coming online in economically depressed desert towns east of Los Angeles. Mass-market cannabis tends to be machine-trimmed in contraptions resembling clothes dryers. In California, there is certainly some demand for premium-craft cannabis, but it’s not yet clear how large it will be. Corporate weed gets the job done, and in most states, people still have to settle for whatever they can find. Wendy was blunt: “We don’t believe in putting out mid-grade medicine.” But under the new regulatory regime, it’s unclear whether small farms will be able to survive. California is a cannabis superpower, producing and consuming more than any other state. Its tens of thousands of pot farmers grow 13.5 million pounds annually, according to a recent report from the state’s Food and Agriculture Department. But of the total crop, only 20 percent went into California’s legal medical market; the rest was sold illegally in California or shipped out of state, also illegally. (California’s 2017 legal medical market was worth close to $3 billion, according to data firm BDS Analytics.) Before Colorado’s recreational market opened in 2014, the state took steps to regulate the industry and implemented an RFID system to track all legal product in the state “from seed to sale.” Among other things, it’s designed to ensure companies pay their taxes and don’t offload product onto the illegal market. States that have since legalized, or are in the process, have mostly followed Colorado’s example. By contrast, in 1996, California became the first state to legalize medical but made only minimal effort to regulate the industry. Legalization was far less popular than it is now, and the state declined to regulate it, instead telling cities and counties to write their own laws. It’s given rise to a confusing regulatory patchwork that is often incomplete or contradictory. For example, until Monday, when the recreational market officially opened, a dispensary licensed in the Bay Area might source product from a locally permitted medical marijuana grower in the Emerald Triangle, but there was no aboveboard way to transport commercial quantities of cannabis from the farm to an edibles factory or a store. In Humboldt, the 101 south to San Francisco is known as “the gauntlet.” In other respects, the lack of rules favored illegal growers. Since California doesn’t track product, it’s easier to divert out of state. It’s only now, with full legalization, that California is implementing the kinds of stricter state-level regulations aimed at eliminating the illegal market. While the dynamic is complex and untested, small-scale growers see market conditions tilting against them. Recently, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions further complicated the equation by making it clear he’d like to see U.S. attorneys go after state-legal cannabis businesses. Anecdotal evidence suggests some of Humboldt’s small farmers are giving up. “If you were in it for the money, there’s really no reason to do it anymore,” Wendy said. One grower, who asked not to be identified, said she’d never apply for a permit. “It’s a lot of money, and they constantly throw shit at you.” She prefers to take her chances selling illegally. “Black market for life,” she said. The morning after the Golden Tarps, Kevin Jodrey was eating breakfast and holding court at the Eel River Cafe along Garberville’s handsome main drag. Not long ago, Jodrey said, “It was the richest town you’ve ever seen, since every business was a laundromat for cannabis money.” But poverty seems to be on the rise, some locals told me, though data was hard to come by. It’s never been easy to be a Humboldt cannabis grower. These days, Jodrey said, his colleagues had to contend with satellite imagery, cease-and-desist letters, warrants. He compared it to “totalitarian East German society.” He kept returning to how much he loved living in Humboldt. “In a world of diminishing privacy, to have a private mountaintop isn’t bad,” he said. And he seems to enjoy living outside the law. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "California's Marijuana Legalization Aims To Repair Damage From The War On Drugs",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES ― California is now the largest state in the nation to have legal and regulated recreational marijuana. And while that alone is a blow to the prohibitionist policies of the failed war on drugs, a lesser-known provision in the state’s new law, along with efforts in a few local jurisdictions, aims to repair some of the damage that the criminalization of marijuana has done to so many communities. “California’s Proposition 64 ballot measure was not only about marijuana legalization, it was one of the most progressive sentencing and criminal justice reforms in the entire country,” said Eunisses Hernandez, a policy coordinator at Drug Policy Alliance, a leading drug policy reform group. A year ago, voters approved Proposition 64 to legalize marijuana for recreational purposes and reduce criminal penalties for various marijuana-related offenses for adults and juveniles. It also authorized a new process for individuals in the state to get previous marijuana-related convictions retroactively reduced, reclassified as lesser offenses or dismissed altogether. The process could end up helping hundreds of thousands of people whose lives have been disrupted or derailed over activities that became legal as of Jan. 1. Criminal convictions can have devastating consequences long after the offense was committed, making it difficult to obtain employment, bank loans and housing. “In many ways, Proposition 64 has already been a success because we’ve ended the unnecessary and arbitrary criminalization of Californians around this issue, and helped tens of thousands of people who were unjustly unable to seek career and education opportunities due to prior non-violent marijuana offenses,” Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom told HuffPost. But relief is not automatic under the new law. Individuals who want their marijuana convictions reclassified or cleared must submit an application to a court. They may also need to hire an attorney to help them through the process. About 5,000 people have so far applied to have marijuana sentences reviewed for possible relief, according to data compiled by the Judicial Council of California. And while it’s encouraging that some are taking advantage of the new process, it’s an extremely small fraction of the number of people who have been arrested for marijuana offenses in the state. California produces vast amounts of marijuana and has done so for years. In 1996, it became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. And despite the passage of more permissive laws, there were still thousands of marijuana-related arrests annually. From 2006 to 2015, there were nearly 500,000 people arrested for marijuana offenses, a recent DPA report found. And Rodney Holcombe, a legal fellow at DPA, said that there may be close to 1 million people in the state who have convictions that could now be eligible for relief. “Creating a safe, legal and tightly regulated system for adult-use marijuana is, at its core, about criminal justice reform and fixing a broken system that has disproportionately harmed low-income Californians and communities of color,” said Newsom, a proponent of Prop. 64. Beyond sentencing, some local governments are making efforts to further repair damage from criminalization by enacting “equity programs” that allow for victims of the war on drugs to have application priority during the marijuana business licensing process. “As we know, communities of color have been most negatively impacted by marijuana prohibition throughout the years ― folks have been incarcerated for activity that is now completely legal ― and you have a new demographic now coming in taking over these spaces making millions of dollars through this industry,” Holcombe said. “These programs can provide a tremendous opportunity for low-income folks, folks of color, folks who have lived in neighborhoods that have been over-policed, especially during the height of the war on drugs.” To that end, Oakland launched the nation’s first equity permit program earlier this year. It sets aside half of all medical and recreational marijuana business licenses for applications by individuals hit hardest by marijuana criminalization. In their research during the development of the program, Oakland City Council found that over the past two decades, the black community has been extraordinarily over-represented in marijuana-related arrests in the region. In 1998, up to 90 percent of marijuana arrests involved a black suspect. By comparison, just 3.9 percent of those arrested were white. To qualify as an equity applicant, individuals must be an Oakland resident whose annual income is less than 80 percent of the average in the region and either have a previous marijuana conviction or have lived in over-policed areas of the city for 10 of the last 20 years. For those who qualify, the application fee is also waived. City councils in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento are also considering equity programs. Holcombe hopes that local jurisdictions ― and other states that may legalize one day ― give a leg up in the industry to even more people, especially those who don’t have the funds to start a business and who may have a marijuana conviction that makes getting a bank loan difficult. Holcombe said cities could address this through allocating a portion of marijuana sales tax to fund these equity applicants’ start-up businesses while also prioritizing women and minority business applicants.

The state’s marijuana industry already has a projected value of $7 billion, and, as more marijuana retailers obtain permits, state and local governments are expected to collect $1 billion annually in tax revenue. With such an enormous marketplace, California should prioritize access for those who had been targeted by anti-marijuana laws, Erik Altieri, executive director of marijuana policy reform group NORML, told HuffPost. “As states start dialing back their war on marijuana consumers,” Altieri said, “it is important that those who were most negatively impacted by our oppressive prohibition are able to see previous harms remedied as best as possible and be given the opportunity to participate in the benefits that come along with legalization and regulation.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "California Lawmakers Ready To Fight Against Federal Offshore Drilling Plan",
    "text": "Hours after President Donald Trump’s administration unveiled plans to massively expand offshore drilling, California lawmakers announced they’ll re-introduce legislation to block the federal government from doing so ― at least near their shores. Lawmakers in both chambers of the state legislature said Thursday that they’ll bring back a bill that would prohibit the building of infrastructure, including pipelines, related to petroleum development in California waters. It would also bar the renewal, extension or modification of leases to support oil or natural gas production, processing or transportation. The bill would protect the waters up to three miles off California’s coastline. The federal government has jurisdiction beyond that point. The state Senate version is coauthored by Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) and Richard Lara (D-Bell Gardens), while the Assembly version is backed by Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance) and Monique Limón (D-Santa Barbara). “California’s economy thrives because of our environmental protections. The Trump Administration’s reckless decision to open these waters to further oil development represents a step backward into the outdated, dirty and destructive energy policies of the past,” Jackson said in a statement. “It’s more important than ever that we send a strong statement that California will not be open for drilling along our coast, which could devastate our multi-trillion dollar coastal economy, our coastal waters and marine life.” Jackson initially introduced the bill last year, after Trump signed an executive order instructing the Department of the Interior to review regulations on offshore energy development. The legislation died in committee in September amid opposition from the petroleum lobby as well as the California Chamber of Commerce. “The oil industry killed that bill,” Jackson said at the time. “They are far too powerful.” The Trump administration’s draft plan, unveiled by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Thursday, would make approximately 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf available for lease by energy developers. “This is a clear difference between energy weakness and energy dominance,” Zinke said. “And under President Trump, we are going to have the strongest energy policy and become the strongest energy superpower. We certainly have the assets to do that.” The federal announcement was met with swift backlash from coastal state governors and senators, including some Republicans. “I urge Secretary Zinke to recognize the Florida Congressional delegation’s bipartisan efforts to maintain and extend the moratorium in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and remove this area for future planning purposes,” Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said in a statement. Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), a Trump ally, said he had “already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration.” The move also drew condemnation from many top California officials, including Gov. Jerry Brown (D) and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra (D). “Drilling off the shores of California’s coast is a non-starter. Our State has banned offshore drilling for a reason: because we don’t want it and because we know what happens when it goes wrong,” Becerra said in a statement. “We are evaluating all of our options to protect our State’s pristine natural resources.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "California Lawmakers Aim To Improve Warning Systems Before The Next Huge Wildfire Hits",
    "text": "Two Southern California lawmakers said Wednesday that they would introduce several pieces of legislation to improve emergency response, hopefully before the next major wildfire destroys thousands of acres in the fire-prone state. The announcement from state Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson and Assemblymember Monique Limón, both Democrats representing Santa Barbara, follows a series of destructive blazes that hit California last year. The Thomas fire, which burned more than 270,000 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, was the largest recorded blaze in state history. Jackson and Limón aim to address the shortcomings of an emergency alert system meant to forewarn residents of an approaching fire. The lawmakers also seek to improve emergency communications with non-English-speaking residents and to reduce the wildfire risk as new developments are built. With climate change exacerbating extreme weather patterns in California ― including the kind of high temperatures and long periods of drought that create ideal conditions for wildfires ― Jackson said in a statement that the state must fortify its emergency alert system. “Recent California wildfires have driven home how important it is that we have a way to notify people quickly and effectively, so they can leave burning neighborhoods, check in on loved ones, and make the best choices for their safety at any hour of the day or night,” Jackson said. The state senator plans to push a measure to give individual counties the ability to automatically enroll local residents in an emergency notification program that can focus on smaller areas. That would address two flaws in the state’s current network of public warning systems. Right now, many of those systems require residents to opt in, meaning they don’t receive the alerts if they haven’t signed up for them. This was among the problems identified after the deadly Northern California fires in October, which killed 44 people. Multiple survivors of those 21 blazes later said they felt they were inadequately warned. The federal Wireless Emergency Alert system ― which state officials used to send alerts to some 8 million smartphones when the Southern California fires erupted in December ― doesn’t require residents to opt in. But it also isn’t designed to target specific neighborhoods that may be more at risk than others. When the fires began in Northern California in early October, officials in Sonoma County — where over half of the fatalities occurred — decided not to deploy the WEA system. Because the alerts couldn’t be targeted to particular neighborhoods, officials said they were worried about setting off widespread panic and prompting mass evacuations by people who weren’t in immediate danger. Another bill, which Limón plans to introduce, would require that all communications sent out by state and county emergency services be made available in not just the first but the second most spoken language in that area. Language barriers can undermine emergency efforts, the assemblymember said in a release. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

The agency’s expertise could help lower the risk of wildfires to new houses and neighborhoods. “Wildfires can strike anywhere in the state,” Cal Fire deputy chief Scott McLean told HuffPost in December. “It’s not ‘if,’ it’s basically ‘when.’ And it’s not gonna stop.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Billboard announced on Tuesday that the Bronx-born artist achieved the feat on the Hot 100 chart with G-Easy’s “No Limit” ft. A$AP Rocky and Cardi B at No. 4, “MotorSport” by Migos, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B at No. 7 and her debut single “Bodak Yellow (Money Moves)” at No. 10. The rapper is only the third musical act in history to place her first three charted singles in the Top 10 since the Beatles in 1964 and Ashanti in 2002. The artist made history in November by becoming the first woman to chart her first three singles in the top 10 on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs list simultaneously. In September, she also became the first female rapper in 20 years to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with no featured artists with “Bodak Yellow.” The single also earned the star two Grammy nominations. “I’m so proud of myself,” she joked on “The Tonight Show” last month while discussing the success of “Bodak Yellow.” “It feels good because, you know, I really worked my ass off for it and it’s just like [sighs] it finally pays off.” Cardi B’s latest single “Bartier Cardi” debuted at No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

    "text": "Carrie Underwood, who revealed this week that her face required as many as 50 stitches after a November fall that also broke her wrist, “looked great” at a gym last month, a former reality TV star said Tuesday. Adrienne Gang of the yacht crew show “Below Deck” encountered Underwood at a resort and posted a photo of them on Dec. 12. Just worked out next to @carrieunderwood NBD... she is adorable and so gracious... LOVE HER! #BelowDeck pic.twitter.com/scDPGudEe3 “She looked great and seemed to be in great spirits,” Gang told Us Weekly on Tuesday. In an email to HuffPost on Wednesday, Gang added: “I really didn’t notice anything wrong, but I also wasn’t looking for it either.” Underwood, in a message to fans on Monday, disclosed that a tumble down steps outside her Tennessee home in November caused facial injuries and required 40 to 50 stitches. She said she wanted to spare the “gruesome details,” but warned she “might look a bit different” and “I just don’t know how it’s all going to end up.” Gang, however, said Underwood looked fine last month. “I didn’t notice anything amiss on her face,” she told the magazine. “Simply, she looked lovely. She was extremely friendly and gracious.” People noted that Gang reassured fans who responded to the picture on social media that the seven-time Grammy winner looked “amazing.” Gang said she had “no clue” Underwood was injured.

    "text": "Country star Carrie Underwood revealed Monday that there was a lot more to her November accident than a broken wrist. She said her face required 40 to 50 stitches for injuries that have altered her appearance. “Now, here we are 7 weeks later and, even though I’ve had the best people helping me, I’m still healing and not quite looking the same,” Underwood told her fan club in a letter. “I honestly don’t know how things are going to end up ...” The seven-time Grammy winner added that she was bound for the recording studio next week. “And when I am ready to get in front of a camera, I want you all to understand why I might look a bit different,” she wrote. “I’m hoping that, by then, the differences are minimal but, again, I just don’t know how it’s all going to end up.” Underwood, 34, a former “American Idol” winner whose hits include “Before He Cheats,” shared a picture last week with a scarf covering much of her face.

    "title": "Carrie Underwood's Style Through The Years, In Photos",
    "text": "Carrie Underwood’s style has come a long way over the past 13 years. The 34-year-old singer has gone from “American Idol” darling ― she won Season 4 ― to a bona fide country superstar, picking up countless awards along the way. Of course, she’s also walked her fair share of red carpets, giving us almost two decades worth of sartorial choices to look back on. The singer rose to fame in the mid-2000s, and her early wardrobe choices definitely reflected that. Decorative belts? Check. Corsets? Yep. Empire waists? You bet. As she left the early aughts behind, Underwood upped the glam factor, often opting for form-fitting silhouettes with plenty of sheer paneling and a whole lot of sparkle ― one thing she’s always loved. Check out some of Underwood’s most memorable style moments below.

Maria Boyle lightheartedly summed up how some people spend their days off between Christmas and New Year, and how they feel once the festivities conclude, with this doodle: The Christmas Holidays are over. #backtowork pic.twitter.com/eCfQjip2Ix Boyle, a research scientist and part-time illustrator from Dublin, told HuffPost the drawing was “a result of acknowledging my own behavior around Christmas and noticing that others I worked with felt the same.” “The holiday cartoon was pretty much a combination of a few different jokes I made which seemed to resonate with people,” added Boyle, who goes by the @TwistedDoodles handle on Twitter. Many people agreed with Boyle’s interpretation: Soooo accurate - Although I think I may just end up looking at holidays when I get back from work today instead of waiting until tomorrow :P #backtowork That's about right 😂 Others also lamented their return to work: First day back at work... can barely keep my eyes open. pic.twitter.com/9SkBImFggI The tired old me from 2017 has to go back to work today. 😑 We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "CBS News Fires Political Director Over 'Inappropriate Behavior'",
    "text": "CBS News fired political director Steve Chaggaris on Wednesday after allegations of what the network called “inappropriate behavior.” CBS News staffers were informed of Chaggaris’ firing on Wednesday evening, according to CNN. The veteran journalist was named political director in March 2017 and oversaw coverage of Donald Trump’s administration. He joined CBS News in 1999 and, after leaving briefly in 2010, was rehired in 2012. “In the last two weeks, accounts of inappropriate behavior by Steve Chaggaris were brought to our attention and were immediately investigated,” a CBS spokesperson said in a statement to HuffPost. “As a result, CBS News has severed ties with Mr. Chaggaris for violating company policy, effective immediately.” CBS, in its own report of Chaggaris’ ouster, reiterated the importance of staffers speaking up about workplace sexual harassment. “In light of recent highly publicized harassment cases, CBS and other big media companies told staffers how important it is to report instances of all types of improper behavior to human resources or managers,” the network said in its report. Chaggaris couldn’t be reached for comment, and his Twitter handle was recently deleted. The firing comes six weeks after Charlie Rose, PBS host and co-anchor of “CBS This Morning,” was fired after accusations of sexual harassment and groping. Other prominent men in media ― including former “Today” show co-host Matt Lauer and MSNBC senior political analyst Mark Halperin ― have recently been fired amid the wave of women speaking up in the #MeToo movement. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the year Chaggaris became CBS’s political director. He took the role in 2017.

    "title": "Houses Of Worship Damaged By Natural Disasters Can Now Receive FEMA Aid",
    "text": "It just got a lot easier for houses of worship and other religious institutions to receive federal aid after a disaster hits. On Tuesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency released a new policy guide stating that eligibility for federal disaster relief will no longer rest on whether a facility is used primarily for religious purposes. Specifically, “private nonprofit houses of worship will not be singled out for disfavored treatment within the community centers subcategory,” Alex Amparo, FEMA’s assistant administrator for recovery, wrote in the manual’s foreword. Prior to the policy change, churches and other houses of worship damaged in a disaster could receive FEMA grants if the funds were applied to schools, health care centers or other facilities not used primarily for religious purposes. They were also eligible to receive U.S. Small Business Administration loans to repair damaged buildings and reimbursement from local governments if they had sheltered evacuees. But religious sanctuary spaces were not eligible for federal aid. Faith leaders and constitutional advocates have long debated whether FEMA’s policy should change. Many religious groups and others, including President Donald Trump, argue that denying disaster aid to houses of worship constitutes religious discrimination under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment. Churches in Texas should be entitled to reimbursement from FEMA Relief Funds for helping victims of Hurricane Harvey (just like others). But groups like Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the Interfaith Alliance contend that providing such federal assistance to religious institutions would violate the separation of church and state. The new FEMA policy raises very serious constitutional questions by appearing to authorize problematic tax aid to churches. We'll be looking into this. https://t.co/KElhQR4Cng Courts haven’t drawn a clear line on church-state separation either. The FEMA guide cites the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2017 decision in Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer, centered on a Missouri church denied state funds to improve its day care playground. The court ruled in favor of the church, which had sued the state’s natural resources department for religious discrimination. But when three Texas churches affected by Hurricane Harvey sued FEMA over its previous policy, a U.S. district court denied the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the federal agency was not obligated to fund repairs to religious spaces.

    "title": "Climate Change Has Quadrupled Ocean 'Dead Zones,' Researchers Warn",
    "text": "The size of oxygen-starved ocean “dead zones,” where plants and animals struggle to survive, has increased fourfold around the world, according to a new scientific analysis. The growth of the zones is yet another consequence of global warming — including increasing ocean temperatures — triggered by greenhouse gases and, closer to the coasts, contamination by agricultural runoff and sewage. “Rising nutrient loads coupled with climate change — each resulting from human activities — are changing ocean biogeochemistry and increasing oxygen consumption,” says the study published in the journal Science. Ultimately, such changes are “unsustainable and may result in ecosystem collapses, which ultimately will cause societal and economic harm.” The analysis of the oxygen-starved zones was conducted by a team of scientists from the Global Oxygen Network (GONE), created in 2016 by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations. Researchers determined that open-ocean “oxygen-minimum” zones have expanded since 1950 by an area roughy equivalent to the size of the European Union. The volume of ocean water completely devoid of oxygen has more than quadrupled in that time, the study found. The number of hypoxic, or oxygen depleted, zones along coasts has increased up to 10 times, from less than 50 to 500. Denise Breitburg, a marine ecologist at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and lead author of the study, called the plunge in ocean oxygen “among the most serious effects of human activities on the Earth’s environment.” Oxygen is “fundamental to life in the oceans,” she said in a statement. “If you can’t breathe, nothing else matters,” Breitburg told The Associated Press. “As seas are losing oxygen, those areas are no longer habitable by many organisms.” But the threat isn’t just to life in the oceans, which account for about half of the oxygen on the planet. “Major extinction events in Earth’s history have been associated with warm climates and oxygen-deficient oceans,” the study warns. Consequences for ocean life can be significant even in areas where oxygen is merely low. Sea life may be stunted and immune responses impaired in such areas, resulting in poor survival rates and a decrease in healthy diversity, scientists warn. The scientists recommend salvaging oxygen-starved areas by tackling climate change and nutrient pollution, focusing on protecting particularly vulnerable sea life with no-catch or no-fishing zones, and increasing and improving surveillance of areas where oxygen is plummeting. Breitburg concedes that addressing global warming can seem daunting, but she says focused local efforts to protect areas can be effective. She points to changes in the Chesapeake Bay, where nitrogen pollution dropped 24 percent from its worst levels after sewage treatment and protections mandated by the Clean Air Act began. Areas of the bay with zero oxygen zones have nearly vanished, according to Breitburg. Even with “ambitious emission reductions,” however, numerical models project “further oxygen declines during the 21st century,” the study warns.

    "title": "Coastal Protection: A Bipartisan Moment For Resistance?",
    "text": "By proposing to give the oil industry absolute priority over the rest of society, and open 90 percent of America’s coastal waters to oil drilling, the Trump Administration and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke run the risk of opening an entirely new environmental battle front – this time in a theater with a critical mass of Republican allies teed up to oppose the administration. All the way back to the Reagan Administration in 1981, whenever Republican administrations have tried to force oil drilling down the throats of coastal communities outside already oil dependent regions like the Gulf of Mexico and parts of Alaska, those communities have fought back – whether red, purple or blue. And where local Republicans didn’t join the fight against coastal oil, they have paid a political price, as the once Republican sections of coastal California turned solidly blue most spectacularly demonstrate. But no previous president has picked as big and broad a battle, or one likely to trigger more massive opposition – at a time when big oil’s national popular standing is lower than it has ever been. (For the first-time private polling shows that a majority of Americans think the disadvantages of relying on oil as an energy source exceed the advantages.) And none has done so with such cavalier indifference to offering at least a fig-leaf that the drilling would be carefully regulated and adequate resources guaranteed to clean up the inevitable spills. For the Republicans, the politics of this (if not the fund-raising) look very bad. The first leasing under Zinke’s plan will not come until 2019 – just in time to inject the drilling issue into the presidential race, but not in time to reap any economic benefits from drilling investments. The entire intervening period will be filled with a host of procedural steps, environmental assessments, state and local legal challenges, all spiced up, most probably, with oil spills from existing drilling operations. This is a fantastic environment for a political mobilization. Presidentially Florida is clearly the prize target – but for the House and Senate the important geography is much broader. We don’t actually need to wait for 2020 for the politics to play out. Leaving out Alaska and the Gulf Coast states, there are 31 Republican Congressional districts impacted by off-shore drilling ― mostly won in 2016 by relatively or moderately close margins. The coasts are purple or pink ― not scarlet. In 2018 mid-terms the Democrats need to gain only 24 seats to capture the House. A recent Cook Report listing the 27 most swing Republican House districts, tagged 17 in OCS impacted, anti-drilling geographies. If the OCS issue heats up enough to push additional, currently safe seeming coastal Republican districts in Florida, South Carolina and North Carolina into play, it could significantly alter the battle for control of the House. Indeed, OCS issues almost tipped control of the Virginia House of Delegates; otherwise moderate Republican and incumbent David Yancey supported oil drilling, and ended up retaining his seat only by the luck of the draw, after a tie vote – if he had lost one vote, or the coin flip, Democrats and Republicans would have had to share control of the legislature. There were four other coastally oriented Virginia legislative races in which Republicans prevailed by less than 5 percent ― meaning that with Trump drilling heating up the ballot in two years, Democrats have even more opportunities to regain control. Media coverage has focused on the predictable opposition from the Governors of California, Oregon and Washington, plus the flip-flop from drilling support to opposition by Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott (whose state actually has more remaining legally protected coastal areas than any other). But what is utterly different this time is that not only the West Coast and New England but almost the entire Southern and Mid-Atlantic coast is likely to rise – in addition to Florida, the Governors of South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, (four of them Republicans) have already opposed drilling – a major shift from the divided reaction to Barack Obama’s original Atlantic drilling proposals, withdrawn because of such local opposition. Only Georgia has yet to oppose. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Log in to hide these messages. The administration has provided its opponents with ample ammunition by stripping its policies of even the pretenses of basic environmental standards, spill-protection and clean up funding. On the same day Zinke announced the leasing the press revealed that the Interior Department had abandoned a series of environmental best-practices governing leasing and other activities. Two weeks earlier the Department had cancelled a National Academy of Sciences study on the risks of drilling. Congressional Republicans allowed funding for the oil spill clean-up fund to expire, in order to give the oil industry a $500 million tax break. Rules designed to avoid a repetition of the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill have been rolled back. This is an enormous opportunity for the environmental movement to broaden its role in the resistance to Trump. Opposition to Trump’s climate denialism has garnered enormous support, bubbling up from cities, businesses and states – but climate remains, by and large, a tribal partisan marker, leaving Republicans unmoved. As a result, environmentalists have yet to demonstrate the ability to reach across the partisan divide in mobilization opposition to Trump. The assault on the coasts could turn out to be a major blunder by the administration, precisely because it creates a bipartisan window of resistance. This is easier, because previous successful anti-drilling campaigns – California from the 1980s on, or the Atlantic Coast under Obama – have created a clear template – organize locally, lead with coastal dependent businesses, and find ways to enable people to become actively engaged in the campaign in the community, not just on line. Environmentalists have recently done this kind of organizing very successfully, with a broad diversity of allies, against pipelines in Nebraska and the Dakotas. But can we make coastal protection once again a national movement, from Maine and Washington to Florida? We won’t be handed many chances this good, however clumsy the President continues to be.

Happy New Year, everybody. Trump fired Comey in May, months after Comey said he and the president had an “uneasy” conversation in which the president demanded his “loyalty.” Comey also testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that Trump asked him to end the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn has since pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russian officials. Trump has denied that he asked Comey for his loyalty or asked him to drop the Flynn investigation. The president called Comey a “nut job” while meeting with Russian officials in the Oval Office the day after the firing, The New York Times reported.

    "text": "Last year was the safest on record for commercial jetliners, several industry groups reported. According to the Aviation Safety Network, no one died in 2017 due to an aviation accident aboard a commercial passenger jet. For trips made by cargo and commercial turboprop planes, there were 10 accidents in 2017 that resulted in 44 onboard fatalities and 35 on the ground. The most recent incident included in those numbers was the Dec. 31 crash in Costa Rica that killed 12 people, including 10 American tourists. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred shortly after takeoff. It was the deadliest such accident in Costa Rica since 1990. For the past two decades, there has been a downward trend in accidents and fatalities in the airline industry. “Since 1997, the average number of airliner accidents has shown a steady and persistent decline, for a great deal thanks to the continuing safety-driven efforts by international aviation organizations,” Harro Ranter, president of the Aviation Safety Network, said in a statement. The agency also noted that as of Dec. 31, the world had gone 398 days without a passenger jet accident, and 792 days since a civil aircraft accident had killed more than 100 people. The last fatal crash of a passenger plane in the United States involving a U.S.-certified airline occurred in February 2009, when a flight operated by Colgan Air crashed in New York, Reuters reported. Forty-nine people were killed onboard and one person on the ground died. A separate airline monitoring agency, the Dutch group To70, estimated that there was just one fatal accident for every 16 million flights. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mistakenly stated that the last fatal passenger jet crash involving a U.S. certified airline occurred in February 2009. In fact, that was the most recent passenger airplane crash, but the plane was not a jet. Additionally, separate incident involving an Asiana Airlines plane in San Francisco resulted in three deaths in 2013, but that airline is not a U.S. certified air carrier.

    "title": "Cop Stops Erykah Badu On NYE To 'Say Hi'",
    "text": "Musician Erykah Badu says she got quite the New Year’s Eve surprise from a Dallas cop who pulled her over just to “say hi.” The “Window Seat” singer shared a video on Instagram showing her sitting in a car with the flashing blue and red lights of a police cruiser behind her. “And why are you pulling me over,” she asks officers in the video. “Because I wanted to say hi,” one cop, who is black, says with a laugh. “Hi,” Badu responds, looking unfazed. Then she bursts out laughing. A post shared by THE UNICORN (@erykahbadu) on Dec 31, 2017 at 8:06pm PST “WTF BABYLON !! HAPPY NEW YEAERZZZZ!” she captioned the video. Some people on Instagram said they don’t blame the officer for wanting to meet the acclaimed artist. “I’m sorry my crazy ass would do the same thing. I don’t blame him 😂😂😂😩🙌🏽😩 You are the queen!!” one person commented. Though Badu and others found humor in the incident, others didn’t see the officer’s move as amusing.

    "title": "As Mass Coral Bleaching Occurs More Frequently, Hopes For Recovery Fade, Study Finds",
    "text": "Mass coral bleaching events are happening far more frequently than in the past, giving some of the world’s most majestic and fragile ecosystems almost no time to recover, according to a new paper published Thursday in the journal Science. A team of researchers analyzed rates of coral bleaching around the tropics over the past four decades, events that most often occur when seawater becomes too warm for coral to remain healthy. Scientists discovered that in the 1980s, severe coral bleaching events occurred only about once every 25 to 30 years. But, in the six years after 2010, the rate between bleachings plummeted, and mass events now occur about once every six years. “Before the 1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of, even during strong El Niño conditions, but now repeated bouts of regional-scale bleaching and mass mortality of corals has become the new normal around the world as temperatures continue to rise,” Terry Hughes, the study’s lead author and the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia, said in a statement. The paper warns that climate change could eventually lead to such events every year. While reefs that bleach ― so named because once-colorful corals turn white ― aren’t immediately killed, many of the creatures die in the intervening days and weeks. A mass bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 left up to two-thirds of parts of the reef dead, and a back-to-back event in 2017 left some scientists in shock. Some corals, however, are able to recover if ocean temperatures return to normal and they’re given enough time to build up their health. But it usually takes 10 to 15 years for the fastest-growing species to recover, the paper states, and “far longer for the full complement” on a reef. The shorter time-frame between mass bleachings reported in the paper makes such recovery increasingly difficult, the authors write, and our rapidly warming world doesn’t seem likely to give corals a respite. Scientists have long said the world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, or about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. And if greenhouse gas emissions ― the prime driver of global warming and, in turn, coral bleaching ― remain unchecked, warming will skyrocket. “Reefs have entered a distinctive human-dominated era ― the Anthropocene,” Mark Eakin, a co-author of the paper and a reef scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said in a statement. “The climate has warmed rapidly in the past 50 years, first making El Niños dangerous for corals, and now we’re seeing the emergence of bleaching in every hot summer.” The paper concludes on a somber note and urges global action to address climate change. “Our analysis indicates that we are already approaching a scenario in which every hot summer, with or without an El Niño event, has the potential to cause bleaching and mortality at a regional scale,” the authors write. “The future condition of reefs, and the ecosystem services they provide to people, will depend critically on the trajectory of global emissions.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "text": "In a frank Twitter exchange this week, acclaimed comedy writer Megan Ganz took former boss and “Community” creator Dan Harmon to task for his unprofessional behavior, and possible misconduct, in the workplace. On New Year’s Eve, Harmon, who also co-created “Rick and Morty,” tweeted about 2017 being the “Year of the Asshole. Myself included.” Responding to the tweet, Ganz, who was a writer for “Community” from 2010 to 2013, pushed her former boss to “be more specific.” “Redemption follows allocution,” she wrote. Ganz’s comment sparked a conversation between the former colleagues which, while oblique, hinted at inappropriate behavior and possible harassment. In Harmon’s follow-up tweets to Ganz, he expressed “regret” for “abusing my position” and “treating you like garbage.” Ganz described how the alleged incident or incidents with Harmon diminished her belief in her own talent and eroded her trust in others. She concluded the exchange with this piece of advice: “It’s good to recognize power dynamics, but it’s also good to recognize you’re no different from those you employ. You’re not a king on a hilltop, nor a beast in a labyrinth. Isolation isn’t always best. Connection breeds empathy. Empathy allows growth.” Ganz was later praised by netizens for her courage in challenging Harmon. “We lift each other up!” she replied.

    "title": "Top Talent Agency Cuts Ties With Danny Masterson Amid Rape Allegations",
    "text": "The United Talent Agency, a top Hollywood agency, has cut ties with longtime client actor Danny Masterson, who is facing multiple rape allegations. The news comes a month after Netflix fired him from “The Ranch.” Masterson co-starred in and co-produced the show with actor Ashton Kutcher, whom he previously starred alongside on the sitcom “That ’70s Show.” In response to a request for comment, the agency, which has represented the actor for 20 years, said, “UTA no longer represents Danny Masterson.” A source familiar with Masterson’s relationship with UTA said the decision to cut ties was made some time back. HuffPost first learned of the news from a source close to Masterson. The Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office have been conducting an investigation into multiple allegations of rape against Masterson for almost a year. Four women have accused Masterson of violently raping them in the early 2000s. Three of the women were members of the Church of Scientology; Masterson is a prominent Scientologist. Masterson has denied all allegations of rape and said the encounters in question were consensual.

Masterson was ostensibly fired by Netflix (a network spokesperson said he was written off the show “The Ranch”) after a Netflix executive told one of the women that top company brass did not believe Masterson’s accusers. The executive, Andy Yeatman, revealed the alleged opinion of company executives after the woman asked him why Masterson was allowed to star on one of their shows while facing multiple rape allegations. Yeatman did not know the woman was a Masterson accuser when he told her the victims were not seen as credible. Netflix confirmed at the time of the report that Yeatman made the comments. “Mr. Yeatman’s comments were careless, uninformed and do not represent the views of the company,” the company said. Yeatman was also later fired by Netflix. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "text": "Dave Chappelle  is feeling the heat for poking fun at the sexual misconduct allegations against Kevin Spacey. In “The Bird Revelation,” Chappelle’s Netflix special that debuted Sunday, the 44-year-old comedian references a number of high-profile scandals, including the sexual assault accusations that actor Anthony Rapp has made against Spacey. “Wow, I mean it is really bad out here,” Chappelle says, according to The Daily Beast. “Kevin Spacey’s out here, grabbing men by the pussy! I didn’t even know that was possible!” Rapp first accused Spacey of misconduct during an interview with BuzzFeed in October. He said Spacey made an unwanted sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986, when Spacey was 26 and Rapp was 14. In the special, Chappelle notes that Rapp “grew up to be gay anyway,” and that “Kevin Spacey sniffed that shit out like a truffle pig.” “I’ve been to a lot of parties in my day. Never been to a good one that had 14-year-old boys in it,” Chappelle says. “All joking aside, Kevin Spacey shouldn’t have done that shit to that kid. He was 14 years old and forced to carry a grown man’s secret for 30 years.” But then he makes one more joke at Rapp’s expense. “The saddest part is, if he had been able to carry that secret for another six months, I would get to know how ‘House of Cards’ ends,” he says. Comedians Norm MacDonald, Donnell Rawlings and Adam Devine defended Chappelle to TMZ, but the jokes about Spacey have angered some viewers. He was a child. He was taken advantage of by an adult. He was ABUSED! Educate yourself, then go find your morals. #disgustedbyignorance ‘He grew up gay anyway': Dave Chappelle on Anthony Rapp allegationshttps://t.co/yZaUD0e0VL Oh God. Seriously @DaveChappelle did you say this? 😞😒 https://t.co/fNeUcPXuvS dave chappelle's take on louis ck and kevin spacey's misdemeanours is utterly disgraceful and normalises sexual abuse extensively. he is a fence-sitter and also a rape apologist who simply profits off all those victims after shamelessly trivialising their ordeals 🖕 Chappelle has sparked controversy in the LGBTQ community before. During his residency at New York’s Radio City Music Hall last year, the comedian cracked jokes about Caitlyn Jenner and President Donald Trump’s attempt to ban trans recruits from the military. Chappelle dismissed accusations of transphobia during an August interview with The Washington Blade. “I’m not an obstructionist of anybody’s lifestyle,” he said, “as long as it doesn’t hurt me or people I love, and I don’t believe that lifestyle does.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Dave Chappelle Makes Fun Of Louis C.K. Accuser In New Netflix Special",
    "text": "Dave Chappelle seems to think sexual misconduct allegations against fellow comedian Louis C.K. are funny. In his new Netflix special, “The Bird Revelation,” which premiered on New Year’s Eve, Chappelle tackles high-profile scandals that have rocked the culture, and says the allegations against Louis C.K. were “the only ones that made me laugh.” “It’s terrible, I know it’s terrible,” the 44-year-old comedian says, per The Daily Beast. “Ladies, you are right. But at the same time, Jesus Christ, they took everything from Louis. I think it might be disproportionate. I can’t tell. This is where it’s hard to be man.” Louis C.K. acknowledged his sexual misconduct in November after five women accused him of unwanted advances. Chappelle takes aim at Abby Schachner, one of the accusers, saying the once-aspiring comedian had a “brittle-ass spirit.” “One lady said, ‘Louis C.K. masturbated in front of me, ruined my comedy dreams,’” Chappelle says in the bit, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “Word?’ Well then I dare say, madam, you may have never had a dream. Come on man, that’s a brittle spirit. That is a brittle-ass spirit, that is too much, this grown-ass woman.” But Chappelle didn’t stop there. “I know that sounds fucked up, I’m not supposed to say that, but one of these ladies was like, ‘Louis C.K. was masturbating while I was on the phone with him,’” Chappelle said. “Bitch, you don’t know how to hang up a phone? How the fuck are you going to survive in show business if this is an actual obstacle to your dreams?” Schachner told the New York Times that the 2003 experience in which Louis C.K. masturbated while talking to her on the phone left her dumbfounded.

    "text": "David Bowie’s cultural legacy continues. The legendary musician’s son, movie director Duncan Jones, has launched an online book club in honor of his late father. Bowie died at age 69 in January 2016 following an 18-month struggle with cancer. “My dad was a beast of a reader,” Jones tweeted last week. “I’ve been feeling a building sense of duty to go on the same literary marathon in tribute to dad.” Jones then revealed that the first book the “Bowie Book Club” discusses would be English author Peter Ackroyd’s 1985 crime novel Hawskmoor. Alright gang! Anyone who wants to join along, we are reading Peter Ackroyd’s “Hawksmoor,” as an amuse cerveau before we get into the heavy stuff. You have until Feb 1. ❤️ It would be “an amuse cerveau before we get into the heavy stuff,” Jones joked, adding that people had until Feb. 1 to read it. Membership of the club appears to be free and flexible. Jones told one tweeter who asked how to join that the person “just did,” indicating it was open to anyone on Twitter who wanted to read and then discuss the book. Bowie’s official website revealed his “Top 100 Books” in 2013. Hawksmoor appeared on the list, alongside other illustrious titles such as The Brief Wondrous Life Of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz, The Stranger by Albert Camus, and On The Road by Jack Kerouac.

    "text": "David Clarke, the Trump-supporting former Milwaukee County sheriff, was temporarily barred from posting on Twitter this week after complaints about tweets encouraging violence against the media. Clarke’s Twitter account was locked and placed in “read-only mode” after other Twitter users complained about three tweets promoting violence, CNN reported Tuesday. Twitter reinstated the account after those tweets were deleted, according to BuzzFeed News. Clarke’s account, with the tweets removed, resumed tweeting on Tuesday. Clarke, a vociferous supporter of President Donald Trump who resigned as Milwaukee sheriff in August, wrote in one tweet about making the media “taste their own blood.” “When LYING LIB MEDIA makes up FAKE NEWS to smear me, the ANTIDOTE is to go right at them. Punch them in the nose,” Clarke wrote, sharing an image of two wrestlers, with his face and Trump’s face superimposed on them, attacking another wrestler labeled “CNN.” That tweet has since been deleted, as has this follow-up tweet in which Clarke boasted about “winning against lying lib media and whiny snowflakes.” “Diaper wearing lefty didn’t like my metaphor reference to punching LYING LIB MEDIA in the nose. Twitter said no violation. Duh,” Clarke wrote. A person on Twitter who had lodged a complaint against Clarke told CNN that Twitter replied by saying Clarke’s account had been locked temporarily because it had “violated” the company’s rules, which explicitly bars “specific threats of violence.” Twitter confirmed the authenticity of the email, but didn’t elaborate on Clarke’s tweeting ban, which was enforced after several other reported complaints in recent days. Clarke said on Sunday that “two UNFOUNDED Twitter complaints” had been made against him. On Saturday, he boasted that a “snowflake lib” had flagged one of his posts, but Twitter had contacted him to say that the tweet didn’t violate any rules. “I know I’m winning,” Clarke wrote at the time. I know I’m winning. Some snowflake lib made a complaint to Twitter because of my earlier tweet about black kids being exploited by lefty failed policies at Ballou High School. I said in my tweet, this CRAP is criminal. Twitter said no violation of rules. Diaper change time. pic.twitter.com/ayf7hGGfgQ This meme epitomizes the attitude of the LYING LIB MEDIA and their goon liberal followers. Two UNFOUNDED twitter complaints were made yesterday against me as I PUNKED THEM OUT for a drive-by hit job they did with FAKE NEWS. When they get hit back they run to mommy to whine. pic.twitter.com/RbHQdv0Zj5 As of Tuesday, Clarke, who as sheriff faced repeated allegations that inmates in his jails were mistreated, was back on Twitter and actively tweeting. Clarke declared that he would not be “intimidated into silence.” I will NOT be Intimidated into silence by LYING LIB MEDIA. I will NOT be intimidated by LIBERAL hyper partisan government HACKS who weaponize government authorirty to go after people whose views they don't like.

The host is set to interview Hollywood stars George Clooney and Tina Fey, Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai, hip-hop mogul Jay-Z and radio host Howard Stern in subsequent episodes that will be released on a monthly basis. The trailer doesn’t indicate what Letterman and Obama will talk about, but it’s possible the current administration will be a hot topic on the series considering Letterman has spoken out against President Donald Trump. Letterman quit “The Late Show” in 2015 following a 22-year run. Obama appeared on the show eight times while he was in office.

    "title": "Deep-Freeze Forecast Threatens South With Beach Snow",
    "text": "The forecast calls for up to three inches of snow, a winter storm watch, and a wind chill in the neighborhood of 9 degrees. Welcome to ― Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. As a mass of frigid air settles across much of the central and eastern U.S., residents farther south, unaccustomed to such wintry weather, are dealing with the unwelcome holiday guest as well. In South Carolina, that means likely snow on the beaches late Tuesday night and early Wednesday: Our latest forecast snow amounts for tomorrow. Most areas should see at least some snowfall but the heaviest amounts should be near and east of I-95, especially near Charleston. https://t.co/pOIntHC05V #scwx #gawx #chswx #savwx pic.twitter.com/SstSJ0SEDy Should the forecast hold, it will be the first time Myrtle Beach has seen at least three inches of snow since 2010. Even regions as far south as Jacksonville, Florida, could see snow on Wednesday. Farther west, residents in Dallas aren’t expected to see a temperature above freezing until midweek. Tuesday morning’s lows in the city were in the upper teens, with the day’s high projected to be 32 degrees. Cold has settled across much of the country, with 90 percent of the U.S. failing to top 32 degrees on New Year’s Day, CNN notes. Aided by what Louisiana forecasters are calling a “nor’easter-type system,” New Orleans approached record lows Tuesday, tying a 1984 record for 25 degrees at the Louis Armstrong International Airport. New Orleans’ historical averages for the month are a low of 47 degrees, and a high of 62. The cold is taking a toll beyond just frozen pipes, slick roads and dead car batteries. Authorities blame at least nine deaths on the cold, The Associated Press reported Tuesday. In Atlanta, where overnight lows will be in the teens all week, homeless advocates worry residents who sleep on the street could be caught off guard.

    "title": "Demi Lovato Felt Insecure, But Posted This Bathing Suit Photo Anyway",
    "text": "Demi Lovato might not always feel as confident as her hit song suggests, but that isn’t stopping her from living her best life on a beach somewhere. While the East Coast of the U.S. get pounded by heavy snow, the “Tell Me You Love Me” singer escaped to the warmth for some sand and sun. On Thursday, Lovato posted a photo of herself frolicking on a beach in a one-piece black-and-white-striped bathing suit. “So, I’m insecure about my legs in this picture but I’m posting it because I look so happy and this year I’ve decided I’m letting go of my perfectionism and embracing freedom from self criticism,” she captioned the photo. A post shared by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) on Jan 4, 2018 at 5:16am PST “Learning to love my body the way it is is challenging but life changing. Giving up my eating disorder has been the most challenging journey of my life but I work every day towards solid recovery even if I mess up sometimes,” she continued. “Today I’m feeling strong. You all can do it too. It IS possible. Thank you God for this new chapter in my life.” Lovato has long been open about her struggles with an eating disorder ― something she shares with both her mother and grandmother ― and sought treatment in 2010 to deal with “emotional and physical issues.” She’s been on the path to self-acceptance since then, dropping body-positive anthems and encouraging her legions of fans to discard toxic beauty standards. In October, she shared side-by-side photos of herself with her followers on Instagram. One photo is from what looks like her Disney Channel days, when the star says she experienced bullying. The photo had the caption, “Recovery is possible.” In her powerful YouTube documentary “Simply Complicated,” released last year, Lovato opened up about relapsing in the wake of her breakup with actor Wilmer Valderrama. The couple announced their split in June 2016. “When I do have moments when I slip up, I feel very ashamed,” the pop star said. “I don’t want to give it the power that it controls my every thought, but it’s something that I’m constantly thinking about,” she continued. “Body image, what I wish I could be eating, what I wish I could be eating next, what I wish I didn’t eat, you know, it’s just constant.” Watch the documentary below.

    "text": "The Colorado state Capitol in Denver was placed under a brief lockdown Thursday afternoon as police respond to shots fired near the government building. The shooting occurred off Capitol grounds at a nearby park, Trooper Gary Cutler of the Colorado State Patrol told HuffPost. The CSP is in charge of security at the Capitol. A spokesman for the Denver Police Department confirmed the shooting to HuffPost, but did not have further details immediately available. The lockdown at the Capitol was lifted shortly after 2 p.m. local time. Panoramic of crime scene from north steps of Capitol. Shooting happened just outside this entrance. pic.twitter.com/DTho8l1Y7F Witnesses told CBS 4 Denver that they saw a person pull a gun and fire at a car while walking on Colfax Avenue near the Capitol. That car reportedly returned fire. There was a large police presence along Colfax Avenue and Sherman Street adjacent to the legislature building shortly after the shooting. Large emergency response. #Denver Capital shooting. pic.twitter.com/QrcJN8OIU9 Scott Reed, assistant general manager of communications for Denver’s Regional Transportation District, told HuffPost the suspect may have attempted to flee the scene by boarding a nearby bus. Denver police held the bus at the scene to retrieve video footage of that moment, according to Reed. Joshua Crews, 36, told The Denver Post he heard about a dozen shots fired as he was waiting to get on the East Colfax Bus on Colfax Avenue and North Broadway Street. He then boarded the bus, which was later stopped by police. “The cops wanted to see everybody’s hands,” Crews told the Post. “There was a guy down... there was a shooter on the bus.” A 15L bus is stopped in the eastbound lanes of Colfax. It’s empty. Only vehicle in stretch from Grant to Lincoln. Lots of police. pic.twitter.com/dcXnuwFN5O Denver police said there was no longer any threat to the area after 2:30 p.m., but it was unclear whether police had taken the shooter into custody.

    "title": "Did Your Ex Text You This Christmas? There's A Name For That",
    "text": "If you got an out-of-the-blue text from an ex while drinking eggnog ’round the Christmas tree this week, you’re not alone. Hearing from ghosts of romantic partners past around the holidays is actually so common it has a name: Marleying. In case you don’t catch the reference, Marleying gets it’s name from Marley, the stingy late business partner of Scrooge in “A Christmas Carol.” It was coined by online dating website eHarmony after the company surveyed more than 4,000 British adults and asked whether they had gotten a text from an ex around the holidays. The study found that 11 percent of singles surveyed have been Marleyed, while 8 percent have contacted an ex themselves. But why does this happen more during this time of year? Experts say it’s a mix of nostalgia, loneliness and opportunity. “The end of the year makes many people feel introspective,” Erika Martinez, Psy.D, licensed psychologist, told Bustle. “It’s not unusual for exes to reach out since they’ve been reminiscing and feeling nostalgic. This is especially true when there’s more possibility of connecting as people return home for the holidays.” Although this data was taken from just people in the U.K., it’s not too difficult to believe that it happens in the U.S., too. After all, we’re not above a nostalgia hookup with an old flame. A U.S.-based survey of 1,000 people from Trojan earlier this year found that 60 percent planned on having casual sex while they were home for the holidays, and one third of those people planned to hit up an ex. Of course, that doesn’t mean everyone is looking forward to rekindling an old romance. If you’ve been Marleyed or plan on getting in touch with an ex over the next few days, remember that it’s okay for anyone to refuse to meet up. “Just because you are at home visiting your old haunts, doesn’t necessarily mean you should feel compelled to haunt a former partner,” Rachael Lloyd from eHarmony told Mashable. ″Though some people are happy to reconnect with an ex over Christmas, it’s important to ensure you are both on the same page to avoid confusion or hurt.” By: Kasandra Brabaw Related: How To Divvy Up Finances In A Long Term Relationship Related: Why I Regret Plucking My Unibrow Related: How The End Of Net Neutrality Will Affect You Related: Meet The Coolest 7-Year-Old On Instagram Related: Here’s What People Who Get Raises & Promotions Always Do By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "text": "If you ever need to grill Sean “Diddy” Combs for information, just put him on Ellen DeGeneres’ couch: He’ll open right up. Diddy appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” Wednesday with “The Four” cast, and revealed that he had once been secretly engaged. The hip-hop mogul initially tried to play it cool during a game of “Never Have I Ever,” but soon cracked under pressure. “I ain’t gonna lie, it was like for four hours,” Diddy told DeGeneres after she asked her guests whether they’d ever been engaged and kept it a secret. “It was for four hours, I honestly did.” “You kept it a secret for four hours, or you were engaged for four hours?” DeGeneres asked. “I was engaged for four hours,” Diddy replied. “And I kept it a secret forever — until now.” Diddy’s engagement may have been six times shorter than the lifespan of a mayfly, but his love life is looking up. The father of six has been dating singer Cassie on and off for several years, and he told People in June that he was “in love.” For more juicy scoops on Diddy’s personal life, you might just have to wait for his next “Ellen” appearance.

    "title": "Dogs Left Outside In The Cold Have Died And Been Found ‘Frozen Solid’",
    "text": "The brutal cold that’s believed to be responsible for at least 11 human deaths this week is also taking a toll on animals — particularly pets left outside in the frigid weather. On Thursday, a woman in Hartford, Connecticut, was arrested and charged with animal cruelty after police say a young pit bull chained outside her home was found “frozen solid,” the Hartford Courant reports. Police said the deceased dog was malnourished and covered in feces. Earlier this week, Detroit Dog Rescue announced it was searching for a man who had abandoned a Pomeranian mix in a cage in front of the Michigan nonprofit’s facility at night, when the shelter was closed. The dog did not survive the night. Temperatures were so cold that fleas stuck to the dog’s body, according to ClickOnDetroit. And last week, a dog named Nanas was found dead in Toledo, Ohio, curled up on the porch of a home. “She was frozen solid,” Megan Brown, cruelty investigator with the Toledo Area Humane Society, told The Toledo Blade. In that case, the dog’s owner told the Blade that he was not living in the home — where the utilities had been turned off — but was keeping his two dogs there. He said that he had last seen them two or three days before Nanas was found dead and that he didn’t know how she could have gotten outside. The second dog, Haze, was inside the house. Though malnourished, he is expected to be OK. The Washington Post notes that at least four similar dog deaths occurred in Ohio over the past couple of weeks. Animal welfare organizations are also seeing significant upticks in reports of cruelty. Detroit Dog Rescue said on Facebook Tuesday that over a period of three days, it had received more than 600 calls, emails and online messages about dogs in distress. New Orleans station Fox 8 reported Tuesday that the Louisiana SPCA’s phones were “ringing off the hook” with reports of pets left outside in the cold. Indianapolis Animal Care Services said that it had received 264 calls about animals in the cold over New Year’s weekend alone and that the calls have continued to pour in, leading to response times that can be longer than a day. The weather driving those types of calls is only supposed to get worse in the eastern United States, as a powerful winter storm continues to barrage the region with snow and temperatures that could shatter historical cold records in some areas. Though many dogs enjoy playing in the snow, animal welfare groups note generally that if it’s too cold for you outside, it’s too cold for your pet to be outside for very long. If dogs are remaining outdoors for more than walks and bathroom breaks, Best Friends Animal Society notes that they need warm, insulated dog houses that are raised up off the ground and always have dry bedding. And if you care for outdoor cats who can’t be brought inside — like a feral cat colony — Alley Cat Allies has tips on creating winter shelters that can help keep them warm and safe. Clarification: This story’s headline has been amended to clarify that the phrase “frozen solid” refers to the state of the dogs when their bodies were discovered.

Lemon knocked back drinks on live TV for hours and even got a piercing as he and co-host Brooke Baldwin rang in 2017 at The Spotted Cat in New Orleans.

Don Lemon is so drunk right now he's spilling his heart on #CNNNYE for his New Year's Resolution. 😂 pic.twitter.com/52npFU7Pmc Turns out, Lemon ended up keeping his New Year’s resolution. On Sunday night, the CNN host, broadcasting from the same bar in New Orleans, told audiences that he actually did get into a relationship in 2017. The couple met in New York City and had been in New Orleans together last year celebrating the dawn of the new year. ″It happened,” Lemon said of his relationship status. “You found your special someone,” Baldwin responded. “Actually he was here last year in the bar ... this is your one-year anniversary of meeting him,” Lemon said. UPDATE on Don Lemon, he did find love in 2017 and it was with a guy who was in the bar when he spilled his guts last New Year 😂 #CNNNYE #Happy2018 pic.twitter.com/w2SGAOkZlg Just before midnight, Lemon started singing about how he found love in 2017.

    "title": "White House Says Secret Rounds Of Golf Make Donald Trump A Better President",
    "text": "Donald Trump loves golf. He has spent at least 91 days of his presidency at golf courses and has been confirmed golfing at least 35 times. Presumably, he has golfed more times, but the White House is often tight-lipped at what in the world the president is doing at these golf courses. On Christmas Day, Trump tweeted that he was taking the day off then getting “back to work” after the holiday. I hope everyone is having a great Christmas, then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)! But Trump then spent the next seven days at the golf course. Reporters confirmed that the president was golfing during at least some of this time. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended Trump’s time on the links when asked by Yahoo News reporter Hunter Walker what his biggest accomplishment there has been. “I think it would certainly be developing deeper and better relationships with members of Congress in which those relationships have helped push forward the president’s agenda ― specifically when it comes to helping get the tax reform and tax cuts passed,” Sanders said, adding, “He has played golf with a number of senators and used that time certainly to accomplish that.” Yet the White House is rarely willing to tell the press when this relationship-building is happening. Officials often don’t release details about whether Trump is golfing, and with whom, and reporters have a tough time confirming what he’s doing. \"You Can't See Me\" ❌ 👀 A large truck is attempting to block cameras from capturing video of President Donald Trump golfing 🚚 🏌 https://t.co/qeO0k6c4YP pic.twitter.com/YO34DA6MGq Sanders, however, denied that the White House was at all skittish about the time Trump is spending at his golf courses. “I think it’s the press that has an issue with his time on the course,” she said. “The president is extremely proud of the accomplishments we had during 2017. ... It was probably one of the most successful first years in office ― passed major legislation, reworked the court system and got a Supreme Court justice nominated and approved and on the bench in the first year. A booming economy, massive gains against the war on ISIS.” Presidents golf. Being commander in chief is a tough job, and everyone needs a way to unwind. But the reason Trump’s time on the golf course is an issue is because he frequently went after President Barack Obama for golfing, saying he was lazy and not doing his job. Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter \"@gretawire: PresObama is not busy talking to Congress about Syria..he is playing golf ...go figure\" @BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard. Nice work ethic. Trump has admitted that he loves golf, but insisted there was a distinction between his golf and Obama’s golf. I don't mind that @BarackObama plays a lot of golf. I just wish he used it productively to make deals with Congress!

    "title": "Donald Trump Rages Against Iran, Pakistan In First Tweets Of 2018",
    "text": "President Donald Trump dedicated his first tweets of the new year to lashing out at Pakistan and Iran. The president first blasted Pakistan on Monday for giving the United States “nothing but lies & deceit.” Minutes later, he tweeted that Iran was “failing at every level.” The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more! Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE! Pakistani officials were preparing a response to the accusations, the country’s foreign minister said about an hour after Trump’s tweet. We will respond to President Trump's tweet shortly inshallah...Will let the world know the truth..difference between facts & fiction.. Trump has been severely critical of the Pakistani government’s handling of terrorist networks. The New York Times reported Saturday that his administration was considering withholding $225 million in aid from Pakistan to punish the country for failing to cooperate with counterterrorism operations. Vice President Mike Pence said last month that Trump had “put Pakistan on notice.” “For too long Pakistan has provided safe haven to the Taliban and many terrorist organizations, but those days are over,” Pence said during a speech to troops in Afghanistan. “As the president said, so I say now: Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with the United States, and Pakistan has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists.” Trump’s heated criticism of Iran on Monday was the latest attack in a war of words between the president and Iranian leadership. The country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, on Wednesday accused the U.S. government of “supporting ISIS and the like” and spending a “tremendous” amount of money to sow “discord” among Americans. Reagan was both wiser and more powerful than Trump. They took measures against Iran: they shot down one of our passenger aircrafts. But where is Reagan, and how powerful is the Islamic Republic now? Trump tweeted Sunday that it was “TIME FOR CHANGE” in light of deadly nationwide protests sweeping across Iran. Iranian demonstrators, frustrated by government corruption and a lack of improved economic conditions following the 2015 nuclear deal, have called on Khamenei to step down. Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer.

    "title": "Amid Already Chaotic Week, Trump Faces New Questions On Potential Obstruction Of Justice",
    "text": "As the White House continues to grapple with the bombshell allegations outlined in a new book about the Trump presidency, a report that the president sought to control the early stages of the Justice Department’s Russia probe is likely to cause further headaches for the administration. According to a New York Times story published Thursday evening, Trump was so determined to keep Attorney General Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from the investigation into his campaign’s possible collusion with Russia during the 2016 election that he enlisted White House counsel Don McGahn to help him. Sessions recused himself anyway, angering the president for months. While Trump has publicly said he disagreed with Sessions’ decision — in July, for example, Trump said he wouldn’t have selected Sessions to run the Justice Department if he’d known he would remove himself from overseeing the probe — the Times report suggests Trump personally attempted to influence the attorney general’s choice. An Associated Press source also confirmed the story. “This is potentially more evidence that the president committed obstruction of justice,” legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on CNN following the Times report. Politico reported last year that Trump asked Sessions to submit his resignation after ex-FBI director Robert Mueller was appointed to oversee an independent Russia investigation. According to The New York Times, Trump rejected the letter and sent it back to Sessions with a note saying “Not accepted.” (HuffPost sought a copy of the letter via a Freedom of Information Act request last year, but the Department of Justice wouldn’t confirm or deny that the letter exists, citing Sessions’ right to privacy. ) The Times also details the days leading up to Trump’s firing of then-FBI Director James Comey, reporting that the president grew increasingly frustrated with Comey in early May ― particularly after Comey testified on Capitol Hill and wouldn’t say whether the president was personally under investigation in the Russia probe ― and began to talk about possibly firing him. This concerned a White House lawyer who believed that firing Comey could prompt an investigation into whether the president was attempting to obstruct justice, according the Times. The lawyer then reportedly misled Trump about his power to remove Comey, intentionally making it appear that he didn’t know whether the president had authority to fire the FBI director. (There is, however, clear legal precedent that he can.) The Times also alleges a Sessions aide asked a congressional staffer for damaging information on Comey several days before Comey was fired, and that a letter Trump intended to send to Comey about his firing cited the Russia investigation in its first sentence and called the probe “fabricated and politically motivated.” The White House didn’t immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment on the Times’ story. It’s already been a challenging week for the White House, beginning with the president’s series of controversial tweets ― including one in which Trump taunted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un about his “much bigger” nuclear button. On Wednesday, several news outlets reported on excerpts from journalist Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which contains detailed, often explosive claims about the chaos within the administration. Wolff quotes former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon describing Donald Trump Jr.’s June 2016 meeting with Russian operatives at Trump Tower as “treasonous.” Bannon told Wolff there was “zero” chance the president’s son didn’t introduce the Russians to his father after the meeting. The president responded with a fiery statement distancing himself from the one-time chief executive of his 2016 campaign. “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency,” Trump said Wednesday. “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

She dismissed Wolff’s work as “trash,” and said the book is filled with “mistake after mistake after mistake.” The White House even sought to block the book from publication, sending a cease-and-desist letter to Wolff and his publisher.

    "title": "Donald Trump Taunts Kim Jong Un: My Nuclear Button Is 'Bigger'",
    "text": "President Donald Trump again challenged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday, boasting that the United States’ nuclear capabilities are “more powerful” than North Korea’s. Trump tweeted the taunt Tuesday evening: North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! Trump’s tweet comes one day after Kim warned the U.S. against threatening North Korea. In his New Year’s address, Kim delivered a mixed message, indicating a possible rapprochement to South Korea, while lashing out at the United States. In the speech Monday, Kim offered to send a delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea next month and proposed talks to discuss the event. At the same time, Kim warned the U.S. that years of work on its nuclear and missile development programs meant that Pyongyang posed as much of a threat to the U.S. as ever. “The entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons, and a nuclear button is always on my desk,” Kim said. “This is reality, not a threat.” The speech drove a wedge between allies South Korea and the United States. South Korean leader Moon Jae-In on Tuesday proposed high-level talks between both neighbors. Trump had responded with restraint to South Korea’s outreach. Sanctions and “other” pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea. Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea. Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time. Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see! Pyongyang has made significant strides in its nuclear and missile development programs, having tested several intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and a hydrogen bomb. Experts believe the entire continental U.S. is now within ICBM striking range. Trump has stepped up the pressure on the North Korean regime to give up its nuclear development with a mix of sanctions, threats and condescending language. In August, he threatened to unleash “fire and fury like the world has never seen” if North Korea threatened the United States. After many years of failure,countries are coming together to finally address the dangers posed by North Korea. We must be tough & decisive! Trump has come to refer to Kim as “rocket man,” while the North Korean leader in turn has referred to the U.S. president as “the mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, warned North Korea on Tuesday against conducting another missile test.

    "text": "For President Donald Trump, McDonald’s is to food as Fox News is to TV channels ― just the best in the field. Trump has praised the fast food giant’s “great” products and general “cleanliness.” Now a new book suggests there’s another, darker factor fueling his McDonald’s habit. In a preview of his tell-all book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, journalist Michael Wolff claims that Trump’s “longtime fear of being poisoned” has affected his dining choices. It’s “one reason why he liked to eat at McDonald’s—nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely premade,” Wolff wrote in New York Magazine on Wednesday. A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 26, 2016 at 2:29pm PDT Trump’s fears of contagion, deliberate or otherwise, also led to “new rules” at the White House that prohibited staffers from touching his toothbrush and other personal items, according to Wolff. It’s not clear if the president believed a specific person or group was out to harm him. The revelation about Trump’s poison concerns is just one of the fascinating assertions Wolff makes in his soon-to-be-released book. The president allegedly expressed extreme displeasure with members of his inner circle ― Steve Bannon “was disloyal (not to mention he always looks like shit)” ― curiosity about what a “golden shower” entails and a disinterest in constitutional literacy. “I got as far as the Fourth Amendment before his finger is pulling down on his lip and his eyes are rolling back in his head,” a campaign adviser tasked with explaining the Constitution to then-presidential candidate Trump told Wolff.

    "title": "Can Anyone Prevent Trump From Ordering A Nuclear Strike? Not Really.",
    "text": "It’s 2 a.m. President Donald Trump awakes to an alert on his phone. It’s another taunt from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the latest in an escalating row of provocations. But Kim’s gone too far this time. A retaliatory tweet just won’t cut it. Enraged, Trump races to his desk and slams his fist on the “nuclear button.” World War III begins. Could this catastrophic scenario become a reality? At a time when such a dramatic question may actually feel pertinent, one can find solace in the answer: No (well, not exactly). Firstly, Trump’s “nuclear button” doesn’t exist, despite his recent claim that it’s “bigger & more powerful” than Kim’s. But the president does have access to the nuclear codes, as well as the sole authority to order a strike. This extraordinary executive power has been contested throughout American history. When North Korea shot down a U.S. spy plane in 1969, a drunken President Richard Nixon reportedly “became incensed and ordered a tactical nuclear strike,” according to CIA official George Carver. “The Joint Chiefs were alerted and asked to recommend targets, but [Secretary of State Henry Kissinger] got on the phone to them. They agreed not to do anything until Nixon sobered up in the morning.” Kissinger is said to have told his aides that “If the president had his way, there would be a nuclear war each week!” Efforts to rein in the president’s nuclear powers are still underway today, with Trump repeatedly threatening to “totally destroy” North Korea, a nation of 25 million people. Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) introduced legislation last year that would prohibit the president from launching a nuclear first strike before Congress declares war. So now, with Trump at the helm, how would the situation actually unfold? HuffPost spoke with six experts about the extent and limits of the president’s nuclear authority. Many agreed that radical checks and balances to this power are long overdue. Stephen Schwartz, independent nuclear policy consultant: There are different scenarios. There’s the one where we are under attack, and then there’s the scenario that people talk about (which is probably less likely) where Trump is watching Fox News, or sitting on the toilet or whatever, and decides “the hell with Kim Jong Un, I’m gonna take him out” and decides to initiate a nuclear strike. In the first situation, our early-warning radars and satellites would receive indication of a ballistic missile attack against the United States, and officials at [the North American Aerospace Defense Command] would assess that information. Assuming that it is a real threat, there would be a conference to loop the president in. He could involve any number of officials, and can then decide to either do nothing, or to launch some of our nuclear weapons out from under the incoming attack before it hits, or he can decide to launch everything. The president is accompanied at all times by a military aide with a briefcase known as the “nuclear football.” In that briefcase are the means enabling him to order the use of nuclear weapons, if he so chooses. Because of the enormous time pressures, he might have as little as five minutes to make a decision. “The only thing that could stop a president who's determined to use nuclear weapons is mass insubordination.” The president would then retrieve from his pocket a laminated card nicknamed the “biscuit,” which contains alphanumeric challenge codes which he would use to identify himself to the director of operations in the “war room” at the Pentagon. Once his identity is verified, he gives the order and it is transmitted down the chain of command. The chain of command goes from the president through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then, if we’re using long-range weapons, down through the Strategic Command, then the order is relayed to our forces in the field. It always happens extremely quickly. Then there’s the abnormal scenario, where the president decides for no particular reason at all that he wants to use nuclear weapons. He could involve other people, but he doesn’t have to. Even if other people are involved in the discussion, at the end of the day they have no legal power. They can object all they want, and the president’s order still goes through. If somebody were to refuse to carry out the order, the president could fire that person or direct the secretary of defense to fire him. It’s important to note that the president doesn’t have the ability to launch nuclear weapons on his own. He can authorize nuclear weapons to be used, but he doesn’t physically control them. He needs help, but the system is predicated on all this happening extremely fast, with nobody questioning it. If it’s a valid order, [operators] will go ahead and launch the weapons. They’re not really trained to think; they’re trained to push button and pull triggers. Lisbeth Gronlund, senior scientist and co-director of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists: There are three basic criteria for the lawfulness of the use of any military weapons: the first is military necessity, which means an attack has to be limited to military objectives; distinction, which means the attack must be able to discriminate between military and civilian targets; and proportionality, which means the military objective has to outweigh the harm to civilians. Bruce Blair, nuclear security expert and research scholar at the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University: There are two different questions. One is strictly legal, and the other is whether the chain of command would treat it as a legal one. I think for all intents and purposes, the chain of command would obey an order to carry out a nuclear strike, unless that strike is obviously illegal. I think that’s a very high bar. I think senior military commanders broadly defer to the president to determine when and how nuclear weapons would be used in the defense of the United States and that they would defer to [Trump’s] judgment. If this nuclear crisis with North Korea continues to escalate and Trump decides to order a nuclear strike against North Korea, I think it would be considered legal by the chain of command. Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons: It’s a complex question, because we [at ICANW] would consider any use of nuclear weapons to be illegal, given the casualties it would cause. It would violate the Geneva Convention in laws of war in many different ways; both the disproportionate response, for example, and that you’re not supposed to target civilians in warfare, whereas nuclear weapons are created to kill as many civilians as possible. They’re not really made for precision guidance military targets. They’re meant to wipe out cities. It would also violate environmental law, given the huge environmental impacts that nuclear weapons have. I’m sure there are other lawyers who would argue differently and could see a hypothetical scenario that wouldn’t have those kind of consequences. But if we’re talking about North Korea, I don’t see anyone being able to claim that a use of nuclear weapons would be in line with international humanitarian laws and the laws of war that we have agreed on. Blair: I think if President Trump comes to the conclusion that a nuclear strike against the United States is imminent, he would seriously consider launching our conventional forces to try to pre-emptively destroy this looming threat. The context may be one in which Trump and Kim Jong Un have escalated their brinkmanship to the point of conflict, and Kim may have fled to his wartime bunker. But yes, I can [envision such a scenario]. I think the Korean crisis has already crossed the threshold into a danger zone that is quite threatening and that could trigger either side to employ force ― presumably conventional forces first, but that which could then escalate to the use of nuclear weapons. “No person is sane enough, stable enough or good enough to have the ability to end the world.” Schwartz: It’s hard to say. Donald Trump has been talking about nuclear weapons for a very long time. He has a very high opinion of himself on this, as with all other matters, and thinks he knows everything. I frankly can’t think of a more dangerous combination in a president than somebody who is so reckless with his words and knows so little about what these weapons actually do ― and doesn’t want to learn any more about how destructive this would be. He said throughout the campaign that he didn’t want to take anything off the table, including using nuclear weapons. I don’t know, and that’s really the problem here: We don’t have a good sense of what the president would or wouldn’t do. There are cooler heads around the president who would presumably caution him to be more cautious, but if they’ve been doing that for the past year, it doesn’t seem to have had any effect. There seems to be an attitude within the White House of “Let Trump be Trump.” I worry less about the president suddenly deciding to use nuclear weapons and more about him boxing himself into a corner through his tweets, statements and attitude that nobody is better than he is. I worry that he walks into a situation where he thinks he’s being smart, then blunders himself into a corner where the only recourse to get out without looking like an idiot is to use nuclear weapons or go to war, or precipitate a war. Scott Sagan, professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation: A preemptive strike: If Trump received intelligence that the North Koreans were fueling a large number of their liquid-fueled missiles and believed that a North Korean attack was likely, he could order a preemptive strike using U.S. [intercontinental ballistic missiles] against the launch sites, missile storage sites, and North Korean command and control facilities. This would be legal under the doctrine of anticipatory self-defense. However, If Trump declared in that scenario (or in any other scenario) that he wanted to “totally destroy” Pyongyang and ordered [U.S. Strategic Command] to aim at the center of the city, such an order would be illegal. This might sound like a far-fetched idea, but recall that Trump said at the U.N. in September that if the U.S. “is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” I would hope that either Secretary of Defense James Mattis or STRATCOM Commander Gen. John Hyten would tell him that this was an illegal order and that they would not obey it. Peter Feaver, political science professor at Duke University and former special adviser on the National Security Council, who testified at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in November about the president’s nuclear authority: I think it’s high time that we took a close look at our nuclear command and control system to include aspects of how the decision would be made by the president and his advisory team, and how it would be transferred down, and what kinds of safety measure you might build in to ensure that decision is not made hastily or in error. Reviewing and hardening [this system] to make it more robust and resilient is wise and needs to be done. That may not be effectively done by legislation imposed by Congress. My concern, and what I told the senators, is that if you tried to foist something on the executive branch by passing legislation ― first of all, it’s unlikely it would pass, and second of all, it’s unlikely the president would sign it ― it’s unlikely that it would play out in practice the way the legislative designers intended. Blair: It’s a step in the right direction. Assuming that Congress would declare war and provide the specific authorization for the use of nuclear weapons, it still would not be an airtight safeguard because the president can still make a very ill-advised decision sometime down the road, in the midst of some conflict. Also, there could be situations when a threat is so imminent that there simply would not be time to debate and produce a declaration of war. So it has some weaknesses. I think an additional, invaluable congressional solution would be for Congress to pass a law prohibiting the first use of nuclear weapons. If they could pass such a law, which is very unlikely given the complexion of the Congress in the control of the Republican Party, it would lay out clear markers and red lines that the president could not exceed. If he did, he would be held accountable and even impeachable. Schwartz: Having some sort of screening process [for the president] would be good. Having at least one other person in the decision-making loop who has to positively affirm not just the president’s identity but has to also agree that the decision would not be a bad thing. We are one of the only nuclear-armed countries in the world that vests this power in one person. It could be the secretary of state, it could be the secretary of defense, it could be a member of Congress in the presidential line of succession. But when you’re talking about something that could literally end the world, it should not be the sole responsibility of one person ― particularly one person who is so temperamentally challenged and mercurial. Fihn: It’s terrifying to think that one person in each of the nuclear-armed states has this authority to launch nuclear weapons, to launch a weapon of mass destruction on civilians. At the same time, I think any use of these weapons would violate the laws of war, which means that even use with many people’s authorizations would be wrong and immoral. Of course, it’s deeply disturbing that it’s so easy for a president to launch weapons and that there’s very little people around him could do, but nuclear weapons are an ongoing threat, no matter who has control of them. Any use would cause a catastrophic humanitarian situation. First- or second-strike isn’t really where the discussion needs to be. The discussion needs to be: Is it OK to use WMD?

Nuclear weapons are meant to indiscriminately kill as many people as possible. All nuclear-armed states have policies that say they are ready to do this to people, right now. Many people are very worried now with Donald Trump having access to these weapons, but if you have a problem with Trump having the weapons, it’s probably the weapons themselves that are the problem.

    "title": "Donald Trump Responds To Utah Senator Orrin Hatch's Retirement",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump responded to veteran Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch (R) announcing his retirement after more than four decades in the Senate. “Congratulations to Senator Orrin Hatch on an absolutely incredible career,” Trump tweeted Tuesday evening. “I will never forget the (beyond kind) statements he has made about me as President,” he added. Congratulations to Senator Orrin Hatch on an absolutely incredible career. He has been a tremendous supporter, and I will never forget the (beyond kind) statements he has made about me as President. He is my friend and he will be greatly missed in the U.S. Senate! pic.twitter.com/0VjzLEeHTl In a video message Tuesday, Hatch, 83, said that he plans to retire from the Senate when his term ends after this year — opening the door for Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, who has been exploring a possible Senate bid, to potentially seek the seat. Romney pilloried Trump in a March 2016 speech, calling him a “phony” and “a fraud.” Last summer, he criticized Trump’s notorious defense of the white supremacist groups that unleashed violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. “Whether he intended to or not, what he communicated caused racists to rejoice, minorities to weep, and the vast heart of America to mourn,” Romney said, warning that Trump’s remarks could lead to “an unraveling of our national fabric.” Trump had urged Hatch, whom he considered a close ally, to stay in office. After Hatch helped spearhead the passage of the GOP’s tax reform bill last month, he effusively praised Trump at a White House celebration, calling him “a heck of a leader” and predicting that his presidency would be “the greatest ... not only in generations, but maybe ever.” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Tuesday that Trump is “very sad” that Hatch is leaving, particularly given his efforts on tax reform. “The president certainly has the greatest and deepest amount of respect for Sen. Hatch and his over four decades of experience in the Senate,” she said. Sanders would not say if Trump would back Romney.

    "title": "Donald Trump Just Called Himself 'A Very Stable Genius'",
    "text": "President Donald Trump hit back at critics who have questioned his mental stability by branding himself a “very stable genius” on Saturday morning. In a series of tweets, Trump said that throughout his life his “two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.” He also bragged about going from “VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star... to President of the United States (on my first try).” Now that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence..... ....Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames. I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star..... ....to President of the United States (on my first try). I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius....and a very stable genius at that! Trump’s comment about his mental stability appeared to reference reporters questioning the president’s “mental fitness” during a White House press briefing this week. Democratic lawmakers have also previously called for Trump to undergo a psychological evaluation, and Michael Wolff alleges in his new book, Fire and Fury, that White House aides openly question the president’s mental health. Trump is set to undergo a medical examination with White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson next Friday, although it will likely focus more on his physical health. Walter Shaub, who quit as head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in July, said the tweets themselves “might be enough to lead the board of any corporation to call an emergency meeting on its CEO’s mental status.” Well, you’ll show ‘em. Nothing says stable like a midnight tweet about “Sloppy Steve” followed by a 7:00 a.m. tweet calling “hoax” on an investigation that has already led to charges against 4 people. Except maybe maniacal laughter. Try some of that too. https://t.co/X7c8LOhR30 Forget the book. This might be enough to lead the board of any corporation to call an emergency meeting on its CEO’s mental status: “my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart” . . . “not smart, but genius....and a very stable genius at that!” Other Twitter users seemed like they couldn’t quite believe the posts: No but seriously WHY would you put the \"like\" before \"really smart\" unless you were writing a comedy bit? It's just so... Zoolander President Genius pic.twitter.com/2ZxPlkKXcz \"A very stable genius, at that!\" is the definition of a self-refuting tweet.

    "text": "President Donald Trump took another shot at Steve Bannon on Thursday, gloating that his former White House chief strategist called him a “great man” after their rift Wednesday and telling reporters he doesn’t speak to Bannon anymore. “I don’t know, he called me a great man last night, so you know, he obviously changed his tune pretty quick,” he told White House pool reporters Thursday morning, referring to supportive comments Bannon made of the president during his Breitbart radio show on Wednesday night.

    "text": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday offered a fiery response to bombshell reports that Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist, had accused the president of meeting with Russian operatives after Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with them at Trump Tower in June 2016. “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency,” Trump said Wednesday in a statement. “When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.” The statement continued: “Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look.” BREAKING: Trump drops new statement, ripping into Bannon, arguing his former Chief Strategist “lost his mind.” pic.twitter.com/ozusZeoB7f Bannon was quoted by author Michael Wolff ― whose tell-all book about the White House is set for release on Jan. 9 ― as saying there was “zero” chance Trump didn’t know about his eldest son and son-in-law Jared Kushner meeting with Russian operatives. Bannon also called the meeting “treasonous” and “bad shit.” A preview of the new book published in New York magazine on Wednesday offered stunning details about the chaos that has reigned at the White House since Trump took office. In the piece, Wolff claims that many people in Trump’s inner circle did not think he would win the 2016 election ― and that, indeed, few even wanted him to. Bannon returned to the far-right news outlet Breitbart as executive chairman in August after he was fired as White House chief strategist. Still, he has been credited with having significant influence over Trump and his administration’s agenda, even after his own departure from the West Wing. Responding to the Bannon bombshell on Wednesday, Trump accused him of only pretending to have influence in the White House. Trump claimed that Bannon, a former member of his inner circle, was “rarely in one-on-one meetings” with him. Trump’s comments Wednesday were a stark contrast with the well wishes he tweeted at the time of Bannon’s departure from the White House in August. In his tweets, Trump thanked Bannon for his “great” involvement in his 2016 presidential campaign and predicted he would be a “smart new voice” when he returned to Breitbart. I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton - it was great! Thanks S Steve Bannon will be a tough and smart new voice at @BreitbartNews...maybe even better than ever before. Fake News needs the competition! Wolff’s reporting was met with pushback from elsewhere in the White House. Stephanie Grisham, communications director for first lady Melania Trump, disputed Wolff’s assertions. “The book is clearly going to be sold in the bargain fiction section,” Grisham told reporters in the White House pool. “Mrs. Trump supported her husband’s decision to run for president and in fact, encouraged him to do so. She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did.” Meanwhile, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed that Wolff’s book is merely “trashy tabloid fiction.” “This book is filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House,” Sanders told reporters Wednesday. During a news briefing Wednesday afternoon, Sanders claimed that Trump and Bannon last spoke in early December. Trump Jr. accused Bannon of spreading “division and lies,” and appeared to suggest that Breitbart’s readers want Bannon removed from the outlet. Wow, Just looked at the comments section on Breitbart. Wow. When Bannon has lost Breitbart, he’s left with . . . umm, nothing. At least one prominent Republican appeared to be enjoying Wednesday’s war of words between Trump and Bannon. An official Twitter account connected to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose relationship with the president has been especially tumultuous, posted an uncaptioned GIF of the senator shortly after the Bannon bombshell dropped.

    "title": "Trump Jokes About 'Fake' Media Awards, But Twitter Was The Real Winner",
    "text": "President Donald Trump had Twitter in an uproar for a lot of reasons Tuesday. Minutes after posting an inflammatory tweet about nuclear war with North Korea, Trump slammed the “dishonest & corrupt” media with a joke apparently pegged to Hollywood’s awards season. “I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock,” Trump wrote on Twitter, adding what categories he’ll cover. I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock. Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned! The tweet is part of a string of Trump attacks on the press throughout 2017, and it seems as if he’s going to mine that same vein in 2018. But, despite the supposed seriousness of the president’s tweet attacking North Korea, Twitter users couldn’t help but see Trump’s latest attack on the media as a leap into the ridiculous. 🎶It’s the First Annual Donald Trump Award for THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR 🎶 pic.twitter.com/ZRm0V7Q3a7 The weirdest part of this is he’s going to creep into the nominees’ dressing room when they’re half naked. https://t.co/mZViUaXkJe The tweet about North Korea followed up by the tweet about an awards show for fakest news is the most Donald Trump 20 minutes imaginable Donald Trump inventing \"fake news\" awards are in the same category of crazy as when Venezuela invented a peace prize and awarded it to Vladimir Putin. \"First of all, it's an honor just to be nominated ...\" Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Donald Trump’s Weird Video Briefing Becomes Bonkers New Meme",
    "text": "President Donald Trump is being mercilessly mocked after he appeared via a taped video message at Thursday’s White House press briefing. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders began the briefing by playing pre-recorded footage of Trump boasting about his tax code rewrite onto two screens. But as many media outlets have noted, the president was likely nearby in another room at the same time. The bizarre situation did not go unnoticed online, with many people likening Trump’s appearance to a movie villain. They also reimagined photos of the briefing in various amusing ways. Here’s a sampling of the humorous responses: Leaning hard into the 1984 vibe here https://t.co/Ck1IsUG53g weird trump video statement during the press briefing pic.twitter.com/k0uEPVt4pw It felt like a message from a bond villain. pic.twitter.com/0Z9GsOXRtj pic.twitter.com/51dk51SpNW I give it two months before trump does press conferences like pic.twitter.com/3w4kvsTKCT welcome to your reckoning, @SHSanders45 pic.twitter.com/alXmMbLLud Sarah Huckabee Sanders just thanked a video recording of Trump as if he was actually there. pic.twitter.com/iZQ2an28vC The bizarre situation prompted other folks to ask why Trump didn’t deliver the briefing in person: What just happened in the WH briefing is disturbing. A desperate, untreated sociopath is dictating to the press directly, but without appearing to take questions. Another piece of our democracy just disappeared and Americans are doing nothing about it. This is the sad truth. pic.twitter.com/49wLguYDNt 1/5 To the best of my recollection, @realDonaldTrump has held exactly ONE press conference in the last year that wasn't with another head of state or a Cabinet head to share the brunt of questions. ONE. This is not normal and this is not acceptable. It used to be that a President would go to the briefing room when he wanted to make a statement.

    "title": "Trump Administration Proposes Massive Expansion Of Offshore Drilling",
    "text": "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has proposed a sweeping new offshore drilling plan aimed at opening huge swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans to oil exploration as part of the Trump administration’s plan to transform the United States into a fossil fuel juggernaut. The draft plan released Thursday includes 25 of 26 offshore planning areas and makes available for lease roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. The administration has identified 47 potential lease sales, including 19 off the coast of Alaska and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico, Zinke told reporters Thursday. “This is the largest number of lease sales ever proposed” for the national offshore leasing program, Zinke said. “This is a clear difference between energy weakness and energy dominance,” he added. “And under President Trump, we are going to have the strongest energy policy and become the strongest energy superpower. We certainly have the assets to do that.” President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April aimed at opening up the now-protected areas. The order instructed the Interior Department to review the current five-year oil and gas leasing program, finalized by the Obama administration in November, and to write new rules for offshore oil and gas drilling under the guise of an “America-First Offshore Energy Strategy.” If approved, the plan would be in effect from 2019 to 2024. It would replace the current leasing program, which runs through 2022 and was approved following an extensive, multiyear review. Zinke stressed that the proposal is the beginning of a process that would allow for public input from states, local communities and congressional delegations. For eight years under the Obama administration, he said, “responsible energy development took a back seat to, in many cases, special interest groups.” Zinke also dismissed environmental concerns, arguing — as he often does — that it is better to produce energy in the U.S. under reasonable regulations than to produce it overseas with none. “It will deepen also our commitment to environmental stewardship because we do it right,” he said. Citing environmental concerns, President Barack Obama’s Interior Department instituted a temporary ban on drilling in the Arctic’s Beaufort and Chukchi seas between 2017 and 2022, thereby limiting offshore drilling to the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Cook Inlet. One month later, Obama used his executive authority to extend permanent protections for large swaths of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. The permanent withdrawal encompasses the entire U.S. portion of the Chukchi Sea and significant portions of the Beaufort Sea. It also covers 31 canyons in the Atlantic, stretching from New England to the Chesapeake Bay. At the time, an Obama administration official said that “no president has ever acted to reverse an indefinite withdrawal” and that the permanent ban would “stand the test of time.” Trump, however, claimed in April that his order “reverses the previous administration’s Arctic leasing ban.” The Pacific coast has been closed to new oil and gas exploration since the disastrous 1969 oil spill off Santa Barbara, California. Many lawmakers from the Golden State are starkly opposed to new drilling. “The people of California are simply not going to allow it to happen,” Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) told Zinke at a June 22 budget hearing. “In fact, our state wants to remove the existing oil and gas rigs in our waters. We are looking forward to the development of offshore renewable energy. And we’re not happy about backwards steps.” Oil drilling off the Atlantic coast ended in the early 1980s. For years, however, the oil industry has lobbied to increase access to new drilling areas to complement the offshore industry in the Gulf of Mexico. The boom in places like North Dakota has allowed shale oil, an unconventional type of crude extracted from sedimentary rocks, to dominate the U.S. market. Sierra Weaver, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, a group that led the charge to have Atlantic waters removed from the current five-year leasing plan, said the Trump administration has offered nothing that would justify going through this process again. “The coast has spoken, whether it is at the local level or the state level,” she told HuffPost. “This is going to be the Trump administration’s first opportunity to either listen to what they say and really respect those local interests, or side with the oil industry over local residents.” The only areas excluded from Zinke’s proposal are marine sanctuaries and the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area in Alaska — which former President George W. Bush set aside for protection with an executive order. “We respected that,” Kate MacGregor, the Interior Department’s deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management, said Thursday. Zinke took only two questions from reporters before MecGregor took over. Questions directed at her were also limited, and no one asked about how the new offshore plan might impact climate or the coastal communities being threatened by rising seas. Companies such as BP ― which was responsible for the catastrophic 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that devastated Gulf states with pollution ― have pushed even harder this year for offshore drilling, despite its relatively higher costs compared to shale. BP lost control of a well off the Louisiana coast seven years ago, causing the Deepwater Horizon rig to explode and dump about 4 million barrels of crude into the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven workers were killed, and several species of dolphins and sea turtles continue to die in record numbers due to the spill’s lasting effects. Thursday’s announcement comes just days after the Interior Department moved to slash key offshore safety regulations adopted in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster — the largest spill in the nation’s history. The agency’s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said the move seeks to “reduce certain unnecessary regulatory burdens” and is expected to save companies an estimated $288 million over 10 years. Last month, Interior also abruptly cut off funding for the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to study offshore drilling in an effort to identify ways to avoid another disaster like Deepwater Horizon. Environmental groups were quick to threaten litigation ahead of Thursday’s announcement. “Our natural heritage is not President Trump’s to plunder, and we will fight this reckless proposal in the courts and on Capitol Hill,” Jamie Rappaport Clark, president and CEO of Defenders of Wildlife, said in a statement. In her own statement, Diane Hoskins, a campaign director at ocean conservation nonprofit Oceana, said that “giving the oil industry unfettered access to our nation’s oceans is a recipe for disaster.” “This plan opens the floodgates to dirty and dangerous offshore drilling, threatening coastal economies that rely on clean and healthy oceans,” she said. Trump’s plan is likely to put him at loggerheads with East Coast Republicans. Florida Gov. Rick Scott pushed back against the administration’s proposal even before there was an official announcement. “I have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,” he said in a statement. Governor Scott’s Statement on Trump Administration’s Plan on Offshore Oil Drilling: pic.twitter.com/iQqNU9afsQ Fourteen House Republicans, most of whom are from Florida, signed a letter opposing Trump’s proposal in June to allow seismic testing ― repeatedly blasting an extremely loud air gun on the ocean floor to detect oil and gas reserves ― on the Atlantic coast. Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) told McClatchy in November that he was trying to rally a coalition of Republicans against drilling on the East Coast. They have company. Just hours after Trump signed his executive order in April, California lawmakers announced plans to introduce a bill to protect state waters from expanded drilling. Alaska native and environmental groups sued the administration the following month to block the offshore drilling efforts in the Arctic. In June, the co-chairmen of the national commission on the BP oil spill warned that Trump’s order could set the stage for another catastrophe of similar scale. Former Florida Gov. Bob Graham and William K. Reilly, who led the Environmental Protection Agency under President George H. W. Bush, wrote a New York Times piece in which they criticized the order for allowing energy exploration in “environmentally sensitive” areas and threatening to get rid of safeguards put in place to protect against undersea well blowouts. Plans to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling ― passed last month as part of the GOP tax bill ― have also been met with fierce criticism from environmentalists and former Interior Department officials who call the area “America’s Serengeti.” This article has been updated with additional details about the draft plan, as well as with quotes from Zinke and MacGregor.

    "title": "Donnie Yen Doesn't Want to Play 'Another Stereotypical Chinese Martial-Arts Man'",
    "text": "Donnie Yen wants more three-dimensional Asian characters in Hollywood. The actor, best known for starring in the “Ip Man” film trilogy, recently sat down with Prestige Hong Kong magazine to discuss Chirrut Îmwe, his warrior-monk character in Gareth Edwards’ “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.” “When I took on the role in Rogue One, I felt it was important for me to take a step forward, to develop it so that it would be less clichéd,” Yen told Prestige. “I know they wanted Donnie Yen because he’s Ip Man. They wanted Ip Man in Rogue One. I get it. But I don’t want to portray another stereotypical Chinese martial-arts man.” Yen said he worked with producers to add some layers and context to the character. In the end, however, he feels the character still fell short. “Even after all of that, Îmwe still came out a cliché,” he said. “But if you think he’s a cliché on screen, you should’ve seen the original script they offered me. It was why I was initially hesitant to take on the role. But I understand why. They can’t have an overhaul overnight. There’s a large audience that has never watched Asians in films before, so it takes time for them to process an Asian actor.” Yen, who touched on his other movies including “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny” and the Hong Kong gangster film “Chasing the Dragon,” had some thoughts about Hollywood’s attempt at Asian-American representation as well. Often, in Hollywood movies, Asian actors are cast in small roles with little significance to the overall story in an effort to appeal to international Asian audiences ― a practice known as pandering, as The New York Times notes. “They need to learn from their mistakes,” Yen told Prestige. “Look at all these actors and actresses that now say no. It proves it doesn’t work. You can’t just put an Asian actor in there and expect that, because they show up for a second, you’ve covered the Asian market. That is a joke.” “I’m glad Asian actors are stepping up and saying no,” he said. “If you’re gonna spend months away from home and devote time in your life to work on a film it had better be worth it.” Damn right. Hollywood has long had difficulty achieving genuine Asian-American representation in TV and films. Asians made up less than 6 percent of speaking characters in Hollywood films from 2007 to 2016, according to a 2017 USC Annenberg study. Actors of Asian descent aren’t faring much better in television. Research shows that though there are more Asian characters on TV now than there were a decade ago, the characters are often tokenized. A majority of shows fail to feature a single Asian-American or Pacific Islander in the main cast. And roughly two-thirds of the TV programs that do feature AAPI series regulars have only one.

You’re not recognized as someone who is fully present in society,” sociologist Nancy Wang Yuen previously told HuffPost. “It’s a literal silencing of Asians and it reinforces the stereotype that Asians aren’t expressive, they’re invisible, that they’re not really there. But that’s because [Hollywood’s] not casting them.” Hollywood has every reason to want to improve its Asian representation. In fact, the 2017 Hollywood Diversity Report from the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA showed that diversity wins at the box office as well as in ratings over broadcast and cable networks. The report also noted a disconnect between “Hollywood industry production choices and market realities.” Well, Hollywood, you heard it from Donnie Yen himself. It’s time to learn from your mistakes.

    "title": "Dreamers To California Republicans: Help Us, Please",
    "text": "PORTERVILLE, Calif. — Luis Galvan, 20, enjoyed a moment of triumph in late October when he boarded a plane for the first time and flew to Indianapolis to receive the top Future Farmers of America degree, a prestigious certificate of achievement in the world of agriculture. Galvan was proud that all his grueling work with livestock and crops had paid off. But his euphoria was short-lived. When Galvan got home, he tore open an envelope waiting for him from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It was crushing news: He had submitted his application to renew a vital work permit for young immigrants known as “Dreamers” in plenty of time, along with a renewal fee. He received a notice back that there was a snafu over a $495 scholarship check he had submitted to pay the fee, and he promptly followed instructions to correct that. But now this second, final notice told him his application was rejected for being late. If Galvan can’t appeal the rejection, his work permit will expire Jan. 15. That would jeopardize his job tutoring junior high kids. It would affect his ability to afford college. It could even lead to him being deported. “What a bucket of cold water,” Galvan said in a late-night interview in Porterville, the small California farm city where he grew up. Surrounded by a sea of orchards — including oranges that are now flooding U.S. markets — Porterville sits in California’s vast Central Valley. Considered one of the world’s most productive agribusiness regions, the valley depends on immigrant labor. And among those who represent the region in Congress are multiple Republican lawmakers, not least of them Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the powerful GOP majority leader whose district includes Porterville. The work permit Galvan holds stems from his status as a recipient of DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program whose fate rests, in no small part, in McCarthy’s hands. Former President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012 to allow undocumented young people brought to the United States as children to stay legally, conditionally, until, Obama said he hoped, Congress came up with a solution to help them. Nicknamed Dreamers, this population has no sure path to legal residency, no matter how long they’ve been here or how much they accomplish. DACA has temporarily protected them from deportation and allowed them to obtain work permits. On Sept. 5, though, President Donald Trump announced that he was pulling the plug on DACA, arguing in a statement that Obama lacked authority to create the program and that federal policy should be “fair to American families, students, taxpayers and jobseekers.” Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders added later that unemployed Americans could possibly assume DACA recipients’ jobs. Nearly 800,000 DACA recipients were suddenly plunged into uncertainty. Dreamers whose work permits were soon to expire were given a chance to apply, one last time, for two-year renewals by Oct. 5. Many missed the tight deadline or their applications, they say, were denied unfairly. If nothing changes, after March, all DACA recipients will begin to lose permits in waves as each card expires. The situation remains up in the air. Despite his harsh rhetoric claiming Dreamers occupy Americans’ jobs, Trump also challenged Congress to come up with a legislative fix with “heart” to help Dreamers before the March deadline. A flurry of negotiations to pass such a bill collapsed just prior to the holiday break. GOP leaders now say Congress will take up DACA again this month as part of a broader debate over Trump’s demands for more border wall investments and cuts in family-based immigration. But the politics are complicated, and they’re especially complicated here in California, home to at least a quarter of the Dreamers. Most polling, from ABC to Fox News, shows that 60 to upwards of 80 percent of Americans think Dreamers should get a chance to stay and become legalized. In and around Porterville, Dreamers and their backers angrily question why McCarthy and fellow congressmen from California’s Central Valley aren’t vigorously pushing for a legislative fix — pronto — because so many Dreamers’ lives hang in the balance. McCarthy declined an interview but in careful language has backed crafting a DACA fix as long as it’s coupled with more investments in border security measures. He said in a statement that he supported Trump’s position and that Congress is working on a “lawful solution to this problem.” It’s clear to everyone that McCarthy is not publicly leading a passionate charge to defend Dreamers. But the raw politics of both Washington and his district are hardly demanding that he do so — at least not right now. McCarthy won his last two elections with 75 percent and 69 percent of the vote. On the ground in McCarthy’s district, however, where Latinos are 41 percent of the population and 27 percent of those eligible to vote, feelings can also get more than a little raw. The 52-year-old congressman, a lifelong Bakersfield resident, represents most of Tulare County, where Porterville is located, and the majority of California’s sprawling Kern County. Kern is peppered with oil rigs that produce more oil than Oklahoma. The county is also home to military-industrial-complex interests. Kern’s formidable agribusiness production, consisting of grapes, fruit trees, scores of other crops and milk, made it the No. 1 farm county in the nation in 2016 at $7.19 billion in value. Tulare’s farm production value was $6.37 billion. California, as a whole, is by far the nation’s biggest dairy-producing state while also producing almost half the nation’s fruits, nuts and vegetables. Those stats form the basis for part of the passion here. After all, advocates for Dreamers argue, California supplies a massive quantity of the food Americans consume. And agribusiness has acknowledged for a long time that immigrants, many of them undocumented and the parents of Dreamers, are essential to creating this bounty. “I’ve complained to McCarthy’s office: What about the Dreamers?” said John Duran, 67, a Republican in Porterville who is of Mexican descent but not an immigrant. “He needs to be doing more. But because he’s Republican he’s got to follow their agenda.” There are no exact numbers, but McCarthy’s 23rd Congressional District is home to an estimated 7,900 young people who fit the profile of those eligible to have signed up for DACA, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by the University of Southern California. Adjacent GOP districts have as many or even more of these young people, who were eligible to sign up for DACA once they reached 16 if they had lived here since at least June 15, 2007. Duran, a former correctional officer who’s active in local politics, said he’s generally pro-Trump and is strongly opposed to government “giveaways.” But he winces at some of the rhetoric around immigrants that’s voiced by the president and his supporters. Even here, where it’s plain to the eye who does a lot of hard labor, Duran said, “some people seem to have the idea that illegal immigrants don’t do anything but crime.” Duran says he was stunned not long ago when a non-Hispanic woman spoke out at a public forum about allowing Dreamers to serve in the military to earn legal status and citizenship. “She came up to me and said if they want to get citizenship, they should serve for 20 years. That just doesn’t make sense to me.” Only Congress can change immigration law to open up a path that doesn’t exist now, a reality that runs contrary to misconceptions that there’s a line anyone wishing to immigrate can get into and just patiently wait a turn. A bipartisan bill introduced in July, the Dream Act of 2017, would create a years-long path to permanent residency and citizenship for eligible young people who’ve been here at least four years prior to enactment of such legislation. But that bill did not advance. Versions of the Dream Act in Congress go back to 2001. Beyond the details, though, some DACA recipients here say they’d just like to hear McCarthy defend them more vigorously — and act with speed. Porterville Dreamer Marco Reyes, 20, who works as a cashier and studies at Porterville College, a community college, said: “If I talked to McCarthy, I’d ask him what he’s doing behind the scenes that nobody else is doing. He must be doing something. Are you going to surprise us later, hopefully with something that’s not bad? Because, with politicians, you never know.” As Republicans bore down on passing tax reform, GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told Fox News shortly before the holiday break that “we have plenty of time” to act on DACA to meet Trump’s March deadline. But Galvan said: “I can’t wait.” Even with nerves on edge, he’s got to attend classes at the local College of the Sequoias — in preparation for transfer to a four-year university — and report for as long as he can to his job tutoring seventh- and eighth-graders. The kids remind him of himself, when he was growing up poor but struggling to hold on to dreams. “After I got DACA, I went crazy,” Galvan said, explaining the sense of liberation it gave him. “I joined every club I could. I’ve really tried to do my best.” It’s been a long road. Galvan arrived from Mexico at 5, and now he’s 20. As he was growing up, employers continued to hire people with little fear of getting penalized for “knowingly,” as the law says, hiring undocumented workers. Farm groups have long admitted that authentic-looking fake documents immigrants buy are part and parcel of how California’s factories in the fields stay open. Galvan’s dad has worked for the same agricultural employer for 15 years. At an early December pro-DACA rally in Porterville, population 60,000, agitated residents channeled their anger about the treatment of undocumented workers. “These people live in the shadows and break their backs so that the people of America can eat!” Rosa Salmeron, a California State University, Fresno, student of social work, shouted through a bullhorn. “We’re not shadows. We are people!” Salmeron, 37, patted Galvan’s shoulder as he took the bullhorn at a rally in Veteran’s Park to tell the crowd about his dilemma. Salmeron, whose parents fled El Salvador during its civil war, is a naturalized U.S. citizen and grateful, she said, for the 1986 amnesty that Congress and President Ronald Reagan crafted that allowed her and her parents a chance to become legal residents and then go on to become citizens. Her family members live and have businesses in McCarthy’s district, in Bakersfield. “These people are not representing us,” she told the crowd of several dozen. She urged people to register to vote and oust local Republicans from Congress if they don’t do more for Dreamers. “The American Dream is at stake!” “Kevin McCarthy is my representative, and it upsets me that he won’t meet to talk about this,” added Daniel Peñaloza, 24, who runs an office in Porterville set up by the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, based in Los Angeles. Peñaloza has organized pro-DACA rallies not only outside McCarthy’s offices but also at the offices of neighboring congressmen David Valadao (R-Hanford), of the 21st District, and Devin Nunes (R-Tulare) of the 22nd District. Valadao, the son of Portuguese immigrants, is a dairy farmer. He doesn’t have the clout that McCarthy wields, but he’s ventured where many other Republicans won’t go. He was one of three Republicans in the House who co-sponsored a failed 2013 comprehensive immigration reform package that would put undocumented workers on an earned path to legal status, a green card. Valadao is also one of two GOP congressmen from California who signed up to co-sponsor the Dream Act of 2017. The other co-sponsor is Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Turlock), whose 10th District also includes farm country to the north of Fresno. Both also signed a Dec. 5 letter with 32 other GOP legislators urging Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to put the Dream Act of 2017 on the floor for a vote. Ryan declined. “As we approach the March deadline,” Valadao said in a statement, “it is more critical than ever that Congress immediately act to repair our broken immigration system and provide DACA recipients with the certainty they deserve.” According to the Pew Research Center, almost 76 percent of Valadao’s district is Latino, and more than 39 percent of the population eligible to vote is Latino — the highest percentage among California’s 14 Republican districts in the House. Democrats hold the rest of California’s 53 House seats. Despite his pro-immigrant record, Democrats consider Valadao vulnerable in the next election. Back in Washington, D.C., McCarthy’s communications director, Matt Sparks, addressed complaints that his boss seemed indifferent to Dreamers and would not meet with constituents unhappy that he isn’t publicly elevating their cause. Sparks said pro-DACA rallies have been disruptive at district offices and have interrupted other constituents’ business. He said field staff in California attend town meetings regularly and listen respectfully to complaints aired in that setting. He provided a statement from McCarthy: “President Trump was right to correct President Obama’s executive overreach by calling on Congress to find a solution for the children of illegal immigrants who came to this country through no fault of their own.” McCarthy had previously told CNBC that “I don’t think this country is going to move these individuals out.” In the same interview, he acknowledged, to a point, his district’s dependence on immigrant workers. “I come from an agricultural community, and I know you need a guest-worker program.” Sparks said DACA isn’t the only immigration-related issue that constituents bring up. Some district residents want to know about possible reforms Congress might initiate to broaden an existing guest-worker program for agriculture. Some want to talk about “chain migration,” a pejorative phrase coined by immigration-restriction activists to describe how immigrants, once citizens, can petition to sponsor certain relatives, including siblings and parents, who want to immigrate. “When there’s consensus around an immigration reform plan,” Sparks said, “then I think something will happen.” Sparks also said that McCarthy’s office was open to learning more about Galvan’s work permit snafu to see if staff could help. Grimmway Farms in Kern County is the world’s largest grower of carrots. Its owners, prominent local donors to McCarthy, declined to comment on DACA. But Beatris Sanders, the executive director of the Kern County Farm Bureau, said that immigration issues “hit us really hard here in Kern. It’s a priority for us to have a working system.” She said the bureau maintains “open dialogue” with McCarthy but has no official position on DACA. “I don’t think anyone should penalize anyone because of something beyond their control,” she added. She also expressed sympathy for Galvan when she heard his story: “I know there are many, many stories like this out there,” Sanders said. The Kern County Republican Party declined to comment on DACA. In Porterville, Republican activist Susan Queen, who is a “100 percent Trump fan,” said she doesn’t think the DACA recipients, or Dreamers, should be removed from the country, and she doesn’t think Trump does either. “Obviously I have sympathy for the kids,” said Queen, 68, a member of the California Federation of Republican Women of Southeastern Tulare County. “I think there should be some sort of way to make them legal here, but I don’t know about citizens.” “My dad was a judge,” Queen explained, “and I don’t like rewarding anything illegal.” If the Dreamers are allowed to gain legal status, she said, perhaps they shouldn’t be allowed to bring in other family members later. It makes her mad, she said, to think about an old friend in Germany who wanted to live and work in the United States and couldn’t seem to ever get a visa. Queen’s family raised animals and had groves she picked oranges from as a kid, but she’s not in the farm business, and her children didn’t work in the fields. Central Valley citrus grower Manuel Cunha, who is no liberal when it comes to business regulations he considers excessive, is a longtime proponent of legalizing undocumented farmworkers who have been here for years. The director of the Nisei Farmers League in Fresno, north of Bakersfield, knows McCarthy well and has raised money for McCarthy and other prominent Republicans. “I’ve fundraised so much that we probably could have paid for immigration reform many times over,” Cunha said. “We’ve given up on some of our political people,” he said in exasperation. “The people who say the climate is not right for immigration or it’s not the right time. Oh, but come to our fundraiser.” Still, he was in Washington recently to visit with members of Congress and staff and talk about undocumented immigrant workers, DACA and the future. “Our rural communities are made up of thousands of these folks,” Cunha said. “They’re in school or working, and they have one parent in the fields or in the packinghouses,” Cunha said, “and maybe another is in construction.” “How simple it would be to do a DACA reform,” Cunha said. “You’ve vetted all of them already.” The current crop of young DACA recipients has already been checked for criminal records, has been fingerprinted and has paid into getting work permits. “Come on, Kevin, let’s get it done,” Cunha said. Because of the uncertainty, kids have come into his office sobbing, he said, because they couldn’t renew their permits, or they’re terrified about what’s next. In Bakersfield, the characterization of their parents as lawbreakers or invaders upsets Dreamers Eloisa Torres, 18, and Leydy Rangel, 22. Both traveled to Washington this fall twice on trips sponsored by the United Farm Workers union so they could tell their stories to staff and members of Congress who’d listen. “Your parents struggle,” said Torres, who wasn’t yet 2 when she arrived. “They’ve told me, ‘Become something.’” She said her father was often away to accept work he was offered in construction or in agricultural fields. She didn’t ask her parents for money to start college this year at California State University, Bakersfield. She collected cans to recycle to make initial payments and was relieved when tuition fees dropped because of state aid. She’s thinking about becoming a lawyer. Rangel, who grew up migrating from the Coachella Valley up through Bakersfield and beyond, picked grapes and pruned vines in the state’s vast vineyards as a child. In high school she convinced her parents to leave her alone in Coachella so she could stay and finish high school there and apply to college. She recently graduated from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. Every night, she worries about her parents getting deported. Another DACA recipient in Bakersfield, Ivan Gonzalez, now 22, managed to cap off his undocumented childhood by running his way to becoming the 800-meter state champion in high school. He won a full scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley. “People didn’t care about my citizenship status when I was running track,” said Gonzalez, whose choice to attend Berkeley was featured in local news. He’s back in Bakersfield after graduation and working at Youth 2 Leaders Education Foundation. He counsels parents and kids on options for college scholarships. California lawmakers, over the years, have gradually passed legislation to first allow undocumented students to attend state colleges and pay in-state tuition rather than out-of-state fees. Later legislation was passed to allow students to receive state aid, not federal, to help pay for tuition. Private scholarships are out there as well. “There are people who think we don’t belong here while eating what my people are picking,” Gonzalez said. He tells families to keep kids in school, no matter what happens to DACA. Ironically, Gonzalez also participates in citizenship workshops to help immigrants with legal permanent residency prepare for testing. “You don’t know how much I wish I were in your position,” he jokes with aspiring citizens he helps. For Luis Galvan, there’s no time to waste. He’s in a race to avoid having his DACA work permit expire. He’s talked to a lawyer and to Mission Asset Fund, a nonprofit group in San Francisco that provided the scholarship to pay his renewal fee. Tara Robinson, the fund’s chief development officer, said the fund issued more than 5,000 checks to DACA recipients and the majority were cashed by Homeland Security and yet, for unknown reasons, a small number weren’t. When Galvan received word from the department to resubmit his application and a new payment, he bought a money order, and Mission Asset Fund later reimbursed him. Then the rejection notice arrived. “Honestly, the first few days after that I couldn’t sleep,” he said. “My mom was crying most of the time. It’s hard. I just try holding it in.” The Center for Public Integrity is a nonprofit investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.

    "title": "Children Forced To 'Deal With It' And Bundle Up As Classrooms Lose Heat",
    "text": "When social studies teacher Jesse Schneiderman arrived at school after the holiday break on Tuesday, he found a dangerous environment waiting for his students. Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore was in shambles. Pipes that had just been turned back on had burst, leaving some rooms flooded. Heating vents weren’t working. Entire rooms were destroyed and inaccessible. Plus, it was bitterly cold. Schneiderman told HuffPost that temperatures inside the school building were in the 30s when he arrived, and still in the 40s on Wednesday. Photos on Twitter showed students across the city suffering as a result. Some of the pictures sent to us of Baltimore City Students at school today. The question now is will it be warmer in classes tomorrow? pic.twitter.com/zRPKGANmj5 “It felt like a disaster movie,” Schneiderman said. “You had a lot of kids who were wearing hats and coats and gloves in classes.” Infrastructure problems were compounded by a storm front that’s already bringing snow, freezing temperatures and heavy winds to the East Coast. The weather is supposed to get worse Wednesday night and through Thursday. Baltimore City Public Schools acknowledged the problems at Frederick Douglass High School and others across the city and closed them down on Tuesday and Wednesday, though Schneiderman said that decision was too late. “We have many schools with leaky windows and outdated heating systems that have a hard time keeping up,” city schools spokeswoman Edie House-Foster told The Baltimore Sun. “With extreme temperatures, we have the added challenge of freezing pipes and water main breaks.” We (teachers) just got an email that schools are open to provide services to kids and teachers need to deal with it, basically. Obviously the kids need it, but good policy isn’t using teachers’ love of kids to make us work in unsafe conditions. Heating issues are plaguing schools up and down the East Coast, leaving parents and educators furious. Vanessa Scott kept her kids home on Wednesday after they reported that their school bus and classrooms at Red Springs High School in Red Springs, North Carolina, had no heat. Parts of the state saw temperatures as low as 10 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday morning, right before the first day of class in the new year. Robeson County Schools didn’t return calls for comment, but its website acknowledged that students were in danger: “While we try to avoid disrupting regular school schedules as it may inconvenience some parents, staff and students, the decision to close schools early are made when there is a clear indication that weather conditions could endanger the safety of children and staff,” the announcement read. Scott didn’t get that alert, and was upset that she had to personally make the call to keep her kids home. Plus, she said, this is an ongoing problem. “My kids wear two jackets to school during winter,” she said, noting that the district should “fix the heat or pay the doctor bill if they get sick.” For cities like Baltimore, this isn’t a heat issue ― it’s a matter of inequality and state funding, Schneiderman said. Cold classrooms highlight the problem of inadequate public school funding, but fixing infrastructure that’s been ignored for years could take a long time, if it happens at all.

Asked how kids can go back to school if their classrooms are flooded and without heat, Schneiderman replied, “I honestly don’t know.” “It’s systemic problems with old buildings,” he said. “The pipes are old, the buildings are old; it’s just intense.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this story referred to Baltimore City Public Schools as Baltimore County Public Schools.

    "title": "Ed Westwick Replaced In BBC Drama Amid Sexual Assault Allegations",
    "text": "The BBC just pulled a Ridley Scott for its upcoming adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel, “Ordeal by Innocence.” Former “Gossip Girl” star Ed Westwick was set to star in the series, but has since been replaced by actor Christian Cooke after three women accused Westwick of sexual assault, the network announced on Friday, according to Variety. All of Westwick’s scenes will be reshot later this month with co-stars Bill Nighy, Anna Chancellor, Matthew Goode and Eleanor Tomlinson. The premiere of the three-part drama series was initially intended to air on Dec. 26, but was postponed indefinitely in November in the wake of accusations by actress Kristina Cohen, as well as two other women, Aurélie Wynn and Rachel Eck.

The independent production company making ‘White Gold’ has informed us that Ed Westwick has paused from filming while he deals with these allegations.” Westwick has since emphatically denied the allegations, while the Los Angeles Police Department continues an investigation into the claims.

    "title": "Education is the kindling of a flame: How to reinvent the 21st-century university",
    "text": "“Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.” This quote from Plutarch is as true today as it was two thousand years ago. Still, the misconception of education as a vessel-filling activity remains. In this column, I outline an idea that could reshape our universities while also prototyping new ways of addressing urgent societal challenges. The kindling of the flame that Plutarch talked about has never been more relevant than now. Last week my column focused on 2017: Last week I suggested that such an upgrade of our societal operating system (OS) should include advancing and transforming our economies, our democracies, and our education systems. It is the latter that I focus on in this column: how to how to reinvent our institutions of higher education through their transformation from an ivory-towered into a distributed eco-system for societal renewal. The difficulties we have in meeting today’s global challenges, such as implementing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) worldwide, are not caused by a knowledge gap. We have all the knowledge we need. The problem is a knowing-doing gap: a disconnect between our collective consciousness and our collective actions. In most societal systems we collectively create results that (almost) nobody wants. Examples: the ecological divide (the self-nature disconnect), the social divide (the self-other disconnect), and the spiritual divide (the self-self disconnect—that is, the disconnect between my current and my emerging future self). These gaps and divides are amplified by the silo structure of our key institutions and the mindset of the decision makers that operate inside them. To address these issues at their root requires two things: new platforms for cross-sector co-creation and an upgrade in the operating system that people use to collaborate—practices that facilitate a shift from ego-system to eco-system awareness. Figure 1 maps the landscape of options for such an operating system. In our research we have identified four different operating systems—in other words, four fields of attention that social systems can operate from: habitual, ego-systemic, empathic, eco-systemic. Figure 1: Matrix of Vertical Social Evolution (Source: O. Scharmer, The Essentials of Theory U) Since I have presented the Matrix of Social Evolution in much more detail elsewhere, allow me here to stick to its essence: the matrix shows that we are stuck with our collective knowing-doing gap because we try to solve level 4 problems with an operating system that runs on OS 1.0, 2.0, or OS 3.0. But, as we learned from Einstein, you cannot solve problems at the same level of thinking and consciousness that created them. The result of that mismatch is on display every single day: more problems lead to more felt pressure and frustrations, which lead to more destruction and “absencing” (to use the language of last week’s column), which in turn lead to more problems, felt pressure, frustrations, and so forth. That in a nutshell is our vertical development challenge: how to move from the vicious cycle of reacting to disruption powered by OS 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 to a generative response that is powered by 4.0—that is, by a process of co-creating the future. The lack of vertical literacy is the main problem in our universities and schools today. Talk to experienced CEOs and CPOs (chief people officers) of major companies and ask them what they need. They commonly say: people, teams, and leaders that can make our organization thrive in a world of VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity). By that, I believe they mean people and capacities that can take their organization into the 4.0 world in which they respond to disruption by co-sensing and co-shaping the future. Then go to universities and talk to faculty and deans of management and engineering schools. Many, maybe most, are rather illiterate when it comes to vertical development. They think mostly in terms of horizontal development—for example, about adding another skill here or another app or course there. They do not think in terms of upgrading the entire educational OS—of our students, our learners, and our societal systems. But if you think about it, if we follow Plutarch, I believe that the only reason universities exist in the first place is to provide vertical developmental literacy. Especially now. If you want the app, you just go to an online learning store like edx.org and get your free knowledge download. Done! You don’t need a physical university for that. The primary reason we have universities and other institutions of higher education today is to support the development of vertical literacy. That means creating a learning environment in which the learner can step into his or her highest future potential in the context of hands-on societal challenges. In our experience, this requires us, as learners, to upgrade the way we pay attention and listen, to upgrade the way we converse, dialogue, and think, to upgrade the way we organize and coordinate in the context of VUCA shaped environments. Everything else is secondary. Vertical literacy gives us the vocabulary and capacities to: How do we build vertical literacy at scale? Well, not by placing learners inside lecture halls. And also not by separating out humanities, social sciences, and STEM into separate universes. That much we know. What it will take is nothing less than a complete reinvention of schooling and higher ed based on a new set of principles. Here is a first cut at a list of core ideas: (1) Co-initiate: Put the learner into the driver’s seat of profound societal change. The learner is not a consumer. She or he is a partner in making the world a better place. (2) Co-sense: Move the outer place of learning from the lecture hall to the real world. This isn’t just about action learning but also includes immersion journeys to the global hotspots of societal renewal across cultures. (3) Embodiment: Move the inner place of learning from the head to the heart, and from the heart to the hand. The essence of learning in this century revolves around activating the intelligence of the heart and then putting it to use in serving the needs of others and the whole. (4) Science 2.0: Bend the beam of scientific observation back onto the observing self. At the intersection between the old, dying civilization and the one that is being born is the transformation of science. Science 2.0 must integrate first-, second-, and third-person data by bending the beam of observation back onto the observing self. (5) Systems Thinking: Make the system see itself. Systems thinking is a core capacity of vertical literacy. Students must learn methods to make the system see itself. (6) Systems Sensing: Make the system sense itself. This is the core capacity to unlock collective creativity. Learners must become literate in “aesthetics” in its original meaning (aistesis means to sense): the cultivation of all our senses. (7) Systems Inversion: Transform the system through eco-system activation. All societal sectors go through similar institutional changes: from perpetuating systemic silos to cultivating generative social field in the context of their eco-systems. Learners need to be literate in facilitating this shift. (8) Know Thyself: To create vertical developmental literacy, we need to integrate science, social change, and self. Deepening our self knowledge requires us to access not only the intelligence of the open mind (curiosity), but also the intelligences of the open heart (compassion), and open will (courage). (9) Tend the Fire: To patiently elicit and draw out the unique qualities and expression of each person with perseverance and in support of his or her highest possible future. (10) The Fourth Teacher: Use nature and social fields as gateways. The Reggio Emilia approach is known for seeing the environment as the third teacher. Building on that we see the cultivation of profound learning relationships to nature and to social fields as gateways to the deeper sources of knowing (”the fourth teacher”). How can we build a 21st-century university that embodies these principles of vertical literacy, i.e., of awareness-based systems change? The answer will vary across contexts, cultures, and geographies. But in our experiments we have found the following five building blocks to be critical (Figure 2). Figure 2: The 21st-Century University: Five Building Blocks (1) Cross-Sector Innovation Labs Create cross-sector Innovation Labs that bring together key stakeholders and innovators who need each other in order to evolve the system they operate within. With our colleagues and partners, we have refined a lab process that generates remarkable results. (2) Cross-Intelligence Capacity Building Create massive online-to-offline mechanisms for complementing the labs and building the deeper capacities at scale (that means at marginal costs close to zero). With the u.lab MOOC we have prototyped a mechanism that combines the democratization of access to knowledge with the activation of the deep learning cycle. Some of the early key learnings from u.lab, which has attracted more than 100,000 registered participants from 185 countries since its launch in 2015, can be found here. (3) Awareness-Based Action Research: Deep Data Imaging Although “big data” has been useful in many parts of our daily lives, the algorithms that increasingly shape our reality have also became a liability that undermines some of society’s foundations (as discussed in last week’s column). We need to progress from big data to deep data. By deep data I mean data that advance vertical literacy by making us look at ourselves in a mirror, individually and collectively, by making us aware of our own patterns and blind spots, by making us see ourselves through the eyes of another or of the whole. An example of big data is your Facebook feed: Facebook filters out all news that it thinks does not match your world view (i.e., it keeps us stuck in our own echo chambers). Examples of deep data mirroring are the case clinics and global mindfulness practices described in the u.lab link above. Another mechanism for generating deep data (i.e., data that help us to see ourselves and to deepen our awareness) that we have developed over the past decade is Social Presencing Theater (SPT). SPT practices help complex stakeholder groups to see themselves and their evolutionary patterns through the mirror of the whole, thereby shifting their individual consciousness from ego-system to eco-system awareness. We are now working to develop SPT as a research methodology that allows people to visualize and understand the deep (and mostly invisible) structures of social change. We see the potential for SPT “scans” to do for social field research over the next decade what MRI scans did for mindfulness and neuroscience over the past decade. (4) A Community of Eco-System Catalysts The fourth building block deals with people. The best concept is worth nothing if the faculty do not embody these new forms and the principles of student-centered learning. The requirements of today’s tenure-track system put faculty on pathways that keep them far from the experiences that are most relevant to reinventing the type of education described here. We need a new faculty track for reflective practitioners who are more deeply involved in major projects of societal transformation and who can share their knowledge-in-action with students while also helping learners deepen their own capacities for embodied knowing. (5) Places, Platforms, and Practices for Making the System Sense Itself The fifth building block concerns places, platforms, and core practices. The piece most needed here is places: high-quality spaces that are designed and structured to build vertical literacy. Figure 2 summarizes these five building blocks that, if put into place, could prototype and accelerate the journey of higher ed institutions toward 4.0 worldwide—a journey that in many microcosms of higher ed has already begun to take shape. While I have been holding the vision of such a new university for some years, it is only now that I feel it is completely doable. To advance the journey toward realizing it, we—the core team of the u.lab and Presencing Institute community—will launch five major initiatives throughout 2018. (1) 4.0 Labs: Co-shaping the Future by Activating Generative Fields We will convene 4.0 Labs at both the country and the regional level. We are currently working with the government of the Netherlands and Scotland on prototyping a country-level lab. We intend to launch the European 4.0 Lab in June 2018. Each of these 4.0 Labs will co-define its own focus at the outset. With the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) we are discussing how to use 4.0 Labs to accelerate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on a country level. The key idea of all these labs is very simple: the next wave of innovation in food, farming, finance, health, learning, and leadership will be highly interrelated and sourced from a shared co-creative 4.0 territory (see Figure 3 below). Since no one can do this alone, we need to create cross-sectional infrastructures that support these initiatives on that journey. Figure 3: Four Evolutionary Stages: From 1.0 to 4.0 (Source: O. Scharmer, The Essentials of Theory U) (2) u.lab 2x: Transforming Our Economy Our second initiative will be launched in March 2018. A joint eco-system of sites and platforms among HuffPost and PI will capture and share the new economic narrative that is shifting the economy from ego to eco. Starting in April, each month our online platform will present inspiring, interactive, 60-minute live-broadcasts. Between the monthly live sessions we will hold global community cafés where change makers from across sectors, systems, and cultures can join the conversation. These will incorporate video-based discussions in small breakout groups and help us to move from traditional media and social media to more interactive and engaging forms of conversation, and from there to globally distributed ways of co-generating future media that change the world for the better. (3) Social Field Research Summer School The third initiative focuses on launching a research project that blends SPT practices, , and data-driven third-person research to investigate the deep structures of social fields. The focus in 2018 will be on establishing the research group and integrating these methodologies. Starting in 2019 an annual Berlin Summer School for Social Field Research will invite 50 leading awareness-based action researchers from around the world to work with each other and with senior thought leaders and investigators in their fields. The intention is to run the Berlin Summer School for 10 years in order to do for awareness-based field research what the Mind and Life Institute did for mindfulness and neuroscience: establish a new domain of research and replicate it worldwide. (4) Eco-system Catalyst Masterclass The fourth initiative, the masterclass for eco-system catalysts, will target the most advanced practitioners and activators of social eco-systems of innovation in order to help them advance their skills, mirror and support each other on their journey of Self, and interweave their respective innovation ecologies across regions, sectors, and cultures. This masterclass will be a year-long journey limited to 50 participants. The first cohort will start its journey in Boston in October 2018. As a group they will activate and cultivate a globally distributed innovation ecology. From that group we expect a new breed of young faculty to emerge who are literate across all of the intelligences discussed above. (5) u.school The fifth initiative focuses on upgrading our place- and web-based infrastructures to better serve the evolving needs of our rapidly growing global community. One key focus is on finding physical campus areas for all of the above (which together will constitute the “u.school”). The first conversations for such a campus are happening in Berlin. The longer term intention is to establish campus areas in all major cultures and geographies. These u.school campuses will partner with multiple universities to co-deliver a curriculum in vertical societal literacy across all system levels (Figure 1 matrix) and then create open source resources that allow for the replication of this curriculum in universities worldwide. Figure 4: Actualizing the New University: Five Initiatives The classical university was based on the unity of research and teaching. The modern university has been based on the unity of research, teaching, and application. The emerging 21st-century university, I believe, will be based on the unity of research, teaching, and civilizational renewal. To transform higher education into its most advanced evolutionary state requires nothing less than a full inversion of its traditional discipline structure toward 4.0 ways of innovating and learning. The purpose of education is not to fill vessels. It’s also not to spurn people who diligently rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic. The purpose of the 21st-century education and university is to help us develop what matters most: vertical literacy—the capacity to sense and actualize our highest future possibility in the face of disruption.

For it is this flame—the flame of the creative human spirit—that at no point in the history of our planet has been so at risk, so attainable, and so necessary for addressing our ecological, social, and spiritual divides. We need intentional places to kindle, cultivate and evolve that flame. At the entrance to the Academy of Athens there was an inscription that said: Let no one enter here who does not know math and geometry. What should the inscription be at the entrance to the new university that we aspire to create today, 2,400 years later? Maybe it could read: Let no one enter here who does not know that the issues outside are a mirror of the issues inside; i.e., let no one enter here who is vertically illiterate. The new university comes into being—the flame is kindling—wherever and whenever we bend the beam of collective attention back onto ourselves, whenever we shift our awareness from ego to eco in order to regenerate our economic, democratic, and educational systems from that awareness and source.

    "title": "Two People Detained In Egypt's Anti-Gay Crackdown Are Freed On Bail",
    "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Two people detained in Egypt in October after allegedly waving a rainbow flag, a symbol of same-sex rights, at a concert have been freed on bail, a lawyer representing them and a human rights NGO said on Tuesday. Sarah Hegazy, 28, and Ahmed Alaa, 21, were released and fined 2,000 Egyptian pounds ($113) each, lawyer Amr Mohamed said. The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information also reported their release on its Twitter account. It was unclear when their trial would resume. Hegazy and Alaa were among dozens of people detained in the conservative Muslim country last year on charges that included “promoting sexual deviancy.” The crackdown was a response to a rare show of public support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights in Egypt. At a Sept. 22 concert packed with 30,000 people and headlined by Mashrou’ Leila, a Lebanese alternative rock band whose lead singer is openly gay, a small group of concertgoers raised a rainbow flag. Local media said homosexuals were receiving foreign funding, and hosted callers who compared their threat to Islamic State. Egypt, a key Western ally in the Middle East, has been under fire internationally for its human rights record. Police, state-aligned media and the religious establishment all regard it as a public duty to combat the spread of homosexuality.

    "text": "Ellen DeGeneres says Eric Trump’s suggestion she may be part of the “deep state” working to undermine his father’s administration is “the craziest thing.” In a clip shared online Wednesday night, the talk show host humorously addressed this tweet that President Donald Trump’s second son posted the previous evening: Shocking... once again, here are the @Twitter “suggestions” of who I should follow. #DeepState pic.twitter.com/6XYUS02j34 Trump’s tweet that Twitter’s “who to follow” suggestions ― including Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama and DeGeneres ― represented the “deep state” prompted widespread ridicule. “It’s just the craziest thing I’ve seen all week, because I saw that movie with the lady having sex with the fish and still this beats that,” said DeGeneres. Eric Trump’s claim is “ridiculous” because “no one has undermined Donald Trump more than Donald Trump,” DeGeneres added. While “honored” that Eric Trump may think she was “powerful enough to be part of a government conspiracy,” DeGeneres said she didn’t “have that kind of time.” “I’ve got my gay agenda meetings on Mondays. I’ve got on Wednesday Beyoncé, and I host an illuminati brunch, and then Portia (De Rossi) and I on the weekends are desperately trying to have a baby,” she joked. DeGeneres later put forward her own theory for why Twitter was suggesting that Eric Trump follow her. “I mean it could be a conspiracy, or it could be because your sister, Ivanka, follows me on Twitter, and your sister, Tiffany, follows me on Twitter. And maybe you should follow me.” Why? Because she does “post a lot of cute videos.” Check out the full clip below. I woke up to discover I was part of a government conspiracy called #DeepState.

    "text": "Christmas cards can lie, but Khloe Kardashian’s eyes apparently do not. In her first public appearance since confirming her pregnancy after months of speculation, the reality TV star stopped by “The Ellen Show” on Thursday and tried to play coy about sister Kylie Jenner expecting a baby of her own. But host Ellen DeGeneres, of course, was having absolutely none of it. She walked away from the encounter with Kardashian fully convinced the Lip Kit mogul sister is, in fact, pregnant and, honestly, we are too. Jenner is expecting her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott, multiple outlets confirmed in September, and is rumored to have a due date sometime in February. But she’s yet to confirm the news herself, and has seemingly gone into hiding, scaling back her social media presence and refusing to appear in public. During a discussion about Kardashian’s pregnancy cravings, DeGeneres tried to pivot to young Jenner’s pregnancy. “Oh I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Kardashian, clearly covering up something, said. Then DeGeneres actually pulled out a phone to try and get the Good American designer to call her sister on the spot, but, alas Kardashian hadn’t memorized any of Jenner’s numbers. “She must be pregnant. There’s too much secrecy around it,” DeGeneres deduced. “Look at your eyes. Y’all, she’s pregnant. I can tell by her eyes.” “I will make a bet right now,” she added. DeGeneres eventually let Kardashian off the hook on Kylie, and got her to spill on names she’s considering for her own baby. Watch another clip of Kardashian below.

    "text": "Wanda J. Culp— Tlingit, Artist, Activist, WECAN Coordinator Tongass ProjectErnestine Hayes — Tlingit, Professor, AuthorBernadine DeAsis — Environmental Specialist, Douglas Indian Association Tribal GovernmentLoretta Marvin — Tlingit, Thunderbird Clan from the Sun HouseErnestine Hanlon-Abel —Tlingit, Indigenous basket weaver, Old-Growth AdvocateJerry Ann Gray — Tlingit-Tsimshian Indigenous Woman Our people, the Tlingit and Haida, have lived in what is now known as the Tongass National Forest in Southeast Alaska since time immemorial. Today our treasured forest faces one of its greatest and most immediate threats to date. As the end of the year approached, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) introduced two legislative budget riders aimed at allowing thousands of acres of old-growth forest in the Tongass (and the Chugach National Forest) to be clear-cut. As indigenous women whose ancestors are from this forest, we vigorously oppose these attacks on our public lands. In the coming days, we urge lawmakers to reject these riders, and instead maintain the existing protections for our ancient forest and its peoples. The U.S. Forest Service and the timber industry should have stopped destroying our ancient forest a long time ago. Our original and historic use and occupancy of the Tongass is essential to our people’s identity and culture as our people have depended upon the bounty of the forest and its waters for millennia. Our matrilineal societies are built from the Laws of Living Nature. Our relationship with the ancient trees of the Tongass extends beyond concepts of wild, untamed, peaceful, quiet, spiritual, and beautiful — for us, the forest is life. This spiritual, physical, and cultural connection to the land allowed our ancestors to thrive when we were the only ones in this forest. And to this day, our people depend on the healthy watersheds and abundant fish and wildlife habitat found in Alaska’s old-growth forests. Sen. Murkowski’s pro-logging rider would exempt Alaska from the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule, which protects wild and roadless areas in our national forests and prevents logging companies from clear-cutting roads into our wild lands and sacred places. These are some of most important areas of the Tongass because our forest is already threatened by the effects of decades of old-growth logging and now global warming. We depend on these areas and their vast expanses of the great Spruce, Hemlock, and Red and Yellow Cedar. Continued indigenous existence depends wholly on the good health of the wild Tongass in its entirety and that means wild and roadless areas must continue to be protected from industrial exploitation. Sen. Murkowski’s other rider seeks to repeal the Tongass Forest Plan, which is equally threatening. Our connection to the land is so paramount that the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act gives each of us a legal voice in the management of the forest. During the planning process for the forest plan, we called on the Forest Service to end old-growth logging on the Tongass in an effort to protect our forest and our way of life. After years of public process, the Forest Service adopted a plan that protects roadless areas and other unique, biologically diverse areas from logging, and, though not fast enough, it begins to transition the Tongass away from old-growth logging altogether. Sen. Murkowski’s efforts to eliminate these protections and reject the long-overdue transition away from old-growth logging ignores our voices and our people.

    "title": "Eric Holder 'Disturbed' By Jeff Sessions' Silence In The Face Of Trump's DOJ Attacks",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Former Attorney General Eric Holder said he’s “disturbed” by the silence of current Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the wake of President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Justice Department and the FBI. Holder made the comment on Wednesday following Trump’s renewed criticism of what he called the “Deep State Justice Dept.” In a Tuesday tweet, the president urged the department to take action against “Comey and others,” a reference to former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into whether Trump’s presidential campaign had colluded with Russian officials until Trump fired him in May. The president also said that a top aide to 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton should be jailed. Holder, who served under then-President Barack Obama, called Trump’s repeated slams of the Justice Department “unfounded.” “When you try to delegitimize a probe, when you try to delegitimize the FBI, that has long-term collateral consequences,” Holder told HuffPost after attending Wednesday’s swearing-in of Alabama’s newest senator, Doug Jones. “I’m disturbed by that, and I’m equally disturbed I’ve seen nothing from this attorney general to defend the people of the Justice Department who are patriots and who do their jobs without any regard to partisan politics. They need to be defended.” Trump has often criticized Sessions for recusing himself from supervising the Russia probe. Last week, the president claimed in a New York Times interview that he has the “absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department.” Holder, meanwhile, has used his platform on Twitter to go after Sessions, who has rolled back several Holder-era initiatives, like his push to reform drug sentencing and his efforts to strengthen the department’s civil rights division. The former attorney general has also criticized GOP lawmakers for pushing voter ID laws and other measures that make it more difficult to vote, an effort he has called “shameful.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Shocking... once again, here are the @Twitter “suggestions” of who I should follow. #DeepState pic.twitter.com/6XYUS02j34 The “deep state” conspiracy theory, which has been repeatedly pushed by the president, revolves around the idea that a deep-rooted civil service is working to delegitimize his administration.

    "title": "Essence Is Once Again A 100 Percent Black-Owned Company",
    "text": "Essence magazine has officially parted ways with Time Inc., making it a fully black-owned company for the first time in nearly two decades. Essence Ventures, a company launched last year by Sundial Brands co-founder Richelieu Dennis, announced Wednesday that it had acquired Essence Communications. Michelle Ebanks will remain the magazine’s president and is set to join the board of directors, the company said in a statement. Members of the executive team, which is made up entirely of black women, are to have an equity stake in business. “This acquisition of Essence represents the beginning of an exciting transformation of our iconic brand as it evolves to serve the needs and interests of multigenerational black women around the world in an even more elevated and comprehensive way across print, digital, e-commerce and experiential platforms,” Ebanks said in a statement. “In addition, it represents a critical recognition, centering and elevation of the black women running the business from solely a leadership position to a co-ownership position.” Essence was founded in 1970 as a publication to cater to black women. Forty-nine percent of the magazine was sold to Time Inc. in 2000, and the remaining 51 percent was sold to the media company five years later. The new acquisition makes Essence one of the only legacy African-American publications to currently be under black ownership. “We remain committed to leveraging our resources to provide opportunities for other culturally-rooted entrepreneurs and businesses that further our culture and create economic opportunities for our communities,” Dennis said in a statement, noting that his company is “excited” to return the platform to black ownership.

    "title": "Ethiopia To Release All Political Prisoners In Bid To Foster Reconciliation",
    "text": "ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia will release politicians jailed on charges including involvement in terrorism, its prime minister said on Wednesday ― an unexpected shift in stance from the government, which has denied accusations it uses security concerns to stifle dissent. Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said the move was intended to “foster national reconciliation.” It follows recent protests over land rights and repression and ethnic clashes, and comes amid a political crisis that has seen some senior officials resign from the ruling party. “Politicians currently under prosecution and those previously sentenced will either have their cases annulled or be pardoned,” Hailemariam told domestic news outlets in the capital. He did not give further details. The Horn of Africa country has been wracked by violence for almost three years, with protests first breaking out in its Oromiya province over allegations of land grabs. Several dissident politicians have since been jailed having been charged with involvement in terrorism and collusion with the secessionist Oromo Liberation Front, which the government has branded a terrorist group. Nearly 700 people died in one bout of unrest during months of protests in 2015 and 2016, according to a parliament-mandated investigation. Rallies over land rights then broadened into demonstrations over political restrictions and perceived rights abuses, including the incarceration of Merera Gudina and Bekele Gerba ― leaders of the opposition group the Oromo Federalist Congress. In recent months, a spate of ethnic clashes have also taken place. Dozens of people were killed in several bouts of violence between ethnic Oromos and Somalis in the Oromiya region last year. Hailemariam’s announcement came after the ruling EPRDF coalition concluded a weeks-long meeting meant to thrash out policies to address grievances. The unrest had triggered growing friction within the party. Two high-ranking members subsequently submitted their resignation, while officials have openly squabbled with each other over the cause of clashes. Ethiopia, sandwiched between volatile Somalia and Sudan, is often accused of regularly using security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent and media freedoms.

    "title": "The Biggest Cause Of Preventable Blindness Just Won't Go Away",
    "text": "This article is part of HuffPost’s Project Zero campaign, a yearlong series on neglected tropical diseases and efforts to fight them. TOGA, Ethiopia ― Fresh out of sight-saving eyelid surgery, Bugune sat fragile and exhausted on a bench in the shade, her son Birhane by her side. “I was in such pain,” said the mother of six, wrapped in a shawl and with a thick bandage across her face, as she recalled the agony of recent months. Since 2015, her eyelashes had been curling into her eye, rubbing and scratching against the cornea until it was too painful to lift the lids to see. “I had tears falling from my eyes, but it hurt too much to wipe them. I had a headache all the time, so I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t go to the market; I couldn’t go to weddings.” Bugune had been suffering from trachoma, a bacterial eye infection that is the world’s leading cause of preventable blindness but that has long been neglected — especially in Ethiopia, which is home to the largest population of sufferers by far. The country is today the last major frontier in the global battle against the disease, but, despite recent efforts, public understanding of the disease and its causes remains poor — pushing the goal of elimination just beyond reach. “I thought I was never going to see again,” Bugane said of the agonizing uncertainty of previous weeks. “I was so scared.” Trachoma has been around for millennia. Traces of it have been found in the eyelids of Egyptian mummies, and it was once common across much of Europe and America. But today the disease is almost entirely confined to the world’s poorest countries, in particular the hot, arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Women, as primary caregivers, suffer disproportionately because children are more likely to be infected. And women are four times more likely than men to need surgery. “It is a disease of poverty,” explained Teshome Gebre, the International Trachoma Initiative’s regional director for Africa, in his office in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. “You don’t find it in the developed world or even the developing world.” Of the 42 countries where trachoma is still present, Ethiopia has more than 30 percent of Africa’s already disproportionate burden. About 75 million Ethiopians — three-quarters of the population — live in trachoma-endemic areas, while the backlog of people urgently needing surgery for trachiasis, the advanced form of the disease, last year reached 693,000, the largest number of any country in the world. Bugune’s village of Toga is in the central region of Oromia, about four miles from the provincial boomtown of Shashamane, where the disease is typically much less common. “The further you go from the main road, the more prevalent trachoma is,” explained Oumer Shafi Abdurahman, former director of Ethiopia’s Neglected Tropical Diseases program and now project manager for Stronger-SAFE, a Wellcome Trust-funded initiative led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that aims to increase understanding of the disease. In some villages in the bushland surrounding Shashamane, where Oumer works, as many as 9 out of 10 children can be infected at any one time. Yet trachoma is easily treatable with antibiotics and simple surgery, and the campaign to eliminate it by 2020, the World Health Organization’s global target, should be attainable, some experts believe. Since 2012, Ethiopia has made significant strides, in particular by pioneering the Global Trachoma Mapping Project, the largest survey of an infectious disease, by using mobile phones and GPS signals to collate the country’s first national trachoma database. The survey found that more than 90 percent of districts in Ethiopia have trachoma at critical levels, a revelation that helped spur the government and its donors to taking more decisive action. In 2014, the federal minister of health announced a $1.7 million “fast-track initiative” to clear the then-estimated backlog of more than 800,000 people in need of surgery by the end of 2016, in part by training specialists to perform surgery at clinics across the country. With the help of organizations like the Fred Hollows Foundation, it has also embarked upon a vast program of drug distribution, doling out antibiotics to entire communities — every man, woman and child — in order to curb transmission. Ethiopia’s health extension program has advanced rapidly in a decade, with some 6,000 clinics and 48,000 extension workers nationwide making it possible to deliver doses of antibiotics to the most remote parts of the country. In Oromia alone, nearly 7 million doses of antibiotics were delivered in 2016 —reaching 94 percent of a targeted population — and a similar number have been reached this year. “Even though it is a very poor country, the system has worked” to deliver a mass antibiotic program, Oumer said. “And now that surgery is freely available, almost everywhere, there’s no reason for someone to go blind because of trachoma.” For a country that 15 years ago had no national program to combat the disease and very little commitment from the central government, this is a remarkable turnaround. The question now is whether Ethiopia can join the ranks of other countries that have recently eliminated trachoma. Yet many are doubtful because, despite improvements, progress has not been as swift as they had hoped. Bugune and her family knew little about trachoma, despite the government’s public awareness campaign. In their circular, thatched-roof homestead less than a mile from the health center, Bugune’s husband, Araba, would remove the eyelashes manually, one by one. He urged her to visit the doctor, but for months she refused. Neither knew of the strong link between transmission and poor hygiene: Bugane said she thought her eye problems were caused by smoke in the house, and her husband agreed. “I don’t need to learn this,” he said. “When there is smoke in the house people get trachoma.” Their neighbors were similarly uncertain. Their son Birhane suggested that light reflected from car windows might cause eye problems. But it is more than just lack of public awareness that is slowing progress. “Compared to the scale of the investment, the results have not been as expected,” Oumer admitted. “In the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which has had mass treatment for over seven years, it simply should have gone by now.” One reason, he thinks, is that trachoma’s biology is still poorly understood by the scientific community. “What we don’t know is probably more than we do know.” His Stronger-SAFE team is trying to work out precisely what lies behind transmission so that prevention methods can become more effective. The Shashamane-based researchers are examining local behavior, including water use, overcrowding and hygiene standards in affected villages, to try to pinpoint the causes. Some experts, for example, wonder whether its extreme prevalence in Ethiopia is a result of cultural factors, such as washing habits or diet. Others think that only economic development, particularly improved water access and sanitation, can wipe out the disease. Oumer disagrees. “There’s no reason why it shouldn’t go here. There are poor countries with no trachoma. There must be something we are doing wrong.” In November 2012, the WHO validated Oman as having eliminated trachoma, while China, Gambia, Ghana, Iran, Morocco and Myanmar have also claimed victory in recent years. (It was considered eliminated in the U.S. by the mid-20th century.) Oumer and others doubt Ethiopia can meet the 2020 target, though he thinks that elimination of trichiasis — the advanced form of the disease that caused Bugune’s eyelashes to grow inward — might still be within reach. Bugune, meanwhile, is fatalistic. She is not, after all, the only one in her family to have suffered. Her brother’s wife recently had successful surgery on her right eye, but now the other eye is infected. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Viral Video Claims People Can Stop Being Gay If They Pray Hard Enough",
    "text": "An evangelical Christian group is using social media to promote the scientifically discredited and flat-out lethal idea that gay, lesbian, or bisexual people can change their sexual orientation if they pray hard enough. Anchored North, a conservative Christian charity, tells the story of a young woman named Emily Thomes in a video titled “Love is Love.” Thomes says that after studying the Bible and repenting of her sins, she was able to leave her “super wild” life as a lesbian and marry a man. The video appears to be designed to attract the attention of young queer people or teens who are questioning their sexuality. “Love is Love” is a phrase often used to promote acceptance of LGBTQ relationships. Anchored North also used a rainbow flag in the video’s thumbnail, appropriating what has become a unifying symbol of the gay rights movement. The first few moments of the video seem innocent enough ― with scenes of teens dancing to catchy party music and two girls laughing and holding hands while walking down a street. Thomes is presented as a relatable narrator, introducing herself as someone who fell in love with a girl when she was 15 and soon started proudly identifying as gay. But, despite the video’s friendlier packaging, Thomes claims that queer people can change their sexual orientation if they try. “People say to me all the time, ‘I was born this way.’ I say, OK, yeah, me too,’” she says at one point in the video. “You’re not born with right affections. That’s why Jesus had to come. You feeling a desire for sin just proves you need grace like me.” “Even though the world would paint a totally different story about what sexuality is and isn’t, God’s word is clear and he can save and he does and he will,” she adds. Since Anchored North’s video went live on Dec. 28, it has racked up 1.5 million views and is by far the group’s most popular Facebook video. Anchored North is a 501(c)(3) California-based charity that churns out flashy Christian social media content. The group clams they are “next generation evangelists.” They are dedicated to reaching young people where they are ― on social media. In the past, the company has created videos about women recovering from abortion or forgiving their rapists. The kind of “transformation” that Anchored North is promising is often linked to a practice known as gay conversion therapy. This type of counseling attempts to change a person’s sexual orientation to fit heterosexual standards, and is often motivated by religious principles. Gay conversion therapy has been thoroughly discredited by all major mental health associations. The American Psychological Association states that efforts to change sexual orientation through therapy carry “serious potential to harm young people,” since the tactics used often “frame the inability to change one’s sexual orientation as a personal and moral failure.” Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth are also almost five times more likely to have attempted suicide than their heterosexual peers. Thomes, an “ex-lesbian” Christian speaker, defended the video in a series of Facebook posts over the past few days. On Tuesday, she went so far as to compare queer relationships to everything from domestic violence to murder. She also suggested that queer people are destined for hell. “Should you stop beating your wife even if you really want to continue? YES. Should you not kill someone even if you’re really wanting to go through with it? YES. Should you get clean if you have a drug problem and are destroying yourself and those who love you even if you still like getting high? YES. Should you stop cheating on your spouse even if you like the attention you’re getting from someone else? YES.” “If you are waiting on God to make your flesh no longer what scripture says it’ll always be, you will spend eternity separated from Him,” she added. Anchored North’s views about sexual orientation reflect the views of most white evangelical Protestants, one of the Christian groups least likely to say in polls that homosexuality should be accepted by society. Mainstream evangelicals tend to hold the belief that marriage was defined by God in the Bible and that Christian sexual ethics have changed little over the past 2,000 years. But the tide is turning. Surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center and the Public Religion Research Institute, or PRRI, show that evangelicals are slowly growing more accepting of queer sexuality ― and that this growth is largely driven by millennials. In 2016, PRRI found that a slim majority (51 percent) of young white evangelical Protestants supported same-sex marriage. Amelia Markham, a queer Christian activist for The Reformation Project, told HuffPost that for an increasing number of Christians, affirming queer sexuality isn’t about “following our feelings” and dismissing the authority of the Bible. “Even conservative Bible scholars concede that good Bible interpretation requires considering the historical, physical, and cultural circumstances that the text is written under,” she wrote in an email. “It then follows that, per the tradition established under Jesus in the New Covenant, echoed quite loudly throughout the last two millennia of the church history, new information should lead Christians to new understanding.” “We don’t jettison the text, we dig deeper and allow it to interrogate us, our prejudices, and ... all the ways that we have cut God down so that our boundaries of who is in and who is out can be maintained.” Brandan Robertson, a queer Christian writer and pastor, told HuffPost that for him, Anchored North’s video shows the damaging effects of fear-driven and anti-queer interpretations of Christianity. While he doesn’t doubt Thomes’ story about her past, he strongly opposes the idea that God desires to turn all LGBTQ people straight. “In the video, you see a young woman stricken by fear and confusion, stemming from non-affirming Christian doctrines, and the power that the fear had to drive her to seek to change her lifestyle,” Robertson wrote in an email. “A more robust, Christ-centered Christian theology would lead us to understand that God is all gracious, all merciful, and extends forgiveness and love to absolutely everyone.” “God has created a vast array of human beings, not one of which is identical to another. And in our diversity ― including diversity of sexuality and gender identity ― God’s glory is revealed.” And for young queer evangelicals, who may be among the 1.5 million people who viewed the video online, Robertson has this piece of advice: “God is love, and in God, there is no retributive judgment ― this is the beauty of grace. So feel liberated to explore yourself, your sexuality, and refuse to buy into any narrative of fear or judgment ― it’s not of God,” he said. “More importantly, you are fearfully and wonderfully made in the image of an eternally diverse God, and in your diversity, you most perfectly reflect God’s divinity. Lean into your queerness, lean into that which makes you unique. And as you do, listen intently for the voice of the Holy Spirit speaking over you, [saying] ‘You are my beloved child, with whom I am well pleased.’” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Exactly What Those Words On Your Beauty Products Mean",
    "text": "The beauty world can be a bit of a minefield. New products are launched daily, and along with them comes a whole new vocabulary. Words like hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic, natural and organic are some of the most frequently used terms to describe the ingredients in products. But do we know what they actually mean? Dr. Anita Sturnham, GP, put it this way: “You wouldn’t eat a plate of food without checking what was on your plate, so you should have that same mentality with your skin care.” Read on for a no-nonsense breakdown of what some of the most common beauty jargon out there really means. Hypoallergenic is a broad term that means a product is less likely to cause an allergic reaction. But it's in no way a guarantee. Tracey Wilmot, the training and education director for Murad, explains: \"Allergies and irritations are a complex response, which is unfortunate but can be anything from natural or synthetic ingredients, preservatives, fragrances, and a multitude of other reasons according to our unique and individual makeup and lifestyle. No company can claim that a product will not cause a reaction and there are no allergy-proof products.\" There is also no industry or legal standard governing the use of the term hypoallergenic, so if you see a product labeled this way, take it as a guide, not a guarantee. You’ve probably seen this term on products meant for blemishes, acne and oily skin. Wilmot says, “Comedo/comedones is the word for blackheads, so non-comedogenic means that the formula is designed not to clog pores, but it does not guarantee the product won’t cause breakouts.” However, there are no guidelines in place for regulating a product’s claim to be non-comedogenic. If blackheads and blocked pores are a concern for you, make sure you are cleansing thoroughly day and night. Avoid heavy, long-wear foundations if possible and look for gels or water-based skin products rather than rich or oily creams. \"It's a research study conducted in order to see if a product is safe and effective under strict scientific standards,\" says Andrea Pfeffer, the founder of the Pfeffer Sal clinic in London. In regard to just how meticulously participants are monitored during a trial, Pfeffer says, \"The product will be tested rigorously under exact industry standards to prove that it performs as it promises to. Be that reducing the appearance of fine lines, or boosting hydration, these trials are where that data is received and recorded. These trials are done to prove the results of the products. They're focused on data, efficacy and safety.\" Ever seen a brand make a claim like: “94 percent of women said their skin looked healthier after using [insert product name]”? Well, that probably means the brand has carried a consumer trial. How do clinical and consumer trials differ? Pfeffer explains: “Consumer trials are the introduction of a product to a chosen group of consumers and are a way for them to try a new product before they decide to purchase it. It also allows the business to gauge the potential success of products before committing to a full launch. They are not done for data and proof but more for spreading the word about the new product.” A consumer trial isn’t based on the scientific evidence of results but rather on the response from potential customers. The pool of people tested varies, too. “Some companies test nationwide or just a selected group of 50, making it hard to determine the scope of skin conditions who will try the product,” adds Pfeffer. “The easiest way to remember this is that clinical trials are fact. Consumer trials are opinion.” Over the past decade, we’ve seen a rise in demand for natural beauty. Dr. Sturnham defines the term: “A product is considered ‘natural’ when it contains ingredients that are sourced from nature, rather than created synthetically in a lab.” However it’s a notoriously grey area of the industry, as there’s no hard or agreed-upon definition or single governing body. For a product to be advertised as natural, a brand needs to provide evidence that just 5% of its ingredients are natural. This doesn’t account for the rest of the formulation and as Sturnham explains, it often tells us very little about the ingredients we’re buying into: “Generally, if a product lasts more than three weeks after the date of opening, it is unlikely to be 100 percent natural, as it will require chemical preservatives to maintain its stability.” With no regulatory body to govern the use of terms like organic and natural, Dr. Sturnham details how confusing such words can be to consumers: “This category of skin care is poorly monitored and even products which are labeled as such, are often only containing a small percentage of organic ingredients. We are not advised if pesticides or herbicides are used in the cultivation process, if the ingredients are sourced from the environment or cultivated in a lab and if the ingredient is a synthetic version of the natural ingredient.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides the “USDA Organic” seal of approval. That seal looks exactly the same when placed on a product’s label, even though it can mean three different things: 100 percent organic, which is only organically produced ingredients other than water and salt; organic, which is 95%; and “made with organic ingredients,” which is 70 percent approved ingredients, and can be marketed like “body lotion made with organic lavender, rosemary, and chamomile.” Alcohol in skin care falls into one of three categories: simple, fatty, or aromatic. Fatty alcohol, such as cetyl alcohol or caprylic alcohol, works to prevent skin's moisture loss and acts as a thickening agent, whereas aromatic alcohol, typically known as benzyl alcohol, is used in very small doses in fragrance as a solvent. Simple alcohol is where the problems lie. Used under names such as isopropyl alcohol and denatured alcohol (alcohol denat), Mirela Mitan, CEO and founder of MMXV INFINITUDE, details the adverse effects it can have: \"If used in a high concentration, this alcohol may weaken the skin barrier function and increase skin dryness.\" If dry skin is a concern, look for products free from simple alcohol. Succinctly summed up by Pamela Marshall, a clinical aesthetician and cofounder of Mortar & Milk, an active ingredient is one that is “biologically active – able to biologically affect the skin.” Usually, these are at the top of the ingredients list and will often have a percentage listed on the packaging. (For example: 10 percent glycolic acid.) AHAs, PHAs, retinol, and vitamin C are all active ingredients. The efficacy of an active ingredient is greatly dependent on the pH levels in the acids, as Marshall clarifies. “The lower the pH, the more ‘active’ a product will be, but that can also mean that it can be more irritating to some skins.” A tip – don’t mistake a high percentage in ingredients like glycolic acid for a sign of increased effectiveness. Marshall says: “Percentages are a misnomer. A serum that claims to be 50 percent glycolic acid is far less effective than a serum that has 10 percent glycolic acid, simply due to the pH levels.” \"Essential oils are simply distilled oils derived from a plant that have the 'essence' of that plant. They have been used for healing for thousands of years and are currently being used in many skin-care products for their healing ability,\" Marshall explains. They're common ingredients prevalent in natural skin-care brands – frequently used examples include lavender oil, ylang ylang and rosehip oil. But just because they're derived from a plant doesn't mean they're harmless; they can be irritating to some, so it's important to spot test them first. But where there's an essential oil, there's a carrier oil working alongside it, which determines how it penetrates the skin. \"Not all essential oils are created equal,\" she adds. \"Their carrier oil is very important to their absorption, so if the carrier oil is too heavy, the essential oil will not penetrate properly.

    "title": "French President Emmanuel Macron Vows To Ban 'Fake News'",
    "text": "French President Emmanuel Macron plans to introduce legislation that will crack down on so-called “fake news” during French election campaigns, calling the spread of such misinformation a threat to democracy. Speaking to journalists at an annual New Year reception on Wednesday, Macron said he intended to overhaul the country’s media laws in order to boost transparency and quash the spread of fake news on social media. “If we want to protect liberal democracies, we must have strong legislation,” Macron said, per Reuters. “At election time, on internet platforms, the rules applying to content won’t be exactly the same.” The new legislation would empower France’s media watchdog, the CSA, to combat the dissemination of fake news during elections and mandate more transparency for sponsored content. There would also be an emergency provision that would allow a judge to delete content or block access to a website deemed to be propagating fake news. Macron previously accused Russia and its state-owned media companies of spreading fake news in order to interfere with the French presidential campaign. The American intelligence community has also expressed “high confidence” that Russia used a similar “influence campaign” during the 2016 U.S. presidential election to “undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process.” Marine Le Pen, the far-right presidential candidate who was defeated by Macron last year, excoriated the president for his planned fake news ban. France was “muzzling its citizens,” Le Pen said in a series of tweets on Wednesday, adding: “Who will decide if a piece of news is fake? Judges? The government?” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "White Supremacist Charged With Terrorism After Alleged Attempt To Derail Train",
    "text": "The FBI has charged a 26-year-old Missouri man with terrorism after agents say he attempted to derail an Amtrak train in Nebraska by triggering the train’s emergency brakes. Taylor M. Wilson of St. Charles, Missouri, had previously traveled with members of a neo-Nazi group to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and expressed an interest in “killing black people,” according to court documents unsealed Wednesday. After Wilson was arrested for triggering the train’s brakes in October, FBI agents found weapons, tactical gear and white supremacist documents at his home. Some items were in a hidden compartment behind a refrigerator, according to the court documents. FBI Special Agent Monte Czaplewski said that Wilson, who has a concealed carry permit, boarded the train intending to carry out a terrorist attack and pulled the emergency brake “with intent to harm those aboard” on Oct. 22, according to the affidavit. Czaplewski also said he believed Wilson’s firearms “have been used for or obtained in anticipation of engaging in or planning to engage in criminal offenses against the United States.” There were about 175 people aboard the train from California to Missouri when Wilson triggered the brakes, The Associated Press reported in October. In the early hours of Oct. 22, Wilson entered a restricted area of the California Zephyr train as it passed through rural Nebraska and triggered the train’s emergency brakes. After the train came to an “expedited stop,” Amtrak workers found Wilson “playing with the controls” while sitting in the engineer’s seat of an engine, according to the affidavit. A struggle broke out as train employees tried to subdue Wilson, who reached toward his waistband several times during the confrontation. Deputies later found a loaded handgun in Wilson’s waistband along with a speed loader, a device that allows rapid reloading of a weapon. Wilson also had three additional speed loaders, a box of ammunition, a hammer, a knife and a respirator-style mask in a backpack. Deputies also found that a business card for the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi group, on Wilson. In an interview with the FBI, Wilson’s cousin Andrew Olney said that Wilson had joined an ”‘alt right’ neo-Nazi group” that he found while researching white supremacy forums on the internet, according to the affidavit. Olney, who lived with Wilson for at least four months, also told the FBI that Wilson attended the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in August with friends from the neo-Nazi group. Olney said “he knew a lot of the guys took guns with them [to the Charlottesville rally], but he did not know for certain if Wilson took anything other than a shield and bulletproof vest,” the affidavit read. Wilson regularly carried a “9 millimeter handgun or a .38 caliber revolver,” according to Olney. After a search warrant was issued in December, St. Louis FBI agents discovered firearms, body armor, “records of communication of threats or detailing instructions pertaining to committing acts of violence against others” and “documents concerning white supremacy.” Items found in a compartment behind a refrigerator included 11 AR-15 rifle ammunition magazines with 190 rounds of ammunition, one drum-style ammunition magazine for a rifle, 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition, white supremacy paperwork and a handmade shield, which Czaplewski believes was taken to the Charlottesville rally. Wilson’s father later gave the FBI 15 of Wilson’s firearms. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that at least one weapon was an automatic rifle and another was converted to a short rifle, “both in possible violation of federal firearm laws.” Wilson was arrested in October on suspicion of felony criminal mischief, trespassing and weapon charges. On Dec. 11, Wilson’s $100,000 bond was posted and he was released. Bobbie Garris, a passenger on the California Zephyr, told Nebraska ABC news affiliate NTV that passengers sat in the dark for over an hour after the train came to an abrupt stop. “We lunged forward in our seats and all the power went out,” Garris told NTV at the time. “We could smell something burning, and I’m going to guess that was the brakes.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "FBI Reportedly Investigating Clinton Foundation",
    "text": "Federal officials reportedly have launched a new investigation into allegations of corruption at Bill and Hillary Clinton’s charitable organization. The FBI and federal prosecutors aim to investigate whether the Clinton Foundation engaged in pay-to-play politics ― that is, whether the Clintons promised political favors in return for financial donations. The primary location of the investigation will be Little Rock, Arkansas, where the foundation was started, an anonymous law enforcement official first told The Hill. Both the Justice Department and the U.S. attorney’s office in Arkansas declined to comment to CNN about the investigation. The reopening of the investigation comes on the heels of the Justice Department’s move to also relaunch an investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she worked as secretary of state, The Daily Beast reported Thursday. A former senior DOJ official told The Daily Beast that officials are aware of demands from President Donald Trump to investigate Clinton. Trump has been increasingly focused on Clinton as the investigation into his alleged ties with Russia has heated up. He tweeted Friday morning that the investigation into him is simply a “hoax.” Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable.

In 2016, prosecutors with the Justice Department rejected a request from the FBI to expand the investigation, The Washington Post reports. Nick Merrill, spokesman for Clinton, told The Hill on Friday that the new probe is “disgraceful.” “Let’s call this what it is: a sham,” Merrill told the publication. “This is a philanthropy that does life-changing work, which Republicans have tried to turn into a political football. It began with a now long-debunked project spearheaded by Steve Bannon during the presidential campaign. It continues with Jeff Sessions doing Trump’s bidding by heeding his calls to meddle with a department that is supposed to function independently.” Sources within both the Justice Department and the FBI told The Washington Post they were skeptical that the case would lead to any charges.

    "title": "Report: Top Law Enforcement Officials Meet House Speaker On Trump-Russia Probe",
    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Two top law enforcement officials met U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Wednesday to discuss demands by congressional supporters of President Donald Trump that the Justice Department hand over files relevant to investigations of possible Trump 2016 campaign ties to Russia, a source familiar with the meeting said. FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Ryan, a Ryan spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said, declining to comment on the subject of the meeting. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Reuters reported in September that the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee had issued subpoenas to Wray and Rosenstein demanding that they surrender their agencies files on former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, his “dossier” on suspected Trump team contacts with Russia and inquiries being made by the FBI and the Justice Department into the dossier’s contents. Officials said at the time that the agencies were reluctant to comply with the subpoenas, backed by House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a Trump supporter, because the FBI was conducting its own probe. That investigation is supervised by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into U.S. allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election campaign to tilt the election in Trump’s favor. Moscow has denied any effort to influence the election and Trump denies any campaign collusion. Trump supporters have said that the “dossier” and other allegations of Trump involvement with Russia are smears concocted by Trump’s political enemies. In December, news outlets reported that Nunes would ask his committee to vote to hold the Justice Department and FBI in contempt of Congress if they did not turn over the material sought by the committee. It is unclear whether such a vote has already been taken. A spokesman for Nunes did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

    "title": "The Fear Of Hair Is A Real Thing, Explaining Why Your Drain Is Such A Nightmare",
    "text": "There’s nothing quite like that fresh, clean feeling you get right after a shower. But it can all be ruined once you notice the clump of hair you left behind in the shower drain. Dun, dun, duuuunnnnnnn: Even if the hair belongs to you, and especially if it doesn’t (those of you who live with roommates, we feel for you), there’s something so gross about seeing it tangled in the drain, just taunting you. But what exactly is it that makes hair in the drain, or loose hairs lying around in general, seem so disgusting ― or, to some, scary? There is such a thing as a fear of hair, sometimes referred to as chaetophobia or trichophobia. Those with this phobia generally hate the sight of loose hairs (whether human or animal) and may also be afraid of hair loss. “There’s no accounting for how human beings can develop irrational fears,” Robert Reiner, executive director and founder of Behavioral Associates in New York, told HuffPost. However, he said, fear crosses the line from disgust to full-on phobia when one’s life “becomes dysfunctional because of it.” Not all of us have the actual phobia, but its roots may lie in a more common anxiety. A fear of hair might have to do with a broader fear of germs or contamination, and in some cases could be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder, Dr. Bernard Vittone, director of the National Center for the Treatment of Phobias, Anxiety and Depression, explained to HuffPost. “One version of OCD is people that are afraid of dirt or contamination,” Vittone said, noting that “hair is usually construed as being sort of dirty and contaminated.” The anxiety, Vittone said, might stem from the thought of becoming ill from loose hair strewn around. Some people don’t even need to be in contact with the hair itself: The thought of contamination alone is enough to make them anxious. “It’s irrational, which puts it in the realm of a phobia, even though some people might say, well, that’s more of an OCD thing,” Vittone said. “It’s really a gray area.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Felony Conviction Rates Have Risen Sharply, But Unevenly",
    "text": "The Elmore Correctional Facility in Elmore, Alabama. The hurdles associated with a felony conviction are prompting some states to revisit how they classify crimes. By Tim Henderson In recent decades, every state has seen a dramatic increase in the share of its population convicted of a felony, leaving more people facing hurdles in finding a job and a place to live and prompting some states to revisit how they classify crimes. In Georgia, 15 percent of the adult population was a felon in 2010, up from around 4 percent in 1980. The rate was above 10 percent in Florida, Indiana, Louisiana and Texas. Less than 5 percent of the population in Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Utah and West Virginia were felons, but every state had a large increase between 1980 and 2010, when the felony population ranged from 1 to 5 percent, according to a University of Georgia study published in October. The new estimates only go through 2010, before many states began to reclassify some crimes, scale back sentencing and take other steps to lower incarceration rates and ease ex-offenders back into society. But they are the first attempt to gauge the state-by-state buildup of felons during a nationwide, decades-long surge in punishment: Less than 2 million people were in prison or jail or on parole or probation in 1980, compared with more than 7 million in 2007. John Pfaff, a law professor at Fordham University, called the study “incredibly important,” but noted that with many gaps in information provided by states, further study may be needed to ensure an accurate picture. Nonetheless, he said, some of the state differences make intuitive sense. “Georgia has been trying to get people out of prison with probation, but we’re seeing that even with probation they’re still getting that record,” Pfaff said. It’s possible that in states with relatively small black populations like West Virginia and New Hampshire, “without that racial divide between a white correctional system and a poor black population, it may be no coincidence that there’s a lower felony rate,” he said. Proponents of more lenient sentencing tend to focus on imprisonment, where Louisiana and Oklahoma have the highest rates, but probation is more common. There were 1.9 million people on felony probation in 2015, compared to 1.5 million in prison. In 2010, the two figures were about the same, at 1.6 million, according to the latest federal statistics. Many view probation as a more humane alternative to imprisonment, said Michelle Phelps, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota. But in some states probation has become a “net widener” that draws more nonviolent criminals into the stigma and harsh supervision of a felony conviction. Phelps pointed to Minnesota, which has one of the lowest rates of imprisonment, but ranked 16th for felon population in 2010. That year felons were about 9 percent of Minnesota’s population, or nearly quadruple the rate in 1980. “Though it’s frequently dismissed as a slap on the wrist, probation can entail onerous requirements,” Phelps said. For instance, probation can require a job and good housing as a condition for staying out of prison, but the felony conviction itself can make it hard or impossible to get that job. Gary Mohr, who heads Ohio’s Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, said a felony conviction can have lifelong consequences, no matter whether the punishment is imprisonment or probation. “Even probation or a six-month sentence is really a life sentence because it affects jobs, it affects housing, it affects everything in their lives,” Mohr said. Easing the Path Several states have moved in recent years to ease the path for convicted felons, including restoring voting rights and prohibiting employers from asking job applicants if they have a criminal record. Even some red-state conservatives support moves to erase the stigma and help people with felony convictions rejoin their communities. Marc Levin, vice president of criminal justice policy at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, said his group supported legislation in Texas and elsewhere to ease the way for felons to return to the community. He cited a Texas bill that would have allowed some felons to seal their criminal records, though the final law that took effect in September only extended to misdemeanors. A 2015 Texas law provided legal immunity to landlords who rent to felons, and a 2009 law made it easier for felons to get occupational licenses. In 2010, Texas was tied with Louisiana for the fourth-highest percentage of population with a felony conviction, at about 10.5 percent. That was triple Texas’s 1980 rate. The findings may help put probation reform on the front burner in some states. In Georgia, a February 2017 report by a state commission called for shorter probation sentences and lighter caseloads for probation officers. (The Pew Charitable Trusts, which also funds Stateline, assisted with the paper.) Almost 3 percent of Georgia’s adult population was on felony probation as of 2015 — far more than any other state and a 12 percent increase from 2010, according to the latest federal figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Georgia already has taken action to reduce felony convictions. For example, as part of sentencing and classification changes enacted in 2012, the state raised its felony theft threshold from $500 to $1,500. Felony thresholds vary widely from state to state, from $200 in Florida to $2,500 in Texas. In recent years, many states have raised them to reflect inflation and reduce felony convictions. Racial Disparities When crime rates rose in the 1980s and early 1990s, local and state leaders hired more police and they made more arrests, including felony arrests, Phelps said. In addition, many states elevated nonviolent crimes like drug possession to felony status, and many district attorneys adopted a get-tough strategy, seeking felony charges whenever possible. Police focused drug enforcement on high-crime neighborhoods, which were often predominantly African-American, Phelps said. As a result, felony convictions rose much faster among blacks than among whites. In 2010, about 23 percent of the black population had a felony conviction. The number of African-American felons increased more than fivefold between 1980 and 2010, while the number increased threefold for other felons. The University of Georgia study did not calculate separate rates for Hispanics or other minority groups. In left-leaning states such as Massachusetts, Minnesota and Oregon, one contributor to the growing share of the population with a felony conviction was an increased awareness of new crimes like domestic violence, sexual abuse and animal abuse, said Josh Marquis, a district attorney in Oregon and a 20-year board member of the National District Attorneys Association. When crime is a major concern in a community, elected district attorneys are especially sensitive to public pressure to file more felony charges, Marquis said. “We are not rewarded for the number of felonies filed,” Marquis said. “But we do face election and accountability to our neighbors who are also our bosses.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Feminist: The 'F' Word I Refused To Say",
    "text": "My mother raised me to respect myself. To know the names of my body parts. To let her know when I wanted to get on birth control. To stand up for myself when being cat called. She even bought me my first vibrator. Mom raised me to know that I had control over my choices. She taught empowering values without using the “f” word: feminism. I never thought of the way my mother raised me as political. Now I see how politics are involved in almost everything. I’ve been confused about politics for much of my life. At age 14 (year 2000) I wrote for my home town’s newspaper, the Waco Tribune Herald, in their Teen section. I covered controversial issues like gay marriage, legalizing marijuana, abortion, and how Hollywood’s projection of perfection was negatively affecting women. Writing about these topics in conservative Waco, Texas made me a target. I received both fan mail and hate mail. It felt good to know that my words meant something to someone, even if it pissed them off. The following 15 years I went back and forth politically. Sometimes I was a hippie handing flowers to conservative protesters at Michael Moore’s screening of Fahrenheit 911 in Bush’s hometown of Crawford (about 20 miles east of Waco). Sometimes I was passionately supporting Mitt Romney and bashing Obama. Then I moved to New York City at age 29 (year 2015) to pursue my passion for writing. That’s where I unintentionally discovered my true political identity and passion for social issues. Moving to New York City was a significant sociopolitical culture shock. I went from being around conservative folks who rarely talked politics to being surrounded by liberals who wore their politics on their sleeve - both figuratively and literally. I was an intimidated Republican with hot pink hair who proudly declared that I wasn’t a feminist. I was often challenged, “Why aren’t you a feminist?”. I really didn’t know. Nobody had ever asked me that. So I asked people why they were feminists. Their replies were on a different intellect than I could comprehend. I had no idea what they were saying, I just knew they had a level of self-awareness and political knowledge that I strived for. Their questions inspired me think. That thinking inspired me to do research. That research inspired me to ask more questions. I realized that these woke New Yorkers weren’t trying to get me to think like them, they were trying to get me to think like me. A concept I’d yet to consistently apply to my political identity. Feminism in populated, urban areas like New York City is extremely progressive. Especially in Trump era. It’s packed with an overwhelming amount of jargon. Words like micro-aggression, macro-aggression, mansplain, patriarchy, misogyny, misandry, toxic masculinity, cisgender, privilege, and so much more. I pretended to understand these words when I heard them in a conversation, then I Googled them as soon as I could. I noticed that women who proudly identified as feminists, though intellectually stimulating, often came across as angry. Their words seemed to come from such a bitter place. A place that I didn’t want to be. I don’t want to be an angry feminist! Feminists hate men! I love men! I’m a humanist! A few months into NYC life, I was discussing my confusion with feminism with my friend, Megan. “I’m not a feminist”, I told her. “Sure you are. You like voting. You like the idea of equal pay. You don’t want to be treated differently just because you’re a woman” she said. “Yea, but I’m not anti-man”, I replied. “Neither am I. I personally prefer traditional gender roles in relationships and that’s OK. Feminism is also about choice”. That simple explanation changed everything for me. The skies parted. Birds were singing. Flowers were blooming. I understood feminism. It’s. About. Choice. Understanding the empowerment behind choice let me shake off my other issues with the “f” word. I watched videos of women like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Kiran Gandhi, and Gloria Steinem. I learned how certain things that I just accepted as part of being a woman were simply wrong. Cat-calling is sexual harrassment. Society’s pressure to hide the fact that I menstruate is a form of oppression. Despite what the beauty industry says, “looking my best” is actually not my job as a woman. I got angry, too. Though I understood fundamental feminist concepts, I still felt like feminism was anti-man. What about men that are raped? What about minority men that don’t receive the same treatment as white men? This curiosity led me to do more research, eventually learning about Kimberlé Crenshaw and Intersectional Feminism. Seeing famous men like Matt McGorry, Will Smith, and John Legend identify as feminists helped me learned that it’s not just for women. It’s about equality. Standing up against racism, homophobia, toxic masculinity, and gender discrimination are all part of the modern Intersectional Feminist agenda. To me, saying I’m a feminist simply means that I stand for equality and choice. Feminism isn’t what I thought it was. It isn’t victim blaming; it’s giving the victim a voice. Feminism isn’t anti-man; it discusses how damaging toxic masculinity can be. Feminism isn’t a pity party; it’s shining a light on injustice.

    "title": "The Wildest Moments From ‘Fire And Fury,’ The Trump Book Everyone Is Talking About",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Journalist Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury drew outsize attention this week, when excerpts were released that featured members of President Donald Trump’s administration openly questioning his mental stability, as well as explosive comments from his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. Trump and the White House unleashed attacks against Bannon and threatened legal action against Wolff and his publisher. The book ended up being released on Friday, four days ahead of its scheduled publication date. Here are some especially notable claims from the book to hold you over until you read the full thing. Trump told former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes that son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner would “work out” the Russia issue. According to Wolff, Ailes warned Trump about “potentially damaging material” coming up about the ties between his campaign and Russian officials. Shortly after the election, his friend Ailes told him, with some urgency, “You’ve got to get right on Russia.” Even exiled from Fox News, Ailes still maintained a fabled intelligence network. He warned Trump of potentially damaging material coming his way. “You need to take this seriously, Donald.” “Jared has this,” said a happy Trump. “It’s all worked out.” Kushner, who has been assigned a rather large array of tasks as a White House senior adviser, has faced plenty of scrutiny in the multiple investigations into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia last year. Bannon told top Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller to use “the internet” as he drafted the administration’s famous immigration executive order. The book paints an unflattering picture of Miller, who is responsible for shaping much of Trump’s platform ― particularly his anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy proposals. Miller knew little about policy or military matters, the book says. Bannon “sent him to the Internet to learn about and to try to draft the [executive order],” according to Wolff. Trump’s daughter Ivanka told her friends about the secrets of her father’s hair. She treated her father with some lightness, even irony, and in at least one television interview she made fun of his comb-over. She often described the mechanics behind it to friends: an absolutely clean pate—a contained island after scalp reduction surgery—surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The color, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men—the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump’s orange-blond hair color. Trump has a conspiratorial reason for his frequent consumption of McDonald’s food. He had a longtime fear of being poisoned, one reason why he liked to eat at McDonald’s — nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely premade. Trump is a “post-literate” TV junkie. Trump has repeatedly claimed that a busy schedule and strong work ethic keeps him from watching much television. “Primarily because of documents,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One in November. “I’m reading documents. A lot. And different things. I actually read much more — I read you people much more than I watch television.” According to Wolff’s book, Trump has three TVs in his White House bedroom, hardly reads and struggles to process information. Trump didn’t read. He didn’t really even skim. If it was print, it might as well not exist. Some believed that for all practical purposes he was no more than semiliterate. (There was some argument about this, because he could read headlines and articles about himself, or at least headlines on articles about himself, and the gossip squibs on the New York Post’s Page Six.) Some thought him dyslexic; certainly his comprehension was limited. Others concluded that he didn’t read because he just didn’t have to, and that in fact this was one of his key attributes as a populist. He was postliterate—total television. As Bannon told Wolff: “[Trump’s] a guy who really hated school … And he’s not going to start liking it now.” “Everybody was a leaker”: former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, Bannon, Kushner — even Trump. In their efforts to “influence the president and undermine” one another, Bannon, Priebus and Kushner created a kind of “paralysis” within the White House that led each of the advisers to turn to the media, Wolff writes. The constant leaking was often blamed on lower minions and permanent executive branch staff, culminating in late February with an all-hands meeting of staffers called by Sean Spicer—cell phones surrendered at the door—during which the press secretary issued threats of random phone checks and admonitions about the use of encrypted texting apps. Everybody was a potential leaker; everybody was accusing everybody else of being a leaker. Everybody was a leaker. At least some of the information about the inner workings of the White House came directly from Trump, Wolff writes. Trump accusing the Obama administration of “wiretapping” Trump Tower was a “turning point” for White House staff. In a series of tweets on March 4, 2017, Trump accused former President Barack Obama of surveilling him, offering no evidence to support the claim. “This is McCarthyism!” Trump wrote, adding that Obama was a “Bad (or sick) guy!” It was a turning point. Until now, Trump’s inner circle had been mostly game to defend him. But after the wiretap tweets, everybody, save perhaps Hope Hicks, moved into a state of queasy sheepishness, if not constant incredulity. Sean Spicer, for one, kept repeating his daily, if not hourly, mantra: “You can’t make this shit up.” Trump had no interest in repealing Obamacare — or health care in general. A man of many phobias, however, he once lied so as not to be pegged obese. Trump had little or no interest in the central Republican goal of repealing Obamacare. An overweight seventy-year-old man with various physical phobias (for instance, he lied about his height to keep from having a body mass index that would label him as obese), he personally found health care and medical treatments of all kinds a distasteful subject. The details of the contested legislation were, to him, particularly boring; his attention would begin wandering from the first words of a policy discussion. During one particular health care discussion, Trump reportedly asked of his aides: “Why can’t Medicare simply cover everybody?” Privately, Kellyanne Conway rolls her eyes at Trump’s antics. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway — arguably Trump’s most loyal defender — has what Wolff describes in the book as a “convenient On-Off toggle.” In private, in the Off position, she seemed to regard Trump as a figure of exhausting exaggeration or even absurdity—or, at least, if you regarded him that way, she seemed to suggest that she might, too. She illustrated her opinion of her boss with a whole series of facial expressions: eyes rolling, mouth agape, head snapping back. But in the On position, she metamorphosed into believer, protector, defender, and handler. Trump has multiple theories that former President Richard M. Nixon was framed for the Watergate scandal. Trump was reportedly reminded of the famous wiretapping scandal as the FBI’s Russia probe unfolded, and compared James Comey to John Dean, who was instrumental in unraveling the Nixon administration’s cover-up. The president has “several revisionist theories” about Watergate and how Nixon was framed, the book says. After a perceived win against Ivanka Trump over the Paris climate agreement, Bannon declared, “The bitch is dead.” Wolff says the president’s plan to back out of the Paris agreement, announced in early June, was the move Ivanka Trump “had campaigned hardest against in the White House.” Bannon, who had fought repeatedly against Kushner and Ivanka Trump’s White House influence, had supported the withdrawal. “Score,” Bannon said. “The bitch is dead.” Bannon called Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with Russian operatives “treasonous,” and suggested Trump himself met with the foreign officials on the same day. Wolff outlines four imagined scenarios justifying the meeting in Trump Tower on June 9, 2016, ranging from outright plotting by the Trump campaign to mere amusement at the prospect of playing dirty campaign tricks on Hillary Clinton. Regardless of the reason, Wolff states that “practically nobody” doubted Trump himself was aware of the meeting. “The chance that Don Jr. did not walk these jumos up to his father’s office on the twenty-sixth floor is zero,” Bannon said, according to Wolff. “Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.” Trump’s presidency might end with impeachment, according to Bannon. Bannon said “it just brings the impeachment closer” if Trump were to fire Mueller. There’s a “33.3 percent chance that the Mueller investigation would lead to the impeachment of the president, a 33.3 percent chance that Trump would resign, perhaps in the wake of a threat by the cabinet to act on the Twenty-Fifth Amendment (by which the cabinet can remove the president in the event of his incapacitation), and a 33.3 percent chance that he would limp to the end of his term,” the former adviser said. Bannon said he certainly doesn’t believe Trump will last eight years. “He’s not going to make it,” he said. “He’s lost his stuff.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "First Rikers Island Jail Facility Set To Close This Summer",
    "text": "As part of a plan to permanently close Rikers Island, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday the island’s first jail will close summer 2018. The Department of Corrections plans to close the George Motchan Detention Center, which currently houses approximately 600 men in custody. Eight other facilities on the island will remain open for now. The current jail population on Rikers Island is 8,705 inmates, a “record-low figure last reported in 1982,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. “Every day we are making New York City’s jail system smaller and safer,” de Blasio said in a statement. “This announcement is an important step in our plan to close Rikers Island and create more community-based facilities to better serve people in custody and our hard-working correctional staff.” In March, de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito announced the plan to close Rikers Island permanently over the next 10 years and instead create “smaller, safer” jails to house inmates. Federal reports over the years have found overwhelming reports of abuse, neglect and use of excessive force at the prison complex. An exact deadline for the first Rikers Island closure has not been set, but there will be no planned layoffs of corrections staff, the mayor’s office said. “The City’s decision to shutter a sprawling, decrepit jail like George Motchan Detention Center is a great start to a new year,” Tina Luongo, attorney-in-charge of the criminal defense practice at The Legal Aid Society, said in a statement. “The key is to ensure that we continue to reduce the population of every single facility and until we close Rikers Island, also ensure that programming continues to serve people who are detained.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "5 Ways To Stop Blowing So Much Of Your Budget On Food",
    "text": "So, how did that “50/30/20 rule of budgeting” work out for you last year? You know, the one that says we should all spend no more than 50 percent of our income on necessities, allow 30 percent for discretionary items and sock away at least 20 percent for savings? Hoping for better results this time, right? Truth is, the 50/30/20 formula eludes most of us. Some 69 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings, and that includes many people near retirement age. It’s understandable: Housing and rent prices are at all-time highs, our incomes don’t allow for much discretionary spending, and many people enter the workforce already in debt from college loans. Saving anything ― let alone 20 percent of a stretched-thin income ― seems highly challenging. But putting together a real savings plan is totally possible, and in some cases, actually pretty painless if you make some strategic tweaks. In a nutshell, we need to stop wasting our money on convenience, says former CNBC host and personal finance maven Suze Orman. Where to start? The average American household spends most of its money — 62 percent of an average $56,000 in annual expenditures — on just three things: housing, transportation and food. Housing and transportation costs aren’t as flexible as food costs, which account for 12.5 percent, or just over $7,000, of the average budget, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And people often fall prey to bank-draining conveniences when they buy food ― so it’s important spending category to focus on if you want to start saving. Here are some tips to help you spend less on food this year: Studies have shown that people who use cash spend 12 percent to 18 percent less than those using a credit card, and McDonald’s reports its average check is $7 when people use credit cards, versus $4.50 for cash. There is probably no better budgeting tool than leaving your credit card at home or removing it from your delivery apps. Going to the grocery store with $50 in cash applies the brakes to impulse purchases. Why? Cash is real. It is tangible. We are detached when we swipe our credit cards, but cash is something you can feel, and you can see it dwindle as you work through your allotted food budget. Tip: Consider signing up for Withdraw Cash Wednesday, a brainchild of the ATM Industry Association that encourages consumers to keep cash on them and use it for everyday purchases because of its budgeting benefits and freedom from interest charges. WCW sends you reminders to refill your wallet every Wednesday and passes along information about how you will spend less and save more if you use cash instead of credit. The average American doesn’t eat 20 percent of the food he or she purchases, and every household throws away an average of $2,200 of food each year, according to a report from the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. Since most of the food we waste consists of fresh fruits and vegetables, it behooves us to focus on two things: the quantity of perishable food we buy in the first place, and how to repurpose produce like the slightly limp zucchini we forgot about in the refrigerator. The solution to the first part is easy: Buy only what you know you can and will eat, and not a green banana more. And for the latter, take a “waste not, want not” approach, and make a filling and hearty soup from the vegetables that have seen better days. Tips: The key is meal planning. To avoid waste, shop for groceries with a list you compile after you figure out your meal plan. Learn how to properly store fruits and vegetables for increased longevity. They should never go in plastic bags or plastic containers. And keep ripe fruit away from unripened produce, so the ethylene gas released by the ripe fruit doesn’t cause your other fruits and vegetables to ripen prematurely. Never leave produce in direct sunlight or in the refrigerator door. Try the store-brand equivalent of the products you regularly use. They are almost always cheaper than the national brands and often, there isn’t a difference. The average household spends an average of $3,008 each year on dining out, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. Some of us do more damage than others, but if eating out is breaking the bank, it’s time to deal with it. Restaurant meals are often the dynamite that blow our budgets. The 2016 State of American Dining by Zagat reported that in New York City, dinners out cost an average of $48.44 per person. The national average is $36.30 ― still a gut punch to the budget. But sit-down meals in restaurants are as much about entertainment as they are about food. We enjoy being served, hanging out with friends, savoring good tastes and not having to lift a finger to clean up the mess afterward. So here’s a compromise: Continue to dine out, but take steps to spend less when you do. Tips: Many restaurants serve oversized portions ― remember how Weight Watchers defined a serving size of chicken breast as the size of a deck of cards? ― so learn to share. Split an appetizer and entree on date night instead of ordering two of everything and tossing out the doggie bag two days later. You probably won’t go home hungry, and you’ve just cut your meal bill in half. Or start the evening at home, and have your first cocktails or glass of wine there with some munchies. Cheese and crackers at home might even send you straight to the restaurant’s salad course. (Shared, of course.) And when it comes to desserts, maybe stroll to a bakery or ice cream shop, where they will undoubtedly be cheaper. The more you do something, the less special it feels. Try saving those fancy meals out for special occasions only. Cook at home instead. Most eateries charge a 300 percent markup on the food they serve. This means that any time you spend $30 on an entree, the ingredients for the food you’re eating only cost $10, according to financial services company The Motley Fool. You pay more in the restaurant because of the labor, service and business expenses. So look at it this way: If the average household spends more than $3,000 dining out each year, the same meals prepared at home could possibly save an average household $2,000. The Motley Fool goes a little further: If you invest that $2,000 a year by not spending it on restaurants and takeout food and generate an average annual return of 8 percent, after 20 years, you’ll have an extra $91,000 for retirement. Tip: Entertain more at home, with friends bringing potluck dishes. Check for discount coupons for your favorite restaurants on sites like Groupon and Living Social. Go to expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner; often, you can get the same selections at reduced prices. If you qualify, ask for a senior or AAA discount. For all the times you grab a bite on the way home because you’re too tired or unmotivated to cook, we can only say, “everything in moderation.” The average American eats an average of 4.2 commercially prepared meals per week, or about 18 meals in an average month. This includes the multiple meals a week that UberEats delivers to the office, the dinners you pick up or have delivered, the delivery pizza you intend to reheat for lunch the next day but never do, and the occasional McDonald’s visits. Meals like this cost an average of $12.75, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and that doesn’t include delivery fees or tips. Can you commit to cutting those grab-and-go meals to once a week, or four times a month, instead of 18? That could save you a bundle, depending on how often you’re eating this way. Heck, even just going cold turkey on your $5-a-day Starbucks habit will save you $150 a month. Tips: Commit to only grabbing takeout once a week. Each time you bring lunch from home or cook something for dinner, put $12.45 in your piggy bank and pat yourself on the back.

    "title": "No Longer A Hero On Breitbart, Steve Bannon Sees Supporters Turn On Him",
    "text": "Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is seeing his most loyal internet followers turn on him after Michael Wolff’s explosive new book about the Trump administration quoted Bannon criticizing a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer. Bannon, the executive chairman of Breitbart, once boasted that the ultra-conservative news organization he has led was the “platform for the alt-right.” Now, stories on the site about the fallout between Trump and his former chief strategist are followed by a barrage of angry internet commentators who have turned on their maker. “Breitbart is bigger than Bannon and too many people are furious and feel betrayed,” the top comment in a story about Bannon read. “He’s also dragging great writers on this site down him with ... Steve needs to go.” “No way to support him and Trump at the same time,” another commenter added. “Bannon has to go.” The drama began Wednesday when Bannon was quoted in an excerpt from author Wolff’s book, Fire and Fury. In it, Bannon is quoted as saying the 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr., other Trump associates, and a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower was “treasonous.” “The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor — with no lawyers,” Bannon told Wolff in the new book. “Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately,” Bannon added. Trump immediately lashed out at Bannon after the quotes were made public Thursday, saying the former chief strategist had “lost his mind” in an official statement. A Trump lawyer sent Bannon a cease-and-desist letter. Later, Trump went to Twitter to call his former partner “Sloppy Steve.” I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve! Whispers quickly began that the fallout might lead to Bannon’s ouster from Breitbart. The Wall Street Journal reported that the owners of the publication were debating Bannon’s future on Wednesday. Rebekah Mercer, a financial backer of Breitbart, distanced herself from Bannon in an interview with The Washington Post. “I support President Trump and the platform upon which he was elected,” Mercer told the publication. “My family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements.” In a Friday tweet, Trump praised the move as “Smart!” The Mercer Family recently dumped the leaker known as Sloppy Steve Bannon. Smart! Where there was once praise for Bannon among Breitbart readers, they’ve now turned to anger and incredulity that he would ever question a meeting between the younger Trump and a Russian. A recent story on the outlet concerns Bannon’s response to Trump’s Thursday attacks, where he praised the president as a “great man” whom he supports “day in and day out.” The top-rated comment centers around Bannon’s apparent strategy of taking the “high road” in the back-and-forth. “Bannon could have easily issued a statement clarifying his comments, but he didn’t,” it read, one on a story with more than 7,000 comments. “The White House waited 5 hours to issue its statement, so Bannon’s team did have enough time to respond. Thus, what high road?” In an unreleased statement, Bannon had planned to praise the younger Trump, but reconsidered after the White House issued Trump’s statement that Bannon had “lost his mind.” “He was literally just about to respond but backed off when the White House issued the statement,” an anonymous source close to Bannon told The Hill. In another Breitbart article detailing Trump’s ire for Bannon, a commenter wrote: “Well, Steve Bannon is a Rino and cuckservative. So there. Fake news.” The comment had more than 800 votes. CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article said that Steve Bannon co-founded Breitbart News. He did not.

    "title": "Four Days Into 2018 And The Resistance Is Surging",
    "text": "Sure, Donald Trump’s tweet in which he taunted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to use his “Nuclear Button” wasn’t exactly a great start to 2018. And there were a lot of terrible, damaging actions that the Trump administration took over the holidays, under the radar of the media and the American people ― from overturning fracking regulations to firing all members of the presidential AIDS commission ― many of which we didn’t realize until the new year. But that said, there are things to celebrate in these first days of 2018, and they reveal the fears of the GOP and the White House, and, more importantly, the continued, if slow, loss of their grip on power. There’s the most obvious: Democrat Doug Jones was sworn in this week as Alabama senator, causing the Republicans to lose a precious seat in the Senate and dropping their majority to 51. Then there’s Utah GOP senator Orin Hatch, a major Trump ally who pushed through the GOP tax scam, who announced this week he’ll retire by year’s end ( joining a slew of GOP Senate and House members), a blow to Trump (who pleaded with him to stay) and another sign of GOP legislators seeing the handwriting on the wall. And there’s also Democrat Tina Smith, added to the ranks of women in the Senate and sworn in this week on the power of the #MeToo movement, replacing Minnesota’s retiring Democratic senator Al Franken, who slammed Trump in his last speech on the Senate floor. Less focused on in much of media, however, was the White House clearly seeing the end of the line on Trump’s attempt to ban transgender people from the military, which will be viewed as cowardice by religious right supporters who praised Trump’s despicable and discriminatory action. These supporters will no doubt express their anger to the White House in coming days for caving in to pressure. In a surprise over the holidays and in what transgender advocates called a “huge win,” the Justice Department decided to allow enlistments to go forward for January 1 as scheduled, and transgender people indeed began enlisting. Per the Washington Blade: With multiple court rulings ensuring the Pentagon must admit qualified openly transgender people into the U.S. military starting Monday, the U.S. Justice Department is giving up on litigation fighting those decisions in federal appeals courts and won’t seek a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court. By accepting new trans recruits, the White House has all but signed the death certificate on any ban as legal challenges proceed, possibly knowing that a study it commissioned will find what every other study has found: that trans people are no threat to the military and serve dutifully and honorably. Similarly, Trump’s dubious voter fraud commission, created solely for the purpose of attempting to prove Trump’s lie that he really won the popular vote but for millions of supposedly fraudulent votes, has collapsed ― dissolved by the administration itself yesterday under the weight of legal opposition and withering media criticism. This is an enormous win considering the commission would have been used to allow further voter suppression and validate voter ID laws. With states refusing to cooperate, as well as with legal challenges ― including from one of its own members ― the fraudulent fraud panel could not go on. And all the energy pushing the states, the legal challenges and awakening the American people came from the Resistance. And, in a spectacle of unprecedented proportions, Trump yesterday said in a statement that his former senior White House advisor and chief strategist Steve Bannon has “lost his mind.” The infuriated president was responding to Bannon having been quoted in a new book calling the infamous Trump Tower 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russian operatives “treasonous,” in addition to many other harsh things Bannon is quoted as claiming about the dysfunctional, dangerous Trump White House. As Bannon didn’t deny the statements all day ― and as his Breitbart News promoted the story ― the Trump base, including the alt-right (to which Breitbart is “home”), splintered into factions, taking sides. The comments on Breitbart look like a war zone, and this is only going to get much bigger. White House press spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders called Bannon’s claims “outrageous” and laughably tried to distance Bannon from Trump, saying he “didn’t have a lot of influence.” By nightfall, Trump, who hadn’t outright denied any of the comments specifically while excoriating Bannon as “only in it for himself,” did what he always does as a desperate last resort: His lawyers sent Bannon a cease and desist letter regarding the “disparaging” remarks. All of this benefits the Resistance enormously. The GOP’s influence is challenged not only in the Senate and the White House, but even among Trump″s already dwindled base, now splitting apart. Only 10 months away from the 2018 mid-term elections, progressives have come together, surging in off-year and special elections, marching and continuing to protest, and putting up record numbers of women running for office. We’re of course still dealing with an onslaught of attacks and challenges, including the new assault by the Justice Department on legalized marijuana this week, and the fate of the Dreamers in coming days as Congress comes up against the spending bill deadline and a possible government shutdown. But all things considered, it’s not a bad start to the new year.

    "title": "Freedom Caucus Leaders Suggest Jeff Sessions Should Go",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― One of President Donald Trump’s greatest frustrations during his first year in office has been his hand-picked attorney general recusing himself from a Justice Department investigation into the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with the Russian government. Despite his supposed penchant for firing people, Trump has been unable to bring himself to give Jeff Sessions the boot. But now, with the FBI unwilling to tell Congress what evidence it used to obtain a special warrant to spy on a Trump campaign official, two of Trump’s biggest supporters in Congress are suggesting Sessions ought to step down or be fired. House Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and former HFC Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) posed a series of questions Thursday ― published in a scornful op-ed in the Washington Examiner ― that ask how the FBI got a surveillance warrant to monitor potential collusion between Russia and Trump campaign official Carter Page, and why the FBI won’t answer their questions. “We in Congress have asked them repeatedly to tell us what was in the application they took to the [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] Court to get a warrant for spying on the Trump campaign,” Meadows and Jordan write. “Did they use the dossier in their application?” The “dossier” in question is the memo prepared by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele that makes a number of explosive claims about Trump’s ties to Russia and describes alleged compromising information the Russians may have on the president. Conservatives see the dossier as a faulty opposition research document that shouldn’t have been used to secure any FISA warrant ― even if at least some of the claims in the dossier have been corroborated, particularly regarding certain meetings between Page and a Russian official. The New York Times published a report last week claiming the FBI mostly used information gleaned by an Australian diplomat who shared a drunken conversation with another Trump campaign official, George Papadopoulos, in May 2016 to secure their FISA warrant. But Meadows and Jordan ask why, if that was the case, the FBI didn’t interview Papadopoulos until January 2017, and why the FISA warrant was centered on Page ― who plays a major role in the Steele dossier ― but not Papadopoulos. “It seems remarkably odd that instead of the FBI answering the critical questions that Congress has repeatedly asked, they instead leak a far-fetched and ill-supported story to the New York Times,” Meadows and Jordan write. “If this is the truth, then give us the documentation we’ve asked for to prove it.” Without actually saying so, the Freedom Caucus leaders go right up to the edge of calling on Sessions to step down. Their letter suggests the need for a new attorney general if Sessions is unable to address their issues immediately. HuffPost reached out to Meadows on Thursday for clarification about whether he and Jordan were saying Sessions should resign or be fired. Meadows said it was time that all relevant documents ― “in unredacted forms” ― be delivered to Congress. “Using an unverified political document, paid for by a Democrat campaign and Democrat Party to justify spying on an American citizen, sets a terrible precedent and is not in keeping with the original intent of the FISA program.” Congress is currently struggling to reauthorize certain sections of the FISA program, but is expected to come to an agreement later this month by having hawkish Republicans team up with some Democrats to renew controversial surveillance programs. Meadows and Jordan complain that the FBI won’t share what it used to obtain a FISA warrant on Page. But former Department of Justice spokesman Matt Milller ― now a partner at the management consulting firm Vianovo ― told HuffPost it would be highly unusual for the FBI or DOJ to share that sort of information with Congress, particularly if the investigation was ongoing and had moved from a counterintelligence investigation to a criminal one. “Bottom-line rule: You don’t share information about a criminal investigation while it’s ongoing,” Miller said. Miller also questioned some of the assumptions Meadows and Jordan make in their op-ed, such as Papadopoulos not being under surveillance, albeit not through a FISA court. “He could have very well been under surveillance,” Miller said. “They have no idea.” Reading the Examiner op-ed, it’s difficult not to question Meadows and Jordan’s motives. They begin the piece by praising Trump’s accomplishments, and they write that “there is no evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.” But we know that at least some Trump campaign officials knew the Russians had thousands of emails that would damage Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. We know people like Donald Trump Jr. sought out information from Russia-connected sources that could hurt Clinton. And there seems to be, at the very least, some sketchy financial dealings with people like onetime Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. To suggest the ongoing investigations are without merit isn’t exactly truthful. There’s also the matter of why conservatives see the need to run interference for Trump on Russia, particularly as they seek a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton and other government dealings during the 2016 campaign. But they may at least have a point about the Justice Department refusing to show Congress the documents that the FBI used to obtain a FISA warrant. And they may yet be proven right that the Steele dossier played more of a role in getting that warrant than certain leaks have suggested ― though that doesn’t necessarily mean the FBI was wrong to watch a Trump campaign official who was meeting with Russians. Either way, Meadows and Jordan want more information. “If Sessions can’t address this issue immediately, then we have one final question needing an answer: When is it time for a new attorney general?” Meadows and Jordan wrote Thursday. “Sadly, it seems the answer is now.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "'Game Of Thrones' Officially Won't Return This Year",
    "text": "It’s official: “Game of Thrones” fans have to wait at least a year for its eighth and final season to find out who will win the Iron Throne. HBO announced Thursday that new episodes will not be ready until 2019 ― a prospect network brass hinted at when Season 7 concluded last summer. Sophie Turner, who plays the increasingly hardheaded Sansa Stark, let slip that she fully expected the series to return in 2019, but this is the first HBO has affirmed the timeline. Season 8 will be the shortest yet, consisting of just six episodes, although some could be extra long. Season 7 saw the series’ shortest-ever and longest-ever episodes, at 50 minutes and 80 minutes, respectively. Although fans waited a couple extra months for the most recent installment ― because the wintry setting required film crews to push production later in the year ― the show usually debuts in the spring. The network has not specified precisely when in 2019 to expect a finale, but there’s a good chance HBO will revert back to a springtime release date for Season 8. By all accounts, the extended waiting period will be worth it, giving showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss more time to craft what might be the most anticipated series finale in television history. With its fiery battle scenes and a deadly ice dragon, Season 7 has already raised production expectations sky-high. And our lingering questions are many: How will Jon and Dany find out they’re related? What will they do with that disturbing knowledge? Will Cersei seriously have another kid? When is Melisandre coming back? Has everyone died at the Wall?? Along with Benioff and Weiss, the season will be directed by Miguel Sapochnik, who helmed fan-favorite episodes “Hardhome,” “Battle of the Bastards” and “The Winds of Winter,” and David Nutter, who headed up the infamous “Rains of Castamere,” among several other episodes.

    "text": "Social media sites in Germany could face hefty fines under a new law if they don’t act quickly to remove hate speech, fake news and other illegal materials from their platforms. Germany’s controversial Network Enforcement Act, also known as the NetzDG law, took effect Jan. 1 after a grace period. The law requires any internet platform with more than 2 million users to implement a system for reporting and scrubbing potentially illicit content, including “threats of violence and slander,” according to Deutsche Welle. Under the new law, sites are given 24 hours (or seven days for more “legally complex” cases) to investigate and delete illegal content after a complaint is received. Violators face fines of up to $60 million. Social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Snapchat, and Instagram, will fall under the purview of the new law, according to Deutsche Welle.

    "title": "She Quit Working For Trump. Now She's Running For Congress To Fight Him.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Gina Ortiz Jones thought she could work for President Donald Trump. When he won the presidency in November 2016, Jones, a career civil servant who served in the Air Force in Iraq under George W. Bush and as an intelligence officer under Barack Obama, stayed in her job as a director in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. But by June, she couldn’t do it anymore. Trump’s plans to gut education and housing aid hit too close to home for Jones, as someone who relied on reduced-cost school lunches and subsidized housing when she was a kid being raised by a single mom in San Antonio. She was also appalled by the president’s hires for top jobs. “The type of people that were brought in to be public servants were interested in neither the public nor the service,” Jones, 36, said in an interview. “That, to me, was a sign that I’m going to have to serve in a different way.” She found a new way to serve: She’s running for Congress. Jones has never run for office before, and if she wins, she would make history as the first lesbian, Iraq War veteran and first-generation Filipina-American to hold a U.S. House seat in Texas. Her hometown district, Texas’ 23rd, has also never been represented by a woman. Jones wouldn’t have been able to grow up healthy or get an education without the opportunities she got from the federal government, she said. The only reason she could afford college, she added, was that she got a four-year Air Force ROTC scholarship — and it infuriates her to see politicians try to take away those chances for others. “Talent is universal. Opportunity is not,” she said. “Folks in Congress, they do three things. They create opportunities, they protect opportunities and they erase opportunities. That’s how we have to be thinking about this very plainly.” Jones, a Democrat, is trying to unseat two-term Rep. Will Hurd (R). It won’t be easy. She has to beat three other Democrats in the March 6 primary, including Jay Hulings, a well-known former federal prosecutor. If she can pull that off, she’ll face Hurd, who has the advantage of being the incumbent and well-financed. As of Sept. 30, Hurd had $870,000 in cash on hand compared with Jones’ $74,000. But Jones is certainly viable. She’s picked up endorsements from major national groups including EMILY’s List, VoteVets and Victory Fund. Former Texas Democratic state senator and gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis endorsed her. A couple of weeks ago, Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who gave a passionate speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, announced his support for her campaign, too. “With leaders like Gina, our nation’s affairs are in good hands,” Khan said in a video announcing his endorsement. “I am supporting her for Congress because of her selfless, courageous leadership. She’s the leader we need for an interdependent world.” If she can win the primary, Jones has some advantages over Hurd. This district, which stretches halfway across the state thanks to insane gerrymandering, has flip-flopped between Democratic and GOP representation for years, with nobody holding it for more than two terms since 2007. Hurd won his first term in 2014 by 2,400 votes against Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego. In 2016, Hurd won by 3,000 votes. Those are pretty close races in a district where roughly 115,000 people voted in the midterm and 229,000 voted in the presidential election. This race is also happening amid a wave of Democratic victories around the country, with some high-level GOP operatives already bracing for a possible bloodbath in 2018. Jones expressed frustration that Hurd routinely votes against his constituents’ interests but seems to get away with it because of his reputation for being “the nice guy.” Last year, Hurd gave people warm fuzzies about bipartisanship by live-streaming a 1,600-mile road trip with Texas Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke. HuffPost thought it looked fun (even if it was a political calculation by O’Rourke, who proposed the trip and announced a Senate run weeks later). Jones scoffed. “When bipartisanship means two dudes get in a car and help each other get elected, we’re all fucking screwed,” she said. Instead, Jones ran through Hurd’s record. He voted to delay the implementation of smog reduction measures by eight years, despite 1 in 13 Texans having asthma (with even higher rates in communities of color, like his). He voted nine times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. He voted for the GOP’s tax bill, which benefits the rich and raises taxes on middle-class families over time. He’s been quiet about Congress’ failure to renew funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which is set to expire and would affect 400,000 kids in Texas. “When bipartisanship means two dudes get in a car and help each other get elected, we’re all fucking screwed.” It’s particularly outrageous that Hurd hasn’t signed onto a bipartisan bill, the Dream Act, to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Jones said. Trump ended the program in September, and young undocumented immigrants will begin losing protections in greater numbers in March unless Congress passes a law to keep it. If lawmakers fail to act, hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants are at risk of being deported. Jones said the uncertainty around DACA is “a huge deal” in Texas’ 23rd District, where more than 70 percent of constituents are Latino. “So I push back on the fact that some say, ‘Oh, he’s not that bad.’ His voting record is awful,” she said. “You don’t get to be a moderate just because you don’t say crazy shit.” Hurd’s campaign spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Since moving back to San Antonio in June, Jones has been living in the house she grew up in. Most people in her community are minorities. Many are low-income. As she’s traveled around the district, she’s met people in border towns living in rank poverty. Some have no running water. Some have no paved roads. Jones said the experience has been a stark reminder of how badly Congress needs diverse voices ― and that now is the time for her to throw her hat in.

    "title": "Goop Pushes An At-Home Coffee Enema Kit In Its Latest Beauty Guide",
    "text": "Goop is at it again. In an email newsletter sent out Thursday, Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle brand released its annual detox guide, which recommends ditching certain foods for the year ahead, in order to cleanse your body of all the toxins. In conjunction with its general “detox” recommendations, Goop also put together a Beauty and Wellness Detox Guide, complete with everything from a $4,099 two-person cedar sauna to a metaphysical colonic and plenty of facial serums, oils, masks and potions to fill one’s beauty cabinet. The one thing that really caught our attention, though, was something called the Implant O’Rama system for an at-home coffee enema. What is a coffee enema, you ask? Well, according to HealthLine, it’s a type of colon cleanse used in alternative medicine that involves inserting brewed coffee and water into the colon through the rectum. And in the case of this Implant O’Rama system, you’d be doing all that by yourself. Coffee enemas are a component of Gerson Therapy, a dietary regimen developed by American physician Dr. Max Gerson back in the 1920s. Other aspects of the treatment include eating a vegetarian diet and drinking raw juices to help heal “the body as a whole.” Supporters of the system claim that it treats everything from cancer, arthritis and heart disease, according to the Gerson Institute’s website. Proponents of coffee enemas believe the procedure can help drain toxic bile from the gut and help the liver’s filtering system, but there isn’t much evidence supporting the benefits or healing abilities of coffee enemas, or colon-cleansing procedures in general. According to a letter published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology, there have been at least three cases of proctocolitis (a gastrointestinal syndrome) occurring in relation to coffee enemas. There have also been multiple deaths related to coffee enemas, and at least one individual suffered rectal burns because the water used was too hot. Overusing enemas can alter the body’s natural chemistry, interfering with normal functioning of the heart and other vital organs, according to the National Cancer Institute. In Goop’s defense, the site does warn (in tiny font) that the treatment is for “those who know what they’re doing.” Still, an at-home enema kit seems a little unrealistic, and potentially unsafe, for the average person.

    "title": "What's The Deal With Grandparent Baby Showers?",
    "text": "A baby shower is an exciting occasion to celebrate parents-to-be and help them prepare for their new bundle of joy. But lately, expectant parents aren’t the only ones being “showered” ahead of their baby’s arrival. Over the past five years or so, there have been increased reports of a newer trend: grandparent baby showers. Baby showers for grandparents (aka “grandma showers,” “grandbaby showers” and so on) are gatherings to celebrate expectant grandmas and/or grandpas before the birth of their grandchildren, typically a first grandchild. Amy Roloff of “Little People, Big World” TV fame had a grandma shower in April when her two daughters-in-law were expecting her first grandchildren. According to TLC, friends of the grandmother-to-be organized the shower, which featured champagne, a game of “pin the panties on the granny” and gifts like diapers and strollers. But this type of celebration has sparked controversy, with many expectant mothers expressing discontent, calling it “tacky” and a way for their parents or parents-in-law to steal the spotlight. In 2010, etiquette expert Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners, called grandparent baby showers a cheap gift grab. We asked members of the HuffPost Parents Facebook community to share their opinions and personal experiences with grandparent showers. The responses were mixed. “My mother-in-law tried to have her own shower when I was pregnant with my first,” one woman, who asked to remain anonymous, told HuffPost. “She argued that the baby would spend so much time at her house that she needed just as much stuff as we did, including things that we could easily bring over with us or that she just wouldn’t need, such as clothing, a car seat, a baby bath, etc.” “She tried to encourage her own sisters and some of her nieces to throw it for her, but the general response was that they were already planning on throwing one for me,” she added. “When that didn’t pan out, she asked for hand-me-downs from their babies and grand-babies, but again, those were already spoken for by me and the other new moms in the family.” In the end, the mother-in-law bought most of these items herself “while complaining about the cost, despite our assurances that there wasn’t anything the baby would need at her house that we couldn’t easily bring over when he was there,” the woman recalled. “She was welcome to get a few things, as my parents did, but it just became this big issue.” But there were many sweet stories about grandparent baby showers, too. “Last year, my Nannie, who is my daughter’s great-grandmother, was thrown a surprise ‘grandma shower’ by the women in her sewing group,” Alexandra Rugh told HuffPost. “All of the items were for the baby, save for a notepad with my Nannie’s name on it, and most were hand made ― blankets, bibs, crocheted hats, a quilt, and more.” The great-grandmother-to-be had no idea they’d planned this celebration for her. “Now, to some, it probably sounds strange, but it was a very special moment for my Nannie because she had just been diagnosed with an enlarged aorta and was scheduled to have open heart surgery two weeks before my due date,” Rugh explained. “At 73 years old, my Nannie didn’t know if she would make it through the surgery. Her biggest fear was dying and not being able to hold her first and only great grandchild. I’m happy to say that Nannie survived the surgery and was able to hold my daughter in her arms when she was just 1 week old.” Today, Rugh’s daughter is over a year old, and her great-grandmother watches her twice a week while the mom works from home. “When I had my daughter 10 years ago, my mother, who worked as a tutor mentor in a New York state correctional facility, was given an amazing baby shower by her co-workers,” Katey Johnson told HuffPost. “I understand why some people may think this is unnecessary, but for my mother, it was truly a well-earned celebration,” she said, adding that her brother died unexpectedly at the age of 19. “As any mother can imagine, her heart was shattered, as were mine and my father’s, but she soldiered on,” Johnson said. “Always the brave face. Always the kind word to lift a spirit.” When Johnson’s first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage, her mother was again heartbroken. However, her second pregnancy instilled a new joy in her mom. “The women she worked with loved her and wanted to celebrate this new joy she earned after years of heartache,” Johnson said. “And the outpouring was amazing. Some people may think a grandparent is trying to steal the spotlight from a new mother, but that was not the case with my mom. The people that loved her were as thrilled to see her happy as she was to welcome my daughter.” Of course, grandparent showers aren’t just for grandmothers-to-be. “My dad’s work threw a ‘Grandbaby Shower’ for him when the first grandchild in our family was born,” Tammy Long told HuffPost. “He was as excited as the parents, and it was a sweet gesture!” Etiquette experts have mixed opinions when it comes to grandparent showers, but they mostly agree on one thing: Tread carefully. “It’s really awesome to celebrate new grandparents,” said Emily Post’s great-granddaughter Lizzie Post, co-host of the Emily Post Institute’s “Awesome Etiquette” podcast. “But we caution people against throwing parties like this and having them get out of control.” Post attributes the practice ― which she says she first heard about in 2014 ― to the fact that many grandparents are becoming primary or secondary caregivers to their grandchildren. Indeed, with changing family structures, growing financial insecurity and more women in the workforce, grandparents are stepping up to help care for their grandkids. “People would realize that their friend was becoming a grandmother or grandfather, but didn’t have a lot of the gear to be able to babysit easily without just sharing constantly with the parents,” Post said. “So the friends would get together and say ‘We can help with that!’” “Unfortunately, we have a tendency in this country to really go after any type of party and gift-giving scenario we can and make a reason for it to become a tradition,” she added. Gathering a group of close friends or co-workers to celebrate a grandparent-to-be can be a nice gesture, but such celebrations should not mimic the baby showers people throw for expectant parents, Post said. She suggested instead getting together for drinks, sending a card or having tea. If a grandparent is going to play a major caregiving role, receiving gifts ahead of the baby’s birth can be appropriate. “You can’t expect a mother to constantly move her crib over to Grandma’s house, so practical gifts the grandmother might use would be a crib, car seat, stroller, books, wipes or bottles,” international etiquette expert Jacqueline Whitmore told HuffPost. Still, Whitmore recommended making gifts optional for this kind of informal celebration. Post echoed this, noting that gifts should generally only be part of the event if the caregiving grandparents need help to afford the essentials for caring for their grandchild. “There are ways to handle it nicely,” she said. “The host might get on the phone with the guests and say something like, ‘I know that Carol is planning on taking care of her granddaughter a lot once the baby is born, and as we all know, it’s been a tough year for her.’ Of course only if that’s information all the friends on the guest list know about and have openly discussed with Carol present. If this close-knit group wants to get together and do this nice thing for her by helping her buy necessities, that’s one thing.” Both Post and Whitmore said that making an official registry is a no-no. Perhaps the most important advice Post and Whitmore offered with regard to grandparent showers is to always consult the expectant mother. “By all accounts on the internet, it seems like lots of moms-to-be are not too thrilled about these kinds of parties,” Post said. “Given how many moms-to-be are upset and voicing their displeasure with these types of parties or how uncomfortable they are with them, I would think that if I was a grandma-to-be and caught wind that my friends were planning to do this for me, I would want to talk to my daughter or son first and make sure the couple felt OK about it,” she added. “They might pipe up and say, ‘Mom, we’ll get you set up. You’re going to be babysitting, we can handle buying the car seat for you.’” Post also noted that expectant parents are often inundated with gifts and hand-me-downs and may have extra items that could go to the grandparents’ house. If the parents say the idea of a grandparent shower makes them uncomfortable, Post said, it’s important to respect that. “It’s wonderful when grandparents feel sheer joy and excitement, and their friends are so supportive of it,” Post said. “It’s tough to tell people, ‘Don’t do this!’ because it is generous. But saying no to a big party is not to not make grandma feel special. It’s just that we have ways of making people feel special in our culture that don’t involve parties of honor and gifts.” Another aspect that requires consultation with the expectant mother is the timing. Whitmore recommends asking about appropriate dates for the grandparent celebration, and not scheduling it around the same time as the mom-to-be’s shower. As far as the expectant mom’s attendance at the event, that depends on whether she lives nearby and on the nature of the party, as she may not want to join her mother or mother-in-law for cocktails with friends.

    "text": "It’s plane crazy: A flight that took off in 2018 ended up landing in 2017. Hawaiian Airlines Flight 446 was scheduled to depart Auckland, New Zealand, on Dec. 31 at 11:55 p.m. local time on its way to Honolulu. However, an unexpected 10-minute delay meant that it took off at 12:05 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2018. Thanks to the location of the international date line, Honolulu is 23 hours behind Auckland. That meant the eight-hour flight landed at 10:16 a.m. on Dec. 31, 2017. Sam Sweeney, a transportation reporter for Washington, D.C., station WJLA, noticed the quirky flight time and posted it on Twitter ... Because of an unexpected delay, Hawaiian Airlines flight 446 took off in 2018 and will land in 2017. #timetravel pic.twitter.com/A5vesXmjqq ... and proceeded to blow everyone’s mind. pic.twitter.com/jwwnKtC7zM pic.twitter.com/DqCNdMFjQ5 Some people weren’t sure how to react. pic.twitter.com/gLLjDZ3Ncl Others felt it was a good opportunity for a “Doctor Who” gif. pic.twitter.com/eesL4LhW1U Some had more practical concerns. Bring back lotto numbers! so i can make two resolution lists for 2018🤔 And at least one person wanted to kill the buzz by bringing, ugh, a rational explanation. That happens every time a plane crosses the current midnight line - think of it as the border between the kingdoms of 2017 and 2018 - in the wrong direction on New Year’s.

    "title": "Bow Down: Helena Bonham Carter Might Play Princess Margaret On 'The Crown'",
    "text": "God save Helena Bonham Carter. The “Ocean’s 8” actress is currently in talks to play Princess Margaret in the upcoming season of Netflix’s royal drama “The Crown,” multiple outlets have confirmed. Series creator Peter Morgan reportedly has a six-season plan in place that involves new actors joining the cast every two seasons to play older versions of the characters. Bonham Carter is “all but confirmed” to replace actress Vanessa Kirby, who delivered a standout performance this past season as the youngest daughter of King George VI. Netflix has not addressed the casting rumor, and did not respond to a request for comment. “I’m just so excited about whoever gets to do it because they’ve definitely got the coolest stuff coming up. Bring on the drama!” Kirby said of her replacement in December. “I would have loved to have done it. I absolutely love to do all the blazing rows and getting drunk and just all of it. But I suppose I was lucky enough to have two seasons, so I could be more grateful, really.” Bonham Carter is no stranger to the royals: She played the Queen Mother in the critically acclaimed “The King’s Speech” in 2010, and in 2012 was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her contributions to drama. Netflix announced in October that Olivia Colman will take the reins from Emmy nominee Claire Foy to play Queen Elizabeth. A successor for Matt Smith, who plays Prince Philip, hasn’t been revealed yet. The third season will reportedly pick up with a time jump to the 1970s ― Season 2 ended in 1964 ― and introduce Camilla Parker Bowles, then known as Camilla Shand, as well as explore the dissolution of marriage between Margaret and Lord Snowdon.

    "title": "C'mon, Sexism Is At Least Part Of The Reason Hoda Kotb Is Making Less Than Matt Lauer",
    "text": "Even when women make it to what seems like the top, they’re still slightly behind. The drama of morning television news provides the latest example. On Wednesday, Hoda Kotb revealed that she won’t be earning as much money as her predecessor, the now-disgraced Matt Lauer, as co-anchor of NBC’s “Today” show. Before he was fired for sexual misconduct, the longtime host reportedly earned $25 million a year. Kotb and her co-host, Savannah Guthrie, will each get $7 million, according to the New York Post. “I’m not making Matt Lauer money. Not even close,” Kotb told People magazine. For her part, Kotb seems perfectly fine with this pay gap, despite the expected internet outrage. And in truth, it’s hard to definitively attribute this to clear-cut gender bias. The TV news business is complicated, and there are any number of plausible reasons why Kotb might be earning less than Lauer, a man accused of showing his penis to a female colleague in an unwelcome attempt to woo her. That’s the thing about the gender pay gap ― there are always “reasons.” But at the end of the day, when a woman is getting paid just 28 percent of what her male predecessor made, it’s hard not to put some of the blame on sexism. Indeed, if you look more broadly at the economy, the fact that Kotb will make less than Lauer isn’t actually that unusual. The gender pay gap ― i.e., the difference between what men and women earn ― is actually most pronounced at the top of the income ladder. Women in the 95th percentile of income earners in the U.S. make just 71 percent of what men in the same percentile earn, according to 2016 Census data analyzed by the Economic Policy Institute. That’s a gap of 29 percent. Women in the bottom 20th percentile face a gap of 15 percent compared to men in the same cohort. The reason is that at the top of the income ladder, there’s wider variation in pay. And the very highest-paying jobs ― think Goldman Sachs banker or Silicon Valley big shot ― are still going to mostly men. Take lawyers: A partner in a prestigious law firm could conceivably earn $1 million a year. Those jobs are still overwhelmingly held by men ― and the reasons for that are inescapably gendered. Other types of lawyers, such as those who work inside companies, may make a quarter of that, and there are many more women doing this kind of work. Meanwhile, at the bottom of the income scale, there’s just less room for variation. One janitor might make a few dollars more an hour than another, but you’re unlikely to find a janitor whose pay is several times that of someone else doing the same job. Now, there’s an important exception here. Female CEOs at the biggest companies do outearn their male peers, according to some research. That’s because mega-corporations are starting to put a premium on finding female talent. It’s not clear that’s the situation in television news, though. The folks at EPI helpfully put together this chart, looking at hourly wages, to help illustrate the situation. Just look at the two bars on the right side. Of course, Hoda and Matt aren’t a couple of corporate lawyers. They’re entertainers in the news business, which comes with its own set of cultural norms and rules. Paying a newcomer less than his or her predecessor is apparently not unusual in the TV business, where proven talent is rewarded. Stephen Colbert started out making less than David Letterman hosting the same show at CBS. Trevor Noah was offered less than Jon Stewart was making to host Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.” “Anchors and hosts need to prove staying power and show they are a ratings draw,” writes Variety’s Brian Steinberg. “Over time, that makes them more valuable and more difficult to let go.” That seems convincing ― until you start to think about Kotb’s star power. Kotb, 53, is hardly a unknown entity. Viewers really like her: She’s been charming them since 2007 as co-anchor of the fourth-hour “Today” show segment she co-hosts with Kathie Lee Gifford. Their cocktail-fueled chatter is legendary. Since Kotb took over Lauer’s spot, “Today” has drawn higher ratings. Her far lower salary could be a sign of the decline of blockbuster TV anchor payouts, as Vanity Fair and Variety both suggested on Wednesday. But then what do we make of NBC paying Megyn Kelly a reported $17 million to do her show? You could also look at Kotb’s situation as just another example of a woman getting pushed out onto the “glass cliff,” a phrase coined about a decade ago by a social psychologist to describe the practice of promoting a woman or a person of color into a prestigious position at a time of turmoil or decline. Vanity Fair also argues that Lauer’s salary was the result of decades of negotiations for higher and higher pay, and that newcomers rarely make as much as their predecessors for this reason. That’s a good excuse for the pay gap here. Companies will pay big money to attract outside talent like Kelly, but it’s cheaper to promote someone in-house like Kotb. We also don’t know how hard Kotb pushed for a big payday. Negotiations are always an X-factor at the top of the pay scale. And for women, they’re a gendered minefield. While men are expected to be aggressive and ambitious and ask for lots of money, women are basically taught from birth to be nice. This means they can have a tougher time asking for more ― and when they do ask, they often have lower odds than white men of succeeding. In this case, we just don’t know if Kotb, or her agent, pushed for a Lauer-sized check. It’s possible she is biding her time and plans to ask for a major raise after logging some more hours in the morning-show hot seat. All Kotb would say about it was that she’s fine with earning far less than Lauer. “I think the whole money thing for me, I’ve always been sort of — I know it sounds ridiculous that I’m going to say this, but I really have done jobs I liked for the job I liked because I never wanted to be happy every other Friday on pay day,” Kotb told People. “Like, I didn’t want that to be the happy day. I wanted to feel good throughout.” Certainly, $7 million a year is enough to feel good. We’re hardly talking about the desperate struggles of a woman on poverty’s edge. Still, NBC seems to be the real winner here. It’s paying far less money for someone bringing in higher ratings ― and doesn’t need to worry about shelling out millions to settle embarrassing sexual misconduct claims.

    "title": "Hoda Kotb Replaces Matt Lauer As 'Today' Co-Anchor",
    "text": "Longtime NBC News personality Hoda Kotb has been named the co-anchor of “Today,” permanently replacing Matt Lauer after he was fired in November. “It’s 2018, and we are kicking off the year right because Hoda is officially the co-anchor of ‘Today,’” anchor Savannah Guthrie announced Tuesday on air. “This has to be the most popular decision NBC News have ever made, and I’m so thrilled.” Guthrie and Kotb will become the first all-female team to jointly anchor the morning show’s first two hours. Kotb will also continue co-hosting the fourth hour with Kathie Lee Gifford, according to an NBC News press release. NBC News chairman Andy Lack sent an email earlier on Tuesday to tell staff about the change. “Over the past several weeks, Hoda has seamlessly stepped into the co-anchor role alongside Savannah, and the two have quickly hit the ground running,” Lack wrote. Whaaaaaatttttttt! #SavannahHodaTODAY pic.twitter.com/qX53MUHxcj Kotb, who has for years been a frequent substitute for the primary anchor team, began temporarily filling in for Lauer after he was fired over allegations of sexual misconduct. “This is a very tough morning for both of us,” Kotb said on air the morning Lauer’s firing was announced. “I’ve known Matt for 15 years and I’ve loved him as a friend and a colleague, and just like you were saying, Savannah, it’s hard to reconcile what we are hearing with the man who we know, who walks in this building every single day.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Hoda Kotb Says She's 'Not Making Matt Lauer Money' On 'Today'",
    "text": "Hoda Kotb might be raking in the ratings on “Today,” but she tells People magazine she won’t be making the same salary as the man she’s replacing. NBC announced on Tuesday that Kotb would be replacing Matt Lauer as the co-anchor of the “Today” show after Lauer was accused of sexual misconduct in the workplace. Kotb will join Savannah Guthrie to lead the first two hours of the program, making history as the first female co-anchors for that segment. Kotb told People on Wednesday that neither she nor Guthrie are making the same kind of money Lauer was. “I think the whole money thing for me, I’ve always been sort of — I know it sounds ridiculous that I’m going to say this, but I really have done jobs I liked for the job I liked because I never wanted to be happy every other Friday on pay day,” Kotb told People. “Like, I didn’t want that to be the happy day. I wanted to feel good throughout. So no, I’m not making Matt Lauer money. Not even close.” Kotb did not mention what her contracted salary is, but Page Six reports that she and Guthrie are each making $7 million annually. Lauer ended his 25-year career at the network with a $25 million contract. And Megyn Kelly, who signed on to anchor the morning show’s third hour last year after great success at Fox News, makes about $18 million a year, according to a Variety estimate. NBC and a representative for Kotb did not return HuffPost’s requests for comment. “Today” ratings soared to beat rival “Good Morning America” after Kotb joined Guthrie in December. In an internal email announcing Kotb’s co-anchor role Tuesday, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack said Kotb and Guthrie have an “undeniable connection with each other and most importantly, with viewers.” Kotb will also continue to co-host the show’s fourth-hour slot with Kathie Lee Gifford.",

    "title": "Hollywood Heroines Launch Initiative To Fight Sexual Harassment And Inequality",
    "text": "Some of the entertainment industry’s most powerful women are teaming up to combat sexual harassment and inequality in Hollywood and workplaces nationwide. Over 300 women who work in television, film and theater launched a far-reaching campaign Monday that includes the creation of a legal defense fund to help less-privileged women come forward about sexual misconduct they’ve experienced. The Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, backed by $13 million in donations from over 200 donors, is spearheaded by high-profile attorneys Roberta Kaplan and Tina Tchen, who previously worked as former first lady Michelle Obama’s chief of staff. Tchen pointed to the #MeToo movement as a major catalyst for the initiative. “The magnitude of the past few months highlights the fact that sexual harassment against women in the workplace is endemic and touches every industry,” Tchen said in a statement Monday. “We are a community of women and men who can no longer stand idly by.” “Earning a living should not come at the cost of anyone’s safety, dignity or morale.” The fund is one of several ongoing commitments supported by members of the Time’s Up movement, which includes Reese Witherspoon, Kerry Washington, America Ferrera and Shonda Rhimes. The initiative also plans to push for legislation that would penalize companies that fail to take action against persistent harassment, according to The New York Times. “Earning a living should not come at the cost of anyone’s safety, dignity or morale,” Rhimes, executive producer of “Grey’s Anatomy,” said in a statement. “It’s well past time to change the culture of the environment where most of us spend the majority of our day ― the work place,” she continued. Time’s Up was formed with the knowledge that many Hollywood figures who spoke out against powerful men have some privilege given their financial statuses and social media platforms. Members hope the initiative will help protect all women ― whatever their situation ― against sexual misconduct. Last month, Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, a national organization representing roughly 700,000 female farmworkers, wrote a letter in solidarity with the legion of Hollywood women coming forward about sexual harassment and assault. “We wish that we could say we’re shocked to learn that this is such a pervasive problem in your industry,” the letter stated. “Sadly, we’re not surprised because it’s a reality we know far too well.” On Monday, Time’s Up members responded with their own letter of solidarity in support of the farmworkers and others victimized by sexual misconduct. “Now, unlike ever before, our access to the media and to the important decision makers has the potential of leading to real accountability and consequences,” the letter stated. “We want all survivors of sexual harassment, everywhere, to be heard, to be believed, and to know that accountability is possible,” it continued. Several Hollywood stars tweeted about the launch on Monday: I stand with women across every industry to say #TIMESUP on abuse, harassment, marginalization and underrepresentation. ⁰@TIMESUPNOW https://t.co/4zd5g2ByU0 pic.twitter.com/0h8ojLOq9U I stand with ALL WOMEN across every industry to say #TIMESUP on abuse, harassment, marginalization and underrepresentation.

    "title": "Women, People Of Color Still Abysmally Underrepresented In Hollywood Leadership",
    "text": "In some ways, 2017 was a landmark year for women in movies, with Patty Jenkins directing “Wonder Woman,” one of the three highest-earning films at the box office, all of which featured major female characters. Several female directors also were behind smaller, critically acclaimed movies, like Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird” and Dee Rees’ “Mudbound.” But barely anything has changed for women in the movie industry over the last decade, according to a wide-ranging new study led by University of Southern California professor Stacy Smith, who regularly examines the issue of representation in Hollywood. Released Thursday, the report entitled “Inclusion in the Director’s Chair?” found that from 2007 to 2017, there was no measurable change in the number of major movies directed by women or people of color. Smith and her team examined the filmmakers behind the 100 top-grossing movies released in each of the years included in the study ― a total of 1,223 filmmakers and 1,100 movies. Only 4 percent of the directors were women, “a ratio of 22 males to every one female director,” according to their report. From year to year, the proportion of female directors who directed that year’s top 100 films hovered between 2 and 8 percent. The study cautioned that the small, incremental changes do not represent “true progress” because, for example, none of the eight female directors included in the top 100 movies of 2017 had directed equivalent movies from 2007 to 2016. Compared to their white male counterparts, women and minority directors often find their careers sidelined by few opportunities for advancement, such as being able to move from smaller to bigger projects. Many female directors only directed one movie over the last decade or even over their entire careers, which the study refers to as “the ‘one and done’ phenomenon.” “This is not true progress. Real change means that we see women working across multiple years and that the number of opportunities for female directors expand each year,” Smith wrote. In the history of the Academy Awards, the movie industry’s highest honor, only four women have ever been nominated for the Best Director prize, and only one has ever won ― Kathryn Bigelow for 2009′s “The Hurt Locker.” The USC study found similarly abysmal results for people of color directing top movies over the last decade. Only about 5 percent of the directors were black, and 3 percent were Asian. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The people in charge of hiring and fostering new talent in Hollywood and making decisions on which movies get made are still overwhelmingly white men, according to the study. “Hollywood’s ‘female director problem’ has been the source of much dialogue over the past several years. The evidence reveals that despite the increased attention, there has been no change for women behind the camera,” Smith said. “Mere conversation is not the answer to these problems — and the time for conversation is up. Until major media companies take concrete steps to address the biases that impede hiring, nothing will change.” Read the full study and its methodology here.

    "title": "Trump's Vote Fraud Panel Won't Give Voter Information To Homeland Security",
    "text": "A lawyer for President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission indicated Friday that the panel will not turn over voter information it collected from states to the Department of Homeland Security. Trump disbanded the commission on Wednesday, and the White House said DHS would take over the commission’s work of investigating voter fraud, which several studies and investigations have shown is not a widespread problem. The announcement prompted confusion and concern over what DHS would do with personal voter roll data that the commission, as of October, had collected from 20 states. As a federal agency, DHS faces restrictions on how it can collect and use Americans’ personal information that the commission, which was only a federal advisory committee, did not have. On Friday, the ACLU of Florida filed an emergency motion in federal court to block the commission from giving any personal information it collected to DHS. In an email that was included in the ACLU’s filing, Joseph Borson, a Department of Justice attorney representing the commission, said the panel had no intention of turning information over. “First, as you know, the Director of White House Information Technology (“DWHIT”) is maintaining the data submitted by the States, and has made clear that no other entity or persons beyond a limited number of his technical staff have access to it,” Borson wrote. “We have additionally been authorized to represent that the data will not be transferred or utilized; thus, there is no basis for emergency injunctive relief.” The comment only adds to confusion about how DHS will take up the commission’s work. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R) has said he would be an informal adviser to DHS and told Politico he expected Immigration and Customs Enforcement to run state voter rolls against databases to identify noncitizens on the voting rolls. Experts warn that’s not a reliable way to identify people illegally on the rolls. Tyler Houlton, a DHS spokesman, said the department as a matter of policy did not comment on pending litigation. Lauren Ehrsam, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said the DOJ declined to comment. DHS officials are distancing themselves from the probe, telling Reuters Friday that its election unit didn’t have any plans to investigate voter fraud. “At the President’s direction, the Department continues to work in support of state governments who are responsible for administering elections, with efforts focused on securing elections against those who seek to undermine the election system or its integrity. Mr. Kobach is not advising the Department on this matter,” Houlton, a DHS spokesman, said in a statement to HuffPost on Thursday.

In June, Kobach sent out a letter to election officials in all 50 states requesting that they provide the commission with all publicly available voter data, including, if possible, the last four digits of Social Security numbers. The request set off a bipartisan uproar, and Republican and Democratic officials alike refused to turn over all or part of the information the commission was requesting. Some officials said they would not do so on principle, while others said they were prohibited by state law from giving the commission the data it wanted. Even though the backlash was bipartisan, Trump blamed Democrats who refused to hand over data for blocking his commission’s work.

    "title": "These Are A Few Of The Shelters Scrambling To Offer Winter Storm Refuge",
    "text": "For thousands of people living on the streets, being outside could easily turn deadly as frigid temperatures sweep across the East Coast this week. In these weather conditions, frostbite and hypothermia can set in within minutes, according to the National Weather Service. As many as 12 deaths have been blamed on the recent cold. Homeless shelters from Florida to Massachusetts are scrambling to provide adequate housing for those in need. Here’s how some of them are handling the winter storm, and where you can go for help. Florida typically sees above-average levels of unsheltered homelessness due to its warm climate. But this week, temperatures in Tallahassee dipped below those in Anchorage, Alaska, and below-freezing temperatures also brought snow to the region for the first time in 28 years. RARE SIGHT: it's snowing in Tallahassee FL for the 1st time in 28 years. @NWSTallahassee measured 0.1\" of snow/sleet on their roof @floridastate at 8:30 AM. Video via 904 Happy Hour. #snow #flwx#frozenAmerica pic.twitter.com/dG5uMrTcpM Although the wintry accumulation may look beautiful, it’s bad news for those without a roof over their heads. Tallahassee’s Kearney Center ― a 242-bed facility that serves more than 900 meals a day ― has been inundated by people seeking refuge, the center’s director, Jacob Reiter, told HuffPost on Wednesday. During cold weather, the center typically receives about 50 additional people ― but two nights ago, 419 people checked in, Reiter said by phone. That’s nearly double the number of beds available. “We’ve got to kind of find areas that are safe inside the building to put additional people inside,” Reiter said. That means setting up spare cots and turning dorms into “gathering rooms,” he explained. “Every day is emergency operations for us,” he said. “We’re doing everything we can.” Making matters worse, the shelter is the only one of its kind in the area. “There’s no other emergency shelter for adults in the entire region, so you have to go all the way to Jacksonville or Gainesville until you find another shelter,” Reiter said. But the solution is not adding more shelters, he added. “We need to address some of the systemic problems. We need more affordable housing we need a higher living wage,” he said. “I think the best way to address it is affordable housing and jobs.” In Savannah, Georgia, where below-freezing temperatures shut down roads and an airport on Wednesday, the Salvation Army’s local shelter was among the area’s facilities bracing for an influx of people. Shane Pritchard, speaking to HuffPost by phone while operating the shelter’s front desk on Wednesday afternoon, said normally the shelter doesn’t open its doors before 5 p.m., but the dangerous weather has created an exception. “I had a guy come in earlier today, and he had ice on his jacket,” Pritchard said. Okay, if this verifies, we have history on our handsCurrent @weatherchannel forecast for Savannah calls for over 6\" of snow todayIn almost 150 years of record keeping, the snowiest day in Savannah is only 3.6\" pic.twitter.com/YbE9QQrWAx Pritchard said the shelter, which has 130 beds as well as spare cots, had filled up on Tuesday night. “When we run out of cots, we have air mattresses that we’ll put up in our TV rooms,” he explained. “I’m just doing it until I run out of space.” Like Reiter, he admitted the work isn’t easy, but added that “if I was out there, I’d want someone to help me.” “It does get hectic, especially because I’m the only one here,” Pritchard said, after noting that the closed roads had prevented other staff members from driving in to help. As far as neighboring shelters go, there are others available, including the Inner City Night Shelter, the Old Savannah City Mission, and Union Mission. The Salvation Army’s shelter is the only one that accepts guests 24 hours, Pritchard said. “The building shuts down, but if people are still looking for a place to stay, we’re still available,” he said. Anyone arriving after 10 p.m. will require an escort by a police officer, he added. Temperatures in parts of South Carolina are forecast to fall into the single digits and teens at times from Wednesday night to Saturday, meaning extremely dangerous conditions for those left out in the cold. David Hanna, director of the Greenville Rescue Mission, which offers housing for men, said Wednesday that the shelter has nearly hit capacity, with 130 guests in the main shelter and 90 people in a cold weather shelter that can house 100. Tonight's forecast for the western Carolinas and northeast Georgia pic.twitter.com/vBAnHeJQdg “I’m really surprised, to be honest,” Hanna said of the fact that the shelter has not yet gone over capacity. “We’re hoping that we don’t go over that number, but we’ll find a way to accommodate everyone.” He urged anyone needing shelter ― men, women or children ― to seek help. “Anybody who is still out there, they are very welcome here. We’d love to have them join us and we’d be a lot happier to know they’re safe,” he said. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) tweeted a list of winter weather shelters that are open. Those locations can be viewed here. We have a few winter weather shelters open. Click for an up to date list of shelters: https://t.co/vXXzczV6EZ In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh urged members of the public to call 911 if they see someone in the cold who may need help. He also asked people to check on elderly neighbors in case they need assistance. Walsh had announced earlier that a snow emergency would go into effect at 7 a.m. local time on Thursday. Such emergencies open Boston Center-Youth & Families Community Centers as warming centers. The number of centers that will open up depends on the need, according to the city’s website. The full list of centers can be found here. “We’re going to continue to be out there, but we’re asking people that if you see someone who might seem disoriented or who shouldn’t be out in the cold, if you call 911, we will get emergency personnel there to try to encourage them to come on in to a shelter,” Walsh said. There are 1,481 year-round emergency shelter beds available throughout Boston for those in need, in addition to 242 overflow beds ― 172 for men and 70 for women ― which can be accessed through a number of shelters that the city collaborates with, according to the city’s website. Those shelters include: - Pine Street Inn ― has three separate locations for men, women and families in need - Boston Rescue Mission ― open to men and women - The Boston Night Center ― open to men and women - Bridge Over Troubled Waters ― open to youth, ages 14 to 24 - Rosie’s Place ― women’s shelter Layers, layers, layers! As the cold weather continues & snow moves in, make sure to bundle up to stay warm & avoid frostbite.

The “Code Blue” alert means that anyone seeking shelter at one of the city’s facilities will not be turned away. Outreach teams will also contact individuals who have been deemed vulnerable several times a day, and will bring them to a shelter if needed. Since the Code Blue protocols were initiated late last month, there have been 106 placements in shelters, safe havens and other warm locations, the city said. Temperatures are to go below freezing tonight. If you see anyone at risk, especially those living on the street, please call 311. During #CodeBlue, shelter is available system-wide for anyone brought to a shelter by outreach teams.

    "title": "How Democrats Can End Trump’s Spell In 2018",
    "text": "Here’s the rub: I fear that Democrats are going to win a hollow victory this November. Sure, they may (though may not) gain a few extra seats ― possibly even enough to retake Congress. But America needs more than that right now. She needs that unity which comes from renewed commitment to a better narrative. This, of course, requires at least some participation from both sides. Trouble is, the Democratic Party has shown themselves both unable and uninterested in reaching out to Trump supporters. Though I’m going to use the term “we,” I’m not actually a Democrat. But I have close friends in each camp, and I see more common ground between them than many would suppose. People are dimensional. For all the hard words thrown and hard lines drawn of late, many are still open to their better angels calling them to higher perspective. Making that easy for them will have a dramatic effect on both the polls and the national conversation, and I’d suggest there are seven things Democrats can do to this end: #1: Embrace the only message that will resonate. There’s exactly one slogan likely to convert any of those still standing behind Trump — one so obvious that few have taken it seriously. “Make America Great Again” If we want to reach Trump supporters, we need to beat Trump at his own game. Workshopped cliches like “Forward Together” and “A Better Deal” will help said cause by about 0%. To win minds, we need to deconstruct Trump’s tricks while presenting a more compelling vision. And nothing will do this more effectively than taking his promise and fleshing it out in detail so as to help people understand the real choice in front of them. Consider this ad: A nurse giving a diagnosis to a white senior. It’s bad. He needs treatment. The man frets. “I can’t pay. I have no coverage.” As he sits in fear, show Obamacare stats on the screen (patients covered, lives saved). Promise “we can fix this in Congress, together”, then flash “Make America Great Again” and fade to black. Now imagine fifty variants of this on rotation, each emphasizing a transpartisan goal while hinting at the required work of getting there, each shining a light on the deeper infrastructure of the beautiful American machine, each laying bare the practical mechanics of greatness, each showing Democrats actually doing something. Most Americans have the same core values. The election ought to be about competence and connection, not tribalism. There’s no need to name or attack opponents. We just need to prove that we get it. Viewers will connect the dots and Trump’s hold will break. (Note: While the DNC couldn’t legally adopt the slogan as their own, they could use it in ads under fair use principles.) #2: Place a freeze on non-starter debates. I used to be a preacher. The first lesson you learn is never to make it hard for someone to take a step towards Jesus. To demand immediate and total conversion is to waste your effort while doing violence to the deeper idea of slow love. Political conversion is no different. We want small wins that compound. Any hint of judgment or coercion undoes this. We need only explain our beliefs in the most honest, direct means possible and then embody them attractively, projecting good will as we go. Now think about how often we do the opposite when it comes to issues like gun control. We demand an ideological fealty we can never hope to gain. The well is too poisoned and walls are too high. No partisan approach will accomplish anything at this point. So why are we still banging the drum of futility when we could be taking the lead on something that might actually help — like, say, onboarding 250,000 more mental health professionals? When we extend the olive branch and focus on common wins that chip away at root problems, we gain listeners and build mutual respect. While some policies may need to change, we can always circle back later to discuss them after the hurt and distrust have been replaced by a foundation for fruitful and cooperative engagement. #3: Focus on common ground over partisan framing. We often frame problems in ways that make it impossible for those on the other side to take that first step towards us. For example, why focus on pro-choice allegiance when most Republicans already share the root value of wanting to reduce unwanted pregnancies? We don’t have to risk Roe v. Wade to acknowledge that some people have legitimate, non-hateful reasons for being abortion-averse. Why force them into a binary decision that can only divide? To be clear, rights don’t have to change. Language has to change. We need to stop making support of the most ideological expression of our beliefs a condition of allyship. For someone to be wary of terms like pro-choice or feminism because of their experiences isn’t necessarily proof of secret misogyny. If we root our discussions in our mutual commitment to fairness and empathy, and if we approach questions about particulars from that shared plane, we just might find ourselves on the same side. Just so, the world won’t get any hotter if we never say the words global warming again — while our political climate might actually cool if we focus our language on our communal responsibility to be good caretakers of the earth. The same ends can be reached by many means. When we start where we agree, we can get somewhere together in a way that fosters trust and open-mindedness. If our big-ticket policies are truly best, we ought to let the evidence make its own appeal to people who feel heard, respected, and involved. #4: Stop alienating wealthy people. As we enter the age of artificial intelligence, the rich are going to get richer. We moralize this to our peril. When we begin with the assumption that rich people have no desire to be just or fair, we lessen their interest in working with us (and we increase their likelihood of writing large checks to opponents and partisan media outlets). This again comes down to language and creativity. All this talk of punitive taxation and “the 1%” is pushing away those who might want to help. As just one creative alternative, we could offset some rates with an inventory of mutual interest investment opportunities (where the rich gain some discretion about where their marginal dollars go). We’d still realize the desired benefits, but we’d give top payers some agency and the ability to feel good about their contributions. There are tens of thousands of such projects out there, each of which might allow “the invisible hand” (as Adam Smith actually conceived it) to let self-benefiting investments serve a wider end. Think of it like Donors Choose for civic development. Rich people run companies that need healthy, educated workers. They have children they want to see safe and loved by healthy peers. They have all the incentives they need to be good citizens. The real disconnect is about who decides which projects take priority and how they’re structured — the best answers to which will always involve some interplay and compromise. (To be clear, I’m not suggesting we let corporations dictate which basic services get offered or how core taxes are spent — only that we could allow them to funnel marginal amounts into special investment buckets as one example of reframing the problem in non-divisive way.) #5: Offer unconditional amnesty to Trump supporters. Great leaders always remind us that commitment to great principles wins in the end. They point out ways in which we can contribute, uniting us around a common vision. They reassure us that our work is not in vain. They take away our frustration and give us catharsis and direction in return. They keep us from indulging our worst selves. The Democrats haven’t had this leadership since Obama left the White House, and this absence has left many of us unsure how to fight against the darkness. Without a better direction, many of us resorted to lashing out in ways we knew weren’t kind or productive. I don’t know where said leaders are or when they might arrive, but I’d make one suggestion in their absence: that we unite in pushing for a general amnesty in the interim. Don’t get me wrong: I also vent about Trump. But I know the utility of doing so is purely negative at this point. Not only will it not win anyone over, it’ll push most further away. The problem at this point is relational, not informational. And the only way to solve that particular problem is to take a step of reconciliation towards our neighbors, using grace to pierce those narratives which hateful men have sold them about us being on different sides. The only practical step we have at this point is amnesty: an agreement to forgive and forget. I’m sure many have strong feelings against this idea. So did the ancient Athenians when the Spartans ended their long occupation and their puppet tyrants fled. None of those who remained could see an easy path to loving their neighbors when half their neighbors had supported a murderous regime. And yet they did the only thing they could to move forward: they took an oath to forget the past and never bring it up again. Our situation today is less drastic, but not so different. There’s no scenario in which 63 million Trump voters will fall on their knees to beg forgiveness. Why not abandon that hope and get ahead on the one thing that can be done? As all our best stories tell us, grace produces more repentance than strict justice ever has or can. (That said, we must make exception for those who’ve directly authored or stirred the hate, from whichever side. By all means, let’s oppose and discipline them openly as an example to all.) #6: Unify against the greater threat. The most urgent problem we’ll face in our generation is a lack of infrastructure to deal with the casualties of the shifting economy. We got a taste of this with the collapse of American manufacturing jobs — more of which were automated than outsourced. If Trump won on the strength of that first wave, imagine what’s coming when their numbers swell by 20 or 30 million more displaced workers? We already have too many citizens no longer able to derive meaning or financial stability from any employment they can find and/or hold. This has fueled crime, addiction, and a hollowing out of the American life. People focused on survival and a search for hope aren’t focused on training for the remaining jobs we still have. This is a hard problem that’s going to involve titanic solutions. But despite many of our best minds suggesting that some combination of basic income and universal healthcare are part of the right solution, we’ve largely deferred working on either. I suspect this is because the pain has been mostly felt by rural communities (which most legislators don’t live in or understand). But this blight is soon coming to the cities, and we aren’t ready. There are other grave threats — climate change and nuclear war among them — but none so likely to undo us before we have a chance to solve the rest. Let’s recall that most of the Founding Fathers despised the idea of party systems, and for good cause. It’s hard to unite against common threats when we’re busy point-scoring and vilifying the other team. The DNC needs to make it clear in their policy, their rhetoric, and their actions that they’re going to fight like hell for all of us, arm in arm with any Republicans who share an interest of keeping winter at bay. (In this vein, a good leader might tell counter-protestors to skip the next Charlottesville and go instead as volunteers and witnesses to affected communities. You can’t put out a fire by focusing on the flames.) #7: Delegate more power (and trust) to the people. The DNC showed itself to be a bought party in how it treated Bernie Sanders in 2016. Perhaps he would have lost anyway, but that hardly matters to his supporters. Those who held the strings were more interested in forcing their agenda than listening to the people. If the central duty of party leadership is to amplify those voices which best address the concerns and hopes of the majority, the Democratic Party isn’t doing so great right now. Being blunt, the only bright spots I’ve seen have been from groups like Brand New Congress and Crooked Media. Both are brilliant efforts, but both are also non-representative of the DNC itself. Trump has a hundred megaphones through which to reach his base, while most Americans have no idea who Tom Perez is or what hopes he may have for this country.

    "title": "How The Heck Do Air Fryers Work, Anyway?",
    "text": "Every year when January rolls around we find ourselves skimping on the booze, refreshing our workout wear, purging our refrigerators and meticulously planning out our Whole30 meals ― all in the name of a new year, new us. Last year, we tried trend diets like Whole30 and “keto,” and in 2016 we were into bone broth and matcha. This year’s healthy eating trend that’s taking the internet by storm? Air fryers ― the tiny, magical machines that use hot air to fry foods to a golden, crispy finish. If you’re like us, you’re probably wondering how the heck air can be used to fry things. Turns out, these kitchen tools are pretty aptly named because they work by circulating hot air around the food, much like hot oil surrounds food to cook it all the way through. The Philips Airfryer claims to be “the original airfryer,” and supposedly uses 75 percent less fat to fry foods in a “healthier” way with only one tablespoon or less of oil. Through a combination of “rapid air technology” and targeted heat and air flow, the fryer fully cooks dishes like roasted rack of lamb in 30 minutes, roasted winter veggies in 20 minutes, and fried risotto balls in 10 minutes. Sounds a bit like, well, an oven, right? You’re not wrong, as both technologies use hot air to cook, but there are a few notable differences between air fryers and ovens, namely cooking methods, cooking time, and results. Ovens don’t use this ~fancy~ “rapid air technology” to cook, instead relying on heating elements and fans to disperse heat, which takes longer and doesn’t produce the same fried result. Ovens, on the other hand, are probably better for toasting, roasting and broiling. Still, if your New Year’s Resolution involves eating healthier versions of your favorite foods, an air fryer might just be the oil-free kitchen tool of your dreams. The Philips Airfryer comes at a hefty $250 price tag (though it can be found cheaper on Amazon) alongside other cheaper alternatives. If you’re in the market for an air fryer, we’ve pulled together a selection of different makes, models, sizes and price tags.

    "title": "How My Uncle's Military Photos Inspired My Project On Latino Masculinity",
    "text": "Communion 1972 I began Fragments of the Masculine to honor my late uncle and the connection we shared even though I had never met him. In 1987, my uncle passed away in a tragic car accident and shortly after, my mother passed his middle name and surname on to me. I felt that, as his namesake, I was left to carry on the legacy and memory of my uncle. Because of this, growing up, I was always intrigued by tales of my late uncle. Through the Veil I felt connected to my late uncle not only through blood, but through family photographs, as well. The photographs of his youth and of his time in the Colombian military captivated me, and the more I stared at the photographs, the more I spent time with them, the more I found aspects of myself reflected in the images. However, I also found aspects of an identity that felt distant and foreign to me. These photographs of my uncle exuded a Hyper Masculine energy and identity that felt unfamiliar. As a young Latino boy still trying to understand his own sexual and cultural identity, these images were both enlightening and alarming. On one hand, they were a window into my uncle’s life, an insight that bonded us from the beyond; yet on the other hand, these images represented a blueprint to Masculinity that I felt I could never live up to. During my teenage years, I began to both confront and accept my identity as a gay man. I also began to experience what it meant to exist as gay male within my Latino community. Growing up within my community, I would often hear disparaging criticisms of homosexuality. Throughout my adolescent years, I was made to understand that being a gay man contradicted what it meant to be a Masculine Latino Male. These ideas and experiences would later resurface in my work as I pursued my artistic ambitions. 1981 Communion 2001 In 2015, I revisited the images of my uncle and began building an archive with the intention of starting a project that would explore the connection I had with them, but midway through this process, the project evolved. After searching through family photo albums for more imagery of my uncle, I stumbled upon a set of Polaroids of my biological father. The Polaroids were taken and sent to me when he was incarcerated in the United States. It had been a while since I had last seen those images and my instinct told me to collect them. I examined every aspect of those images much like when I did with the images of my uncle. My eye was drawn to my father’s body language, mannerisms, and his handwriting. Many of the Polaroids contained messages or notes and provided insight into the father I barely knew. The Polaroids also served as visual evidence of the only time I had ever met my father: while he was still imprisoned. It felt as though, through those images, my absentee-father was attempting to parent me and show me how to embody this ideology of Masculinity that I was expected to live up to. Confronted with this new discovery, I started incorporating images of my biological father into my art practice and soon realized that there was a greater correlation between the images my late uncle and biological father. A Memory Lost Papasito Using reproductions of the archival photographs of my father and uncle, I created experimental photographic collages by ripping, deconstructing, adding to, and removing information from each original image to create new compositions. I also incorporated patterned printed materials and cultural dialect that refer to my Colombian heritage into the images, deepening their personal narrative. Through this creative process, I confront each image from a personal and reflective standpoint, allowing instinct and emotion to guide the creation of the final composition. While this initially began as a personal narrative, it expanded to a universal one. My examination of the photographs of both my uncle and biological father address not just my personal relationship with these two men, but the ideas behind Masculine culture within the Latino Community as well. Through my work, I examine my childhood, sexual identity, and the profound impact these images had on my upbringing and the formation of my own identity. In Fragments of the Masculine, I seek to question traditional ideas on Masculinity, particularly within the Latino American community. Much like my deconstructed images, I am breaking down archaic ideas that limit and devalue the complexities of the formation of one’s own identity.

    "title": "How To Beat The '7-Year Itch' In Your Relationship",
    "text": "Ups and downs are par for the course in any long-term relationship. But it’s a commonly held belief that at the seven-year mark specifically, couples tend to fall into a slump, which often leaves them feeling restless and dissatisfied with the marriage. This is known as “the seven-year itch.” Indeed, the median length of marriages that end in divorce has long hovered around seven years, according to U.S. government data. But, overall, relationship experts are divided on whether this phenomenon is real. “No one has discovered anything particularly special about the seventh year of a relationship,” Karl Pillemer, the author of 30 Lessons for Loving: Advice From the Wisest Americans on Love, Relationships, and Marriage, told HuffPost. “So couples should not dread the seventh year as a unique threat. On the other hand, studies do show that on average, marital satisfaction and overall quality drop over the first several years people are together, as ‘real life’ — and in particular kids — enter the picture.” Couples can, of course, fall into a rut at any point in a relationship ― whether it’s been six months, seven years or decades. But if you’re one of the couples who feels the so-called itch coming on, don’t fret. We reached out to experts who gave us their advice on how to reignite the spark in your marriage right now. “If you feel the itch to leave your relationship as you near seven years, ask yourself if you are itching for a change in general. If you feel your relationship is stagnant or boring, look around at your life as a whole. Is your relationship stagnant, or is your life stagnant? People can transfer their feeling of boredom or lack of enthusiasm for aspects of their life onto their partner when their partner may not be the cause at all.” ― Marie Land, psychologist “Ask each other if you feel grateful for your partner’s presence in your life. If you find that your feelings of gratitude ― or lack thereof ― are less than ideal, now would be an excellent time to ask yourself why. Once you discover the answer, I recommend that you actually do something to express your gratitude ― and to do it frequently in a way that your partner knows in their heart that you sincerely appreciate them. If you truly can’t find reasons to feel grateful, that is a strong indicator of other problems. Start having conversations with your spouse, no matter how difficult it may be. You need to get to the root of why one or both of you are not feeling and/or expressing gratitude.” ― Gary Brown, marriage and family therapist “Realize that hot, new love inevitably becomes not-so-hot, older love. People in search of hot, new love and bolt every time there is an itch discover, sadly, that they are unable to sustain relationships. Because that can’t-eat-can’t-sleep euphoric phase of romantic love is biologically unsustainable in humans. Our body chemicals kick in at around the two-year mark and the euphoria turns into the less sexy attachment phase of a relationship. I have interviewed lots of divorced men and women who bolted when the new became old, and often these are the people who go on to have multiple, unsuccessful marriages. That’s the challenge in making a marriage last: We must embrace the reality that, through time, our relationships lapse into a predictable routine that may not have the heat of a honeymoon but has something larger and more important — and that is security and friendship and commitment.” ― Iris Krasnow, author of Surrendering to Marriage and The Secret Lives of Wives “Do something your partner is interested in and you aren’t. When a relationship goes stale, resentment of a significant other’s independent interests often plays a part. The long and happily married elders I’ve studied ask this: What’s more important, how you spend your leisure time or your relationship? Choose a week and, at one point in it, join in your partner’s interest. He loves country music and you hate it? Get tickets to a country concert. Her love of hiking bores you out of your wits? Choose a local park, pack a lunch and give it a try. Some elders actually found they enjoyed the other’s interest. And it can be better than sitting at home feeling angry and left out.” ― Karl Pillemer “If you find that you need everything in your life to be perfect ― or at least to appear perfect ― you’re in trouble. The very best of marriages are never perfect. Fairy tales are nice, but they are just that; they’re fairy tales and they bear very little resemblance to real life. If you want to avoid the pitfall of any ‘itch,’ then you have to learn to let go of your need for your partner (or yourself) to be in a perfect marriage. That puts way too much stress on your relationship and actually increases the chances that you will divorce.” ― Gary Brown “If you’re not talking, you’re not touching and if you’re not touching, you’re in trouble. Sex is really fun and can ease the tension of all the other stuff that comes up when you are living with the same person in the same house, sharing kids and bills, year after year.” ― Iris Krasnow Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "How To Divvy Up Finances In A Long-Term Relationship",
    "text": "When you’re in a long-term relationship, a discussion around merging finances is a really good idea. Most often, cohabitation is the the right time to have the money conversation. Before then, it might make your partner uncomfortable. Moving in together means sharing costs, so it makes sense to start then, though it’s ultimately up to you to decide the best time. Since money touches almost every one of our day-to-day decisions, merging finances can bring more clarity and efficiency to your life. When my colleagues and I work with clients, our goal is to get them to shift their individualistic mindset and take on more of a team approach. We’ve seen couples who have been married for years still Venmo’ing each other for rent. Let us tell you: There’s definitely a better way! The Team Mentality As you can imagine, most couples come into a relationship with different financial situations. One person might be earning more, have credit card debt or student loans, better healthcare benefits at work, or a higher 401(k) match, etc. If you start thinking as a team, deciding which levers to pull and how to approach saving and debt decisions becomes more straightforward because you’re looking at things from a big-picture perspective. While some people feel their S.O.'s student debt is not their responsibility, we remind them that over the course of their relationship, they will benefit from the higher income that their S.O. may obtain because of that debt. (By virtue of being more marketable.) So, if one person can help their S.O. pay down that debt even faster, both can start working toward other, more fun goals much more quickly. We totally understand that this is a huge mindset shift and will not happen overnight — or, in some cases, at all. But, starting a conversation about money is an important step. Combining In Stages Sometimes couples can work to merge their assets in stages. Pre-debt, post-debt, pre-marriage, post-marriage, etc. But overall, I encourage clients to move away from thinking of their assets and liabilities as mine or theirs, and instead to think of them as our assets and liabilities. When one person comes enters a relationship with a child from a previous relationship, most of us would agree that it’s best to think of the child as “our child.” Similarly, over the course of your life together, you will tackle many challenges together and your finances are no different. For married people who are exceptionally concerned with having their “own” money, it makes sense to discuss a prenup or post-nup, as the law would override individual assets, making the state of your savings — individual or joint — irrelevant. How To Talk About Finances Early In A Relationship Some financial professionals say to wait on these conversations, but I think the earlier the better. Financial habits are a good indicator of priorities; if you and your partner don't share priorities, that may be a sign other issues will arise down the road. The important thing is to start small, don't jump into heavy-duty conversations. Start with simple questions, and try your best not to interject with immediate commentary or judgment. You want these conversations to be constructive and productive. An app I've recommended to clients who are in relatively new relationships and aren’t ready to graduate to a joint account system is called Honey-Fi. It's simple to set up and easy to use. Also, it's flexible in terms of giving you full autonomy over how much information you want to share; the rest you can keep private. How To Combine Finances When You Live Together For couples who do want to combine their finances, here’s a step-by-step guide to how to do so: Joint Emergency Fund Once you’re living together, it’s a good idea to have an emergency fund with cash savings equal to three months worth of your joint fixed expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, transportation costs, etc.). Calculate what that number is, multiply it by three, and slowly work toward saving that amount together. You can automate a monthly savings amount directly from your joint checking account. Joint Credit Card Once you know how much of your paycheck is going to rent, other monthly expenses, as well as student loans and other savings, the rest is yours to enjoy. Figure out what that number is and then use a joint credit card for all those costs, from SoulCycle to happy hours and dinners out to get as many rewards points as you can. (Shout out, points junkies!) Every few days, log in to your credit card app to keep an eye on how much you and your partner have racked up so you don't go over the amount you can feasibly pay off each month. You never want to put more on your credit card than you can afford to pay off in any given month. If you can't pay off the item you’re purchasing, you cannot afford it yet — period. (There are exceptions, but this is the rule.) Consider opening up a savings account and stashing money away for a few months until you can afford that item, and then feel free to put it on your credit card, confident in the knowledge you will be able to pay the bill off in full when it comes due. How To Combine Finances When You're Married In addition to everything in the last slide, married couples should consider having joint accounts: Joint Checking Account Having a single account where paychecks get deposited keeps everyone on the same page about what’s going in and what’s coming out. If this doesn’t feel right, we recommend having a “side stash” — a little money on the side that’s a judgement-free zone your partner can’t comment on. Your main paycheck should go into the joint checking account, but you pick a number or percentage together (no more than a few hundred dollars) that goes into your side stash. Many couples find this to be a helpful tactic to cap “fun” money, while avoiding arguments. Joint Savings Account When you’re planning for goals together, it’s a good idea to segregate that money from the rest of your financial life in a completely separate account. We like using an online bank, which has the added benefit of keeping your savings out of sight, out of mind. You can then set up a monthly or biweekly automatic transfer from your checking into that savings account; and when you hit your goal, spend that money guilt-free. Take that trip, or buy the couch!

    "text": "Behind nearly every person who’s achieved success in their field, you’ll find a mentor who helped them get there. For outpatient coder and auditor Sundae Yomes, that person is Claudia Kernaghan. Yomes said her career in the health industry would have stalled without her more experienced colleague’s help. “I was working as a medical biller and was given the opportunity to transfer into coding, but I had no experience,” Yomes said. “I was determined to be successful, though, and luckily, Claudia took me under her wing and taught me the guidelines and how to use my coding books. It was her guidance and encouragement that helped me attain my first coding credential.” Today, Yomes is the Las Vegas chapter president of the American Academy of Professional Coders, and mentors other workers every chance she gets. “I tell people it’s essential to meet up with others and find the right person you click with and can forge a strong friendship with,” she said. “You have to have trust with your mentor and know that they have your best interest at heart.” As Yomes’ career development shows, mentorships are invaluable. Unfortunately, many millennial workers forgo such relationships, sometimes out of pride, said Adam Smiley Poswolsky, millennial workplace expert and author of The Quarter-Life Breakthrough: Invent Your Own Path, Find Meaningful Work, and Build a Life That Matters. “Young people are very self-motivated and determined. Often, they want to prove to themselves they can make anything happen. That’s understandable, but not an effective way of approaching career growth,” Poswolsky told HuffPost. “Asking for advice is not a sign of weakness; it shows you care about your job and building your career capital. The more you invest in mentorship, the more you learn.” Finding and maintaining a mentor relationship is especially important for women. More men than women say they interact with senior leaders at least once a week ― which all too often keeps women at lower levels in their companies, according to research by the management consulting firm McKinsey and the nonprofit Lean In. Below, Poswolsky and other workplace experts share their best advice for finding a senior workplace ally. Kate Snowise, a psychologist and executive coach, encourages clients to look for people who are five to 10 years ahead of them in their careers and in a role they aspire to. Once you’ve spotted a few prospective mentors, ask them if they wouldn’t mind sparing an hour for coffee to discuss how they ended up where they are in their careers. “Most people are actually complimented by such an act. In the midst of a busy working world, it is nice to know that someone admires you for where you have gotten and what you have achieved,” Snowise said. “The worst that can happen is you hear nothing back, and the best is that it may be the start a highly beneficial relationship that helps you plan and navigate your own career.” Ideally, your workplace values each person’s professional development and has created institutional programs to help connect newer staff with higher-ups. Mentorship programs are especially important in the wake of recent high-profile workplace sexual harassment scandals. As The New York Times reported, many men in high-powered positions admit they’re less likely to mentor women, fearing that one-on-one interaction with female subordinates could be misinterpreted or gossiped about by others. “Mentor programs can counter any misconceptions of favoritism or inappropriate activity by being transparent, outlining policies and being structured with the help of HR,” said Lynn Taylor, a national workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant; How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior & Thrive in Your Job. Plus, Taylor said, such programs also serve to benefit the company. “Excellent retention, word-of-mouth, talent acquisition and solid growth can be direct results of well-planned mentorship programs,” Taylor said. “They’re the hallmarks of great employers.” If no mentorship program exists at your job, give your mentor search some direction by pretending you’re searching for investors in you and your future career, Poswolsky said. “I encourage millennials to build their own board of directors made up of four or five mentors they can turn to for professional and personal advice,” he said. “Find people who have experience in the area you want to work ... whose character and leadership qualities you admire.” Your mentors should be people you actually want to have a conversation with, Poswolsky explained. “This isn’t supposed to feel like homework; it’s supposed to be fun,” he said. “The best mentor is someone who will tell like it is, even if that means admitting what they don’t like about their job, or what’s not working at their company. Instead of picking the most senior person at your company, look for someone who will give you honest and thoughtful feedback.” Cast an even wider net by going to local networking events and perusing online resources, said Hannah Becker, a millennial career blogger at The Motivated Millennial. “Online resources are helpful because finding a knowledgeable and supportive mentor in one’s field or organization can be really challenging,” she said. “A few mentor-matching resources I recommend are eMentor for military veterans and MicroMentor for entrepreneurs.” And don’t forget about LinkedIn’s resources. Late last year, the online resume juggernaut rolled out its Career Advice mentoring program, which aims to connect users with mentors and coaches in their fields, free of charge. You may feel like your mentor-mentee relationship is one-sided, with you reaping the career benefits and your mentor losing out on valuable time, but that’s not entirely the case. Giving back and helping others actually has amazing benefits for the person doing the giving, Snowise said. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "How To Get Your Engagement Ring Properly Insured",
    "text": "Engagement rings may no longer be required to cost three months’ worth of income, but they are still pretty expensive. It might be the last thing on your mind when you got engaged, but just like any other forms of valuables, financial protection is called for in case something bad happens to it. “People often make the mistake in thinking that an engagement ring is automatically insured under a homeowners policy,” says Jerry Ehrenwald, president and CEO of the International Gemological Institute. “However, many policies only provide limited coverage, which could leave you footing the bill — or a big chunk of it — if you need to replace an expensive item.” Every couple should consider a insurance policy appropriate for their ring. Read on for all the essential tips you need to know to get started. Pick A Provider Determine the type of coverage you actually need: Most homeowners policy will only cover a maximum of $1,000 to $2,500 for personal jewelry, which might work if your ring cost was on the lower end of the spectrum. However, if your ring had a much higher value than that, the smart thing to do is to get an extension — also known as a “rider” — that specifically provides coverage for your ring. Give your home insurance provider a call to figure out the personal property limit, and the type of rider available to you. Get An Appraisal A receipt for your ring is required by the insurance provider, and you’ll also need to get a jewelry appraisal to determine the real value of your ring. Check your insurance company’s guidelines to make sure that the type of appraisal you’re paying for fits the requirements. The American Gem Society has an online directory for the appraisers in your area. Expect to fork over $50 to $100 an hour for this service, based on an estimate listed on Jewelers Mutual. How Much It Costs Engagement ring insurance plans work on an annual basis, and according to Investopedia, you’ll be paying $1 to $2 for every $100 the ring is worth. The number fluctuates according to where you’re based: You’ll be expected to pay more for your coverage for places with higher theft rates. Read The Fine Print As with all insurance policies, it’s important to read the policies thoroughly and evaluate whether they fit your specific needs. Some riders will cover accidental loss, while others won’t account for other damage beyond theft or loss. Another important answer to get on paper: What counts as sufficient proof that your ring is gone and will need to be replaced. If you want a more tailored plan for your piece of bling, consider going to a company that specialize in jewelry insurance, such as GemSafe.

Extreme cold can pose a number of hazards to life and property ― but you can minimize the risk by familiarizing yourself with winter safety tips. HuffPost has gathered a number of these, which you will find below, in an effort to ensure you and your loved ones are prepared for the winter storm informally dubbed “Grayson.” If water pipes freeze, they can burst, which can be costly and inconvenient to repair. To help head off potential water freezes, you can take the following precautions, adapted from the American Red Cross: In addition to the above suggestions, you should consider winterizing water pipes by wrapping them in insulation (newspaper can also work in a fix) or self-regulating heat tape. These items are available at most home improvement stores. If you suspect your pipes are going to freeze, consider closing the inlet valve on your toilet and then flushing it to prevent damage. If the pipes freeze, open the faucets to allow for expansion of frozen water. If you are a renter, contact your landlord. Do not use a blowtorch or a kerosene or propane heater to unfreeze your pipes, due to risk of fire. If a pipe breaks, shut off the valve controlling the water to your home. If you don’t know where the shutoff valve is, contact your utility provider. In the event your home is damaged by the extreme cold, you might be eligible for financial relief through your homeowner’s policy. In power outages, heat systems that rely on electricity won’t operate, allowing bitterly cold temperatures to take hold inside the home. Here are some tips for staying warm, adapted from the New York City Emergency Management Department: In addition to the above suggestions, you should contact your utility provider to ensure they are aware of your power outage. In some instances, your provider may be able to provide an estimate of when power might be restored. In the event you have electricity but no heat, check your breaker switches. If you use propane or fuel oil, check the levels. If you can’t identify the problem, contact a repairman. Freezing weather has been blamed for at least 11 cold-related deaths this week.

    "title": "6 Ways Logan Paul Could Have Actually Raised Suicide Awareness",
    "text": "YouTube star Logan Paul shared a horrific video featuring an apparent suicide victim earlier this week, sparking a major dialogue about the proper way to bring awareness to mental health issues. The video, which racked up more than 1 million views before it was removed, featured Paul, a tour guide and several others as they walked through Aokigahara, a woodsy location in Japan that has been dubbed the “Japanese Suicide Forest.” The footage showed the group as they found a person who died of an apparent suicide, zooming in on the body. (The person’s face was edited to be blurred out.) Paul can also be heard laughing on the tape. People were outraged following the video, expressing their anger with Paul on Twitter over his callous attitude toward the victim and suicide. Paul has since apologized, saying that he “intended the video to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention.” Dear Internet, pic.twitter.com/42OCDBhiWg Paul’s video certainly missed the mark when it comes to productive, compassionate and responsible mental health awareness. Experts stress that videos like these do more of a disservice to the mental health community rather than help it. Research shows that showing videos or divulging methods of suicide may have a contagion effect, leading to copycat acts in vulnerable individuals, according to Dan Reidenberg, executive director of the Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (SAVE). Problematic content around mental health can also contribute to stigma, which can prevent people from seeking help, he added. “It can create trauma for many and that can have lasting effects on people,” he told HuffPost. If the goal truly is mental health awareness, there are other, more efficient methods anyone can do to help. Below are some expert-approved ways you can lend your voice or your time to the cause: Reidenberg recommends creating awareness through social media channels, which arguably have the widest reach. You can do this by openly discussing mental health, supporting others who do the same and sharing responsible, research-backed information about mental illness and treatment. This rule should also apply to journalists and entertainers, said Victor Schwartz, medical director of the Jed Foundation, and organization dedicated to preventing suicide in teenagers and young adults. “Media and artists sharing accurate information about mental health and suicide risk in ways that focus on availability and effectiveness of treatment are known to be helpful,” Schwartz said. Some communities have local mental health groups where you can donate your time, money or energy as a way to support people living with mental health issues, according to Reidenberg. Or, find a way to get involved on a larger scale through national organizations like SAVE, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Crisis Text Line, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the Jed Foundation. “Any person experiencing thoughts of suicide should take this seriously and seek professional support, as this is certainly a sign of significant distress and should not be ignored,” Schwartz said. If you think someone you know might be in crisis, it’s vital that you express it so they may get the help they need. And this doesn’t just apply to in-person conversations: Here’s what to do if you see someone you know post a status about harming themselves on social media. There’s power in what you say. Using mental health terminology in a casual or blithe manner ― like saying you’re “so bipolar” for wanting to switch up your hair color, or calling someone a “nut job” for acting a little strange ― can further contribute to stigma, according to both experts. You can be an advocate by eliminating these colloquial phrases out of your vocabulary. “There are some ways of showing or talking about these issues that might also feel disrespectful, mocking or that might add to prejudice,” Schwartz said. “Remember that we sometimes make fun of or mock things that make us anxious or uneasy.” The more informed the world is on suicide, the more likely people will start making a difference when it comes to curbing it. Suicide is the 10th-leading cause of death in the United States, and recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the rate of suicide increased by nearly 2 percent last year. In other words, the problem is only getting worse. “While we can’t prevent every suicide, suicide is the most preventable death that there is,” Reidenberg said. Bottom line: Professional support, whether that’s through therapy, medication or both, is the most effective way to manage a mental illness. Seeking help is hardly something to be shamed, Reidenberg said. “Mental health is just as important as physical health and the sooner we can get someone to treatment, the better and then the less likely they will die by suicide,” he explained. If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. You can also text HELLO to 741-741 for free, 24-hour support from the Crisis Text Line.

    "text": "Spotting a narcissist in the early stages of dating isn’t as easy as you’d think, which is why so many people end up in relationships with them. Narcissism exists on spectrum; it’s possible to have some characteristics of narcissism without having full-blown, clinically diagnosed narcissistic personality disorder. There are some telltale signs, though, says psychologist Craig Malkin, author of the book Rethinking Narcissism: The Bad — And Surprising Good — About Feeling Special. “Although there are many varieties of narcissism (outgoing and bombastic, shy and introverted, or proudly self-sacrificing), there are common traits,” Malkin said. “What they all have in common is a powerful aversion to sharing authentic emotional vulnerability.” What other traits do they have in common? Below, Malkin and other experts share six red flags. You have to hand it to your date: He or she picked the restaurant, effusively recommended things on the menu and knew exactly what bar you should head to after dinner. It might be nice to have someone plan everything out for you for a change, but narcissists call the shots for a very particular reason, Malkin said: Open-ended plans might end with them not getting their way ― something they don’t respond well to. “Instead of asking for what they want, narcissists often arrange events to make them happen,” he explained. “If your date insists on planning out the entire date, it could be a fun sweep-you-off-your feet experience, but it could also signal something far more ominous: someone who demands that everything always goes their way.” You’re still waiting for your appetizers, and your date has already expounded on all the weekend getaways you should plan and how well you click. Their clear interest in you may be alluring at first, but watch out: Love-bombing ― overblown demonstrations of attention and affection meant to win someone over ― is a marker of narcissism, said Virginia Gilbert, a Los Angeles-based marriage and family therapist. “The adoration is so intoxicating that you may ignore the fact that it’s way too soon to be planning a future together,” Gilbert said. “Reality check: Your date is using love-bombing to hook you so you’ll give him what he wants ― most likely physical intimacy, money, connections, or taking care of them.” Most narcissists brag, but those who rate high on the narcissism scale have figured out ways to do it covertly. That’s because they’re experts in impression management and have learned to keep their arrogance in check in the early stages, said Tina Swithin, a divorce coach and the author of Divorcing a Narcissist: Advice from the Battlefield. “A highly skilled narcissist may casually mention the high-end gym that they belong to or that they only fly first-class, but it is done with such subtle sophistication that their target may not even register it as a red flag,” she said. “The less-skilled narcissist will openly and obnoxiously discuss their Ivy League degree, or the square footage of their new apartment.” Pay attention to how your date treats your waiter: It could be an indication of how they’ll eventually treat you, said Darlene Lancer, a marriage and family therapist and the author of Codependency for Dummies and Dealing with a Narcissist. “How do they treat the waitress, the car hop, or staff at the ice cream shop? Rudeness and arrogance signal low self-esteem and narcissism,” Lancer said. “Their rudeness to the waiter and hostess could hint at pent-up rage and demanding and possibly emotionally abusive behavior.” If you’re on a date with a narcissist, they might tell you that they’re looking for a life partner, but can’t seem to find anyone who’s worth investing in, Lancer said. “Chances are, their relationships have frequently ended after intimacy developed,” she said. “They’re looking for perfection but usually find some flaw, and end the relationship so they can continue their search.” Unfortunately for you, the problem might lie with your date. “Pay attention to the negative facts people divulge about relationships,” Lancer said. “Ignore their vulnerability, bragging, and compliments.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Narcissists will grill you about getting passed up for a promotion at work or joke about where you went to college, but they’ll get unnerved if you put them in a similar hot seat, Malkin said. “The two of you will talk about your vulnerabilities or tough experiences you’ve had, but they’ll never once volunteer their own struggles,” he said. “You feel like you’re opening up, until you realize you’re the only one who’s laid your soul bare. It’s a great strategy for the narcissist to feel stronger in an inherently uncomfortable situation, but it spells huge trouble down the line. With a narcissist, it’s likely that you’ll always be in the hot seat.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "How To Stay Married When You're Cooped Up During A Storm From Hell",
    "text": "If you’re married and live on the East Coast, you may be questioning your wedding vows right about now. Sure, you’re in it “in sickness and in health” ― but what about through “bomb cyclones” from hell that slowly drive you both nuts? This excerpt from a New York Times story pretty much sums it up: Mrs. Ramos, who made her husband go out into the blizzard because he would drive her crazy at home totally made my day. https://t.co/PS25JrEsyr pic.twitter.com/Px7shEpiQH To help keep your sanity as a couple and not go stir-crazy during these trying times, we asked marriage therapists to share advice for snowed-in spouses. See what they had to say below: In an ideal world, you’d be at some new brunch place in the city, taking your first bite of fried chicken and sipping a Bloody Mary. But you aren’t living in an ideal world ― you’re living through a snowpocalypse, and you’re essentially under house arrest with the rest of your family. If you can’t agree on anything else, you can all probably agree that you’re hungry. To that end, warm up those frozen tamales from Christmas ― or use the leftover cheese from your New Year’s party for a makeshift charcuterie board. If you’re really feeling ambitious, score brownie points with your spouse by making breakfast in bed. “Hey, you may not be at a hotel, but you can still get the hotel experience in small ways when you’re experiencing this weather,” said Danielle Kepler, a marriage and family therapist. “Figure out what food you have in your fridge and eat it in bed, wearing robes and your pajamas as if you received room service.” This one might send a shiver up your spine ― and it’s already so cold ― but hear us out: It’s kind of fun to put away all your electronics and see if your family could survive, Little House on the Prairie-style. You might even end up engaging with each other. “Consider your snow day an old-fashioned day,” said therapist Amanda Stemen. “Light some candles, home cook a meal, play some records, and enjoy what may come. Focus on one another, rather than on work or other distractions. Plus, doing something different like this increases oxytocin so it feels like you’re beginning something new and exciting.” This is perfect Netflix and chill weather. Taking off the sweats you’ve been wearing for two days straight may seem frightful, but the payoff is so very delightful, said sex therapist Celeste Hirschman, who co-authored the book Making Love Real: The Intelligent Couple’s Guide to Lasting Intimacy and Passion. “You both might be very hesitant to get naked, but grab a blanket; there’s lot of sexy fun you can have while bundled up,” Hirschman said. “I suggest wrapping your partner up in that warm blanket and giving them some great oral sex down below.” Woah, this “bomb cyclone” just got a whole lot bomber. Sure, it’s not the most fun idea on this list, but face facts: Your home has been a total pigsty since the holidays, and now you’re stuck living in it. Get busy cleaning. The best part of tidying up? It could lead to some of that sexy time mentioned above. A 2015 study from the University of Alberta found that couples who divvied up chores had higher relationship satisfaction and more sex than couples who didn’t mutually contribute. Why not just lean into the awfulness of your current situation and really get some work done? It’s a supremely unsexy activity, but you’re frozen inside anyway, so set your cold hearts on getting some tax work done, advised couples therapist Aaron Anderson. “This is a good one, because you save yourself the stress and arguments that inevitably come when you’re trying to cram in April,” Anderson said. “Not everything couples do is romantic.” Anderson even provided a to-do list for snowed-in love birds: Dust off all those receipts and organize them, write down the value of donations you donated to the thrift store, and call your mortgage provider and get your latest statement. The opposite argument could be made for being super lazy: You’ve muddled through the holidays with your families, and now you’re dealing with this snowmaggedon nonsense. Give yourself a break. “The kids are probably in their rooms binge watching who-knows-what, so go ahead and enjoy the silence together,” Anderson said. “Sit down, cuddle and just talk. You probably do this at night when the kids are asleep, but couples’ nighttime conversations are different than their daytime conversations.” The other benefit of having quality adult conversation, according to Anderson? “Your kids will get to see you two communicating, which will set them up for their own relationship successes later down the road,” he said.

    "title": "How To Wean A Child Off A Security Blanket, Stuffed Animal, Or Pacifier",
    "text": "In medical parlance, the soft stuff that kids seek for calm — the binkies, blankets and stuffies that serve as dopamine dealers for snuggling toddlers — are known as “transitional objects.” They’re transitional in that they provide a bridge between a period of constant comforting attachment to mom and dad and a growing independence in the world. They are a means by which a kid can teaches himself or herself self-regulation, but, as healthy as that sounds, a transitional object can become problematic in a child’s life. Transitional objects cease to be helpful when they foster dependence. “It depends on how dependent on it they are to function,” explains pediatrician Dr. Jack Maypole, associate professor of Pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine. “How demanding are they that it’s with them for much of their day? And if it’s not, does the world have to stop to find the lost whatever?” If the behavior associated with the object has become a pain point, it might be time to wean the kid off the object of their desire. Of course, Maypole notes that this should not be the case for children who have special needs. Children who are not neurotypical may require unique considerations. But for most neurotypical kids there are tactics to diminish the use of transitional objects, though it should be considered a team effort. “If it starts to become an insurmountable obstacle to the well-being of the child there may be a need to strategize with partnering folks at childcare, babysitters or family members,” Maypole says. Because it turns out that consistency is key. There’s simply no use in having inconsistent guidelines. And first and foremost among those guidelines should be to not shame the kid for their behavior. “That’s the worst thing you can do,” says Maypole. Though he does acknowledge that the frustration around transitional object behavior can be very real. “You’re beating them up over something they can’t do anything about. It’s just not constructive.” How to wean kids away from blankies, binkies and stuffies: Weaning away from a transitional object also requires an appropriate time. A sick kid or a child who has a parent out of town, for instance, isn’t going to respond well to any tactics. It’s best to wait for a time when everyone is healthy, the schedule is stable and there’s no expectation of stress or disruption. Interestingly, the guidelines around weaning a kid from a transitional object are pretty consistent regardless of what the object is. The idea is to make the object less available, but not totally unavailable. The important part is that the object is available during the times when it is most necessary. “You also can praise them if they give it back,” Maypole encourages. “Give them a fist bump or high-five. Reinforce the behavior that giving it back is a great thing. Rewards always get you farther.” Maypole also suggests creating a plan, complete with goals that allow a kid to level-up, as if they were playing a video game. It can be a matter of building a calendar where every week the goal is to spend more time away from the object. This can be paired with simple rewards, like stickers or crackers, to encourage moving to the next level. It’s important to note that some kids hold onto transitional object even up until 4-years-old. It’s totally fine to allow them to come to the conclusion it’s time to move on on their own terms. “They tend to give it up through a combination of peer-pressure and self-consciousness, or frank rules related to school.” But most importantly, Maypole stresses the key is to “Know your kid, what plays to their strength and how best they are motivated.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "I Was Ghosted By My Best Friend",
    "text": "When it comes to ending relationships these days, there seems to be only one way to do it. And that’s not to do it at all, and just disappear into the ether — or, to give it its technical term, to ghost. Ghosting is everywhere; a study found that 80 percent of millennials have been ghosted at least once. The other 20 percent have presumably only managed to avoid it because they’ve been the ones to run off first. I am very firmly in the 80 percent. Back in my dating days, people ghosted on me so many times that I once made a boyfriend promise that he wouldn’t do it, too. So, he dumped me in a text message instead, which, while being a welcome change, wasn’t much better. Among these disappearing acts, what I never expected was that my best friend would vanish. So, when after almost a decade of friendship, she just stopped replying, it hurt more than any breakup ever did. I first met Rachel* during freshman week when we moved into the same corridor in college. We bonded over a love of George Foreman grills and a hatred of Virginia Woolf. We went to the bar so often that the staff saved us a table every night. I’d crawl into her bed hungover after a night out, and when we graduated and moved to opposite ends of the country, we’d speak on the phone for two or three hours at a time. Around three years ago, a decade after we first met, she just stopped replying. There was no big fight, no real warning, no anything – she just disappeared. Texts, phone calls, emails; nothing got a response. She had drifted from the rest of our college friends after she moved up north, but I got in touch with her new friends there to check that she was okay. They told me she was fine, just busy. I heard nothing at all for almost a year. I had absolutely no idea what to do with myself. Rachel was the one who’d seen me through the countless disappearing dates, and now she was the one who’d disappeared. I wanted to sit around in my pajamas and wail down the phone to someone, but I had no idea who that someone should be. I was hurt and totally stumped. When you break up with a friend, you go through all the same stages as you do with a boyfriend. The disbelief, the wondering what you did wrong, the endless guilt and feeling that you’ve somehow wronged them in a terrible way. You wonder if you’ll manage to keep your other friends and worry that if you turn to them for comfort they’ll feel like you’re asking them to choose sides and will wander off too. Society doesn’t afford a friend breakup the same emotional clout that it does a romantic one. So, somehow, you just have to find a way to move on. Which isn’t always easy. Kate’s* best friend disappeared on her nearly ten years ago, and she hasn’t heard from her since. “I don’t think I’m fully over it, even now,” Kate says. “I suddenly realized that it was always me getting in contact with her, so I decided to see how long it took her to contact me. A whole year went by, and I didn’t hear a thing. I was very ill at the time, so sent her an email to explain, but I never got a reply to that or any other messages. “I felt really angry at first, like I’d been abandoned by someone I thought I could rely on. Over time that anger has mostly gone, but it’s still sad and confusing.” Unlike Kate, I did eventually hear from my vanishing friend. She sent me a card when I got engaged apologizing for disappearing, but I was too hurt to go back to how we’d been. We now have the same relationship I have with my exes: the odd like on Facebook, and that’s it. “When you break up with a friend, you go through all the same stages as you do with a boyfriend.” It’s inevitable that over the years, some friendships are going to come to an end. The person you loved when you were 18 and hugging a bottle of vodka may not be the same person you want in your life when you’re nearly 30. But being ghosted by a friend is a particularly brutal experience. I was lucky; in what was a complete reversal of my early twenties, I had a supportive boyfriend who I could turn to about my ghosting friend. He understood that we should take friend breakups more seriously. They may not have a whole industry of bad TV and movies that you can watch and empathize with while demolishing a block of cheese, but that doesn’t mean they’re not tough. We all know to be kind to the person whose boyfriend has ghosted them. It’s about time we started doing it for people whose friends have wandered off, as well. *Some names have been changed.

    "title": "Eastern U.S. Slicked In Ice As 'Bomb Cyclone' Rages Up The Coast",
    "text": "A deadly cold spell has gripped much of the Eastern United States in the wake of a stormy “bomb cyclone” lashing the Atlantic Coast with snow and high winds as it charges north. Meteorologists warn that parts of the country could be dangerously sheeted in ice as the fierce cold continues through the weekend. The weather system, “one of the most intense western Atlantic winter storms in decades,” will plow into eastern Canada on Friday, according to The Weather Channel. At least 17 people have died as a result of the cold in recent days. The storm has wreaked havoc in parts of New England and beyond, with blizzard conditions and freezing temperatures causing widespread power outages, school closures and flight cancelations. It dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of New Jersey and New York, and caused flooding in the Boston area and in parts of Maine. Snowfall reached as far south as Tallahassee, Florida, for the first time since 1989. The National Weather Service on Thursday cautioned Boston residents against “going out and floating on icebergs” drifting through streets swollen with slush and floodwaters. Here’s @kathrynburcham showing why she’s the best in one the business, floating on an ice berg to provide updates .. @boston25 pic.twitter.com/iPJf9EUiv4 The cold’s toll includes animals. Dead sharks have been washing up on beaches in Massachusetts. Some have frozen, while others have been trapped in shallow waters in Cape Cod Bay, according to the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy. Dogs and other pets left outdoors have also fallen victim to the frigid temperatures. Niagara Falls was transformed into a scene out of Narnia, with chunks of ice crystallizing and creating a stunning spectacle. The snowstorm has been widely referred to as a “bomb cyclone,” a meteorological term describing a powerful cyclone that gets energy from rapidly dropping pressure caused by colliding hot and cold temperatures. The storm on Friday was subsiding in most of the East. But the “arctic outbreak” will continue, the National Weather Service warned. “A surge of arctic air will spread over the region in the wake of the storm, producing well below normal temperatures and dangerously low wind chills through the coming weekend,” the weather service added. ❄️High winds from the winter storm bearing down on the East Coast push large chunks of ice into a dock on North Carolina's Outer Banks Wonder if @algore is liking the cold weather that 48 States are experiencing brrrr ❄️pic.twitter.com/PMDEzDO102 New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Friday encouraged people to “stay warm, keep an eye out for neighbors, and bring pets inside.” The wind chill will make it feel as cold as 20 degrees below zero this weekend, he added.

    "title": "Iceland Makes It Illegal For Companies To Pay Men More Than Women",
    "text": "Ladies of Iceland, rejoice: The country implemented a new law Monday that will make it illegal for male employees to be paid more than women doing the same job. As of Jan. 1, the legislation said that any company or government agency with 25 or more staff members will “have to obtain government certification of their equal-pay policies,” according to Al Jazeera. Companies failing to comply with this law will face fines. A board member of the Icelandic Women’s Rights Association, Dagny Osk Aradottir Pind, told Al Jazeera that the legislation is a mechanism to “ensure women and men are being paid equally.” She added that Iceland has had legislation in place saying men and women should be paid equally “for decades,” but a gender pay gap has persisted. “The legislation is basically a mechanism that companies and organizations ... evaluate every job that’s being done, and then they get a certification after they confirm the process if they are paying men and women equally,” she said. Iceland is the first country to execute such legislation. The country first announced the measure in March 2017 on International Women’s Day. Currently, Iceland’s Parliament consists of nearly 50 percent female members. The World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked the nation as the world’s most gender-equal country for the last nine years, acting as “a leader on female political empowerment and a strong performer on wage equality.” The United States comes in at No. 49. The WEF noted in its report that despite Iceland’s achievements toward equal pay, “its gender gap in the areas of economic participation and opportunity and educational attainment” have still widened over the years, following a global trend. The organization estimates that it will be a century before the overall gender gap worldwide is closed. The Icelandic government has said it is committed to closing the gender pay gap by 2022. “I think that now people are starting to realise that this is a systematic problem that we have to tackle with new methods,” Aradottir Pind told Al Jazeera. “I really feel that we have managed to raise awareness, and we have managed to get to the point that people realize that the legislation we have had in place is not working, and we need to do something more,” she added.

    "title": "If You’re A Working Mom, Here’s What You Accomplished Last Year",
    "text": "Happy New Year! Typically, the past week or so has been spent reviewing the last 12 months, making resolutions, and posting about the former and latter on social media. Even for people like me who are pretty anti-new years resolutions, there’s something about the new year and all the “2017 in review” type posts that make this a natural time for some personal reflection. I put this off for a bit, because honestly, I was struggling to be happy with what I was looking back on. So here I am today, staring 2018 in the face, and I’m deciding to break it down: What did I accomplish in 2017? In my current semi-sleep deprived state, only worsened by the New Year’s Eve festivities, this question is a bit harder to answer than it has been some other years. My one-year-old (or is it 14 months old, when can I stop counting months??) is running around the living room, pointing at our kitty cat and yelling in her own language. I’m waiting for the caffeine to kick in and stretching out the kinks in my back from snuggling her in bed all night. This was a challenging year. The electoral college put an unimaginable man in the White House. Hatred and divisiveness came out from their formerly hidden corners and were translated into death threats, violence, and a terrifying new reality. I cried over shootings, I cried over families being torn apart, I cried over injustices I was seeing all over the world. All of these incredibly large and tragic problems made my own issues seem insignificant, but somehow I still managed to cry over those too. I was insulted, judged, hurt, and taken for granted, partially because I’m a mom, partially because I’m a woman, and partially because I’m a human, and we clearly have this terrible tendency to treat each other very poorly at times. One shoe off, a bit blurry, not really looking at the camera, but still wonderful in its own way. And displaying sideways for who knows what reason. This sums up 2017 pretty well. But negativity is draining, and there’s enough of it on my social feeds as everyone looks back at 2017, so I forced myself to make a list of what I actually accomplished in 2017. I’m sharing it in hopes that this can perhaps bring some encouragement to others, especially working moms with young children (or single child in my case), who may have had some similar feelings as they looked back on 2017. So here we are, in no particular order, 2017 Accomplishments of Working Mom: Pediatric Bodyguard - Ensured a minimum of boo boos and stranger danger Speech Therapist - Encouraged development of child’s language skills, working from nonsense gurgles to eventual communication that people other than you could understand Mobility Coach - Assisted physical development, from head lifting to walking, running, pointing, and grabbing Sleep Specialist - Figured out how to get child to sleep through the night, or at least in cycles of sleep patched together with interruptions to make some semblance of sleep, plus the appropriate amount of nap time sleeping, while also ensuring that you got enough shut-eye to function at home, at work, and socially Scheduler/Strategist/Logistics Coordinator - Fit in a 40+ hour work week, exercise, play time, meal time, bath time, adult time, grocery time, doctor time, story time, volunteer time, professional development time, nap time, babysitter time, family time, bedtime (child’s), bedtime (yours), plus other appointments as needed Chef/Baker/Milk Producer - Prepped and/or coordinated and consumed healthy meals for yourself and other family members. Sometimes this included producing milk in your own freaking body and then functioning as a cow for child Negotiator/Mind Manipulator - Perfected techniques for high-stakes situations such as leaving playground without a complete meltdown, or securing ownership and use of your own cell phone, or keeping child distracted and happy during a long car ride, or quiet during an important phone call Maid - Self explanatory. Included exponentially more laundry than you ever thought possible and dried banana smooshes in very strange places Work - Whatever your job is, you got it done, plus some, because you were determined to set a great example for your child and had to fight the working mom stereotypes every day. Plus, you know, bring that bacon home to pay for things like tiny shoes which were outgrown before you could instagram them properly even though they are the cutest thing you’d ever seen. And health insurance. ($$$$$$ but that’s another, more frustrated and angry blog topic) Entertainment Curator - Netflix shows don’t play themselves. This is a real job Grocery Store Wine Specialist - Self explanatory Accountant - Figured out how to pay for all of the above Researcher - Determined the best approach for all of the above. Googled and message boarded at your own risk. And of course, all other tasks as assigned/needed - On call for anything and everything. So yea, if you did all that in 2017, give yourself a round of applause while I’m over here attempting to pat myself on the back. Working moms are some of the hardest workers on the planet (research supports this, I promise), even if it can sometimes be hard to pick out what exactly you accomplished in the last 12 months in this sometimes blurry adventure we call life. Here’s to stepping into 2018 with confidence and positivity! We got this!

    "title": "Trump ICE Chief Wants To Prosecute Politicians Who Won't Lock Up More Immigrants",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― The Trump administration is considering prosecuting state and local officials for not fully cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency’s acting director said Tuesday in an escalation of his threats against so-called “sanctuary cities” and the undocumented immigrants who live in them. The Justice Department did not rule out acting on Thomas Homan’s suggestion. An official told HuffPost on Wednesday that the department is working with ICE “to explore any and all potential options” for reining in jurisdictions that limit their assistance with federal deportation efforts. But Homan’s plan is likely unconstitutional, legal experts say. And the acting director’s argument that sanctuary cities are protecting hordes of dangerous criminals isn’t backed up by his agency’s own data. Recent reports from the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, show the Trump administration itself is increasingly cracking down on petty offenders, not violent felons. Homan, who is also President Donald Trump’s nominee to permanently lead ICE, laid out his threats during a Fox News interview on Tuesday. He said that ICE would dramatically increase its own enforcement efforts in California in response to the state’s new law limiting police cooperation with immigration officers and that the federal government should consider lawsuits and funding cutbacks against jurisdictions that pursue sanctuary policies. Public officials should be held “personally accountable” and criminally prosecuted under a law against harboring unauthorized immigrants, he said. ICE did not respond to a request for more information on who Homan thinks should be prosecuted. “We’ve got to take these sanctuary cities on, we’ve got to take them to court and we’ve got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes,” Homan told Fox News. “California better hold on tight,” he said in the same interview, vowing to send more ICE officers to the state. The big problem with Homan’s lawsuit plan is that there are no grounds for criminal prosecution of public officials in these situations, according to several legal experts. Laws merely limiting cooperation with ICE don’t amount to illegal harboring of undocumented immigrants, said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF, a Latino civil rights organization that fought anti-sanctuary city legislation in Texas. Besides, criminal prosecution requires personal involvement in wrongdoing, he added. The way to hold public officials personally accountable in a democracy is by regularly scheduled elections or recall votes, both of which are options in California, Saenz argued. Criminal prosecution of local officials who don’t, say, hold undocumented immigrants until federal authorities arrive would also run right into the 10th Amendment, which prevents the federal government from forcing state and local authorities to use their resources to enforce federal law ― something that has been used to block past Trump efforts against sanctuary policies. ″No matter how much the federal government may not like that, unless they’re to seek a repeal of the 10th Amendment, Homan should shut up and get out of town because he has no legitimacy in the position he currently occupies, having engaged in threats that are more akin to a totalitarian thug than to our government,” Saenz said. Using the threat of prosecution or an actual prosecution to retaliate against officials who have spoken out against the Trump administration would also be a “very serious infringement” of those officials’ First Amendment rights, said Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Wang called Homan’s comments an “extension of the tactics of the Trump administration ... who have tried to smear immigrants as criminals.” “State and local officials who have for various policy reasons decided not to participate in the Trump administration’s deportation tactics are also now being smeared by the Trump administration as criminals,” she said. “It’s really a gross abuse of the federal government’s power.” As for Homan’s insistence on Tuesday that “more citizens are going to die” if places like California adopt sanctuary policies, he was echoing comments that Trump has made ever since the 2016 campaign. But there isn’t much data available to support that assertion. The violent crime rate in California plummeted from 1,045 per 100,000 in 1990 to less than half of that by 2014, according to the FBI’s most recent Uniform Crime Report ― that’s during a period in which the state’s undocumented population grew two-thirds larger. Recent Homeland Security reports indicate that the Trump administration is spending more resources on processing higher numbers of petty cases against undocumented immigrants, while casting aside Obama-era guidelines that focused on the much smaller number of individuals who were potential public security threats or had been deported before. Some 17 percent of people deported after being arrested by ICE last fiscal year in the interior of the country ― in other words, not those caught at the border ― had no criminal convictions. (The fiscal year ran from Oct. 1, 2016, to Sept. 30, 2017.) That’s a sharp increase over the 8 percent figure registered in the previous fiscal year. Of those who did have convictions, driving under the influence, “dangerous drugs,” immigration violations and traffic violations were the most common. A week after taking office, Trump ordered the departments of Justice and Homeland Security to compile quarterly reports showing how many immigrants were locked up on federal criminal charges. The latest report, released last month, said 94 percent of the 37,557 confirmed immigrants in federal criminal custody were undocumented. But most of the undocumented immigrants held in federal prisons and pretrial detention are facing prosecution for crossing the border illegally rather than any violent crime, according to data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Two-thirds of the non-citizens in federal custody in 2015 were imprisoned on an immigration charge, the commission’s report says. Immigration offenses accounted for nearly one-third of federal prosecutions, with about 20,711 cases. Even those lopsided numbers don’t capture the full picture. The Sentencing Commission’s numbers only include cases processed through the U.S. district courts proper. But most criminal immigration cases are handled by U.S. magistrate judges, who can adjudicate misdemeanor matters. It’s hard to be 100 percent sure without specific data, but it is overwhelmingly likely that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants locked up on federal criminal charges are prosecuted for immigration violations, said Cesar Cuatémoc García Hernández, a law professor at the University of Denver. “It flies in the face of logic that simply being in the United States without the federal government’s permission is inherently endangering anyone,” García told HuffPost. “Not every crime is the same, just as jaywalking is not the same as murder. Just because someone is convicted of a federal crime does not mean that they are a danger to the public.” Finally, although Homan and other Trump administration officials often describe sanctuary policies as if they fully cut off local law enforcement’s cooperation with ICE, most such jurisdictions in reality continue to share certain information with the agency and even hold individuals in particular situations, such as when the federal government provides a warrant or the person has been convicted of more serious crimes. California’s new law, for example, allows more extensive cooperation with ICE in cases involving about 800 criminal offenses.

What the policies do is restrict local authorities’ participation in enforcing immigration law against people charged with lesser crimes or not charged at all. Supporters argue that this allows police to work better with immigrant communities. They also point to legal and financial concerns: It costs money to hold people on ICE’s behest, and if local officials do so without a warrant, they can be and have been sued. By threatening to prosecute local officials, the Trump administration is essentially trying to force them to abandon their own judgment about what is best for their communities, García said. “Once you start threatening elected officials with jail because of the positions they take as public officials, you’re engaging in fear-mongering,” García argued. “You’re trying to scare them away from taking public positions they feel they ought to take. ... It’s beyond the pale for a high-ranking official of the executive branch of the U.S. government to believe it’s appropriate to prosecute a political opponent.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "text": "Burger chain In-N-Out wants its customers’ buns to be warm, apparently. The Southern California-born fast-food company is now selling hot cocoa ― its first new menu item in 15 years, according to reports. As of Monday, all of its outlets were selling eight-ounce servings of hot chocolate, with the price $1.60 in some locations, CBS in Los Angeles reports in the segment above. The expansion began several weeks ago. The drink sticks to the fast-food joint’s California roots, using cocoa powder from Ghirardelli Chocolate Co. The mix is made with water, and can be topped with freeze-dried marshmallows. The last time In-N-Out altered its menu was to add lemonade back in the early 2000s, reports say. Technically, though, the cocoa addition isn’t brand-new. “This is actually the return of hot cocoa,” In-N-Out President Lynsi Snyder said in a statement. “My grandparents, Harry and Esther Snyder, served it for many years beginning in the ’50s. I’m not sure how it fell off the menu but it’s part of our culture and something special for kids, and I’m happy that we’re bringing it back.” A rep told the San Francisco Chronicle the drink will be a permanent item, although it did not appear on In-N-Out’s online menu as of early Thursday. In-N-Out has more than 300 outlets in the Western and Southwestern U.S. And get this: Eater San Francisco reports that kids under 12 will get a free serving when it rains. It wasn’t clear how many locations make that offer. The menu newcomer caused quite a stir on the Internet, of course. I just found out that IN-N-OUT has HOT COCOA and I am way more excited than any adult has a right to be about hot cocoa Anyone try that brand new #InNOut HOT COCOA yet? It's #Ghirardelli and has MARSHMALLOWS so it has to be worth the hype...right? pic.twitter.com/HVPMRaNjso IN N OUT HAS HOT CHOCOLATE I REPEAT IN N OUT HAS HOT CHOCOLATE Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Thousands Of Iranians Take Part In State-Sponsored Pro-Government Rallies",
    "text": "LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Thousands of Iranians took part in pro-government rallies in several cities on Wednesday in a state-sponsored show of force after six days of street unrest that has shaken the clerical leadership and left 21 people dead. State television broadcast live pictures of rallies in the southwestern cities of Kermanshah and Ilam and in the northern city of Gorgan, where marchers waved Iranian flags and pictures of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In the Shi’ite holy city of Qom, demonstrators chanted “death to American mercenaries.” There were also rallies in Isfahan, Iran’s third largest city, and Abadan and Khorramshahr in the oil-rich southwest, state TV footage showed. Marchers voiced support for Khamenei, chanting, “The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader,” and, “We will not leave our leader alone.” They accused the United States, Israel and Britain of inciting the unrest and shouted, “The seditionist rioters should be executed!” The anti-government protests, which erupted last week out of frustration over economic hardship among the youth and working class, have grown into the boldest challenge to the Islamic Republic’s established order in almost a decade. The demonstrations, organized on social media, have largely been held after dusk. They continued into Tuesday night with video footage posted on social media showing demonstrators on the streets and riot police deployed in several cities including Ahvaz in the southwest. Hours earlier, Khamenei had accused Iran’s foes of fomenting the protests, some of which have criticized him by name and called for him to step down. The outburst of dissent is the most serious since 2009, when Iranians took to the streets over accusations of vote-rigging in the re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Hundreds have been arrested across the sprawling country and a judicial official warned some could face the death penalty. The demonstrations have put pressure on President Hassan Rouhani, who championed a deal struck with world powers in 2015 to curb Iran’s disputed nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions against Tehran. Many of those protesting are frustrated at what they see as the failure so far of his government to deliver on promises of more jobs and investment as a payoff from the nuclear accord. Rouhani, who has said the demonstrators have a right to protest, told Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in a phone call on Wednesday that he hoped the unrest would end in a few days. “We are certain about Iran’s security and stability ... People are free in Iran to protest within the framework of law,” Rouhani was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA. TOUGH CHOICE ON SANCTIONS U.S. President Donald Trump has asserted in tweets that Iranians have lost patience with alleged corruption and what he called a terrorist regime. The six days of demonstrations in a string of Iranian cities began over economic conditions, and Trump must decide by mid-January whether to continue waiving U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports under the terms of the nuclear deal that he opposed. If he reimposes sanctions on oil, it could increase the economic pain for Iran’s leaders - but also send the wrong message about U.S. support for Iran’s people, analysts say. Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, commander of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards, said on Wednesday, “If the Americans’ sympathy with Iranians were real, they would have not imposed cruel sanctions on the our nation.” Referring to Rouhani’s policy of detente with the West, Jafari told Fars news agency that “friendship with the United States” would never bring prosperity and that the Guards were ready to help the government overcome economic challenges. ROUHANI UNDER PRESSURE Resentment over economic stagnation and alleged graft within the clerical and security hierarchies sparked the protests after Iranians took to social media to vent their outrage. Anger has been building up since last month. Thousands of Iranians joined a hashtag campaign on Twitter and other sites to express frustration over the slow pace of reforms. Under the ”#I am regretful” hashtag, they expressed disappointment with Rouhani, who was elected on promises of tackling high unemployment and granting more social freedoms. They focused on Rouhani’s latest budget bill. It has allocated, as usual, billions of dollars to religious universities and institutions while the government said it did not have enough cash to help the unemployed, including 28.8 percent of youth who are jobless. Both the arch-conservative Khamenei and the pragmatist Rouhani have pledged to curb corruption and create economic prosperity for all Iranians. But there have been few changes. The elite Revolutionary Guards, for example, still control a vast economic empire. While more than 20 million out of 80 million Iranians live below the poverty line, the wealthy, including relatives of government officials, import tens of thousands of luxury cars every year, causing widespread resentment. While young, impoverished Iranians have dominated the current protests across the Islamic Republic, some members of the urban middle class are also taking part.

    "title": "No, The Protests In Iran Are Not Another Green Movement",
    "text": "Thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets over the past week in massive, widespread demonstrations against Tehran’s political elite. The rare protests are reminiscent of the country’s last major uprising in 2009, but almost a decade apart, the movements are vastly different in scale and direction. Millions of people descended upon Iran’s capital in June 2009 after hardliner President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad secured a second term in an election marred by damning claims of vote-rigging. The explosive uprising, led in part by defeated candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi, was the largest since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. State forces cracked down violently, opening fire on protesters who chanted “Where is my vote?” and making scores of sweeping arrests. The current anti-government clashes erupted in the city of Mashhad and have now spread across the country and stretched into a second week. Incensed Iranians are expressing their frustrations with socioeconomic issues including rising inflation and unemployment, and allegations of widespread corruption. President Donald Trump has tweeted his support for the demonstrations “against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime.” His administration also criticized former President Barack Obama’s “shameful” inaction during the 2009 unrest (while simultaneously banning Iranians from entering the U.S.). As with the Green Movement, the Iranian government is retaliating with mass arrests and restrictions on dissent. Both demonstrations created enormous challenges for Tehran, but unlike the 2009 revolt, experts say, today’s protests are an extension of Iran’s civil rights movement fueled by longstanding grievances, rather than a coordinated revolution. Several factors highlight the key differences. Green Movement protesters were mainly middle-class professionals rallying alongside Mousavi’s reformist supporters. But now, the unfolding protests are largely being driven by lower- and middle-class Iranians who are disappointed by the limited economic improvement the nation experienced as a result of its historic 2015 nuclear agreement, among other grievances. After decades of diplomatic friction between Tehran and the West, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from stifling economic sanctions. President Hassan Rouhani, a key architect of the deal who was re-elected in May, promised it would revive the economy and create millions of jobs. The vast majority of people who have been arrested in the past few days are under 25 years old, Iranian authorities claim. Organizers of the Green Movement have been “completely taken by surprise” by the present demonstrations, according to Trita Parsi, founder and president of the National Iranian American Council. “They’re on the sidelines. They had no idea this was coming. They were not part of this. And to a certain extent, they’ve even kept a calculated distance from these protests because they’re not entirely clear of what the direction is going,” he told NPR on Wednesday. Today’s protesters are “much poorer, much less hopeful, and ― in a way that one person described it to me ― they feel they have absolutely nothing to lose,” he added. “That’s why you have these calls for the complete overthrow of the government. That’s very different from the Green Movement.” The number of protesters is also drastically different; there were millions in 2009, compared with thousands over the past week. Without a clear leader, the current demonstrations likely lack the coordination needed to begin a revolution, according to NIAC research director Reza Marashi. “In 2009, mass discontent and leadership emerged, but state monopoly on violence played a key role in preventing the other pillars from taking root in a sustainable fashion ― by way of cracking down on protesters, and imprisoning opposition leaders,” he wrote in a HuffPost blog post earlier this week. “As things stand in Iran today, mass discontent remains clear, but protesters have been less coordinated. They currently lack a discernible organizational network. No shared ideology has emerged beyond general disdain for the government. And the protests have thus far been devoid of any leadership.” The government has temporarily restricted access to certain social media channels, including Instagram and Telegram, a messaging app. Unlike in 2009, social media platforms and smartphones have reportedly been critical tools to organize protests, in the absence of actual leaders. By contrast, the protest leaders in 2009 “played a really important role,” according to Iran expert Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution. “They effectively legitimized the protests as something that was politically sanctioned. We haven’t seen an episode like that, where someone who’s part of the system called upon their followers to go to the streets.” Whereas the Green Movement was mainly concentrated in Tehran, the recent protests have rapidly spread in smaller numbers to scores of cities and towns nationwide, in some ways making it more difficult for state forces to suppress them. Iran’s supreme leader, ultra-conservative cleric Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blamed the chaos on Iran’s foreign rivals. “In recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic,” Khamenei, the country’s highest-ranking authority, said in a statement on Tuesday. Rouhani, in a pre-recorded speech broadcast on state media Sunday, urged restraint on all sides: “We are a free nation. And according to the constitution and citizen rights, the people are free to express their criticism and even their protests.” He also cautioned that “criticism should not be accompanied with violence or vandalizing public property.” The protests’ rapid escalation is of particular concern, according to Maloney. “This began in Mashhad as opposed to Tehran, and really percolated at least in the first 24 to 36 hours outside the capital. That’s a very important distinction in that Tehran has always been the center of political gravity for the Islamic Republic and contemporary Iran,” she said. “That quick escalation is a real point of concern for the regime, because it suggests that this is no longer about one individual or faction versus another, this is very much about a sense of alienation at a basic level.” Where the protests are headed or what the outcome will be remains unclear, Maloney added, but there is a feeling of “simmering rage” that can’t be resolved by quick fixes or short-term changes. “I think this represents one of the most serious challenges to the Islamic Republic since its inception,” she said, “precisely because of the passion of those on the streets and the extent to which they appear to be ready to effectively jettison the entirety of the system rather than focus their ire on one particular individual or policy.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Over 450 Protesters Arrested In Tehran During Crackdown On Anti-Government Demonstrations",
    "text": "By Bozorgmehr Sharafedin LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s Supreme Leader on Tuesday accused enemies of the Islamic Republic of stirring unrest across the country as the death toll from anti-government demonstrations that began last week rose to 21. Nine Iranians were killed in Isfahan province during protests on Monday night, including two members of the security forces, state television said. Six protesters were killed during an attack on a police station in the town of Qahderijan. The governor of Falavarjan County said the protesters were armed. The deputy provincial governor of Tehran said police have arrested more than 450 protesters in the capital over the past three days as security forces struggle to contain the boldest challenge to Iran’s clerical leadership since unrest in 2009. In his first reaction to the unrest, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: “In recent days, enemies ofIran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic.” Khamenei said on his website that he would address the nation about the recent events “when the time is right”. He did not mention any enemies by name but Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, said the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia were behind the recent riots in Iran. “Saudis will receive Iran’s unexpected response and they know how serious it can be,” Shamkhani was quoted as saying by Tasnim news in an interview with Beirut-based Al Mayadeen TV. Musa Ghazanfarabadi, head of Tehran’s Revolutionary Court, warned protesters on Tuesday that those arrested would face harsh punishment. Ghazanfarabadi said the detainees will be soon put on trial and the ringleaders would face serious charges including “moharebeh” ― an Islamic term meaning warring against God ― which carries the death penalty. The semi-official ILNA news agency quoted Ali Asghar Naserbakht, the deputy governor of Tehran province, as saying that 200 people were arrested on Saturday in Tehran, 150 people on Sunday and about 100 people on Monday. Hundreds of others have been arrested in other cities, according to agency reports and social media. Naserbakht said the situation in Tehran was under control and police has not asked for the help of the Revolutionary Guards special forces. Deputy Interior Minister Hossein Zolfaghari said 90 percent of the detainees were under 25-years-old, showing frustration among youths from the economic situation and lack of social freedoms. A judiciary official was quoted as saying by ISNA that 20 ringleaders of protests in Karaj, the fourth largest city in Iran, have been arrested. Iran’s judiciary chief Sadeq Larijani ordered prosecutors on Monday to “punish rioters firmly”. The demonstrations which broke out last week were initially focused on economic hardships and alleged corruption but turned into political rallies. Anger was soon directed at the clerical leadership that has been in power since the 1979 revolution, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the ultimate authority in Iran’s system of dual clerical and republican rule. Iran is a major OPEC oil producer and regional power deeply involved in Syria and Iraq as part of a battle for influence with rival Saudi Arabia. Many Iranians resent the foreign interventions and want their leaders to create jobs at home, where youth unemployment reached 29 percent last year. Government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a news conference that both protesters and the security forces should follow the law. “People have the rights to protest but there is a difference between demonstration and riot...Even those who are confronting the rioters should act within the framework of law,” he said. State television reported that protesters who set ablaze four mosques in villages in Savadkuh County in northern Iran on Monday have been arrested. Rouhani refrained on Monday from accepting responsibility of problems raised by protesters and he blamed his predecessor and also Iran’s long-time adversary, the United States for the government’s shortcomings. Rouhani, seen as a pragmatist who is at odds with hardliners, said: “People on the streets do not ask for bread and water, but for more freedom,” ― implying that the protesters were not targeting his government but the more rigid establishment. U.S. President Donald Trump supported the protesters in a tweet on Tuesday: “The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime... The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said on Tuesday “Instead of wasting his time by publishing offensive tweets to other nations, Trump should focus on internal affairs of America.” Turkey said on Tuesday it was concerned by reports of people dying and public buildings being damaged in Iran. “We believe it is necessary to avoid violence and not succumb to provocations,” the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding that it hoped foreign intervention would be avoided. The Russian Foreign Ministry was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying external interference was destabilizing the situation and calling it “unacceptable”. Iran and Russia are the main allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while the United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey support rebel groups.

    "title": "What's Behind Iran's Massive Anti-Government Protests",
    "text": "The largest protests to hit Iran in almost a decade have swept across the country in recent days, sparking violent retaliation from government forces. U.S. President Donald Trump’s provocative tweets have further inflamed hostilities as Tehran’s crackdown intensifies. With a rising death toll and growing international attention, the anti-government demonstrations present an unpredictable challenge for Iranian authorities, who swiftly blamed the nation’s “enemies.” As the clashes threaten to drag into a second week, here’s an outline of what’s happening, and why. Protests erupted in Mashhad, Iran’s second-largest city, on Thursday. Hordes of Iranians took to the streets, angrily decrying dismal economic conditions, rising inflation and unemployment, and allegations of widespread corruption. Protesters are disappointed by the limited economic improvement the nation experienced as a result of Iran’s historic 2015 nuclear agreement with six other countries. After decades of diplomatic friction between Tehran and the West, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for relief from stifling economic sanctions. President Hassan Rouhani, a key architect of the deal who was re-elected in May, promised it would revive the economy and create millions of jobs. “The nuclear deal is overwhelmingly supported by the Iranian public, but there was an expectation that much more economic development would come out of it,” Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, told CNN. In recent days, the demonstrations have spread to dozens of cities and towns, including the capital Tehran. “The Iranian people’s demands have been put off too long,” a protestor identified only as Yaser told the BBC from the city of Talesh. “None of the authorities have allowed a platform for these demands to be heard. The protesters are decent, not saboteurs. ... They want jobs, an income and marriage. No protester deserves a bullet.” Iran’s supreme leader, ultra-conservative cleric Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blamed the chaos on Iran’s foreign rivals. “In recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence apparatus to create troubles for the Islamic Republic,” Khamenei, the country’s highest-ranking authority, said in a statement on Tuesday. At least 21 people, including members of Iran’s security forces, have been killed in the demonstrations. Police have arrested more than 450 protesters in Tehran. Authorities also have temporarily restricted access to certain social media channels, including Instagram and Telegram, a messaging app. Rouhani, in a pre-recorded speech broadcast on state media Sunday, declared: “We are a free nation. And according to the constitution and citizen rights, the people are free to express their criticism and even their protests.” The president cautioned that “criticism should not be accompanied with violence or vandalizing public property.” Tensions between Tehran and Washington have soured since Trump took office, and continue to worsen with the U.S. president’s support for the protests. Trump has vowed to “tear up” the Iran nuclear deal, triggering international alarm, and moved to decertify it in October. He could terminate the agreement later this month and reimpose sanctions on Tehran. Trump, on Twitter, has praised the protests, and encouraged Rouhani’s government to “respect their people’s rights, including right to express themselves.” His administration also urged Tehran to unblock the restricted social media sites. Trump shared two video clips of his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September, in which he called Tehran an “oppressive regime.” “The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime,” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, warning, “The U.S. is watching!” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi addressed Trump’s remarks. “Instead of wasting his time by publishing offensive tweets to other nations, Trump should focus on internal affairs of America,” Qasemi said. Trump “doesn’t carry any credibility in Iran,” the National Iranian American Council’s Parsi said. “This is not about Trump, and Trump stepping into this is not necessarily helpful,” Parsi told CNN. The demonstrations don’t necessarily signal the beginnings of a revolution or coup, according to Reza Marashi, National Iranian American Council research director. “As things currently stand, these protests more closely resemble a continuation of Iran’s long-standing civil rights movement rather than an attempt to overthrow the government,” Marashi recently wrote for HuffPost.

    "title": "Iranian Protests Raise Tricky Questions For U.S. And Saudi Policymakers",
    "text": "If Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s chequered foreign policy track record is anything to go by, Iran could tempt him to embark on yet another risky adventure inspired by widespread anti-government protests in Iran, the real focus of his multiple regional quagmires that include the devastating war in Yemen and the failed effort to force Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to resign. In many ways, Prince Mohammed faces the same considerations in deciding how to respond to events in Iran as does U.S. President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump has to this month not only choose whether to certify to Congress Iranian compliance with the 2015 international agreement that curbed the Islamic republic’s nuclear program, but also whether to waive U.S. sanctions on Iran. A decision to reimpose economic sanctions could mean a U.S. withdrawal from the agreement. At the core of Mr. Trump’s decision as well as Prince Mohammed’s deliberations on how and if to respond to the Iranian protests is the question whether the United States and/or Saudi Arabia see a strengthening of hard-line conservative factions in Iran as serving their purpose of at least further containing the Islamic republic, and possibly engineering a situation that would be conducive to regime change. “The most likely scenario is that the evidence of popular dissatisfaction and the inevitable repression will harden the Trump administration’s position on sustaining the deal and provide additional incentives for ratcheting up new economic pressure on the government, They also may see some possibility of flipping the Europeans if the crackdown is fierce and well-documented,” said Brookings fellow and ormer State Department policy planning Iran expert Suzanne Maloney. Europe has urged Mr. Trump not to nix the nuclear agreement. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, in contrast to hard-liners, has sought to reach out to the protesters by recognizing their right to criticize while denouncing violence and promising to address their economic grievances. Mr. Rouhani may be able to tackle some issues like the fraudulent financial institutions that have deprived many of their savings, but will struggle to fix the country’s structural economic issues, including the power of hard-line institutions such as the Revolutionary Guards Corps. He may also be able to institutionalize and anchor in law the right to protest with the backing of hardliners. Moreover, addressing economic issues would be even more daunting if Mr. Trump effectively withdraws from the nuclear agreement. Ultimately, the odds are that hard-liners, irrespective of what scenario unfolds, will emerge strengthened by the current crisis either as the result of protests losing momentum as the regime curbs access to social media, a brutal squashing of the protests as a last resort, or because increased external pressure will initially unite rival factions and reinforce widespread disillusionment with the nuclear agreement that has failed to provide tangible economic benefits to a majority of Iranians. Looming in the background is the risk that Prince Mohammed with or without US backing or cooperation will seek to exploit the Iranian government’s problems by attempting to further destabilize the Islamic republic by stirring unrest among already restive ethnic minority groups such as the Kurds and the Baloch. Kermanshah, a city in predominantly Kurdish western Iran, was one of the first cities to which the protests spread after first erupting in the conservative stronghold of Mashhad. Saudi Arabia has funnelled large amounts of money in the last 18 months to militant groups and madrassas or religious seminaries in the Pakistani province of Balochistan that borders on the Iranian region of Sistan and Baluchistan, both populated by restive Baloch populations. A Riyadh-based think tank believed to be supported by Prince Mohammed last year published a blueprint for stirring unrest among the Iranian Baluch. Mr. Trump and the U.S. State Department have in recent days expressed support for the protesters, urged the international community to chirp in, and said they back those in Iran that are seeking a peaceful transition of government. Various US analysts have argued that Mr. Trump’s anti-Iranian track record, including his attempted bans on granting visas to Iranians, curtails the impact of his support for the protesters and may even strengthen the hardliners by allowing them to point fingers at alleged foreign instigation. “While we’re on Trump, the impact of his tweets has been marginal at best. They’ve triggered a slew of angry comments, packed with ridicule. Across classes, factions and generations in Iran, there is a shared contempt for #POTUS whose policies look erratic and hypocritical,” tweeted Bloomberg News’ Iran correspondent, Golnar Motevalli. Rather than speaking out, the analysts proposed concrete steps the United States could take to support the protesters. Ms. Maloney and journalist Maziar Bahari suggested the United States could use its influence with technology, satellite internet providers and social media companies like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to try to keep the protesters’ communications channels open. Former State Department official Reza Marashi argued that advice he and others proffered in 2009 when the Iranian government faced far larger protests against alleged election fraud remained valid in the current situation. “We advised our superiors to express concern about the violence against protestors, and highlight the importance of respecting free speech, democratic process, and peaceful dissent. We also emphasized a need for the U.S. government to publicly express its respect for Iranian sovereignty, its desire to avoid making America the issue during a domestic Iranian protest, and its belief that it is up to Iranians to determine who Iran’s leaders will be,” Mr. Marashi recalled. Much of that advice has been ignored by the Trump administration. In doing so, the administration has not only allowed Mr. Rouhani and the hardliners to point to a scapegoat, it has seemingly gone out of its way to raise Iranian fears that U.S. policy, with the Saudis in tow, is focused on regime change.

    "title": "Israel Tells African Migrants, Asylum-Seekers To Leave Or Go To Jail",
    "text": "Almost 40,000 undocumented African migrants in Israel will soon face a grim choice: uproot their lives and leave now, or risk going to jail indefinitely. The Israeli cabinet on Wednesday approved a plan that would see the government give $3,500 to undocumented African migrants who agree to leave before the end of March. Those who remain in Israel by that deadline would face indefinite detention. Israel’s interior minister and public security minister described the agreement as “two options: voluntary deportation or sitting in prison.” An estimated 38,000 undocumented migrants currently live in Israel, many who are asylum-seekers that fled war and persecution in Sudan and Eritrea. The country has granted asylum to less than 1 percent of applicants since since signing the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called African migrants “a threat to the social fabric of society, our national security, our national identity … [and] our existence as a Jewish and democratic state.” Israel’s Population and Immigration Authority last week called on undocumented migrants from those two countries to leave “to their country or to a third country.” The United Nations Refugee Agency expressed concern over the announcement when Israel’s Interior Ministry proposed it in November, noting that returning refugees in need would be a violation of international refugee law. “As party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, Israel has legal obligations to protect refugees and other persons in need of international protection,” Volker Türk, UNHCR’s assistant high commissioner for protection, said at the time. Human rights groups in Israel said that they believe those “third countries” could be Rwanda and Uganda. Israel had previously engaged in negotiations with those countries to take in some of the Sudanese and Eritreans from Israel. But on Friday, Uganda’s state minister for international relations, Henry Okello Oryem, called those reports “fake news.” “We don’t know where that story is coming from. We don’t know why it keeps coming up,” he told The Associated Press on Friday. “There were negotiations like three or four years ago between the two countries, but we never concluded on the matter,” Olivier Nduhungirehe, a Rwanda deputy foreign minister, echoed. The plan, officially proposed months ago, has received significant pushback from human rights groups and international organizations alike. The contested plan is akin to “human trafficking and smuggling,” Teklit Michael, an asylum-seeker from Eritrea living in Tel Aviv, told the AP. “We don’t know what is waiting for us [in Rwanda and Uganda],” he added. Another asylum-seeker living in Israel, 38-year-old Anwar Suleiman Arbab, crossed into the country via Egypt in 2008 after fleeing Sudan. He told the New York Times that he’s already been temporarily detained twice. “If it’s between going back to Africa or to jail in Israel, I’ll go to jail,” he said. “The contested plan is akin to “human trafficking and smuggling.”” Some 1,420 migrants in Israel are currently being held in detention centers, Reuters reports. The government has announced that it will soon close its Holot detention facility, where it houses many migrants. The Israeli Supreme Court placed limits on how long migrants could be incarcerated there, the Times reported, and authorities found it was not effective in encouraging them to leave Israel. Filippo Grandi, the U.N.’s high commissioner for refugees, reminded Israel of its “painful history of migration and exile” in a statement last month. “The majority of Africans who arrive in Israel have lived through extremely difficult conditions, violence and even forms of modern slavery,” he continued. “New generations must not forget that refugees do not flee out of choice, but because they don’t have any other choice.” More than 60,000 African migrants arrived in Israel between 2005 and the end of 2012. In 2013, Israel completed construction of a 150-mile steel fence along its border with Egypt, designed to curb illegal immigration through the Sinai Peninsula. It quickly succeeded in a drastic reduction of border crossings. Netanyahu later boasted its effectiveness while praising U.S. President Donald Trump’s internationally condemned plan to erect a multibillion dollar wall along the Mexican border for purported security reasons.

He reportedly asked officials about the possibility of deporting them forcibly, according to a report from the Guardian this week. Public protests demanding migrant deportations have been happening for years in Tel Aviv and beyond. In 2012, more than half of Jewish Israelis reportedly agreed with a statement that African migrants are “a cancer in the body” of the nation, and over a third condoned anti-migrant violence, according to the Times of Israel.

    "text": "In a democracy, there are things the people in power must not say, unless they are absolutely true. One of those things is that the other side is plotting a coup to remove them from power. Saying that is an invitation to bring one’s supporters into the streets and shed blood in order to prevent said coup from taking place. Saying it can also be a prelude to claiming broader, extraordinary powers in order to, once again, prevent said coup from taking place. Saying it must never be used as a talking point to win a news cycle or two. In other words, don’t fucking say it if you don’t mean it. Conservatives, including a sitting congressman as well as, more recently, White House Senior Advisor Kellyanne Conway, have taken part in spreading this incredibly irresponsible message, another example of Trump and his minions tearing at the fabric of our democratic system. Conway appeared on Fox just after host Jesse Watters had said: “We may now have proof the [Mueller] investigation was weaponized to destroy [Trump’s] presidency for partisan political purposes and to disenfranchise millions of American voters. … Now, if that’s true, we have a coup on our hands in America.” Although Conway herself didn’t use the word coup, she didn’t say anything about Watters’s comments, and in fact walked right up to the line in her own statement. The response to these despicable statements was swift, harsh, and absolutely right on. I’ve interviewed coup plotters, torture victims, generals, politicians they toppled & dozens whose lives were destroyed by actual coups & coup attemptsThis language is so dangerous for democracy—and it’s precisely what you see before purges (which Fox News hosts are advocating) pic.twitter.com/CAFvAZaNUj Coup?! I cover wars. Militaries. Actual coups. Where citizens violently rise up and kill each other for power over each other. This is alarmingly irresponsible language, even for Fox. Inflammatory. Baseless. Dangerous. https://t.co/1tGrKZGfTR Fox News is seemingly suggesting the Mueller investigation, which began in May (seven months ago), is a coup. This is the definition of a coup or coups d'etat: “a sudden, violent, and illegal seizure of power from a government.” https://t.co/2x7kygbTZ7 The bullshit excuse for all this coup talk was some texts sent by Peter Strzok, who was the lead FBI official working with the Trump-Russia probe led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The texts showed that Strzok held Trump in particularly low regard. It’s worth noting that he also sent texts that slammed Bernie Sanders, Eric Holder, and Chelsea Clinton. The Trump people (and, yes, I include Fox News and others in the right-wing media who talked this way as “Trump people”) seized on one text in particular, where Strzok wrote: \"I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office—that there's no way he [Trump] gets elected—but I'm afraid we can’t take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.\" Conservatives believe the name “Andy” refers to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. The reality is that Strzok wasn’t talking about some kind of plot to prevent Trump from taking office, but instead, according to FBI sources who spoke to the Wall Street Journal, was expressing his conviction that the already ongoing FBI investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia could not be brushed aside on the assumption that Trump had no chance of winning. Strzok’s text, the source explained, “was meant to convey his belief that the investigation couldn't afford to take a more measured approach because Mr. Trump could very well win the election. ... It would be better to be aggressive and gather evidence quickly, he believed, because some of Mr. Trump's associates could land administration jobs and it was important to know if they had colluded with Russia.\" For what it’s worth, the coup talk has died down for now after the initial outburst on Fox by Jesse Watters and the even more-unhinged Jeanine Pirro (a long-time Trump friend whom Mr. Popular Vote Loser once characterized as “sexy as hell”), who uttered the following: “I doubt in American presidential election history that there has been as great a crime or as large a stain on our democracy than that committed by a criminal cabal in the FBI and the Department of Justice who think they know better than we who our president should be.” I’ll also add that all this ridiculous talk of an entire investigation being hopelessly compromised by supposed partisan bias because of statements made by one official—whom Mueller removed in July as soon as he learned of the texts—reminds me of another investigation of a president. The investigation of Bill Clinton, as you may remember, also employed an official who was an open partisan. That official had, before joining the Clinton probe, run the congressional campaign of a Republican, and even seriously considered running for the U.S. Senate himself as a Republican. That official was not a staffer on the Clinton investigation. He was its chief. His name was Ken Starr, and he was put in charge of the Clinton investigation after the previous investigator Robert Fiske was removed under circumstances that themselves reeked of partisanship. How many Republicans objected to the Ken Starr investigation because of his partisan bias? How many Fox News conservative talking heads did so? The answer is none. That’s a point I raised recently when I was a guest on a conservative cable news show fighting back against this Trump coup talk (video is below).

    "title": "Ivanka Trump Reportedly Imagined Herself As The First Female President",
    "text": "Ivanka Trump reportedly had some pretty high aspirations for herself when her father became president. According to an excerpt from Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, the president’s older daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, took jobs in President Donald Trump’s West Wing for personally opportunistic reasons. The excerpt, quoted in New York Magazine, reads: The First Children couple were having to navigate Trump’s volatile nature just like everyone else in the White House. And they were willing to do it for the same reason as everyone else — in the hope that Trump’s unexpected victory would catapult them into a heretofore unimagined big time. Balancing risk against reward, both Jared and Ivanka decided to accept roles in the West Wing over the advice of almost everyone they knew. It was a joint decision by the couple, and, in some sense, a joint job. This joint job included an “earnest deal” between the two in which Ivanka Trump might make history. Between themselves, the two had made an earnest deal: If sometime in the future the opportunity arose, she’d be the one to run for president. The first woman president, Ivanka entertained, would not be Hillary Clinton; it would be Ivanka Trump. In 2015 when her dad was running for president, Trump did tell Town & Country that she wouldn’t rule out a run for public office herself. “It’s not something I’ve ever been inclined to do, but I’m 34, so who knows?” she said. “At this point, I would never even contemplate it, but that doesn’t mean that when I’m 50 I won’t have a change of heart.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Democrats Aren't Sure Whether To Make Jeff Sessions' Pot Crackdown An Election Issue",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Leading Democrats blasted Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Thursday announcement that he would open the door to a federal crackdown on states that have decriminalized forms of marijuana use. Sessions’ action reverses a Department of Justice policy from the Barack Obama administration that effectively shielded those states from federal prosecution. Sessions “needs to focus on issues like transnational criminal organizations” and what the nation needs to do on “investigating and prosecuting human trafficking,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a rumored 2020 presidential candidate, told HuffPost on Thursday. Sessions “needs to leave grandma’s medicinal marijuana alone!” she continued with a chuckle. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), a centrist, declared that the move “would seem to be the absolute opposite direction of where the country’s headed and one more example of this administration being completely out of step with where both Americans are headed and, for that matter, Democratic and Republican state legislatures.” “This is a big mistake,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told HuffPost. “In those states where the people in the states have made a determination to decriminalize or legalize marijuana ... the federal government would better spend its resources going after real problems we’ve got.” But criticizing Sessions’ move is one thing. Turning his marijuana crackdown into an election-year political cudgel ― in stump speeches, campaign literature and ads ― is something else entirely. And when asked whether Democrats planned to use the marijuana crackdown against Republicans in the November elections, some of the same Democrats keen to clobber Sessions were noncommittal. “It’s way too early to predict that,” Warner said. Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Senate campaign arm, said, “Every Democratic member of the Senate will have to decide what’s best in their states.” Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who also expressed her displeasure with Sessions’ decision, argued that Democrats ought to run on kitchen-table economic issues rather than marijuana. “There are so many other things to run on, like the tax bill that just passed that does not help working families at all,” she said in an interview. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not respond to multiple email requests for comment on the political salience of Sessions’ move. The DSCC referred HuffPost back to Van Hollen’s remarks. When asked about making marijuana an election issue, Democratic National Committee spokesman Michael Tyler provided a statement indicting Sessions’ “morally bankrupt and economically stupid” decision without commenting on the potential political effect. Part of the challenge for Democrats who might want to turn Sessions’ move into a partisan issue is that so many of their Republican colleagues responded with similar outrage. Lawmakers from states that have legalized the drug, including Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), were especially firm in their criticism. In a scathing floor speech, Gardner, who chairs the National Republican Senate Committee, the GOP Senate’s campaign arm, said he was “prepared to take all steps necessary” to get Sessions to reverse the decision, including holding up Department of Justice nominees. Warner and Hirono both cited Republican condemnations in explaining the difficulty of making marijuana an election-year issue. Still other Democrats were reluctant to even condemn Sessions’ order. Sens. Bob Casey (Pa.), Jack Reed (R.I.) and Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), who faces a tough reelection battle, all said they were still too unfamiliar with Sessions’ action to comment. (Casey later issued a statement expressing “serious concerns about how this action by Attorney General Sessions could impact Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana law.”) Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) also pleaded ignorance when asked about the matter at a Thursday news conference. “I haven’t seen” Sessions’ comments on marijuana, Schumer said. Jeff Hauser, a former political communications chief at the AFL-CIO who runs the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research’s executive branch accountability project, observed that congressional Republicans, partly at the prodding of the libertarian-leaning Koch brothers, have warmed to criminal justice reform in recent years. But Democrats would be mistaken to think that they are forfeiting opportunities for bipartisan progress by making an unrepentant drug warrior like Sessions a political liability for Republicans, according to Hauser. “If Democrats get elected in part on this platform, that will ultimately make passing a [bipartisan reform] bill more likely because Republicans will want to put the issue in the past,” Hauser said. “The way you get Republicans to repudiate hacks like Jeff Sessions is by causing them to pay a political price.” At the state level, Democrats appear less hesitant to make marijuana a significant part of their electoral strategy. Sessions’ action “will be a net positive for Democrats pretty much everywhere,” said Jared Leopold, communications director of the Democratic Governors Association. “I don’t see this as a winner for Republicans anywhere,” Leopold added. “But it’s especially a problem in a state like Colorado, where marijuana is a major source of revenue for the state government.” At least 15 Democratic gubernatorial candidates and current governors blasted Sessions’ decision, including Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a former Detroit health director running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Michigan, where legalization is likely to be on the ballot in November, vowed in a statement that, if elected, he’d “fight [the crackdown] tooth and nail.” This is how the federal government interferes with a State’s will. I will join our new Progressive Attorney General and fight this tooth and nail when I’m elected. It’s bad policy. https://t.co/6UcBHMs87k Later in the day, former Michigan Senate Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer, the frontrunner in the race for the state’s Democratic gubernatorial nomination, tweeted that Sessions’ “move takes us backward in our fight to level the playing field.” In Nevada and Colorado, two states with legal recreational pot where Republican attorneys general are seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, the Democratic Party was eager to jump on Sessions’ announcement. Two Colorado Democrats vying to succeed Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper ― Rep. Jared Polis and former Colorado Treasurer Cary Kennedy ― delivered stinging rebukes of Sessions’ decision. Polis slammed Sessions for “waging war on local marijuana;” Kennedy called it an “attack” on Colorado voters. By contrast, Colorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman, a Republican who is running against Polis and Kennedy, reaffirmed her commitment to defending the Colorado law but declined to criticize Sessions’ decision. Coffman noted that it would still be up to federal prosecutors’ discretion and consequently admonished residents to “not freak out.” We'll give Jeff Sessions our legal pot when he pries it from our warm, extremely interesting to look at hands. https://t.co/LF0RpdCiHG Nevada Democratic Party spokeswoman Hellen Kalla called on state Republicans, including Attorney General Adam Laxalt, to “clearly and firmly commit to standing up against any meddlesome attempt by the Trump administration to infringe upon our state’s right to grow our economy as our voters see fit.” Nevada Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Sisolak denounced the move as well, declaring, “We cannot and will not stand for this or any threat by the Trump administration to undo progress in Nevada.” But Laxalt, one of Sisolak’s opponents, merely offered a statement highlighting his past willingness to defend the state’s marijuana law against legal challenges despite his opposition to the ballot measure that legalize it. Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who is launching a competitive bid to unseat Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), noted on Twitter that Heller voted to confirm Sessions despite knowing about Sessions’ “stance against marijuana legalization.” Let's not forget: @SenDeanHeller knew Jeff Sessions' stance against marijuana legalization and voted to confirm him as Attorney General anyway. https://t.co/NAW8dzYmLr The polling on marijuana legalization suggests that it could be a potent issue at the ballot box. Nationwide, 64 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana, an increase from 12 percent in 1969, according to Gallup. Broken down by party affiliation,Gallup found that legalization has the support of 72 percent of Democrats, 67 percent of independents and 51 percent of Republicans. As the data journalism site FiveThirtyEight observed, that makes marijuana legalization one of the least polarizing public policy issues in the country today. Since Democrats struggle to turn out infrequent voters during the midterms, the galvanizing power of protecting state-level marijuana laws could work in their favor. In 2014, the last nationwide midterm election cycle, 69 percent of voters in a pre-election poll said they were more likely to turn out if a marijuana legalization proposal were on the ballot. It is far from clear, however, that marijuana initiatives ultimately provided Democrats a meaningful boost in 2014. The party continued its midterm losing streak that year, prompting the Democratic National Committee to release an autopsy with recommended improvements a few months later. “I don’t see this as a partisan issue,” said Tom Angell, founder of the nonprofit Marijuana Majority. “Either party that wants to latch on to this will find that it will benefit them. The opportunity is there.” “When you are looking at races that are potentially going to come down to a few hundred votes or a thousand votes, shit like that matters.” But the circumstances this fall are different from 2014 and more likely to benefit Democrats, according to several political strategists from both parties. There are now 29 states that have legalized some form of recreational or medical marijuana, including several, like Colorado, Washington and California, where it is already ingrained in the economy and culture. And with Democrats poised to ride a midterm election wave, Sessions’ marijuana offensive could further tip the scales against the GOP, these strategists say. Assuming federal prosecutors take advantage of the new powers Sessions has granted them, it is likely to be the most politically damaging in GOP-held swing districts with a higher proportion of libertarian or socially liberal voters, such as Washington’s 8th and California’s 45th, according to GOP strategist Liz Mair. “When you are looking at races that are potentially going to come down to a few hundred votes or a thousand votes, shit like that matters,” said Mair, who has advised leading conservatives, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R). Sunjeev Bery, a progressive strategist who has worked for MoveOn.org and the ACLU, predicted that “campaigning on that heavy-handed response is going to peel off independent voters, especially in places like Colorado.” What’s more, Bery said, “if the Trump administration goes after marijuana users in a state like California, that will significantly hurt their fundraising in high-net-worth libertarian communities like Silicon Valley.” Hauser of the Center for Economic and Policy Research argued that the marijuana crackdown buttresses an existing Democratic narrative about the Trump administration’s misplaced law enforcement priorities ― whether it involves police brutality or white-collar crime. “It can bring home to people who may or may not have been following other issues closely that Trump is a destabilizing force, and things that people have grown to rely on, including access to marijuana, can be taken away from them,” Hauser said. That message would likewise appeal to conservative-leaning libertarian voters fed up with federally driven encroachments on civil liberties, states’ rights or “free trade, free movement of people-type stuff,” according to Mair. “That just doesn’t play out West. And this fits into that narrative and that problem,” she said. Some progressives are already concerned, though, that Democrats are too timid to capitalize on Sessions’ action. In an NBC News column Thursday, New York City-based activist Sean McElwee appealed to Democrats to, among other things, abandon their historic reluctance to make marijuana reform a theme in campaign advertisements. “To really set their sights on large-scale change, top Democrats need to stop being so squeamish and lead with weed,” McElwee wrote. Castigating Democrats for their lack of backbone is a familiar refrain from the the party’s progressive base. And there is evidence to support their arguments. A widely cited 2013 study co-authored by two researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan found that politicians in both parties assume that their voters are more conservative than they actually are.

    "title": "Jeff Sessions Unleashes Federal Prosecutors On Legal Marijuana",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a vocal and longtime opponent of marijuana, will allow the nation’s top federal prosecutors to decide how to handle marijuana cases in states where the drug has been legalized. The Justice Department decision, announced on Thursday, immediately caused chaos in an industry that has been growing in recent years as some states have embraced marijuana legalization, and sent stock prices of large cannabis companies nosediving as much as 35 percent. It will likely leave those in legal marijuana businesses uncertain whether the U.S. attorney in their district will resume enforcing federal law, which still regards marijuana as illegal. Sessions rescinded four memos issued during the Obama administration that outlined guidelines to help federal prosecutors decide whether to enforce laws against marijuana growers and sellers in states where the drug is legal. The guidance effectively discouraged federal prosecution of those who were following state laws. “It is the mission of the Department of Justice to enforce the laws of the United States, and the previous issuance of guidance undermines the rule of law and the ability of our local, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement partners to carry out this mission,” said Sessions. “Therefore, today’s memo on federal marijuana enforcement simply directs all U.S. attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country.” One Justice Department official called Sessions’s decision a “return to the rule of law.” But DOJ officials struggled to explain the implications of the policy in a background briefing with reporters on Thursday, and offered little direction for the state-legal marijuana industry. “Marijuana continues to be against federal law,” one said. A senior department official said Sessions’ new memo removes the “de-facto safe harbor” that existed under Obama policy. “This is something that has been under consideration at the department for a long time, and I think finally a decision was made,” the official said. Sessions has been all over the place on issues of states’ rights, but has consistently opposed marijuana legalization. He’s also been reliable supporter of aggressive law enforcement action against drugs more broadly. During a hearing on Capitol Hill in 2016, Sessions, then a senator, spoke out against weed, and urged the federal government to send the message to the public that “good people don’t smoke marijuana.” He also has called states’ legalization of marijuana “a mistake,” claimed cannabis is only “slightly less awful than” heroin and criticized the Obama administration for not taking a more forceful stance against the drug. Although marijuana remains illegal under federal law, eight states and Washington, D.C., have voted to legalize the substance for recreational use. A total of 28 states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes. A Justice Department memo in 2013, shortly after the first successful statewide cannabis legalization initiatives in Colorado and Washington state, was among the Obama administration’s guidance that permitted states to forge their own way on marijuana law. A series of memoranda included the Cole memo, named after then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole, which urged federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations. But those memos were not officially law, and were subject to changes from future administrations. With support for marijuana legalization recently reaching 64 percent nationwide, the highest ever, many questioned the Trump administration’s move to lay the groundwork for a crackdown. President Donald Trump, who said during the campaign that he wouldn’t use federal law to prosecute state-legal marijuana, now “strongly believes” federal law against marijuana should be enforced, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday. Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), co-chair of the Congressional Cannabis Caucus and a representative of a legal marijuana state, called it “one of the stupidest decisions” Sessions has made. “One wonders if Trump was consulted ― it is Jeff Sessions after all ― because this would violate his campaign promise not to interfere with state marijuana laws,” Blumenauer said in a statement. “It’s time for anyone who cares about this issue to mobilize and push back strongly against this decision.” Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), who also co-chairs the cannabis caucus, called on the president to overrule Sessions. “The Trump Administration needs to back off, and allow marijuana to be treated like alcohol under the law,” Polis said in a statement. “At stake is a growing industry that has created 23,000 jobs and generated $200 million in tax revenue in Colorado. I’m calling on President Trump to overrule Attorney General Sessions and protect consumers, our economy, the will of the voters, and states’ rights.” Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) suggested Sessions lied ahead of his confirmation as attorney general about his intent to target state-legal marijuana operations. Gardner, in a series of tweets, also threatened to retaliate. I am prepared to take all steps necessary, including holding DOJ nominees, until the Attorney General lives up to the commitment he made to me prior to his confirmation. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), whose state began allowing recreational marijuana sales on Jan. 1, called Sessions’ move an “extravagant holiday gift to the drug cartels.” “Sessions has shown a preference for allowing all commerce in marijuana to take place in the black market, which will inevitably bring the spike in violence he mistakenly attributes to marijuana itself,” said Rohrabacher. “He is doing the bidding of an out-of-date law enforcement establishment that wants to wage a perpetual weed war and seize private citizens’ property in order to finance its backward ambitions.” Rohrabacher added: “By taking this benighted minority position, he actually places Republicans’ electoral fortunes in jeopardy.” The direct impact of the policy change is uncertain. It means that U.S. attorneys ― the chief federal law enforcer within their regional jurisdiction ― now have the attorney general’s blessing to aggressively pursue marijuana prosecutions. The U.S. has 94 U.S. attorneys. “We don’t know a lot about the U.S. attorneys because the president fired all of them,” said John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert on marijuana policy. “As the acting U.S. attorneys show what they’re going to do and the newly confirmed U.S. attorneys begin to act, we’ll get a better understanding, but until then it’s just uncertainty layered on top of uncertainty.” A senior Justice Department official said the message for the nation’s top federal prosecutors was that they should approach marijuana cases “like all other cases” and decide which prosecutions are priorities in their district. “We think that U.S. attorneys need to determine what cases need to be brought in their districts,” one senior Justice Department official said. “The attorney general believes marijuana is against federal law.” Later Thursday, Bob Troyer, the U.S. attorney for Colorado, said his office wouldn’t change its priorities with the new guidance, and would continue to focus “in particular on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state.” Marijuana-reform advocates blasted Sessions’ decision as a sad step backward. “Jeff Sessions’ obsession with marijuana prohibition defies logic, threatens successful state-level reforms, and flies in the face of widespread public support for legalization,” said Maria McFarland Sánchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a progressive nonprofit. “It’s now time for Congress to put the brakes on Sessions’ destructive agenda by limiting the Justice Department’s ability to undermine states’ decisionmaking.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

The singer shared a throwback video on Thursday of her days in the dance troupe for “In Living Color.” The clip of her dancing with her fellow Fly Girls was in response to Bruno Mars and Cardi B’s “Finesse” remix video, which debuted Wednesday night and was dedicated to the ’90s sketch comedy show. A post shared by Jennifer Lopez (@jlo) on Jan 4, 2018 at 1:15pm PST Instead of a written caption, Lopez used hashtags to say “once a fly girl always a fly girl” and “killing it since forever.” She also tagged the post #finesse.

    "title": "'Jeopardy!' Player Loses Thousands After Mispronouncing 'Gangsta's Paradise'",
    "text": "The minds behind the answers on “Jeopardy!” did not come to play on Monday night when a contestant mispronounced the title of a Coolio song, costing him $3,200. On the first episode of 2018, contestants were given this Double Jeopardy! clue to win $1,600: “A song by Coolio from ‘Dangerous Minds’ goes back in time to become a 1667 John Milton classic.” The category was “Music & Literature Before & Afters,” a popular theme on the quiz show where contestants must combine well-known entities to create a new phrase. Contestant Nick Spicher buzzed in and confidently answered: “What is Gangster’s Paradise Lost?” The answer pushed Spicher to the lead, going from $9,600 to $11,200. Moments later, host Alex Trebek revoked the dollar value Spicher had won from the answer plus the penalty he should have received for answering incorrectly. “Our judges have re-evaluated one of your responses a few moments ago, Nick,” he said. “You said ‘gangster’s’ instead of ‘gangsta’s’ on that song by Coolio, so we take $3,200 away from you. So you are now in second place.” You can watch the awkwardness here: Let Nick’s mistake be a lesson to us all. In 2018, you gotta keep it gangsta at all times. Never Gangster #Jeopardy pic.twitter.com/NMO7QsAfyI OUCH. Don’t mess with the genius of Coolio, my man. “Jeopardy!” explained the error of Spicher’s remark in full detail on its blog, noting that each response in the game is carefully reviewed “at the Judges’ Table during live gameplay to ensure that it is complete and accurate.” As such, the show “ultimately ruled against Nick’s response of ‘Gangster’s Paradise Lost’” because of one syllable. “Although Nick’s response of ‘Gangster’s Paradise Lost’ was initially accepted, the hard R sound caught the ear of one member of the onstage team, who immediately followed up with a quick check,” the blog post reads. “It turns out that ‘gangsta’ and ‘gangster’ are both listed separately in the Oxford English Dictionary, each with its own unique definition.” So, because Spicher’s response changed not only the title, but also its meaning, it was rendered unacceptable.

    "title": "Jerry Van Dyke, 'Coach' Actor And Brother Of Dick Van Dyke, Dead At 86",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Jerry Van Dyke, the younger brother of actor Dick Van Dyke and a four-time Emmy nominee, died Friday in Arkansas. He was 86. Jerry’s wife, Shirley Ann Jones, told the New York Times that his health had deteriorated since a traffic accident in 2015. Van Dyke’s television career began in tandem with his brother’s, as one of his earliest appearances was on “The Dick Van Dyke Show” in 1962 as Stacey Petrie. Van Dyke was best known for his role as Assistant Coach Luther Van Dam on ABC’s “Coach,” which earned him four Emmy nominations. Throughout his television career, Van Dyke gravitated towards projects that would go on to be short-lived, turning down a starring role in “Gilligan’s Island” to work on “My Mother the Car,” which has been regarded as one of the worst television shows of the era. It ran for only one season on NBC in September 1965. A few of his other ill-fated projects included “Accidental Family,” “Headmaster” and “13 Queens Boulevard.” When his television career began to seemingly taper off at the end of the ’60s, he supported himself with his stage show, which played in Las Vegas, at Playboy Clubs, and on cruise ships. In 1989, however, Van Dyke nabbed the role of Assistant Coach Luther Van Dam on “Coach,” which ran until 1997. Van Dam assisted Craig T. Nelson’s Coach Hayden Fox as they oversaw the fictional Minnesota State University Screaming Eagles. Van Dyke’s work on the show earned him four Emmy nominations for supporting actor. Van Dyke was characteristically good-humored about the meandering nature of his career. “Everybody talks about me making a comeback,” he told USA Today in 1990 when discussing an Emmy nomination he received for the role. “I say: ‘Comeback from what? This is as good as it’s ever been.’” After “Coach” ended, Van Dyke continued to make guest appearances in sitcoms like “Yes, Dear,” “Raising Hope” and “My Name is Earl.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The comedian noted on his late-night show Thursday that Trump’s lawyers’ tried to stop the release of Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by sending cease-and-desist letters to Wolff and publisher Henry Holt & Co. But the actions actually encouraged more people to order the tome. It’s gone from “number 48,000 on Amazon straight to Number One,” said Kimmel. The publisher also changed release date to Jan. 5 from Jan. 9. Kimmel had some advice for the president: “If you don’t want people to read a book about you, why would you take legal action to try to stop people from reading the book about you?” “I wasn’t going to buy the book, I was just gonna read the excerpts in magazines and move on,” Kimmel added. “But now that Trump’s lawyers are going all-out to try to stop this book from being published, I’m buying 20 copies! I can’t buy enough of these books!” Check out the full segment above.

It’s like a superpower that she can just unlock and do so specifically with not many attempts.” And he didn’t stop there. “For me, I love acting and I’m so lucky to be doing it. But she’s on another plane,” Krasinski said. “This weird intersection happened while filming where I totally forgot I was her husband.

    "title": "Joie Lamar Talks New Creative Book Honoring Pulse Nightclub 49 (AUDIO)",
    "text": "This week I talked with best-selling author Joie Lamar about curating the new coffee table book Cuarenta y Nueve, which is Spanish for 49 pays artistic homage to honor the lives of the 49 we lost in Orlando at Pulse Nightclub Massacre. Cuarenta y Nueve is a unique compilation from 49 contributors including Lamar, to remember and honor the lives we lost on June 12, 2016. Joie was shaken to the core by this tragedy especially since she had lived in the Orlando area for 10 years as part of the Latino LGBTQ community and had partied at the Pulse nightclub many times, even knowing one of the victims. She wanted to do something that would honor the victims and came up with the concept of paying homage to the 49 lives lost by gathering 49 talented individual contributors and Cuarenta Y Nueve was born. The 49 diverse contributors come from our LGBTQ community including Cat Grant, a multi-media artist and writer in Toronto who began recruiting for the project early on. Filmmaker Kate Johnston also helped Lamar gather talent for this passionate project. The names and variety of talent poured in including photographer Angel Torres who designed both the front and back cover of the book as well as recruiting other contributors. All proceeds of Cuarenta y Nueve will be donated to support the work of Pride School Atlanta and GLAAD in perpetuity. I talked to Joie about what she hopes to accomplish with Cuarenta Y Nueve and her spin on our LGBTQ issues. LISTEN: When asked how she sees our LGBTQ community moving forward in this Trump administration Lamar stated: Joie Lamar published her first novel volume 1 of a 2-part memoir entitled Mambo Lips in 2016 and volume 2 entitled Salsa Hips that are currently being developed into a feature film Las Alas directed by filmmaker Kate Johnston. Both books have been added to the curriculum and library portfolio at two LGBTQ schools. The Harvey Milk High School in New York City and Pride School in Atlanta. There will be three launch dates for Cuarenta y Nueve including Montreal, Canada on January 27th 2018 with launch dates in Toronto and New York to be announced. Joie Lamar lives in Canada with her wife, two fur babies and a growing number of world changing projects.

    "title": "Undocumented Immigrant Acquitted In Kate Steinle Shooting Gets 3 Years On Gun Charge",
    "text": "Jan 5 (Reuters) - An undocumented immigrant acquitted in a fatal San Francisco shooting, in a verdict condemned by President Donald Trump, was sentenced to three years in prison on a lesser gun charge on Friday but credited for time already served behind bars, authorities said. A San Francisco Superior Court jury on Nov. 30 found Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, 45, not guilty of murder and manslaughter charges in connection with the July 1, 2015, shooting death of Kate Steinle. Jurors found him guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm. A San Francisco judge on Friday sentenced Garcia Zarate to three years in prison on the firearms charge, said San Francisco District Attorney’s Office spokesman Alex Bastian. Garcia Zarate, a Mexican national, has been behind bars since his 2015 arrest, so his sentence has been completed after factoring in credits, Bastian said. Garcia Zarate had found the gun that killed Steinle. It accidentally discharged, with the bullet ricocheting off the ground at a crowded pier before striking the 32-year-old woman, his defense attorneys have said. Prosecutors claimed Garcia Zarate intentionally fired the gun, but they said they accepted the jury’s verdict. Trump, who used the Steinle case as a rallying cry against the policies of so-called sanctuary cities for immigrants during his successful run for the presidency, has called the jury’s verdict “disgraceful.” On Dec. 5, just days after he was acquitted in San Francisco, Garcia Zarate was indicted on federal charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm and being an undocumented immigrant in possession of a firearm. He remains in the custody of the San Francisco Sheriff’s Department and will be handed over to U.S. Marshals on warrants stemming from the federal charges, said sheriff’s department spokeswoman Nancy Crowley. The latest criminal counts against Zarate would not violate the constitutional protection against so-called double jeopardy, which prohibits a person from being tried twice on the same charges, because they differed legally from the state court charges, a U.S. Department of Justice spokesman said last month. A representative for the Office of the Federal Public Defender could not immediately be reached for comment. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Former Hostage Joshua Boyle Facing 15 Charges, Including Assault",
    "text": "A Canadian man held captive by a Taliban-linked group for five years was arrested Monday in Ottawa on charges of assault, sexual assault and unlawful confinement, among others, his lawyer told Canadian Press. Joshua Boyle, 34, and wife Caitlan Coleman were abducted by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network in 2012 during a backpacking trip in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces freed the family, including the couple’s three children, during an October military raid, after which they returned to Canada. According to the Toronto Star, Boyle now faces 15 charges in all, including eight counts of assault, two counts of sexual assault, two counts of unlawful confinement, one count of uttering death threats, one count of misleading the police and one count of causing someone to “take a noxious thing, namely Trazodone,” according to a court document. The alleged incidents occurred between the time Boyle arrived in Canada on Oct. 14 and Dec. 30. A publication ban on information that could identify any alleged victims is currently in place, according to the BBC. Boyle remains in police custody. His attorney, Eric Granger, told CTV News that he is set to appear in court on Wednesday. “This is an individual obviously we all know has been through a lot, is an individual otherwise who hasn’t been in trouble before, and he’s presumed innocent of these charges,” Granger told the outlet. “I can’t speak about the specific charges, but I can say that ultimately it is the strain and trauma he was forced to endure for so many years and the effects that that had on his mental state that is most culpable for this,” Coleman, Boyle’s wife, said via a statement to the Star. Coleman was rushed to the hospital on Oct. 17, but Boyle did not specify why in an email to The Associated Press at the time. At a press conference upon their return, Boyle said he and his wife had been attempting to help villagers in remote parts of Afghanistan and referred to himself as a “pilgrim.” He told reporters that the Haqqani group had authorized the murder of one of the couple’s children and had brutally raped Coleman, and asked the Afghan government to bring his kidnappers to justice. Boyle also said he and his family would focus on their lives in Canada. “Obviously it will be of incredible importance to my family that we are able to build a secure sanctuary for our three surviving children, to call a home, to focus on edification and to try to regain some portion of the childhood that they have lost,” he said.

    "title": "Journalism Fights For Its Life",
    "text": "In his important year-end post for his site PressThink, New York University journalism professor and critic Jay Rosen warned, “the world has changed and journalists are in the fight of their lives.” Rosen’s point is that the way for journalism to earn trust has changed because users now have more choices and more control. He then provides a thoughtful list of ways is which journalists can win trust through transparency. But how does one win the trust of everyone in the era of Trump, who now is a bully with the White House pulpit? The president proudly claimed in an interview with the Fox Business Channel last October that he “started this whole fake news thing.” Of course, that is not true. In fact, according to the Washington Post, “President Trump has made 1,950 false or misleading claims over 347 days.” That the president frequently lies is not fake news, and it is not new news. A Morning Consult/Political poll last December found that only 36 percent of those sampled thought the president is honest. In fact, 51 percent of those polled believe he is dishonest, while 60 percent think he is reckless. Yet his almost daily attacks against the press, mostly false or misleading, have staggered many members of the press. The First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees freedom of the press. Freedom House reports that freedom of the press is in decline around the world, including here in the United States. A record number of journalists have been imprisoned worldwide, including 21 on “fake news” charges. Senator John McCain issued this warning to President Trump in December on Twitter, ”@POTUS must understand his harmful rhetoric only empowers repressive regimes to jail reporters and silence the truth.” Soon after his return to the White House, following a holiday break in Florida, the president launched another fusillade on Twitter against one of his favorite targets, The New York Times. “The failing New York Times has a new publisher, A.G. Sulzberger. Congratulations! Here is a last chance for the Times to fulfill the vision of its Founder, Adolph Ochs, to give the news impartially, without fear of FAVOR, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved,” his first tweet read. He continued in a second tweet, “Get impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all your phony and non-existent ‘sources,’ and treat the President FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write and apology to your readers for a job poorly done!” Clearly, the president’s claims of fake news and his attacks on news organizations are all a tactic. If he was innocent of sin, if his White House was free of scandal, if his agenda was popular with the masses, he wouldn’t have to protest too much. But he doth protest an awful lot! He loves to spin his own alternate reality and lash out at the press. His communications staff, assorted acolytes and members of Congress echo his attacks because it is in their own personal interest and the mainstream media are easy targets. Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron stoically observed last year, “We are not at war with the administration, we are at work.” But for more news channels, more online news sites, and the growing amount of users who get their news from social media, opinion is now the currency of the realm. An enormous number of Americans get their information only from sources they feel agree with their views, i.e., one’s that are consistent with their core beliefs. And some news outlets carefully craft their content to appeal to their likely viewers, and to advance a political agenda. This has left America so politically divided it is hard for people from different regions or ideologies to agree on basic facts, let alone have an rational and calm discussion. More transparency is important, absolutely, but do Sean Hannity’s 3.2 million viewers care if he is transparent? Few of his viewers check around with different sources to get the other side of the argument. And they don’t care that Hannity regularly consults with President Trump, who is a big fan of his program. Sure, Hannity is not a journalist, but he is on the Fox News Channel. The big question is at what point will Americans say enough is enough with the attacks on the press. At what point will Americans be motivated enough to devote time to study all sides of the issues. At what point will Americans take the time to be well informed before making decisions about elected officials, as our founding fathers had intended when they wrote the First Amendment. The fathers wanted to assure that America would not be ruled by a despot, rather that it would always be ruled by the people. The press is not perfect, but most major news organizations have a process to assure that all of the facts are fully vetted before they are published, and to assure fairness, impartiality, independence and accountability. On the other hand, the administration, the Congress, and government agencies are not always transparent and accountable to the people. That will only happen with a strong and vibrant press.

    "title": "So Justin Bieber And Selena Gomez Did Ring In The New Year Together",
    "text": "While the rest of us are trying to stick to our resolutions, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez threw the new year, new me approach out the window and celebrated in secret over the weekend. The on-again-off-again couple who are currently very much on again reportedly rang in 2018 together down south in Cabo San Lucas, where Gomez and friends were vacationing on a girls trip. “Justin flew in to Cabo on a private jet from Cancun where he spent a few days with his family,” a source told E! News. “He arrived on Saturday evening and checked into an oceanfront villa 10 minutes away from Selena’s villa where she was staying.” The two apparently watched the fireworks over the ocean together after Gomez and pals Raquelle Stevens, Courtney Barry, and Ashley Cook spent the day in the sun. A post shared by Raquelle Stevens (@raquellestevens) on Dec 29, 2017 at 6:45pm PST Bieber also shared a photo over the weekend appearing shirtless (well, duh) in a Snapchat captioned “New Years” with a few friends. “Justin and Selena are doing great,” a People source added. Tweens and the pop culture inclined everywhere received the shock of their lives when the couple, who dated from 2011 to 2015 before calling it quits, seemingly rekindled their romance in November. After being spotted by paparazzi on multiple outings together, the two were photographed kissing after one of Bieber’s hockey games, confirming once and for all that heart truly does want what it wants. “I’m 25. I’m not 18, or 19, or 20,” Gomez said of her reconciliation with Bieber. “I cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn’t right. But that doesn’t mean caring for someone ever goes away.” Gomez is still, however, on good terms with ex-boyfriend The Weeknd, who she dated right before she started to belieb again.

    "title": "Watch Justin Timberlake Literally Do The Robot In 'Filthy' Music Video",
    "text": "Does Justin Timberlake dream of electric sheep? Timberlake’s wife, actress Jessica Biel, has promised that his forthcoming album “Man of the Woods” will feel like “the Wild West, but now.” But the first single, “Filthy,” which was released on Friday with a music video, is actually all about the future. In the video, Timberlake channels a Steve Jobs-like character at a “Pan-Asian Deep Learning Conference” in the year 2028. But the main attraction is a robot he’s created that mirrors his every movement, leading to ― what else would you expect? ― a dance-off complete with scantily clad backup dancers. “I said, put your filthy hands all over me / And no, this ain’t the clean version,” he sings on the chorus. “And what you gonna do with all that meat? / Cookin’ up a mean serving.” Produced by Timbaland, Danja and Timberlake himself, the single couldn’t be further from the “earthy” and “personal” vibe he teased (and infuriated) fans with this week. “Filthy” feels more akin to the former boy bander’s previous “20/20 Experience” era, with a slick beat and futuristic production.

    "text": "Just when you had gotten that “Trolls” song played at every last wedding, birthday, bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah out of your head, Justin Timberlake is back with new music. Ahead of his scheduled appearance at the Super Bowl 2018 halftime show, the singer announced that his fifth studio album, titled “Man of the Woods,” will drop Feb. 2, with the first single available on Friday. The Tennessee-born Timberlake shared a short video clip on social media Tuesday, showing him solemnly wandering through the wilderness while musing on the origins of his new sound. “This album is really inspired by my son, my wife, my family, but more so than any other album I’ve ever written, where I’m from, and it’s personal,” he says. A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake) on Jan 2, 2018 at 7:04am PST Aside from a promotional track here and there, Timberlake lately has been largely absent from the music scene. His last album was released more than four years ago. Timberlake’s 2-year-old son Silas, and wife Jessica Biel, whom he pulls in for a kiss, make cameos in the video. “It feels like mountains, trees, campfires. Like Wild West, but now,” Biel says in a voiceover. Musician Pharrell Williams also appears long enough to let us know that the music is “earthy,” as we hear various samplings from the album. The former boy bander is set to rock the Super Bowl halftime show, presumably with some of his new music, just days after the album drops.

    "title": "Suicide Bomber Kills At Least 11 In Afghan Capital",
    "text": "KABUL, Jan 4 (Reuters) - A suicide bomber in the Afghan capital caused dozens of casualties on Thursday after blowing himself up close to a group of security personnel who were carrying out an operation against illegal drugs and alcohol dealing, officials said. Islamic State, which has claimed a series of attacks in Kabul over the past two years, issued a statement on its Amaq news agency saying it was responsible. It said a suicide bomber targeting a group of police and intelligence service personnel had detonated an explosive vest, killing or wounding around 80 of them. Wahid Majroh, a spokesman for the ministry of public health, said 11 dead and 25 wounded had been brought to city hospitals after the blast in an area of the city not far from the U.S. Embassy and other foreign missions. As security forces arrived, a Reuters reporter saw four police vehicles carrying dead or wounded security personnel from the scene. Police officers at the scene said the bomber had been wearing police or army uniform and had approached a group of security personnel conducting controls on illegal drugs and alcohol sellers, but there was no official confirmation. “Kabul police forces were there to prevent a possible protest when a suicide bomber approached them and detonated his suicide vest,” Kabul police spokesman Bashir Mujahid said. While Afghan forces backed by U.S. air strikes have claimed some success against Taliban insurgents since the United States announced a stepped up military strategy last year, high profile attacks on civilian targets in Kabul have continued.

    "title": "Kendrick Lamar, Top Dawg To Produce Album For 'Black Panther' Film",
    "text": "As if we weren’t already on the edge of our seats waiting for “Black Panther” to hit theaters, Marvel just gave us another reason to be hype for the film. Kendrick Lamar and label executive Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith are curating and producing the film’s soundtrack. “Black Panther: The Album” will feature music from and inspired by Ryan Coogler’s highly anticipated film, Interscope Records announced on Thursday. This is the first time Marvel has integrated multiple original songs created specifically for a movie, according to the press release. “I am honored to be working with such an incredible artist whose work has been so inspirational, and whose artistic themes align with those we explore in the film. I can’t wait for the world to hear what Kendrick and [record label Top Dawg Entertainment] have in store,” Coogler said in a statement. The director hand-picked the “DAMN.” artist ― who appeared on one of the variant covers for Forbes’ most recent “30 Under 30” issue ― for this collaboration. “Marvel Studios’ ‘Black Panther’ is amazing, from its cast to its director,” Lamar said in the press release. “The magnitude of this film showcases a great marriage of art and culture. I’m truly honored to contribute my knowledge of producing sound and writing music alongside Ryan and Marvel’s vision.” “All the Stars,” which features SZA, is the first track off of the album. “Black Panther,” the 18th movie in Marvel’s sprawling film franchise, features an all-star black cast, including Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Angela Bassett, Lupita Nyong’o and Danai Gurira, among others. The movie hits theaters on Feb. 16, which clearly isn’t soon enough. We’ll be bopping along to “All the Stars” until then.

    "title": "Poet And Activist Keorapetse Kgositsile, Who Celebrated Black Arts, Dead At 79",
    "text": "Activist and poet Keorapetse Kgositsile, also known as Bra Willie, died at the Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Wednesday. He was 79. Kgositsile was battling a short illness at the hospital, South African outlet News24 reports. Family spokesperson Terry Fowler told the news site that Kgositsile had undergone surgery after suffering from circulatory problems. It is with great sadness that we have learnt of Prof. Keorapetse Kgositsile's passing. He was with us just the other day at Abantu Book Festival & his event -which was his last ever- was one of those the audience wished would never end. RIP National Poet Laureate. #NoSerenityHere pic.twitter.com/nGNCt4v3Yu South African President Jacob Zuma honored the poet in a statement, per Times Live. “Today our country mourns the sad passing of one of the giants of our liberation struggle who was renowned for his accomplishment as well in the education‚ arts and culture sectors,” Zuma said. “He was highly regarded even beyond the borders of our country and was a celebrated arts intellectual in the continent. We extend our deepest condolences to the family. May his soul rest in peace.” Kgositsile, the father of American rapper Earl Sweatshirt, was part of the African National Congress liberation movement during the 1960s. He began his writing career at the same time, working for Johannesburg’s anti-apartheid newspaper New Age. In 1962, Kgositsile went into exile in the United States, where he eventually received a master’s degree in fine arts from Columbia University. He began writing extensively about jazz. In 1969, he published his first poetry collection, Spirits Unchained. Two years later he founded the Black Arts Theatre in Harlem and published his well-known collection My Name Is Afrika. He moved back to Africa in 1975, becoming a professor at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. In 1990, he returned to post-apartheid South Africa, where he advised the minister of arts and culture. Kgositsile was honored with the South African Poet Laureate Prize in 2006. After news of his death broke, many people paid homage to Kgositsile’s life and works on Twitter. Among them was Nathi Mthethwa, South Africa’s current minister of arts and culture: Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Kerrice Lewis, Lesbian Woman Shot And Burned Alive In Washington, D.C.",
    "text": "Kerrice Lewis, media image Kerrice Lewis, age 23, was brutally murdered just days after Christmas, in Washington D.C. On Thursday, December 28, police responded to a report of gunfire on Adrian Street, just south of G Street. They arrived at 7:30 p.m. and found a vehicle on fire. After the fire was put out, officers found a woman unconscious and suffering from gunshot wounds in the trunk. Police said, by the time D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services arrived, they found “no signs consistent with life.” The car fire behind the 800 block of Adrian Street SE, D.C. Neighbors said they heard multiple gunshots in the alley behind the 800 block of Adrian Street, SE, and moments later they saw a raging fire. Kerrice Lewis was reportedly heard screaming as she tried to escape from the trunk. Lewis was orphaned at the age of 11 and raised by her grandparents. Her grandfather, William Sharp, told Fox 5 DC he feels as though his heart has been ripped out. He said “her mother died of a brain aneurysm and her father was tragically murdered up in the D.C. area.” Lewis struggled deeply with the loss of her parents. She recently served time in jail. Her grandfather said she was striving to turn her life around — Lewis worked on construction sites and Sharp said she “was very excited because she had just finished taking some classes and was looking forward to taking some more.” He said she was a “free spirit” and “full of life” and that “she would light up a room, just talking and laughing.” Lewis’ best friend and exgirlfriend, Mercedes Rouhlac Mercedes Rouhlac, the victim’s best friend and ex girlfriend, told WJLA she “talked to her everyday.” Rouhlac said she “just kept calling her” and wondering why Lewis wasn’t answering her phone. Heartbroken friends of the victim are disappointed by the lack of media coverage. When lesbians are murdered the distinct media bias keeps the general population in the dark. This bias is multiplied where “butch” lesbians are concerned, and compounded if you’re a woman of color. Lesbian relationships are typically downplayed, sexuality is often omitted, and there’s a resulting lack of focus (with both investigations and media) on potential hate crimes — even where the murder is exceptionally horrific (as in this case). In Washington DC a 20 lesbian women was tied up in her trunk after being kidnapped. Shot then burned alive in her car. My friend who knew her is broken atm. Police don’t have a suspect or a motive yet. Kerrice Lewis with her best friend’s son, media image. Julia Diana Robertson is an award-winning author and journalist.

    "text": "KFC took a page out of Donald Trump’s playbook with its latest marketing stunt, trolling both the president and rival fast-food chain McDonald’s at the same time. Trump threatened North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with this tweet Wednesday: North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! It inspired KFC’s British arm to post this similarly sinister (but thankfully spoof) message to its rival’s mascot, Ronald McDonald: McDonald’s leader Ronald just stated he has a “burger on his desk at all times”. Will someone from his big shoed, red nosed regime inform him that I too have a burger on my desk, but mine is a box meal which is bigger and more powerful than his, and mine has gravy! #nuclearbutton McDonald’s hasn’t responded. Trump famously loves fast food, and a new tell-all book about the White House says the president’s “longtime fear of being poisoned” is why he likes premade burgers from McDonald’s. He’s also been photographed chowing down on buckets of KFC chicken. Even amid the terrifying possibility of nuclear armageddon, KFC’s latest gag still went down well on Twitter: Now THAT'S a finger lickin' good one.

Well, Kardashian cleared the air and then some, when she responded to a fan on Wednesday who had defended her parenting skills. “I haven’t heard this BUT lets get this straight.

    "text": "2017 ended on a frightening note for Kim Kardashian and her family. The reality star’s 2-year-old son, Saint West, was hospitalized with a bout of pneumonia last week. TMZ reports that Saint was admitted to an L.A. hospital last Thursday and released on Saturday. Kardashian applauded her son’s strength via Twitter on Tuesday, calling pneumonia “so scary.” “My precious baby boy is so strong!” Kardashian wrote. “After spending three nights in the hospital & seeing my baby get multiple IV’s [sic] and hooked up to oxygen machines, our end of year was challenging.” My precious baby boy is so strong! After spending three nights in the hospital & seeing my baby get multiple IV’s and hooked up to oxygen machines, our end of year was challenging. Pneumonia is so scary. pic.twitter.com/XfQZ5btWap Kardashian also thanked health care professionals in a follow-up tweet. “I just want to thanks [sic] every nurse & doctor out there who works so hard around the clock,” she wrote. “We are so grateful for you all!” The KKW Beauty mogul added that Saint had completely recovered and was at home with his family. I just want to thanks every nurse & doctor out there who works so hard around the clock. We are so grateful for you all! He’s home and all better. He’s so resilient I’m sure he will still say the ambulance ride was cool! My strong Saint 👼🏽 Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the lungs and causes them to fill with fluid, leading to coughing, fever and difficulty breathing. Older adults and children under 5 are most at risk for developing pneumonia. The disease ranges in severity, but can be deadly. Luckily, vaccines can prevent some of the causes of pneumonia, like flu, measles, pertussis and pneumococcus. Here’s hoping 2018 is a happy and healthy year for the Kardashian/West family!

    "title": "Kim Jong Un Reopens Long-Closed Border Hotline With South Korea",
    "text": "SEOUL, Jan 3 (Reuters) - North Korea reopened a long-closed border hotline with South Koreaon Wednesday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to mock the North’s leader by saying he has a “bigger and more powerful” nuclear button than he does. The North’s decision to open the border phone line came a day after South Korea proposed high-level discussions amid a tense standoff over North Korea’s missile and nuclear programs. That followed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s New Year address in which he said he was open to speaking with the South and would consider sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics to be held just across the border in Pyeongchang in February. U.S. officials said Washington would not take any talks between North and South Korea seriously if they did not contribute to denuclearising North Korea. A State Department spokeswoman saidNorth Korea “might be trying to drive a wedge of some sort.” Kim ordered the reopening of the hotline at the truce village of Panmunjom at 0630 GMT on Wednesday, when South Korean officials at the border received a call from the North, the South’s unification ministry said in a text message. Officials on both sides were checking the line and conducting a conversation for about 20 minutes, the contents of which were not disclosed by the ministry. That gesture came only hours after Trump, who has mocked Kim as “Little Rocket Man,” again ridiculed the North Korean leader on Twitter. “Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” Trump tweeted. Trump and Kim have exchanged a series of bellicose comments in recent months, raising alarm across the world, with Trump at times dismissing the prospect of a diplomatic solution to a crisis in which North Korea has threatened to destroy the United States. While appearing to open the door to discussing taking part in the Winter Olympics, Kim also warned that he would push ahead with “mass producing” nuclear warheads in defiance of U.N. sanctions. His New Year’s Day speech came after a steep increase in missile launches in 2017, as well as the North’s sixth and most powerful nuclear test. Kim, who has vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, said he had a nuclear button on his desk. The hotline with the South was shut down by North Korea in February 2016 in retaliation against the closing of a border factory town that was jointly operated by the two Koreas. “We will try to keep close communications with the south Korean side from sincere stand(sic) and honest attitude, true to the intention of our supreme leadership, and deal with the practical matters related to the dispatch of our delegation,” the North’s KCNA news agency quoted Ri Son Gwon, chairman of North Korea’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, as saying. The talks would aim to establish formal dialog about sending a North Korean delegation to the Olympics, Ri said. South Korean presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan said the North’s decision to open the hotline had “significant meaning” because it could lead to constant communication. U.S. officials had voiced skepticism about the possibility of meaningful talks, particularly if they did not take steps towards banning North Korea’s nuclear weapons. Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, warned North Korea against staging another missile test and said Washington was hearing reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said both sides should seize the Olympics as an opportunity to improve ties and make concrete efforts toward alleviating tension.

    "text": "In an emotional swearing-in speech Tuesday, Larry Krasner, Philadelphia’s new district attorney, promised to transform the city’s criminal justice system, fight inequality and lower the high incarceration rate. “Today, we start the long road towards trading jails and trading death row for schools,” Krasner said. “Today, we trade fear for sanctuary.” A civil rights defense attorney with a history of suing the Philadelphia Police Department, Krasner was elected as the city’s top prosecutor in November, defeating Republican opponent Beth Grossman. Krasner, who has been applauded by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and other progressives for his calls for reform and strong stance against capital punishment, said Tuesday that everyone deserves protection, support and a second chance. He spoke of human potential being lost due to incarceration, and of how the current system impacts residents across the city — from the police officer to the young student to the mother of a heroin addict. “Today we start the long road towards trading division between police and the communities they serve for unity and reconciliation and cooperation, all of which make us safer,” he said. Along with not pursuing death sentences, Krasner has said he will end the city’s use of cash bail and its controversial “stop and frisk” policy.

His duty as a “technician” of that movement, he said, is “to seek justice in society.” “That requires us to communicate the truth, to represent the public and to exercise power with restraint, with our roots dug deep in the rich soil of equality,” he said. “That’s what we need to do.” Krasner replaces Kelley Hodge, who has been serving as acting district attorney since July, when she replaced Seth Williams. Williams announced in February that he would not seek a third term and was later indicted on 29 federal fraud charges involving campaign funds and other financial disclosures. He pleaded guilty to a bribery charge and was sentenced in October to five years in prison.

Many more retail outlets will open in the months to come. “This was another milestone in California’s voter-approved efforts to be smarter and more cost-effective about preventing real crime,” Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) told HuffPost. ”Now it’s time for California to transition a billion-dollar industry largely existing in the shadows of the black market into a tracked, traced, taxed and tightly regulated system.” California, the most populous U.S. state, began the nation’s medical marijuana trend in 1996, and holds an outsized influence in national policy as it begins recreational marijuana sales under an initiative approved by voters in 2016. The state’s new recreational marijuana industry has a projected value of as much as $7 billion ― enough to make it the world’s largest legal marijuana market ― and is predicted to eventually generate $1 billion annually in local and state tax revenue. One of the few shops to obtain a permit to begin Jan. 1 sales of recreational marijuana was Berkeley Patients Group, in Berkeley, the oldest medical marijuana dispensary in the nation. “We are thrilled to be one of the first recipients of a state license and are thankful for the opportunity to now serve quality cannabis to a larger community in a safe and welcoming environment,” Étienne Fontán, vice president and director of the company, told HuffPost. Fontán, a longtime advocate of marijuana legalization, said his shop has been adding inventory for what will likely be a busy day of sales. California produces vast amounts of marijuana, and has done so for years. Now, more than 20 years after the state legalized medical marijuana, 28 other states allow cannabis for medical purposes. Eight states, including California, and the District of Columbia, have also legalized the plant for adult recreational purposes. “California is going to have a major impact on the public’s view of cannabis, not just in the U.S., but around the world,” Mason Tvert, a proponent of progressive drug laws and a partner at VS Strategies, a communications and government relations firm focused on marijuana policy, told HuffPost. “California is our country’s number one tourism destination, with millions of people from around the country and hundreds of thousands from around the world visiting each year. A whole lot of people are going to witness this system. They will see that it works, and they will share their experiences with others back home.” California’s new recreational marijuana law allows adults 21 and older to legally possess up to one ounce of marijuana. Adults can also grow up to six cannabis plants at home for personal use. It remains illegal to openly use marijuana in public, and smoking pot is banned anywhere that tobacco smoking is banned, so recreational consumers will have to enjoy their new rights in private. The law goes beyond the regulation and taxation of marijuana, and aims to repair damage from the country’s failed war on drugs. Individuals with prior marijuana-related convictions that wouldn’t have been a crime under the new law, or would have resulted in a lesser punishment, can petition courts to have their record reclassified, or cleared altogether. As of September, some 4,500 people had petitioned courts to change their marijuana-related sentences. In addition, some local jurisdictions are giving priority or other assistance to marijuana business license applicants previously convicted of low-level marijuana offenses, or who come from low-income communities hit hard by harsh drug-war policies. California’s regulated recreational marketplace begins as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a staunch opponent of marijuana legalization, continues to suggest that a federal crackdown of state-legal marijuana may be in the works. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, but states have pressed ahead with their own laws under Obama administration guidance that urges federal prosecutors to refrain from targeting state-legal marijuana operations. That policy could be reversed or altered by Sessions, who hinted as recently as last month that the Justice Department is looking to make changes. A Sessions task force reviewed the hands-off approach to state laws this year, but its report largely reiterated current policy and did not push for a crackdown, according to The Associated Press. In May, Sessions urged Congress not to renew the federal law that blocks the Justice Department from spending money to interfere with states’ legalization of medical marijuana. Lawmakers rejected his request. President Donald Trump, as a candidate for office, said he would respect states’ rights on the issue. “Federal officials have been engaging in more cannabis-related dialogue than ever with state officials, and it seems like they recognize the catastrophe that would be caused by significantly interfering in state regulatory systems,” Tvert said. “These state laws are working, and it would be very difficult to justify disrupting them.” A recent Gallup poll found that 64 percent of Americans favor making marijuana legal ― the highest since the pollster first posed the question almost five decades ago. Majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents all voiced support for legal marijuana. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Libyan Slave Trade Perpetuates The Commodification Of Black Bodies",
    "text": "The word “slavery” typically evokes images of Civil War-era America, of a time when the North and the South were at each other’s throats and blacks were forced into arduous work without pay or fair treatment. It’s easy to think that slavery ended with the 13th Amendment – but it has simply changed how it operates, continuing to rear its ugly head in less blatant ways. In recent months, however, the most insidious form of slavery as we know it has resurfaced in Libya. That unstable nation is caving in on itself through a brutal civil war, and countless of its citizens are choosing to traverse its dangerous terrains in an attempt to reach the safety of Europe. To do so, they pay exorbitant fees to smugglers who dangle the false prospects of a better life. This journey is reminiscent of the Middle Passage over the Atlantic – though in this case, immigrants believe they are escaping rather than heading toward a life of slavery. For hundreds of people, this has not been the case. Following a lockdown by the Libyan Coast Guard, many of these refugees have been trapped in Libya and, as a result, have been ensnared in the Libyan slave trade. These human beings, who wanted nothing more than to escape hardship, are now being auctioned off like cattle by the very people they entrusted to help them. The slave trade in Libya has become so commonplace that these people are now being sold to do grueling work and be beaten by their “masters” for as little as $400. Have we reverted to those unimaginably horrible days when blacks counted for only three-fifths of a person? Perhaps the most jarring thing about all of this is that this is black-on-black crime. Politics and war have convoluted the minds of Libyans so intensely that they can easily excuse their own people suffering abuse and being turned into commodities. And the alternative is no better – migrants have been raped, robbed, and murdered while trying to get to Europe. We must abandon a wholly misguided notion that has endured in our world for far too long – that black bodies are something to be sold and abused. Black people are human beings whose lives matter just as much as anyone else’s, despite what history would suggest. We have seen this time and time again – black people working to better their lives, only to get shut down and have their worth belittled.

The fact that these stories are only just now coming to light after months of this abhorrent practice makes one thing clear: Though the physical shackles are no longer in use, black people in this world are still chained by the public’s general mindset that black lives are not worth their time, their interest, their concern. Despite America’s divided history, the time has come for us to work together to help these innocent people. This is a human rights issue, not a partisan one. Libya has claimed that it is not responsible for dealing with the influx of immigrants discriminating against their black brothers and sisters, so it is essential that we intervene to help unchain people of color once and for all — lest we have blood on our hands.

    "title": "Higher Fuel Prices And Cold Weather Will Squeeze Heating Assistance",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― After then-President Barack Obama and Republicans in Congress cut funding for a federal program that helps poor people pay utility bills in 2011, warm weather and low fuel prices mitigated the impact of the change. But now, unusually cold weather and rising prices could cut into the benefits that reach only 6 million households, just 16 percent of those eligible. “If this is what the rest of the winter’s going to look like, we’re going to have a tough time,” said Mark Wolfe, head of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association, a lobbying group for state heating assistance programs. Members of Congress from Massachusetts warned on Thursday of a “home heating crisis” in the Northeast, urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to release additional Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funds. “Families in the Commonwealth will soon confront a home heating emergency as LIHEAP funds are exhausted while extreme cold weather continues to strike the region,” the lawmakers, all Democrats, wrote in their letter. “Families in the Northeast are also facing heating fuel prices that are significantly higher than last winter.” Since the early 1980s, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program has helped millions of households heat their homes in winter and cool them in summer. Partly because of higher fuel costs, Congress boosted the program’s funding to $5 billion for 2009 and 2010, then started paring it back after the Obama administration signaled it was willing to sacrifice social spending to cut deals with Republicans. The program currently gets $3.3 billion. “We had a huge spike in energy prices, and the program doubled to $5 billion,” White House budget director Jack Lew said in 2011. “We’re now at a price level that’s close to where we were before that increase.” Energy prices subsequently increased again, bottomed out in early 2016 and are now on the rise once more, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Several relatively mild winters have alleviated the impact of the higher prices in recent years, but 2018 started out unusually cold across most of the U.S. Wolfe said heating oil price increases will effectively reduce the value of federal assistance for home heating costs from 61 percent two years ago to 52 percent today for households that benefit from the program. While the Obama administration supported cuts to heating assistance, the Trump administration proposed getting rid of it entirely as part of an austere budget last year that took funding from safety net programs and gave it to the military. (Most of the budget was a nonstarter on the Hill.) Trump budget director Mick Mulvaney called heating assistance wasteful and cited a Government Accountability Office report from 2010 that found 9 percent of beneficiary households had incorrect information on their applications, including 11,000 Social Security numbers belonging to dead people. “Eleven thousand dead people got this benefit a few years ago,” Mulvaney told Congress in May. “Dead people!” Wolfe said most of the dead people probably had surviving spouses who legitimately qualified for the program. Mulvaney did not mention that Department of Health and Human Services has implemented each of the Government Accounting Office’s six recommendations for improving the integrity of the program. Keith Wilson of Wendell, Minnesota, said he’d called the Minnesota Department of Commerce to request a heating assistance application on Thursday. His utility costs had increased about $50 per month last year. Wilson said it’s been so cold that a pipe froze and burst in his basement last week. The 61-year-old disabled woodworker faulted himself for not keeping the heat high enough in the basement, but said he’s been scraping by on Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. “I had to take out a loan to get a tooth fixed,” he said.

    "title": "Logan Paul 'Dead Body' Video Spurs Thousands To Petition To Get Him Off YouTube",
    "text": "Thousands of people want Logan Paul off their screens. A Change.org petition entitled “Delete Logan Paul’s YouTube Channel,” has garnered more than 190,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon following the YouTuber’s recent “dead body” video, which featured disturbing footage of an apparent suicide victim in Japan’s Aokigahara forest. Paul has since removed the vlog and issued a written and video apology in light of the immense backlash. “A man who had family and friends chose to end his life, and you chose to share his death to your millions of followers without thinking about how his family/friends felt?” the petition reads. “It’s disgusting and shouldn’t be tolerated.” The petition is hardly the only one protesting Paul’s YouTube channel, though it has received more signatures than others on Change.org. Multiple petitions call for YouTube to ban Paul from the platform, citing the vlogger’s disrespect of Japan and its culture and the trivial way suicide was discussed in the video. YouTube previously told HuffPost in a statement that it had issued a Community Guidelines strike to Paul’s channel. When a user has a strike on the account, he or she may not have access to some YouTube features. The strike doesn’t last forever, however, and expires after three months. “Our hearts go out to the family of the person featured in the video,” YouTube said in the statement. “YouTube prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner. If a video is graphic, it can only remain on the site when supported by appropriate educational or documentary information and in some cases it will be age-gated.” The petitions echo the flood of criticism Paul’s received over the week. Even celebrities have chimed in to underscore how insensitive the vlogger’s behavior was, including fellow YouTuber Anna Akana, whose sister died by suicide. Akana questioned Paul’s claim that he’d been trying to spread mental health awareness through the video. Dear @LoganPaul,When my brother found my sister’s body, he screamed with horror & confusion & grief & tried to save her. That body was a person someone loved.You do not walk into a suicide forest with a camera and claim mental health awareness. A Japanese vlogger who goes by the name of Reina Scully also shared her thoughts on the video. Judging by his other vlogs in Japan, she said, Paul seems to think of Japanese people as “caricatures” rather than human beings. “As a Japanese national citizen who grew up in the U.S. with a green card, there were a lot of times where I was treated as though I was really tiny and I was a child,” Scully said. “It’s definitely because I’m foreign. ... It’s definitely alarming in the worst of ways, and after watching some clips of Logan Paul’s other blogs in Japan ... there’s a sliver of what I used to experience of how people used to talk down to me because I was foreign.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "Video Proves Logan Paul Did Many More Utterly Offensive Things In Japan",
    "text": "Social media has been flooded with outrage at Logan Paul’s “dead body” video, which shows an apparent suicide victim in Japan’s Aokigahara forest. Although that video sinks particularly low, it’s not the only insensitive clip the celebrity vlogger filmed in Japan. A compilation video created by YouTuber site We The Unicorns includes a clip of Paul saying, “I just gotta be careful to not, like, disrespect the culture,” along with shot after shot of Paul, well, disrespecting Japanese culture and people. Turns out, Logan Paul's trip to Japan was problematic for many reasons 😡 pic.twitter.com/yhj2BYgk4G In the mashup, mined from Paul’s own vlogs, he is seen gallivanting around in a stereotypical rice hat and robe, walking with his hands held in a prayer position and demeaning Tokyo as a “real live cartoon.” And that’s barely the tip of his mockery. Paul smashes a Game Boy Color at a store and then announces to the attendant that the device is “much-o broken-o.” He throws Poké Balls at people in Japan while screaming “I choose you.” We’re getting serious Jesse Watters’ Chinatown segment vibes. The We the Unicorns compilation went viral on Twitter with about 3.5 million views. Many social media users were appalled at what they saw. Even Chrissy Teigen, who had previously urged people to be more forgiving of Paul, harshly condemned the vlogger after she watched the mashup. tokyo is so fucking beautiful and so fucking kind. so fucking wonderful. there is no place like it in the world. I thought the suicide video was the stupidest thing he did but no. The latest reactions back up what Japanese YouTuber Reina Scully was already saying about Paul. In her own vlog, Scully noted that Paul’s videos suggest he sees Japanese people as “caricatures” rather than human beings. “It’s definitely alarming in the worst of ways, and after watching some clips of Logan Paul’s other blogs in Japan ... there’s a sliver of what I used to experience of how people used to talk down to me because I was foreign,” said Scully, a Japanese national citizen who grew up in the U.S. Others have pointed out that Paul’s insensitive behavior toward Asians has not been confined to his Japanese trip. He has a history of undermining Asians and other people of color, as demonstrated by some of his past tweets shared by actor Jimmy Wong. Hey world. If you didn’t know, @LoganPaul has always been disrespectful and racist towards Asians.This is nothing new. Sadly. pic.twitter.com/Gq1OIbUuoX “Watermelon makes your penis bigger ― black men. Soy increases the estrogen in your body, decreasing penis size ― asians,” Paul wrote in one tweet. In another tweet, he attached a picture of himself holding an unidentified child. “Found this little Asian boy in London,” he wrote. “Named him Isaac.

    "title": "Logan Paul Fans Attack Japanese Vlogger Who Responded To His 'Dead Body' Video",
    "text": "A Japanese vlogger is facing racist attacks for criticizing YouTube celebrity Logan Paul’s recent “dead body” video, which showed disturbing footage of an apparent suicide victim in Japan’s Aokigahara forest. The vlogger, who goes by the name Reina Scully, posted a video citing Paul’s past disrespect of Japanese people and explaining why his clip, which showed him laughing near the unidentified body, was so offensive. Scully, who’s known for her anime reviews, soon faced a barrage of insults from Paul’s fans. She shared a collection of the remarks, which include racist slurs and profanities, on Twitter, receiving more than 6,000 retweets within a day: I want you to see this. pic.twitter.com/Rzpw2NmOIQ “Ching Chang Chung. Shut the fuck up you suicide faggots. Let the japs kill themselves ... LOGANG for LIFE,” one commenter wrote. Another Paul fan commented, “You bitch you don’t have the right to talk about him, you fucking peaces of shit you are just using his name for clickbait fuck you bitch.” In addition to highlighting how dangerously and insensitively Paul handled the subject of suicide, Scully mentions in her video that she’s seen other vlogs of Paul in Japan that suggest he thinks of Japanese people as “caricatures” rather than human beings. “As a Japanese national citizen who grew up in the U.S. with a green card, there were a lot of times where I was treated as though I was really tiny and I was a child,” she said. “It’s definitely because I’m foreign. ... It’s definitely alarming in the worst of ways, and after watching some clips of Logan Paul’s other blogs in Japan ... there’s a sliver of what I used to experience of how people used to talk down to me because I was foreign.” She added that while Aokigahara, which has gained notoriety as the site of many suicides, has been featured in a variety of internet content, it isn’t a tourist destination and shouldn’t be portrayed as such. “It’s one of our sins, and the internet is glorifying one of our darkest issues,” she said. Paul issued an apology after the outcry, saying he was unprepared to encounter a body in the forest. “What we came across in the woods that day was obviously unplanned,” he said, later adding, “I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down.” But Scully said in her video that she doesn’t buy that. Though Paul said he didn’t know how to react to the body in the moment, Scully pointed out that it doesn’t account for his decision to share the video later. She also called for YouTube to take action. “I refuse to accept that as any kind of reasoning whatsoever. Everyone has their videos edited, especially him, who obviously has a whole team working behind his production,” Scully said. “You decide to put that out there. That is the power that YouTube gives us, and you took that power away from yourself by using it as an excuse as to why this all went down. You have no sense of responsibility.” Though many Paul fans attacked Scully, she also received an outpouring of support, including from several fellow YouTubers. Some people agreed that Paul has long made insensitive comments toward Asians and other people of color. Actor Jimmy Wong shared a series of tweets from Paul about black and Asian genitalia and his references to Asians as “little.” Hey world. If you didn’t know, @LoganPaul has always been disrespectful and racist towards Asians.This is nothing new. Sadly. pic.twitter.com/Gq1OIbUuoX YouTube told HuffPost in a statement that it had issued a Community Guidelines strike to Paul’s channel.

    "title": "How Logan Paul's 'Dead Body' Video Explains The Chain Reaction Economy Of YouTube",
    "text": "On Monday, a vlogger uploaded footage to YouTube of what appeared to be the blurred body of a dead man. I don’t mean Logan Paul. Paul is the Vine star turned internet sensation who on Sunday had uploaded the original footage of the body, which he and his video crew had discovered inside Japan’s so-called suicide forest amid their own nervous cackles and bizarre wisecracks. That video had caused righteous and widespread outrage. But this wasn’t that. This was a 10-minute rant titled “Logan Paul Just Ended His Career,” created by a YouTube personality named Kavos. Staring into his webcam, Kavos attacked Paul relentlessly and ruthlessly for the video, calling him “a massive piece of shit” and an “obnoxious, inconsiderate fuck.” (Curious readers can view his whole video on his YouTube page, but we have opted not to embed the video for reasons that will become clear.) “How far is Logan Paul willing to go for some views?” Kavos asked. “You’re literally exploiting a man’s suicide and his death,” he said at another point. Like Paul’s upload, it was a reaction video, this one a reaction to the reaction, through which the internet could embrace its collective anger at Paul’s tasteless response to death ― and it worked. “Logan Paul Just Ended His Career” has received more than 11 million views, or almost double what Paul had garnered on the original video when Kavos decided to create his. “Let me know what you think down below,” Kavos says at the end of his anti-Paul screed. “Please like the video. Share it around ― and let’s expose Logan and the people who think this is right.” Search for Paul’s video on YouTube right now and you won’t find the original. That has been deleted, and Paul has since apologized both in writing and over YouTube. In its place: an ever-growing number of webcam-based reactions to Paul’s actions ― quickly spliced together and often earnest condemnations. To people who didn’t grow up on YouTube, they can look like unappealing wastes of time. But these easy-to-make videos have become the basis of a popular and occasionally profitable corner of the YouTube economy ― a primary reason why so many of them overwhelm YouTube’s search engines at the sound of a trending topic. “This is the first video I’ve seen of you but I agree with everything you said. I like how you analyze everything, you have a new subscriber,” one commenter wrote to another anti-Paul vlogger. This is how the YouTube economy works. Reactions are the stock-in-trade, subscribers and views the coin of the realm ― so much so that a comedy duo reportedly tried to trademark the term “react” last year. One of the earliest versions of the form came back in 2007 in response to a porn trailer unofficially titled “2 Girls 1 Cup,” which, if you haven’t heard of it before, I will not be explaining. “The resulting videos were like a social periscope,” Sam Anderson later wrote in The New York Times. “They allowed people to watch this taboo thing by proxy, to experience its dangerous thrill without having to encounter it directly.” These reaction videos, psychologists say, allow us to fill up on one of the most basic of human emotions: empathy. “When you watch someone react to something with a big response, it’s much easier to empathize with them because you know exactly what they’re feeling,” a clinical psychologist told Ars Technica last year. That feels good. But over time these vloggers have come to so intimately understand the relationship between empathy and engagement that the form has become exploited ― transformed into something else entirely. Now reaction videos often come not from an innocent bystander watching in horror as Paul treks through the woods for the first time but from a fleet of professionalized vloggers ready and willing to create carefully crafted and well-edited videos they know will resonate with YouTube’s audience, leading, if all goes well, to clicking, button-pressing, engagement and an improved personal brand. Paul’s video became another moment for these vloggers, however earnest, to grow their name by working within the same incentive system that caused Paul’s own horrible decision to walk into the Aokigahara forest for clicks. These vloggers aren’t the problem, however. They are simply working in accordance with the incentives set up for them by the platform Paul himself had used to perfection with videos like “REACTING TO JAKE PAUL’S DISS TRACK AGAINST ME!” and “REACTING TO MYSELF BEFORE I WAS FAMOUS!” for his 15 million-plus subscribers. Select All’s Madison Malone Kircher argues that something like Paul’s reaction video was always going to be the endpoint of YouTube culture, but maybe that’s not quite right. The endpoint was always going to be YouTube reacting to something like Paul’s reaction video. Kavos’ video, however, proved much more successful than any of the other reactions to Paul’s mistake, likely because of one significant difference between his and theirs. Interspersed with the vlogger’s morally sound vitriol was a not insignificant portion of the exact video Kavos was criticizing ― nearly raw footage of Paul and his friends belittling a death. “I need to show this next part of the vlog,” Kavos says. “And it’s a horrible, horrible thing to see, and I’m going to blur it a lot more ― I’m going to blur it way more than Logan did because he didn’t blur it enough. But you get it ― it’s a dead body. Just have a look at what he does.” YouTube explained in a statement about Paul’s original video that graphic footage “can only remain on the site when supported by appropriate educational or documentary information.” That’s no doubt why YouTube has blocked people who have tried to upload the version of Paul’s video full stop, and why at least some of the vloggers opted not to include it (another clear reason: genuine sensitivity). But Kavos walked a fine line, unfurling his disgust while providing the hard-to-find original footage — the disgusting stuff. Wrote one commenter: “From 3k average sub’s a day to 75k yesterday... Good to see Kavos finally getting some decent recognition. Kudos and keep up the good work!” “[S]omeone did bad and time for you to make money.congrats 10M,” another wrote. But others weren’t so impressed, calling Kavos “disgusting” for creating a video that included the footage of a blurred dead body “for the same reason, views.” “What is Youtube coming to,” ask one commenter. “It makes me laugh as soon as someone does something wrong everyone creates a video about it to gain views and subs unbelievable.” The reaction must have not been intense enough to make Kavos think twice, however, or to ignore the golden vlogger rule of “react first, think later.” Because on Wednesday, he returned to YouTube to upload another video.

    "title": "YouTube Star Logan Paul Sparks Outrage With Disturbing 'Dead Body' Video",
    "text": "YouTuber Logan Paul is facing a backlash for posting disturbing footage of what appeared to be a man who had killed himself. The 22-year-old vlogger shared the now-deleted 15-minute video titled “We Found A Dead Body in Japan’s Suicide Forest” on his popular YouTube channel Sunday. It showed Paul discovering the young man in the Aokigahara forest on the slopes of Mt. Fuji in Japan. The forest is the world’s second most popular suicide location, per Atlas Obscura. Paul’s non-monetized clip racked up 6 million views in its first 24 hours online. “Breaking Bad” star Aaron Paul (no relation) was among the hundreds of people to condemn the clip: Dear @LoganPaul,How dare you! You disgust me. I can't believe that so many young people look up to you. So sad. Hopefully this latest video woke them up. You are pure trash. Plain and simple. Suicide is not a joke. Go rot in hell.Ap I have absolutely no respect for Logan Paul. His attitude and methods of gaining success have never felt right to me, and his actions today were disgusting. Especially when he has SO many viewers (a lot of kids) who look up to him. suicide is not a joke.suicide is not a way to gain views.suicide is not to be taken lightly.what logan paul did is not acceptable.if you’re struggling, please take your health seriously and please seek help. your life is worth so much. you are worth so much. Logan Paul is trash. This is a fact. Suicide isn’t a joke of any sort & the fact that Logan Paul made a video & publicly posted a dead person to millions of young fans then had the nerve to laugh and joke after .. it’s fucking sickening if you support that then you’re just as sick & twisted Suicide is serious. People have lost loved ones, idols, hero’s, fans to suicide. Filming a video and mocking a victim is not raising suicide awareness. Laughing at the body of a poor depressed soul. I can’t believe the disrespect of the victim, their family, and your YOUNG fans. Paul later issued an apology via Twitter, and claimed he thought he “could make a positive ripple on the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity.” “That’s never the intention. I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention,” he added. Read the full statement below: Dear Internet, pic.twitter.com/42OCDBhiWg “Game of Thrones” actress Sophie Turner slammed his justification: @LoganPaul You’re an idiot. You’re not raising awareness. You’re mocking. I can’t believe how self-praising your “apology” is. You don’t deserve the success (views) you have. I pray to God you never have to experience anything like that man did. Other Twitter users are now calling for all of Paul’s videos to be deleted from YouTube, where he has 15 million subscribers: Can we start 2018 by removing all Logan Paul content from the internet? If you even attempt to defend Logan Paul’s actions, you need to re-evaluate yourself. Absolutely disgusting. Get this man off YouTube. logan paul gotta go 👋🏼 We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "New K-Pop Music Video Praised As Celebration Of LGBTQ Love",
    "text": "Fans are applauding K-pop girl band LOOΠΔ for breaking barriers with its newest music video, “Heart Attack.” The video, released last week, shows the group’s newest member, Chuu, pining for her fellow bandmate Yves’ affection. With LGBTQ love rarely seen in the K-pop industry, fans took the video as a monumental statement. In less than a week, the video has racked up more than 500,000 views. the kpop industry is kinda known for completely shutting down and shying away from anything lgbt,, but then loona comes around and makes a whole ass music video about the newest member falling in love with another female member. i love unique and accepting legends The video doesn’t explicitly mention that the pair is together or that either of them identifies as LGBTQ. Still, fans have taken the chemistry between the two, along with shots of Chuu working to get her bandmate’s attention ― and their closeness near the end of the clip ― as evidence of their love in the music video. The clip’s YouTube description also mentions that the single is about Chuu’s “desire to be loved by Yves.” “The titled track “Heart Attack” does not interpret the feelings of being in love in a serious way, but with Chuu’s own adorable emoticon-like ways,” the YouTube description reads. Of course, social media users had a lot to say after the music video’s release. I think this new unit of loona members might be set on supporting lgbt both yves and chu's music videos and songs seem to promote comfort in yourself and who you choose to love that's really cute & a great message new LOONA solo is the lgbt+ bop we all deserve for 2018 Each LOONA mv is more perfect than the previous one, each one is unique and beautiful. ♥We have a soft lesbian story in this one, a soft love between two lovely girls, and that's so pretty and meaningful !https://t.co/P1NZKwRNOW The video is particularly noteworthy given the state of LGBTQ rights in South Korea. The country has made strides in accepting the gay community, with a record number of people showing up for Seoul’s annual pride festival. However, same-sex marriage has not yet been legalized. And just last year, a watchdog group reported that the military had launched a “witch hunt” to prosecute gay soldiers after a video emerged showing two male soldiers having sex. “Military investigators used the information they gained from the investigation on the sex video to track down other gay soldiers in the army, starting by forcing the suspects to identify who they had sex with and then widening their search from there,” Lim Tae-hoon, head of the Military Human Rights Center for Korea, told The Associated Press. The country’s president, Moon Jae-in, came out in opposition to homosexuality and the legalization of same-sex marriage while on the campaign trail, angering LGBTQ rights activists.

    "title": "U.S. Rabbi Rips Lorde For 'Anti-Semitic' Israel Concert Boycott In Washington Post Ad",
    "text": "New Zealand Grammy-winning pop star Lorde has been blasted as a “bigot” by a controversial U.S. rabbi for dropping a planned concert in Israel to protest the nation’s treatment of Palestinians. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach and his World Values Network harshly criticized the 21-year-old singer in a full-page ad in The Washington Post that appeared Sunday, saying she was joining a “global anti-Semitic boycott of Israel.” The New Jersey-based Orthodox rabbi — who’s a regular contributor to Breitbart News and once served as Michael Jackson’s spiritual adviser — added that “21 is young to be a bigot.” The ad states: “Tell Lorde and her fellow bigots that Jew-hatred has no place” in the 21st century. The ad also accuses “New Zealand and Lorde” of ignoring Syria “to attack Israel” because the singer will perform in Russia, which backs Syria’s Assad regime. New Zealand singer Lorde has been called a “bigot” in a full-page newspaper advertisement in The Washington Post for cancelling her concert in #Israel. pic.twitter.com/6wS1bwZzJv The ad claims that a “growing prejudice against the Jewish state” in New Zealand is “trickling down to its youth.” As evidence, Boteach pointed to a United Nations resolution last month backed by 127 countries — including New Zealand — calling on the U.S. to rescind its recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Lorde last month canceled a concert she had planned in Tel Aviv for June after she was contacted by two New Zealand activists, one Jewish and one Palestinian, who urged her to do so to press for Palestinian rights as part of the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel founded in 2005. “I have had a lot of discussions with people holding many views, and I think the right decision at this time is to cancel the show,” Lorde wrote last month. “I’m not too proud to admit I didn’t make the right call on this one. Tel Aviv ... I’m truly sorry to reverse my commitment to come play for you. I hope one day we can all dance.” Here is @Lorde's statement on the cancellation of her Tel Aviv show, via Israeli PR for the concert. pic.twitter.com/Ph0uGHRjCV Lorde hasn’t yet responded to Boteach’s ad. Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev last month also urged Lorde to reconsider her decision to cancel the concert. Boteach, who calls himself “America’s rabbi,” said in a video on his Facebook page defending the ad that “Israel’s not perfect.” But given its situation, it’s “arguably the most just and most humanitarian country in the world,” he said. In 2015, Boteach (who has written for The Blog in HuffPost) also took out a full-page ad in The New York Times accusing then-national security adviser Susan Rice of having a “blind spot” concerning genocide — both the “Jewish people’s and Rwanda’s” genocide. The ad was blasted by several Jewish groups, and Boteach later apologized. Ad suggesting @AmbassadorRice has a blind spot for genocide is outrageous. The rabbi, whose organization receives funds from right-wing Donald Trump backer and casino owner Sheldon Adelson, has defended former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon against charges of anti-Semitism by the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt.

    "title": "LA District Attorney Considering Charges Against Harvey Weinstein, James Toback",
    "text": "The Los Angeles District Attorney’s office is considering sex-crimes charges against Hollywood heavyweights Harvey Weinstein and James Toback, according to two reports. Results of Beverly Hills police investigations into two sexual assault complaints against Weinstein were “under review” by prosecutors, Greg Risling, a spokesman for the DA’s office, told The Hollywood Reporter. The Los Angeles Times reported the DA’s office also is reviewing police investigations into five complaints against Toback. Weinstein, a now-disgraced producer, has been accused of sexual harassment, assault and rape by more than 80 women. Toback, once a high-flying producer and screenwriter, has been accused by over 300 women of sexual harassment. Beverly Hills police confirmed to HuffPost that Weinstein is under investigation in two cases, but declined to comment further. The DA’s office did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment. In addition to the cases involving Weinstein, prosecutors are reviewing five investigations related to Toback, according to the LA Times. Beverly Hills police submitted results of three investigations on Dec. 18, and Los Angeles police forwarded two on Dec. 28, Variety reported. Los Angeles police confirmed to HuffPost that Toback is under investigation, but declined to elaborate. Both Weinstein and Toback have vehemently denied accusations against them. Weinstein’s lawyers, Blair Berk and Ben Brafman, said in a statement to media outlets in December that Weinstein “never at any time committed an act of sexual assault.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Nonetheless, to those offended by Mr. Weinstein’s behavior, he remains deeply apologetic.” Six women brought a class-action lawsuit against Weinstein and his movie studio Weinstein Co. in December. Weinstein also reportedly remains under investigation for alleged sexual assaults in New York, London and Los Angeles.

    "title": "'Love & Hip Hop' Star Puts Music Producer In His Place After He Says Afros Aren't Elegant",
    "text": "“Love & Hip Hop: Miami” star  Amara La Negra isn’t going to let anyone in the music industry tell her who she is or how she should look. The Dominican-American singer clapped back at music producer Elijah “Young Hollywood” Sarraga during a meeting at his North Miami studio to discuss collaborating, which was shown in the first episode of the VH1 series on Monday. At the start of their conversation, Sarraga tells the Afro-Latina singer that he needs her to “look a certain way.” When Amara asks what that would be, he says she should look “a little bit more Beyoncé, a little less Macy Gray.” “You have to be more sensual,” says Sarraga, who is Latino himself. “You could see Beyoncé just like this soul sista, the same way you could see her come in a beautiful gown, elegant, breathtaking.” “So I can’t be elegant if I have a ’fro? Is that what you’re saying?” Amara quickly asks, to which Sarraga responds, “Yes, I guess.” “Not all Latinas look like J.Lo or Sofía Vergara or Shakira, so where are the women that look like myself?” Continuing to demean the singer’s identity, Sarraga questions what it means to be Afro-Latina ― “Are you African? Or is that just because you have an Afro?” ― and suggests she is “a little intense about this whole African thing.” At one point, the music producer says the industry is ultimately looking for “cookie-cutter poster” children. In response, Amara reminds him that all Latinos don’t look the same. In fact, it’s an ethnicity with a rich racial diversity. “Not all Latinas look like J.Lo or Sofía Vergara or Shakira, so where are the women that look like myself?” she asks. The altercation only escalates from there, ending with Amara walking out of the studio. In the later confessional, Amara says she is “extremely proud of my brown skin. I’m proud of my color, of the way my hair curls. I’m proud of who I am, and nobody’s gonna take that away from me.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Amara has already signed a multi-album deal with Fast Life Entertainment Worldwide and BMG, Billboard reported on Tuesday. “I’m still in shock!” Amara told Billboard in a statement. “At times, I am caught pinching myself because there is a part of me that still is in awe of being signed to a franchise that will heighten my success. ...

    "title": "'Love & Hip Hop' Star Amara La Negra Shuts Down Trolls Saying She's In Blackface",
    "text": "“Love & Hip Hop: Miami” star Amara La Negra is both black and Latina, a concept many online trolls can’t quite seem to grasp. The Miami-born Dominican singer first addressed social media comments that she is donning blackface during a live interview with The Shade Room on Monday. When host Angelica Nwandu asked Amara her thoughts on what some people are saying, the proud Afro-Latina said it was really important for her to “educate and inform people about Afro-Latinos” while on the reality show. But it seems the issue didn’t end there. On Thursday, the singer once again addressed accusations that she wears blackface by posting an adorable throwback video of herself participating in a beauty pageant when she was a child. A post shared by A  M  A  R  A \"LA NEGRA\" (@amaralanegraaln) on Jan 4, 2018 at 5:53am PST “Well Yea I guess I was Born in a ‘Black Face Body!,’” Amara wrote in the Instagram caption for the video. “Its funny that I even have to go through this and show you baby pictures or videos to prove to blogs and people on social media that my skin color is not airbrushed or spray tanned nor do I take melanin shots to be black!” However, there has been at least one incident of someone imitating the singer in blackface. In 2016, former Dominican beauty queen Geisha Montes de Oca took the stage on the variety show “Aquí Se Habla Español” wearing blackface, an Afro wig and padding to make her butt look bigger. Amara reposted an image of Montes de Oca on Instagram with the question: “What did you all think?” The “Love & Hip Hop” star has also had to face people questioning her Afro-Latino identity before. In the first episode of the series, which debuted on Monday, the singer goes head-to-head with music producer Young Hollywood about her image.

During the altercation Amara reminds him that “not all Latinas look like J.Lo or Sofía Vergara or Shakira, so where are the women that look like myself?” The singer may have walked out of Young Hollywood’s studio that day, but this week she walked right into a multi-album deal with Fast Life Entertainment Worldwide and BMG.

    "title": "Making Climate An All-American Issue",
    "text": "It is both dangerous and wrong when an issue that affects the well-being of all Americans ― no matter who they are, or where they live, or whether they are rich or poor ― is partisan and ignored by the two political parties. For that reason, Republican and Democrat leaders should make a new year’s resolution that 2018 will be the year they cooperate to deal with America’s most critical environmental issues, chief among them global climate change. Let’s trim away the fat that makes the politics of environment seem so complicated. We all breathe. So why should clean air be a partisan issue? Fresh water is essential to life. So why should clean water be politicized? We all deserve the opportunity for the spiritual nourishment that America’s natural treasures can give us. Our children deserve that opportunity, too. In fact, it is every generation’s obligation to preserve “America the beautiful”. So why should keeping those treasures off limits for oil, gas and other development be a Republican or Democrat issue? Most obvious of all, every one of us is affected by the weather. Whether we live where sea levels are rising on the coasts; or we make our living by feeding America; or we want our homes, businesses and most treasured possessions to be protected from unprecedented floods and wildfires; or we do not want our loved ones threatened by suffocating heat waves and unbearable cold, we all depend on the weather to be reasonably stable and safe. So, why should global climate change be a Democrat versus Republican issue? The high temperatures expected as a result of global climate change will negatively affect farm yields and heat-related deaths, already the No. 1 weather-related killer in the United States. The study published in Science estimates that every county between El Paso, Texas, and Charlotte, North Carolina, could see its mortality rate rise to nearly twice the deaths from automobile accidents. The answer to each of these questions is that issues so vital to the health and future of America should never have been partisanized. Nor should Democrats and Republicans be imprisoned by the generalizations that the former are environmentalists and the latter believe that growing the economy is always more important than protecting ecosystems and habitats. There are reasons that those generalizations are not always fair today. First, there are many conservative individuals and organizations who are deeply committed to the environment, and there are Democrats who are not. Second, we have reached a point at which environmental stresses are so severe that the health of the economy itself is threatened, including jobs, entire industries and government budgets. It has never been accurate to think that the economy and environment are disconnected from one another. Agriculture cannot function in sustained drought. Businesses, communities and families cannot function without fresh water. Weather disasters are pushing families into debt and governments into deficit spending. Moreover, the protection and preservation of ecosystems in the United States has itself become a significant source of jobs and GDP. Research shows, in fact, that the benefits of environmental regulations so often opposed by conservatives far exceed their costs. The need for all of us to actively break down political stereotypes came to mind as I read a story this week by E&E reporter Zack Colman. “Environmental groups are at odds about how to treat a growing number of Republicans who are speaking out on climate change,” Colman writes. Examples include the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in the House of Representatives; 31 of its members are Republicans and 31 are Democrats. Organizations ranging from ConservAmerica to the Evangelical Environmental Network have shown strong commitments to climate action, although for different reasons. Groups like Young Conservatives for Energy Reform focus on clean energy. Senior Republican thought leaders such as Hank Paulson and James Baker of the Climate Leadership Council are pushing for carbon pricing. Colman reports that some environmental leaders are willing to work with conservatives and Republicans like these. Others are skeptical, while others want to see Republicans prove their commitment to climate action. The Sierra Club’s Executive Director Michael Brune says, “When they prove themselves to be reliable and courageous champions for the environment, then (they) would have their shot at earning the Sierra Club’s support.” The initiative I lead ― the Presidential Climate Action Project ― has a bipartisan national advisory committee that includes the leaders of ConservAmerica and the Evangelical Environmental Network (Rob Sisson and the Rev. Mitch Hescox respectively) as well as former environmental leaders who have served under Republican and Democrat presidents. My personal experience has removed any doubts I might have had about the sincerity of conservatives who understand both the potentials and the need to act on climate change. So, how might other conservatives, liberals, Republicans and Democrats increase their confidence that they are allies against global warming? Here are some suggestions: First, all should publicly dismiss and distance themselves from Donald Trump’s absurd claim that climate change is a hoax. Second, all should work for the restoration of the most important climate-action plans put in place by President Obama and systematically revoked or banished to legal limbo by the Trump Administration. Members of the Climate Solutions Caucus should introduce and work tirelessly for passage of an omnibus bill that not only restores many of these plans, but gives them the status of law. This would create greater stability in federal policies, which would encourage more private investment in the technologies necessary to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Third, Republicans and Democrats alike should twist Trump’s arm to abandon his plan to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump should restore America’s leadership in fighting climate change with U.S. technologies. Members of the Climate Solutions Caucus should engage Trump in a negotiation over what America’s promise to other countries will be under the Paris accord. Fourth, the Climate Solutions Caucus should agree on a bipartisan approach to carbon pricing and push publicly and relentlessly to pass the legislation to implement it. Fifth, climate advocacy groups should help Republicans frame their commitment to climate action in ways that are consistent with the goals and values of traditionally conservative and faith-based organizations. For example, carbon pricing is a market-based approach to climate action ― an approach that would make many federal regulations unnecessary. Sixth, climate action advocates from both parties should frame next November’s midterm election as the America’s referendum on national, state and local climate action. The Pew Research Center has found that 55 percent of Americans rank the environment as a top policy issue that Trump and Congress should tackle. Only defending the country from terrorist attacks and strengthening the economy ranked higher. National organizations from leaders from both political parties should make clear to the American people that clean energy technologies and climate action are critical to a strong economy and to America’s security from terrorism.

An Associated Press poll found in August that 70 percent of respondents said that climate change is underway and 61 percent including 43 percent of Republicans said the government needs to tackle it. Even more Republican voters will back climate action when they see their leaders do so, and more Republicans in Congress will feel it’s safer to support climate action after their colleagues have done so. There is no avoiding the fact that this year will be politically charged because of the midterm elections this November. Republicans are intent on maintaining control of Congress and Democrats believe they have a chance to win it back. But this could – and should – be the election year in which our politicians work together on the environmental issues that are so obviously important to the health, welfare, economic security and resilience of our communities and the nation.

    "title": "Paul Manafort Sues Special Counsel Robert Mueller, DOJ Over Russia Probe",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort filed suit against special counsel Robert Mueller, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and the Department of Justice on Wednesday ― a suit that experts quickly said has little chance of success. In his complaint, Manafort alleges that Mueller’s investigation “diverged from its focus on alleged collusion between the Russian government and President Trump’s campaign.” “The investigation of Mr. Manafort is completely unmoored from the Special Counsel’s original jurisdiction to investigate ‘any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump,’” the complaint reads. “It has instead focused on unrelated, decade-old business dealings — specifically, Ukraine political campaign consulting activities of Mr. Manafort.” “The lawsuit is frivolous but the defendant is entitled to file whatever he wants,” a Justice Department spokesperson told HuffPost in an email. Manafort and his business associate Rick Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury in October and were charged with a dozen counts involving money laundering, failure to file foreign bank reports, and false statements. Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former director of the FBI, to the position of special counsel looking into the Trump campaign’s alleged dealings with Russia back in May. Rosenstein had been overseeing the Russia probe after Attorney General Jeff Sessions had recused himself from the investigation. The lawsuit, filed by the same attorney representing Manafort in his felony criminal case, contends that Rosenstein’s appointment order gave Mueller “carte blanche to investigate and pursue criminal charges in connection with anything he stumbles across while investigating, no matter how remote from the specific matter identified as the subject of the Appointment Order.” “I’ll hand it to Manafort’s lawyers: they’re good at convincing their client to spend money on filings that will go absolutely no where,” tweeted Matt Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman during the Obama administration.

Vladeck said then that special counsel regulations don’t raise the same issues as independent counsels, which came under scrutiny for going outside their mandate and allowing another branch of government ― the legislative branch ― to oversee the workings of the executive branch. A special counsel was much “less of an intrusion” than an independent counsel, Vladeck said, and “the scope of the Special Counsel’s investigative jurisdiction is entirely within the control of the Attorney General; and the Attorney General retains the power to oversee the Special Counsel’s investigation — as provided by the Executive Branch’s own regulation, rather than congressional mandate.” Read the suit in full below.

    "title": "Staff Interacted Several Times With Vegas Mass Shooter, Hotel Says",
    "text": "The staff at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas either interacted with mass shooter Stephen Paddock or entered his room at least 10 times before the night he killed 58 people at a music festival from his suite, a hotel representative has reportedly revealed. The day of the October attack, Paddock had a room service delivery and a housekeeping call, the hotel said. It wasn’t clear, however, if anyone entered Paddock’s room that day, or, if they did, what they saw. The revelation was made by a hotel representative responding to questions from the Las Vegas Review-Journal concerning reports that Paddock had hung a “do not disturb” sign on his door for three days as he prepared for his massacre. The hotel has come under fire for apparently failing to check on a guest who turned out to be a mass killer. Paddock, 64, fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition on concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Festival from the broken window of his 32nd-floor corner suite at Mandalay Bay on Oct. 1. He then killed himself. He had an additional 4,000 rounds in his room along with an arsenal of weapons. It’s not clear what his motive was. A representative of MGM Resorts, which owns Mandalay Bay, emailed the information on Paddock interactions after the newspaper asked if changes were being considered to hotel policies on entering rooms without a guest’s consent. “Mandalay Bay staff, room service and housekeeping had contact with [Stephen] Paddock or entered his suite more than ten times over the course of his stay, including the three days leading up to October 1. As a result of these interactions, there was no need to conduct a welfare check” on Paddock, the representative said in an email Friday. “There were numerous interactions with Stephen Paddock every day at the resort, including a room service delivery and a call with housekeeping on October 1, all of which were normal in nature.” The representative did not respond to further requests to elaborate on details of the interactions or what staff may have observed. The spokesperson said the do-not-disturb policy had not changed. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

A spokeswoman did not link the change to the Vegas mass shooting but told the Review-Journal it did so for safety, security and guest experience.

    "title": "Mapping A World From Hell",
    "text": "He left Air Force Two behind and, unannounced, “shrouded in secrecy,” flew on an unmarked C-17 transport plane into Bagram Air Base, the largest American garrison in Afghanistan. All news of his visit was embargoed until an hour before he was to depart the country. More than 16 years after an American invasion “liberated” Afghanistan, he was there to offer some good news to a U.S. troop contingent once again on the rise. Before a 40-foot American flag, addressing 500 American troops, Vice President Mike Pence praised them as “the world’s greatest force for good,” boasted that American air strikes had recently been “dramatically increased,” swore that their country was “here to stay,” and insisted that “victory is closer than ever before.” As an observer noted, however, the response of his audience was “subdued.” (“Several troops stood with their arms crossed or their hands folded behind their backs and listened, but did not applaud.”) Think of this as but the latest episode in an upside down geopolitical fairy tale, a grim, rather than Grimm, story for our age that might begin: Once upon a time ― in October 2001, to be exact ― Washington launched its war on terror. There was then just one country targeted, the very one where, a little more than a decade earlier, the U.S. had ended a long proxy waragainst the Soviet Union during which it had financed, armed, or backed an extreme set of Islamic fundamentalist groups, including a rich young Saudi by the name of Osama bin Laden. By 2001, in the wake of that war, which helped send the Soviet Union down the path to implosion, Afghanistan was largely (but not completely) ruled by the Taliban. Osama bin Laden was there, too, with a relatively modest crew of cohorts. By early 2002, he had fled to Pakistan, leaving many of his companions dead and his organization, al-Qaeda, in a state of disarray. The Taliban, defeated, were pleading to be allowed to put down their arms and go back to their villages, an abortive process that Anand Gopal vividly described in his book, No Good Men Among the Living. It was, it seemed, all over but the cheering and, of course, the planning for yet greater exploits across the region. The top officials in the administration of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were geopolitical dreamers of the first order who couldn’t have had more expansive ideas about how to extend such success to ― as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld indicated only days after the 9/11 attacks ― terror or insurgent groups in more than 60 countries. It was a point President Bush would reemphasize nine months later in a triumphalist graduation speech at West Point. At that moment, the struggle they had quickly, if immodestly, dubbed the Global War on Terror was still a one-country affair. They were, however, already deep into preparations to extend it in ways more radical and devastating than they could ever have imagined with the invasion and occupation of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and the domination of the oil heartlands of the planet that they were sure would follow. (In a comment that caught the moment exactly, Newsweek quoted a British official “close to the Bush team” as saying, “Everyone wants to go to Baghdad. Real men want to go to Tehran.”) So many years later, perhaps it won’t surprise you ― as it probably wouldn’t have surprised the hundreds of thousands of protesters who turned out in the streets of American cities and towns in early 2003 to oppose the invasion of Iraq ― that this was one of those stories to which the adage “be careful what you wish for” applies. Seeing War And it’s a tale that’s not over yet. Not by a long shot. As a start, in the Trump era, the longest war in American history, the one in Afghanistan, is only getting longer. There are those U.S. troop levels on the rise; those air strikes ramping up; the Taliban in control of significant sections of the country; an Islamic State-branded terror group spreading ever more successfully in its eastern regions; and, according to the latest report from the Pentagon, “more than 20 terrorist or insurgent groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan.” Think about that: 20 groups. In other words, so many years later, the war on terror should be seen as an endless exercise in the use of multiplication tables ― and not just in Afghanistan either. More than a decade and a half after an American president spoke of 60 or more countries as potential targets, thanks to the invaluable work of a single dedicated group, the Costs of War Project at Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, we finally have a visual representation of the true extent of the war on terror. That we’ve had to wait so long should tell us something about the nature of this era of permanent war. America’s war on terror across the globe (from the Costs of War Project). Click on the map to see a larger version. The Costs of War Project has produced not just a map of the war on terror, 2015-2017 (released at TomDispatch with this article), but the first map of its kind ever. It offers an astounding vision of Washington’s counterterror wars across the globe: their spread, the deployment of U.S. forces, the expanding missions to train foreign counterterror forces, the American bases that make them possible, the drone and other air strikes that are essential to them, and the U.S. combat troops helping to fight them. (Terror groups have, of course, morphed and expanded riotously as part and parcel of the same process.) A glance at the map tells you that the war on terror, an increasingly complex set of intertwined conflicts, is now a remarkably global phenomenon. It stretches from the Philippines (with its own ISIS-branded group that just fought an almost five-month-long campaign that devastated Marawi, a city of 300,000) through South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and deep into West Africa where, only recently, four Green Berets died in an ambush in Niger. No less stunning are the number of countries Washington’s war on terror has touched in some fashion. Once, of course, there was only one (or, if you want to include the United States, two). Now, the Costs of War Project identifies no less than 76 countries, 39 percent of those on the planet, as involved in that global conflict. That means places like Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, and Libya where U.S. drone or other air strikes are the norm and U.S. ground troops (often Special Operations forces) have been either directly or indirectly engaged in combat. It also means countries where U.S. advisers are training local militaries or even militias in counterterror tactics and those with bases crucial to this expanding set of conflicts. As the map makes clear, these categories often overlap. Who could be surprised that such a “war” has been eating American taxpayer dollars at a rate that should stagger the imagination in a country whose infrastructure is now visibly crumbling? In a separate study, released in November, the Costs of War Project estimated that the price tag on the war on terror (with some future expenses included) had already reached an astronomical $5.6 trillion. Only recently, however, President Trump, now escalating those conflicts, tweeted an even more staggering figure: “After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is time to start rebuilding our country!” (This figure, too, seems to have come in some fashion from the Costs of War estimate that “future interest payments on borrowing for the wars will likely add more than $7.9 trillion to the national debt” by mid-century.) It couldn’t have been a rarer comment from an American politician, as in these years assessments of both the monetary and human costs of war have largely been left to small groups of scholars and activists. The war on terror has, in fact, spread in the fashion today’s map lays out with almost no serious debate in this country about its costs or results. If the document produced by the Costs of War project is, in fact, a map from hell, it is also, I believe, the first full-scale map of this war ever produced. Think about that for a moment. For the last 16 years, we, the American people, funding this complex set of conflicts to the tune of trillions of dollars, have lacked a single map of the war Washington has been fighting. Not one. Yes, parts of that morphing, spreading set of conflicts have been somewhere in the news regularly, though seldom (except when there were “lone wolf” terror attacks in the United States or Western Europe) in the headlines. In all those years, however, no American could see an image of this strange, perpetual conflict whose end is nowhere in sight. Part of this can be explained by the nature of that “war.” There are no fronts, no armies advancing on Berlin, no armadas bearing down on the Japanese homeland. There hasn’t been, as in Korea in the early 1950s, even a parallel to cross or fight your way back to. In this war, there have been no obvious retreats and, after the triumphal entry into Baghdad in 2003, few advances either. It was hard even to map its component parts and when you did ― as in an August New York Times map of territories controlled by the Taliban in Afghanistan ― the imagery was complex and of limited impact. Generally, however, we, the people, have been demobilized in almost every imaginable way in these years, even when it comes to simply following the endless set of wars and conflicts that go under the rubric of the war on terror. Mapping 2018 and Beyond Let me repeat this mantra: once, almost seventeen years ago, there was one; now, the count is 76 and rising. Meanwhile, great cities have been turned into rubble; tens of millions of human beings have been displaced from their homes; refugees by the millions continue to cross borders, unsettling ever more lands; terror groups have become brand names across significant parts of the planet; and our American world continues to be militarized. This should be thought of as an entirely new kind of perpetual global war. So take one more look at that map. Click on it and then enlarge it to consider the map in full-screen mode. It’s important to try to imagine what’s been happening visually, since we’re facing a new kind of disaster, a planetary militarization of a sort we’ve never truly seen before. No matter the “successes” in Washington’s war, ranging from that invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 to the taking of Baghdad in 2003 to the recent destruction of the Islamic State’s “caliphate” in Syria and Iraq (or most of it anyway, since at this moment American planes are still droppingbombs and firing missiles in parts of Syria), the conflicts only seem to morph and tumble on. We are now in an era in which the U.S. military is the leading edge ― often the only edge ― of what used to be called American “foreign policy” and the State Department is being radically downsized. American Special Operations forces were deployed to 149 countries in 2017 alone and the U.S. has so many troops on so many bases in so many places on Earth that the Pentagon can’t even account for the whereabouts of 44,000 of them. There may, in fact, be no way to truly map all of this, though the Costs of War Project’s illustration is a triumph of what can be seen. Looking into the future, let’s pray for one thing: that the folks at that project have plenty of stamina, since it’s a given that, in the Trump years (and possibly well beyond), the costs of war will only rise. The first Pentagon budget of the Trump era, passed with bipartisan unanimity by Congress and signed by the president, is a staggering $700 billion. Meanwhile, America’s leading military men and the president, while escalating the country’s conflicts from Niger to Yemen, Somalia to Afghanistan, seem eternally in search of yet more wars to launch. Pointing to Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, for instance, Marine Corps Commandant General Robert Neller recently told U.S. troops in Norway to expect a “bigass fight” in the future, adding, “I hope I’m wrong, but there’s a war coming.” In December, National Security Adviser Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster similarly suggested that the possibility of a war (conceivably nuclear in nature) with Kim Jong-un’s North Korea was “increasing every day.” Meanwhile, in an administration packed with Iranophobes, President Trump seems to be preparing to tear up the Iran nuclear deal, possibly as early as this month.

Consider, for instance, a recent report in the New York Times that about 2,000 employees of the Department of Homeland Security are already “deployed to more than 70 countries around the world,” largely to prevent terror attacks. And so it goes in the twenty-first century. So welcome to 2018, another year of unending war, and while we’re on the subject, a small warning to our leaders: given the last 16 years, be careful what you wish for.

Temperatures in New York City hit record lows, hovering around 8 degrees Fahrenheit, which felt like minus 6 degrees Fahrenheit when factoring in windchill. “They told me there would be tea,” Carey said. “Oh, this is a disaster.” The icon then seemed to rally, despite the lack of hot liquids, and assured the crowd that she’d go on. “OK, well we’ll just have to ― I’m just going to be like everybody else with no hot tea. We’re going to try to do this right for you because I just want to show my appreciation for everyone that speaks out for justice and tries to make the world a better place.” She then started singing her 1993 hit, “Hero.” Nevertheless, folks on Twitter had fun commenting on the hot tea moment. “they told me i’d have hot tea” famous last words of 2017- Mariah Carey 😂 MARIAH CAREY ANGRILY RAMBLING ABOUT HOT TEA ON DICK CLARKS NEW YEARS EVE SPECIAL IS THE RIGHT WAY TO ENTER 2018 “I was told there would be tea,” -@MariahCarey at #RockinEve I’m using that line every time I’m disappointed in 2018.

    "title": "Marijuana Industry Not Freaking Out Over Threat Of Federal Crackdown",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― The marijuana industry and its advocates collectively held their breath this week following the release of new Justice Department guidance that gave federal prosecutors the go-ahead to aggressively pursue state-legal marijuana operations. But just a day after the decision, many experts are cautiously optimistic that their initial fears of a crackdown were overblown. In an announcement Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions officially reversed a set of Obama-era memos that had advised federal prosecutors in legal weed states to de-prioritize marijuana cases. Although the new guidance gives significant authority to U.S. attorneys in the eight states that have already legalized marijuana, the practical effect of the decision will ultimately depend on how they exercise it ― if they do at all. “The rescission of the [memos] doesn’t affect the industry at all. What affects the industry is when DEA agents start kicking down doors and U.S. attorneys begin prosecuting people,” said marijuana expert John Hudak, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy think tank. And there’s little reason to believe federal authorities will take Sessions up on the invitation to reignite the war on state-legal marijuana, said Patrick Moen, a former Drug Enforcement Administration official who now serves as general counsel for Privateer Holdings, a private equity firm that invests in marijuana companies. “I still keep in touch with a lot of my former colleagues, and they are almost universally uninterested in maintaining cannabis prohibition,” Moen said. “The majority of U.S. attorneys feel similarly.” Senior Justice Department officials who briefed reporters on the policy change on Thursday faced a barrage of questions about the Sessions memo. They struggled to articulate the message they intended to send to the marijuana industry, with one simply stating the obvious fact that “marijuana continues to be against federal law.” In states where marijuana use is legal, the Sessions memo left people scrambling to ascertain the views of their local U.S. attorney, the top federal prosecutor in each of the nation’s 94 federal districts. The attorneys who spoke out gave little indication that the new guidance would change the status quo, which industry officials took as a positive sign. In many cases, federal prosecutors signaled that they would proceed as they had under Obama-era policy by focusing on issues of marijuana distribution to children, the diversion of marijuana to other states, violence and use of firearms, and using state-authorized marijuana operations as a cover for illegal trafficking. Take a statement issued by Adam Braverman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California. He wrote that the Sessions memo “returns trust and local control to federal prosecutors” and allows DOJ to enforce the laws enacted by Congress, and Braverman noted that marijuana “cultivation, distribution, and possession” has long been against federal law. But his statement also acknowledged cold reality: His office can’t take on everything and would “continue to utilize long-established prosecutorial priorities to carry out our mission to combat violent crime, disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal organizations, and stem the rising tide of the drug crisis.” (U.S. attorneys for California’s other three districts have not yet weighed in.) In Oregon, U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams said his office would continue to place an emphasis on “stemming the overproduction of marijuana and the diversion of marijuana out of state, dismantling criminal organizations and thwarting violent crime in our communities.” In Colorado ― the first state to implement legalized recreational marijuana ― U.S. Attorney Bob Troyer said his office would keep “focusing in particular on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state.” “The rescission of the [memos] doesn’t affect the industry at all. What affects the industry is when DEA agents start kicking down doors and U.S. attorneys begin prosecuting people.” U.S. Attorney Annette L. Hayes of the Western District of Washington noted her office had already been prioritizing cases involving “organized crime, violent and gun threats, and financial crimes related to marijuana,” and said it would continue to focus resources on “those who pose the greatest safety risk to the people and communities we serve.” (Joseph Harrington, her colleague in the state’s Eastern District who is in the office on an interim basis, referred questions to Justice Department headquarters.) In Alaska, U.S. Attorney Bryan Schroder said that no enforcement priorities would change and that his office would continue “combating violent crime, including as it stems from the scourge of drug trafficking.” Halsey B. Frank, U.S. attorney for Maine, said he would consult with his staff before determining how the Sessions memo might affect charging decisions. He also stated his intent to “follow long-established principles to prosecute federal crime, including to combat the current drug crisis.” Perhaps the most opaque statement came from U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling in Massachusetts, who told The Boston Globe that “marijuana is in fact a dangerous drug” and that his office “will continue to investigate and prosecute bulk cultivation and trafficking cases, and those who use the federal banking system illegally.” In Nevada, which voted to legalize cannabis in 2016, interim U.S. Attorney Dayle Elieson has yet to comment. Sessions appointed Elieson on Wednesday, the day before releasing his memo. U.S. attorneys are typically Senate-confirmed presidential nominees and often have political aspirations. It’s by no means a firewall, but marijuana industry officials may take small comfort in the notion that U.S. attorneys by and large might be unwilling to be seen as circumventing the will of voters in their home states, especially now that the cannabis industry is past the startup phase. “Even if they were to wade into some kind of enforcement action, that’s a decision that’s fraught with political peril,” Moen said. “The field offices and the federal prosecutors are local in nature, they live and work in these communities, they are the ones that have to deal with blowback from the local governor’s office, the state attorney general, and they frankly rely on their state and local partners for cooperation as a force multiplier so they can get their jobs done.” It could also prove difficult for a U.S. attorney to obtain a conviction. (Though simply charging and prosecuting individuals who complied with state marijuana laws could send a damaging message, even if cases aren’t successful.) “If the feds begin to go in and arrest business owners, they’re going to go on trial somewhere in that state, and if you have a state like Colorado where something like 60 percent of Coloradans support marijuana reform, it’s probably going to be hard to find 12 jurors without at least one of them thinking the feds are overstepping their bounds,” Hudak said. Although many saw the Sessions memo as largely symbolic, it did mark a clear shift away from the recent trend toward normalizing the marijuana industry. That change was enough to trigger some concern in the cannabis market. “We’re talking with our investors and making clear that as of today nothing has changed. People had questions yesterday about what this meant, but today they’re moving ahead,” said Kevin Conroy, the former deputy attorney general of Massachusetts who now works at a local law firm where he represents prospective marijuana businesses and investors. “We’re talking with our investors and making clear that as of today nothing has changed. People had questions yesterday about what this meant, but today they’re moving ahead.” “It has always been against federal law to dispense marijuana, so anybody who is in this industry by nature is somewhat of a risk taker,” added Conroy. “There has always been uncertainty in this industry. Yesterday’s announcement brought further uncertainty, but how much further uncertainty we just don’t know yet.” But larger financial institutions may be easier to spook. At least a few banks that had been considering getting involved in the marijuana industry appeared unwilling to wait around and see if the announcement would actually lead to concrete action. “I’ve had two large national financial institutions put their efforts to lend capital to California marijuana business on hold,” said Scott Martinez, who served as Denver’s city attorney during the launch of Colorado’s recreational marijuana program before joining local law firm Snell & Wilmer, where he now advises businesses on regulatory issues regarding the cannabis industry. Whether or not a crackdown is coming, the new guidance does make it harder for the financial industry to justify the risk of getting involved in the marijuana business, Martinez said. And that uncertainty alone makes it harder for up-and-coming marijuana companies to get access to the financial resources they need to get off the ground. “For those folks who are already in the marijuana business, it’s going to be business as usual, because they’ve already made the calculation about the risk they want to undertake as a business proposition,” Martinez said. “What yesterday’s announcement really affects in a major way is the new entrants into the marijuana industry, and it affects business partners who may be involved in legal marijuana in the states.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Less Than 1 Ounce Of Marijuana Leads To Arrests Of More Than 60 Georgia Partygoers",
    "text": "At least 63 people were arrested over the weekend on suspicion of possessing less than an ounce of marijuana after police were unable to identify the actual owner of the drug stash found at a house party in Cartersville, Georgia, over the weekend. Cartersville police said they arrived at the party — billed as a lingerie-themed 21st birthday bash, according to WXIA-TV — about 2:20 a.m. Sunday after receiving a 911 call about possible gunshots. Police, who called in the county drug task force to assist in the investigation, said they found two firearms at the scene, including one that had been reported stolen in Detroit, as well as “several smoking devices” and “suspected cocaine.” Officers also found less than an ounce of marijuana, reported the Cartersville Daily-Tribune. When no one admitted to owning the weed, everyone still at the party was arrested. “All the subjects at the residence were placed under arrest for the possession of the suspected marijuana which was within everyone’s reach or control,” said the Bartow Cartersville Drug Task Force in a news release. Citing jail records, the Daily-Tribune reported that 63 people arrested at the party who’d been processed at Bartow County jail by Monday night had all been charged with a single count of possession of less than 1 ounce of marijuana. The individuals arrested were predominantly black males ages 19 to 25. The Daily-Tribune said several of them were “prominent high school athletes.” Four men were also booked on suspicion of felonies not related to drug possession, reported BuzzFeed News. Police said they found less than an ounce of marijuana at a house party Saturday night & since no one claimed it, they arrested 70ppl for it. Some just got out today. Story at 5pm on Ch2 pic.twitter.com/OA2xQFdGX3 Attendees told WXIA that the reported gunshots had been fireworks. Deja Heard, the woman whose 21st birthday was being celebrated at the party, told WSB-TV that “all of us are innocent — it’s just not right.” Some of the arrested partygoers reported being mistreated by police, telling WSB that they were “tied up with zip ties.” and “threatened with tasers.” Several men said they’d been “locked in cages.” The Georgia NAACP said it was launching an investigation into the arrests. The organization has backed a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for the arrested partygoers, described as the “Cartersville 70.” “Some of these young people need money to make bail and all of them need assistance with their legal fees. A good majority of these individuals are college students and members of the U.S. military who were visiting home over the holiday break, and decided to attend a party to catch up with old friends while in town. Others were working citizens who lost their jobs the second they walked into work this morning,” the campaign page reads. “They need your help to bring justice and light to the unjust treatment these individuals experienced leading to and during their incarceration.” BREAKINGNEWS: the NAACP is investigating the acts of Bartow County Law Enforcement in the arrests of 70 people for small possession of marijuana in Cartersville. #NextGenNAACP @wsbtv pic.twitter.com/HdiekV2eOo In nearby Athens, Georgia, black individuals are 4.7 times more likely to be charged with a marijuana violation than white individuals, according to ThinkProgress. Nationwide, a black person is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for a marijuana-related offense compared with someone who is white.

On Tuesday, Cartersville police said in a statement that they would be reviewing a “long-standing” department policy to call the county drug task force during drug investigations. “It has been a long-standing policy of the Cartersville Police Department that drug investigations routine patrol officers encounter are referred to the Bartow Cartersville Drug Task Force. This current policy is now under review for any further drug investigations,” police said.

    "title": "How Medical Racism Created A Black Anti-Abortion Movement",
    "text": "Two years ago, filmmaker Yoruba Richen was shooting footage of an anti- abortion protest in Indiana when she saw signs that would later inspire a full-blown documentary. “Abortion is killing black people,” one sign read. Another declared in big, bold letters that “Margaret Sanger was racist.” After doing some research, Richen found there was an entire network of black activists leading an anti-abortion uprising across the U.S. Their main message was bold and terrifying to her: “The most dangerous place for an African-American child is in the womb.” Richen, an award-winning documentary filmmaker, screenwriter and producer, recently delved into this topic in her short documentary “Anti-Abortion Crusaders: Inside The African-American Abortion Battle,” created in partnership with PBS Frontline and The Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute. The documentary, which was released in December, focuses on the anti-abortion argument that black women are coerced into getting abortions at higher rates than white women. This, in turn, the argument goes, continues the United States’ long history of medical racism by using abortion as a means to black genocide. “Medical racism is a huge issue and it’s something that we haven’t really reckoned with in this country.” “Genocide is a very potent argument in our community because of the history of racism. That’s why this message is able to catch on,” Richen, a black woman herself, told HuffPost in a recent interview. “Medical racism is a huge issue and it’s something that we haven’t really reckoned with in this country.” Richen spoke to people on both sides of the aisle ― from anti-abortion preachers to pro-choice Planned Parenthood physicians ― to find the disconnect in the argument. The messaging, she found, stems from an often-cited and controversial statistic that black women in the U.S. account for 28 percent of reported abortions each year, while making up only 13 percent of the female population. “What I think both pro-lifers and reproductive-righters can agree on is that black women have a larger number of abortions than you would expect when thinking about their share of the population,” reproductive rights historian Cynthia Greenlee notes in Richen’s documentary. “Where we differ is the interpretation.” In addition to this statistic, much of the language used in discussions about racism and anti-abortion ideology originates from the mother of birth control: Margaret Sanger. Sanger created the first birth control clinic in the early 1900s and founded a women’s health organization that would later be known as Planned Parenthood. For all of her accomplishments, however, Sanger is a problematic historical figure: She was a vocal supporter of eugenics, which is the practice of selective breeding. HuffPost sat down with Richen to discuss her documentary and how medical racism and misogyny intersect to create the argument that abortion is black genocide. Can you talk to me more about the different ways this 28 percent statistic is interpreted and how it leads to such a polarizing argument? Black women are having higher numbers of abortions than their population. Just as similarly, and not to compare it, but there are higher numbers of African Americans in lots of things that you can point to such as incarceration rates. The real question that reproductive rights people want to look at is why that’s the case. What is it that is causing those numbers? And it’s everything from lack of sex education, health care access and many, many other causes people have looked into and written about. You can definitely use that statistic in many ways. But as Dr. Raegan [a Planned Parenthood physician interviewed in the documentary] says in the piece, “Let’s not focus on statistics. That’s not the focus. Let’s focus on women getting access to care.” What was it like talking to these people on both sides of the argument, and how do you think racism and misogyny play into this debate? I don’t doubt their sincerity in terms of the fact that they believe what they’re doing is the right thing and it’s the right thing for black people. There is a religion that plays into it, and that religion is patriarchal. A lot of protesters will go up to black women and say, “You’re killing your community. You’re killing your people.” That is what happens at a lot of the anti-abortion protests. Who wants to hear that they’re responsible for the genocide of their community? You can imagine when getting an abortion a woman is making a decision ― whether it’s a tough decision or a liberating decision ― it’s still a deep decision. You may feel shameful. You may not have support from your family. Then add this other cultural argument where people say, “Look what you’re doing to your community.” We as black women have held up our communities for so long, we bear a lot of that responsibility. It compounds this personal decision that may already be difficult with the larger conversation of racism in America. “A lot of protesters will go up to black women and say, 'You’re killing your community. You’re killing your people.'” Do you believe this anti-abortion rhetoric, specifically in the black community, poses a threat to Planned Parenthood? Yes, I do. Planned Parenthood hasn’t historically dealt well with this issue well because Margaret Sanger does have a somewhat checkered history in terms of race. But I think one of the most potent arguments that I heard was that she was a woman of her time. Most white people in the 1920s, like most white people of her time, were actively racist. She definitely had some views and opinions that we would look at today as problematic, but she also did a lot of work around birth control in the South, in black communities and worked with black leaders on this issue. Only recently has Planned Parenthood looked at this complexity as opposed to just kind of ignoring it. Planned Parenthood does come under a lot of threat, as we know. This argument has become a lightning rod and this is just another avenue to attack it, and I think it is effective. What was your takeaway ― as a black female filmmaker ― about this anti-abortion movement that’s embedded itself into small pockets of the black community? This is a movement that is being ignored at our peril. It hasn’t gotten a lot of attention, but I think it actually is potent and effective and it seems to be making inroads within the mainstream abortion movement. Abortion rights are already under attack and this is simply another way to further that cause. [Rapper] Nick Cannon came out recently and said something like “Planned Parenthood is killing black people.” I mean, you have people who believe this stuff, so it’s effective. It’s a movement that should be watched and noted. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Concerns ranged from not knowing how to pump gas to fears of smelling like gas or being attacked by hoodlums. You can read the hilarious fears here.

    "title": "Mercer Family Sides With Trump, Distances Itself From Steve Bannon",
    "text": "Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon has apparently lost the support of billionaire Republican donor and longtime Donald Trump supporter Rebekah Mercer. Mercer made her differences with Bannon clear in a statement to The Washington Post on Thursday. “I support President Trump and the platform upon which he was elected,” Mercer said. “My family and I have not communicated with Steve Bannon in many months and have provided no financial support to his political agenda, nor do we support his recent actions and statements.” Those “recent actions” refer to a falling-out between Bannon and Trump that ignited when an excerpt from journalist Michael Wolff’s upcoming book on the Trump administration was published Wednesday. In the excerpt, Bannon is quoted as saying there’s “zero” chance Trump didn’t meet with Russian operatives during a June 2016 encounter at Trump Tower, which Bannon labeled “treasonous.” An unidentified associate told The New York Times the split between Bannon and the Mercer family was so acrimonious that they cut off funding for his personal security detail. Per a Wall Street Journal report, the board of the far-right Breitbart News is also considering ousting Bannon from his position as executive chairman there. Mercer owns a minority stake in the website. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders encouraged the move during Thursday’s press briefing. “I certainly think that it’s something they should look at and consider,” she said of Bannon’s potential dismissal.

    "title": "Meryl Streep Wonders Why Melania And Ivanka Trump Won't Speak Out About #MeToo",
    "text": "While responding to allegations that she knew for years that film producer Harvey Weinstein had been accused of sexually assaulting multiple women, actress Meryl Streep argued that her critics should instead focus on the deafening silence from the White House ― particularly that of first lady Melania Trump and of first daughter Ivanka Trump, who is also an adviser to the president. “I don’t want to hear about the silence of me,” Streep said in a New York Times interview published Wednesday. “I want to hear about the silence of Melania Trump. I want to hear from her. She has so much that’s valuable to say. And so does Ivanka. I want her to speak now.” Ivanka Trump has only briefly addressed the issue of sexual harassment, saying in November that it “can never be tolerated.” Streep has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump ― who himself has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women ― and pilloried him in a speech at last year’s Golden Globe Awards. The president, who is prone to attacking his critics on Twitter, was quick to respond. He called Streep “over-rated” and “a Hillary flunky,” referring to her support of his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment on Streep’s latest remarks. Last month, a right-wing artist claimed responsibility for hanging up posters in Los Angeles featuring Streep’s face and the words “she knew.” Streep, who worked with Weinstein over the years, told the Times that she stood by her response to the mogul’s downfall and dismissed suggestions that she had previously known about his alleged serial sexual predation. She also said she was surprised to hear that people were criticizing her for not speaking out about the allegations sooner. “I found out about this on a Friday and went home deep into my own life. And then somebody told me that on ‘Morning Joe’ they were screaming that I haven’t responded yet. I don’t have a Twitter thing or ― handle, whatever. And I don’t have Facebook. I really had to think,” Streep told the Times. “Because it really underlined my own sense of cluelessness, and also how evil, deeply evil, and duplicitous, a person he was, yet such a champion of really great work.” “You make movies. You think you know everything about everybody. So much gossip. You don’t know anything. People are so inscrutable on a certain level. And it’s a shock,” she added. “Some of my favorite people have been brought down by this, and he’s not one of them.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Meryl Streep Recalls That Time Dustin Hoffman Slapped Her On Set",
    "text": "Meryl Streep walked away from 1979 film “Kramer vs. Kramer” with her first Academy Award and an uneasy relationship with co-star Dustin Hoffman. In an interview with The New York Times about her new project “The Post” and Hollywood’s recent reckoning with sexual abuse and harassment published Wednesday, Streep recalled a day on set when Hoffman slapped her across the face without warning while filming a scene. “This is tricky because when you’re an actor, you’re in a scene, you have to feel free. I’m sure that I have inadvertently hurt people in physical scenes,” Streep said. “But there’s a certain amount of forgiveness in that. But this was my first movie, and it was my first take in my first movie, and he just slapped me. And you see it in the movie. It was overstepping. But I think those things are being corrected in this moment. And they’re not politically corrected; they’re fixed. They will be fixed, because people won’t accept it anymore. So that’s a good thing.” According to biographer Michael Schulman, who published a book about Streep’s career in 2016, the actor also taunted her about the death of her boyfriend, actor John Cazale, to provoke a reaction for the camera. Streep apparently later forgave his on-set behavior after he apologized. Hoffman has been at the center of multiple allegations of sexual misconduct from women including an intern on on the set of a TV movie and a friend of his daughter’s, both of whom were teenagers at the time. Things came to a head at a contentious panel led by John Oliver last month when the host publicly confronted Hoffman about the groping accusations. While Streep refuses to name other individuals who’ve mistreated her in the film industry, the actress told the Times that she felt “really beaten up” in the early days of her career, when drugs ran rampant on film sets. “I have experienced things, mostly when I was young and pretty. Nobody comes on to me [now]. So I wouldn’t have had that more recently,” she said. “But back in the day, when everybody was doing cocaine, there was a lot of [expletive] behavior that was inexcusable. But now that people are older, and more sober, there has to be forgiveness, and that’s the way I feel about it.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "The Met Museum Is Changing Its Pay-As-You-Wish Admission Policy",
    "text": "Non-New Yorkers officially have less than two months to take advantage of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s pay-as-you-wish admission policy. Tourists will be charged a mandatory entrance fee starting March 1, The Met announced Thursday. The public museum hasn’t charged a mandatory entrance fee for nearly 50 years. Under the updated policy, visitors from outside of New York state will pay what are currently suggested admission prices: $25 for adults, $17 for seniors and $12 for students. Kids under 12 will still get in for free. The museum said New York residents and students from New Jersey and Connecticut will be allowed to follow the current pay-as-you-wish guidance if they can show proof of residence. Under The Met's updated policy, all NY-state residents and NY, NJ, and CT students will remain pay-as-you-wish, all children under 12 remain free, and visitors from outside New York State will be required to pay an admissions fee. https://t.co/m9Uc7nQrPs pic.twitter.com/A1EbmUCa05 The change is expected to affect about 31 percent of the Met’s annual visitors, Daniel H. Weiss, the museum’s president and CEO, wrote Thursday in a blog post. Visits to the museum have increased by more than 40 percent over the last eight years, Weiss said ― but the number of guests paying the full suggested admission fee has declined by 73 percent over the last 13 years. “We are now the only major museum in the world that relies exclusively on a pure pay-as-you-wish system or that does not receive the majority of its funding from the government,” he wrote. “What is clear is that our current pay-as-you-wish policy is no longer sufficient to meet the Museum’s daily operational demands,” he added. “Paid admissions represent only 14 percent of our overall revenue, one of the lowest percentages among our New York City peers.” Weiss said the museum considered its role as an educational resource before making its decision. Still, many critics have argued that the Met should keep its current entrance policy. Hey @NYCMayor pls work to stop this. This will harm young people, families, and folks who aren't of the ownership class. Pay-as-you-go was critical to me as a young person to see art. Why only let the rich have access? https://t.co/KmNKkOFMv7 will NYers now be asked “Papers, please” at the gates of the Met? https://t.co/KLNlMA8ZZB The Metropolitan Museum of Art sits on public land, in a building owned by the city. It's repugnant that the city agreed to this change. Two of The New York Times’ chief art critics voiced their concerns in an lengthy piece on Thursday. “I’m instinctively suspicious of, and resistant to, ‘carding’ procedures, meaning any admission policy based on presenting personal identification, which is what the Met is asking for from New York State residents who want to keep paying what they wish,” art critic Holland Cotter wrote. “This potentially discriminates against a population of residents who either don’t have legal identification or are reluctant to show the identification they have,” he added. “And it plays directly into the hands of the anti-immigrant sentiment that is now poisoning this country. I cannot remember a time when a museum’s unqualified demonstration of ‘doors open to all’ would carry more positive — I would say necessary — political weight. This is my single biggest reservation about the Met’s admission-by-I.D. policy.” Fellow art critic Roberta Smith agreed, saying she worried that the “Met’s plan is classist, and nativist.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

The museum faced a multimillion-dollar budget deficit that was at least partly caused by financial mismanagement.

    "title": "'Fire And Fury' Author Defends Book After Trump Slams It As 'Phony' And 'Full Of Lies'",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Journalist Michael Wolff on Friday said he stands by “Fire and Fury,” his new book about President Donald Trump’s administration that has drawn Trump’s ire and rocked the political world. “My credibility is being questioned by a man who has less credibility than perhaps anyone who has ever walked on earth at this point,” Wolff said of Trump. On NBC’s “Today” show on Friday, in his first interview since the book went on sale at midnight, Wolff defended his reporting, and his descriptions of Trump aides and confidants openly questioning the president’s mental health and stability. Wolff said “100 percent of the people around” Trump raised concerns about his mental fitness for office. “I will tell you the one description that everyone gave,” he said. “They all say he is like a child, and what they mean by that is, he has a need for immediate gratification. It’s all about him.” Trump and the White House have launched a full-scale campaign to discredit Wolff, attacking the book as “complete fantasy” and “tabloid gossip.” On Thursday, an attorney for Trump sent a cease-and-desist letter to the book’s publisher, attempting to halt its release. Later that day, Trump tweeted that he “authorized Zero access” to Wolff, and trashed the book as “phony” and “full of lies.” Book excerpts released this week have widened a rift between the president and former chief strategist Steve Bannon. Trump on Thursday smeared Bannon with the nickname “Sloppy Steve” and appeared to threaten the former aide and Wolff. I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve! Wolff on Friday said he did interview Trump for the book. “I absolutely spoke to the president,” he said. “Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don’t know, but it certainly was not off the record.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

But he affirmed that he is “certainly and absolutely, in every way, comfortable with everything I’ve reported in this book.” Interest in the book skyrocketed in the furor over Bannon’s comments, so the publisher released it Friday morning, ahead of its scheduled publication date next week.

    "title": "Michael Wolff On Donald Trump Exposé: 'I Am Not A Hit Man'",
    "text": "The author of the controversial tell-all book on Donald Trump’s presidency claims he did not pursue the book to take down the president. Instead, journalist Michael Wolff insisted on Friday, he was willing to be proved wrong about Trump’s nefarious reputation ― though that didn’t happen. In an interview with NPR’s “All Things Considered,” Wolff said his intention for Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House was to report everything he saw under the Trump administration. “I’m becoming the poster boy for taking down Donald Trump. That was never my intention,” the journalist told NPR’s Kelly McEvers. “I am not a hit man,” Wolff said. “My intention was to go into the White House and report what I saw and what I heard,” he said. “I thought this was going to be an extraordinary story in whatever way it went. I had no way of knowing what way it would go.” Asked by McEvers whether he still stands by his book, despite Trump and the White House disputing it, Wolff said: “When you write a book like this, people regret what they said to me. What they say to any reporter who they relax with and they forget who they’re talking to, I have sympathy for that, and I think the natural response is to say, ‘Oh, my God, I didn’t say it.’ But I will tell you, they said it.” Wolff’s explosive book, which was released early Friday morning, provides a behind-the-scenes look into Trump’s presidential campaign and administration and his reputation within the White House. Wolff told NPR he spent at least three hours with Trump over the course of his campaign and in the White House. The book includes unsavory anecdotes about Trump, including references to the president’s aversion to reading, administration officials’ incessant leaking to the press and an episode of former chief strategist Steve Bannon calling Donald Trump Jr.’s 2016 meeting with Russian operatives “treasonous.” But the two main issues tackled in the book, Wolff said, were that Trump won’t read anything and Trump won’t listen to anyone. “The two fundamental issues [in the book] were that Donald Trump doesn’t read anything,” said Wolff. “Let me accent that ― anything, nothing.” “Not only does he not read, he doesn’t listen,” he added. “It becomes, from day one, the crisis of the presidency: You can’t tell him anything.” Trump tried to stop Fire and Fury from being released by having his attorney send a cease-and-desist letter to Wolff’s publisher on Thursday. That move spurred Wolff to publish the book four days earlier on Friday instead of its intended release date of Jan. 9. In an attempt to discredit Wolff as a journalist, Trump tweeted Friday that the book was filled with “lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist.” “I authorized Zero access to the White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book,” Trump wrote. “I never spoke to him for book.” Wolff defended himself on NBC’s “Today” on Friday: “I absolutely spoke to the president. Whether he realized it was an interview or not, I don’t know, but it certainly was not off the record.” I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve! Speaking to NPR, Wolff said he approached this book with an open mind about Trump. “In many ways, from the beginning, this has felt like a train wreck, and, as it happened, the train just kept going on but the wall was still out there,” he said. “Eventually it will hit that wall.” “I was certainly willing to be convinced to think differently, willing to think that this unusual figure had a new way to approach things and, what the heck, maybe it would work,” he added. His finished project, however, proved his initial instincts right. “I feel that that is not the case now,” Wolff said. “I saw and learned that everyone around him feels that’s not the case. The train will hit the wall.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Michele Bachmann Says She's Considering Running For Al Franken's Senate Seat",
    "text": "Former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said over the weekend that she is considering running for Senate. Bachmann, who represented Minnesota’s 6th Congressional District for eight years, said in an interview with “The Jim Bakker Show” that people had urged her to run in 2018 to replace outgoing Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.). She said she is asking God if she should enter the race. “The question is: Should it be me, should it be now?“ Bachmann said. “But there’s also a price you pay. And the price is bigger than ever because the swamp is so toxic.” Bachmann retired from Congress in 2014 amid investigations into alleged violations of campaign finance law during her short-lived presidential run in 2012. The former tea party darling was briefly regarded as a serious presidential contender in 2011 after winning the Iowa straw poll, but she quickly flamed out amid low polling numbers and the unexpected victory of former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) in the Iowa caucuses. In Congress, Bachmann was best known for her crusades against former President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act and the IRS. Last year, she served on Donald Trump’s 2016 evangelical campaign advisory board and said God had sent him as a “reprieve” from transgender rights. “If you’re going against the tide in D.C., if you’re trying to stand for biblical principles, and you stick your head up, the blades come whirring and they try to chop you off,” Bachmann said during the Bakker interview. “We’re trying to be wise. Should we do this? Shouldn’t we do this?” If she decides to run, Bachmann will most likely face Minnesota Lt. Gov. Tina Smith (D) in a special Senate election scheduled for November. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton (D) appointed Smith to the Senate seat being left vacant by Franken, who resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct.

Snowmass-based Above It All Balloon Co. had to cancel all of its planned flights during Pence’s six-day visit, which fell on days that are usually very busy for the company. “It’s been very disappointing,” co-owner Pam Wood told The Aspen Times. “This is our busiest week of the winter.” The declaration of “national defense airspace” prevented anyone from flying within 3 miles of the estate where the Pences stayed on the outskirts of town. Those who violate the Federal Aviation Administration order and fly anyway can be hit with civil penalties, criminal charges and ― if they’re deemed to be an imminent security threat to the vice president ― the “use of deadly force.” Wood noted that she respects the need for security, but said she was frustrated by the complete lack of a heads-up. She estimated her loss to be around $10,000 ― potentially as much as $20,000. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

President Donald Trump’s kids took a trip to Aspen last year, a jaunt that cost taxpayers upward of $330,000 in security costs alone, as the roughly 100 Secret Service agents that accompanied them had to rent ski equipment, buy lift tickets and pay for accommodations in the pricey resort town.

    "title": "The Internet Is Living For This Photo Of Doug Jones' Gay Son 'Side-Eyeing' Mike Pence",
    "text": "Following one of the most bitterly fought special elections in recent memory, Democrat Doug Jones was formally sworn in as Alabama’s newest U.S. senator Wednesday. As per tradition, Vice President Mike Pence swore in Jones, 63, who becomes the Yellowhammer State’s first Democratic senator in 25 years. Jones’ presence also shrinks the GOP Senate majority to 51-49, which many have interpreted as a harbinger for midterm elections this fall. For now, a lot of chatter is focused on this photograph of Doug Jones’ openly gay son, Carson Jones, at his father’s side during Wednesday’s ceremony. The photo is, of course, just one of many that were shot at the ceremony. While it’s impossible to know what Carson was really thinking at the time, the image appears to capture him giving Pence a contemptuous look. Given Pence’s history of supporting anti-LGBTQ legislation, Twitter and Facebook users have been happy to chime in with amusing captions of their own. Wow. The look on the face of Doug Jones' proudly gay son Carson as bigot Pence swears him in: priceless. https://t.co/0gPIcDpXXk pic.twitter.com/asMD36eCrd Photo of the decade: Doug Jones being sworn in, while his openly gay son QUIETLY DISINTEGRATES THE SOUL OF MIKE PENCE. pic.twitter.com/wTKHAZSrOx Someone buy the rights to adapt this staring contest between Carson Jones and Mike Pence. pic.twitter.com/wwAD9s1S6j My 2018 aesthetic will be Carson Jones sideeyeing homophobe Mike Pence while his father, Doug Jones, is sworn into the US Senate. 😏 🏳️🌈 pic.twitter.com/l21UJ37Q8p Carson, who works as a zookeeper in Colorado, stoked the flames of internet speculation himself when he posted the photo to his own Instagram account late Wednesday, accompanied with the hashtag #nocaptionneeded. A post shared by Carson Jones (@thedapperzookeeper) on Jan 3, 2018 at 12:44pm PST Though it’s not visible in the picture, Carson also donned a rainbow flower boutonniere given to him by LGBTQ advocacy group DCHomos for the occasion. After his father’s Dec. 12 victory, Carson confirmed to The Advocate that he identifies as gay. The interview followed a flurry of blog posts declaring him Sen. Jones’ “sexy son” and a “hottie zookeeper” alongside shirtless vacation photos and gym selfies culled from his Instagram account. “I am obviously thrilled with my dad’s victory,” the 22-year-old, who came out to his parents in 2015, said at the time. “We have been overwhelmed by the support of so many people that made this happen. Alabama made a really big statement that unity wins out.

    "title": "Mitt Romney is Not The Answer",
    "text": "The election of Donald Trump has made strange bedfellows. I find myself agreeing with Washington Post conservative writer Jennifer Rubin, conservatives Anna Navarro and Bill Kristol and Republican strategist Rick Wilson. This would never have happened without Donald Trump in the White House. But desperate times calls for desperate measures and I’m looking for allies anywhere to help stop the debacle that has been the Trump administration. But Mitt Romney isn’t one of them. First of all, I find it infuriating that political pundits who just last week claimed that Hillary Clinton should go away and take up knitting after her loss in 2016 are now clamoring for a Senate seat run for Mitt Romney who lost his presidential election in 2012. As far as the media is concerned, a woman has to go into hiding after she loses any election (except Sarah Palin, the one woman that should have been hiding) but a man can run multiple times and is still a viable candidate with a voice that must be heard. A white man like John McCain, Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, and Bernie Sanders can lose elections and are still booked on all the talk shows and can do book tours without being told to shut up. The double standard is unbelievable and it is no coincidence that many of the pundits who grilled Hillary while hand holding Donald Trump have been accused of sexual misconduct. The bar is currently set so low, that Mitt Romney for Senate sounds like a good idea. He can’t be as bad as Trump so there’s that, right? But in the rush to crown Mitt Romney because of his weak #NeverTrump stance, let’s not forget Romney’s greatest hits: Romney was the Steve Mnuchin of 2012, super rich; out of touch with everyone who wasn’t rich and constantly outraged that the rest of us didn’t understand his struggles. The Romney’s tales of struggling as college students, eating tuna fish sandwiches off an ironing board because they couldn’t afford a table omits that the Romney’s lived off Mitt’s stock investments. His advice to struggling students was to ask your parents to loan you money to start a business. And while the Romney’s might have been smart enough not to get photographed with sheets of money like the clueless Mnuchins, that’s basically it. Again, the bar is set so low its underground. And while these quotes are really, really stupid, the policies Mitt Romney has advocated for as Governor are equally bad. Romney also: During the 2016 election, Romney was one of the Republicans who didn’t support Trump. He was a vocal opponent coming out often to warn about the dangers of a Trump presidency. But once Trump won the election, he summoned Mitt Romney dangling the carrot of a Secretary of State Job and Romney came running. It seems his #NeverTrump stand ends at the door to the Secretary of State office. If Romney is elected as Senator from Utah, he will go right back to voting party line including the Republican budgets which punish the people who didn’t have the skills to be born rich. Romney will go right back to thinking that 47 percent of Americans aren’t worthy of consideration. He will follow the Republican’s policies of governing by the meanest, cruelest methods possible for the people who have the least. And he will not hold Trump accountable for his actions. Look for Romney to go back to groveling like he did for the State job as long as Trump has a base of supporters and a pen to sign whatever legislation Paul Ryan puts in front of him.

    "title": "Mormon President Thomas Monson Dies At 90",
    "text": "(Reuters) - Thomas Monson, leader of the Mormon church, has died at the age of 90 at his home in Salt Lake City, Utah, the church said on Wednesday. Monson became the 16th President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - as the religion is officially known - in 2008. As president, he was believed by members of the faith to be a prophet who receives divine revelations. Monson died on Tuesday evening surrounded by his family, the church said in a statement on its website. Remembering the life and legacy of President Thomas S. Monson (1927–2018). pic.twitter.com/j683yNQCDx Mormons worship Jesus, believing in a “restored” church with living apostles and prophets and an additional testament - the Book of Mormon - to those found in the traditional Bible. The church, which was formally organized in 1830 in Upstate New York, reported last year to have 15.8 million members worldwide. They include the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and actor Katherine Heigl. “President Monson had all the hallmarks of an unassuming servant of the Lord,” the church said in a statement. Born and raised in Salt Lake City, Monson was appointed in 1963 to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the church’s second-highest governing body after the three-man First Presidency. Upon his death, a president is succeeded by the head of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, a post currently held by the 93-year-old Russell Nelson. Monson’s predecessor Gordon Hinckley died aged 97 in late 2007. As well as his life-long dedication to his faith, Monson had a “broad business background” and led a successful career in the publishing industry, the church said on its website. “Do something for someone else on that day to make his or her life better. Find someone who is having a hard time, or is ill, or lonely, and do something for them. That’s all I would ask,” he said during an interview on his 81st birthday, according to the church. Many took to Twitter to share their tributes to Monson: President Monson was among the greatest men I have ever known. Service was his motto and humility his hallmark. Countless were the lives he touched as a prophet, father, and friend. Today, I join millions across the globe in mourning his passing. #LDSChurch #utpol A joyous reunion —- Tom and Francis are together again. One of the kindest, most humble and loving men I have ever met, Thomas S Monson #ldspresident passed away tonight. He was 90. It isn’t sad, when you know they are finally home.

    "title": "Motel 6 Gave Guest Info To Immigration Agents, Washington State Attorney General Alleges",
    "text": "Motel 6 locations in Washington state gave information about thousands of guests to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, leading to the detention of at least six people, the state’s attorney general alleged in a lawsuit on Wednesday. The lawsuit comes after the Phoenix New Times revealed in September that staff at two Motel 6 branches in Arizona were giving ICE their guest registries ― something the hotel chain said at the time was “implemented at the local level without the knowledge of senior management.” The practice was actually far more widespread, according to Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose office carried out an investigation into Motel 6 practices in Washington following the reports from Arizona. Ferguson’s office found that Motel 6 locations in Washington were also providing ICE with customers’ names, room numbers, license plate numbers and dates of birth, in violation of consumer protection and discrimination laws, the attorney general said. “After news reports in Arizona revealed Motel 6 staff was handing over guests’ private information, Motel 6 implied this was a local problem,” Ferguson said in a statement. “We have found that is not true. Washingtonians have a right to privacy, and protection from discrimination. I will hold Motel 6 accountable and uncover the whole story of their disturbing conduct.” Motel 6 did not immediately respond to a request for comment. After the Phoenix New Times report in September, Motel 6′s corporate office said it would issue a directive to all U.S. locations telling employees they were prohibited from voluntarily providing ICE with guest lists. Ferguson’s office said that Motel 6 admitted that at least six locations in the state ― in Bellingham, Everett, Seattle, SeaTac and Tacoma ― have given guest registry information to ICE agents since 2015. According to the attorney general’s office, those branches released the information of about 9,000 people ― and likely many more, because the company only gave full details on four of the locations. It is not clear whether any of the locations have given out information since September, when Motel 6 says it banned the practice. Motel 6 trained employees to give guest registries to ICE upon request and did not require a warrant, Ferguson’s office alleged. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that law enforcement officials are not allowed to force hotels to turn over guest information without a warrant. At a Motel 6 location in Everett, Washington, employees gave guests’ information to ICE about 228 times in a 225-day period, according to Ferguson’s office, which alleges that ICE agents routinely visited the motel, asked for a guest list and circled Latino-sounding names. Ferguson’s office says Motel 6 was aware that ICE was using the information to target guests based on their national origin, and had therefore violated the state’s anti-discrimination law. ICE spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe said that the agency will not comment on the lawsuit because it is not a party to the litigation and that it “does not typically disclose or discuss specific information related to the source of its enforcement leads.” “The agency receives viable enforcement tips from a host of sources, including other law enforcement agencies, relevant databases, crime victims, and the general public via the agency’s tip line and online tip form,” O’Keefe said in a statement. “The agency’s immigration enforcement actions are targeted and lead driven, prioritizing individuals who pose a risk to our communities. It’s worth noting that hotels and motels have frequently been exploited by criminal organizations engaged in highly dangerous illegal enterprises, including human trafficking and human smuggling,” the statement added.

    "title": "Muslims May Become America’s Second-Largest Religious Group By 2040, Pew Reports",
    "text": "America’s Muslim population is growing at a steady rate ― so much so that Muslims are projected to one day outpace Jews as the country’s second-largest religious group. New estimates from the Pew Research Center show that there were about 3.45 million Muslims of all ages living in the U.S. in 2017. Combining data from a 2017 Pew survey of U.S. Muslims and from the Census Bureau, the research center found that Muslims make up about 1.1 percent of America’s total population. Muslims have been part of America’s religious landscape since the country’s founding. The first wave of Muslims arrived in the U.S. as slaves, many of whom were later forcibly converted to Christianity. Pew first began collecting estimates about the size of the country’s Muslim population in 2007. Since then, the religious group appears to have grown at a rate of about 100,000 per year, fueled by high fertility rates and continued migration to the U.S. Pew projects that the Muslim population will grow faster than America’s Jewish population. In early 2017, Pew reported that Jews accounted for about 2 percent of the U.S. adult population. They are currently the second-largest religious group. Pew predicts that by 2040, Muslims will become the second-largest religious group. By 2050, the American Muslim population is projected to reach 8.1 million, or 2.1 percent of all Americans. Despite American Muslims’ fast rate of growth, it is important to note that they will continue to be a religious minority in an overwhelmingly Christian country. Pew’s 2014 landmark Religious Landscape Survey showed that Christians made up a whopping 70.6 percent of the U.S. adult population. On the other hand, non-Christian faiths, including Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and others, only made up about 5.9 percent.

    "title": "Net Neutrality Supporters Launch New Campaign To Reverse Unpopular FCC Decision",
    "text": "Repeal, or get replaced. That’s the message a broad group of internet activists wants to send to lawmakers as they fight to reinstate net neutrality rules the Federal Communications Commission overturned in a contentious vote last month. On Wednesday, the group Fight for the Future launched an all-out campaign urging Congress to reverse the FCC ruling via the Congressional Review Act, or face a drubbing in November’s elections. Their leverage? Informed voters, and the deep unpopularity of the FCC’s decision that would allow internet providers to discriminate or charge more for some data. A full 83 percent of Americans disapprove of the net neutrality repeal, including three out of four Republicans. Just before Election Day, Fight for the Future will send text messages to voters who sign up to receive them, informing them of their representatives’ action ― or inaction, as it may be ― to overturn the ruling. The text messages will look something like this: Those who sign up are also encouraged to write to lawmakers. “Dear Congress,” the suggested language reads, “Unless you vote for a CRA to overturn the FCC net neutrality vote, I will not vote for you. I have given my phone number to Fight for the Future, who will text me your voting record on the eve of your next election.” Under the Congressional Review Act, the FCC decision can be overturned by a simple majority vote in both houses of Congress. Congress only has 60 days to act after the FCC submits a report to the House and Senate outlining its proposed rule change. “Any lawmaker that ignores the overwhelming consensus among tech experts and this level of public outcry doesn’t deserve to be in office.” According to Fight for the Future, 29 senators so far have said they would vote to overturn the FCC ruling via the Congressional Review Act. In case you’re wondering, here’s a list of the 535 voting members of Congress, and how much money the telecom industry has contributed to each of them since 1989 ― a total of $101 million.

    "text": "(Reuters) - Police arrested a 16-year-old boy suspected of killing four people including his parents and sister with an assault rifle at their New Jersey home on New Year’s Eve, prosecutors said on Monday. Officers from Long Branch police and the Monmouth County Sheriff’s Office responded to a call shortly before midnight and discovered the victims, the Monmouth County Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement. The suspect, who was not identified, was arrested at the home without incident, the statement said. “Thankfully it was uneventful. It didn’t require any force,” Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni told reporters on Monday morning, the New York Daily News reported. The victims were identified as the suspect’s father, Steven Kologi, 44; mother Linda Kologi, 42; sister Brittany Kologi, 18; and family friend Mary Schultz, 70.

    "text": "At least nobody could complain that they weren’t invited. Maria Menounos married Keven Undergaro, her beau of about 20 years, during the live broadcast she was hosting of Fox’s New Year’s Eve special from Times Square in New York City. Her co-host, talk-show and game-show king Steve Harvey, officiated. A HUGE congrats to the newlyweds @mariamenounos and @undergaro! 💍 #NYEonFOX #MarryingMaria pic.twitter.com/2h2WPzYHg4 Menounos, 39, didn’t let the icy temps prevent her from wearing a strapless gown under a sheer lace coat. Undergaro, 51, remained in a winter overcoat as the two shared a post-“I do” kiss that perhaps warmed them up for a few moments. The idea for the on-air ceremony came just two weeks ago when a producer mentioned to Menounos that she had hoped for an on-air wedding of a different couple, unless she and Undergaro wanted to finally get hitched, People magazine reported. So Menounos texted Undergaro, and the ceremony became a go. The two were engaged on Howard Stern’s radio show in 2016 and Undergaro had actually been in talks about tying the knot there, People noted. But it all worked out Sunday night. The guest list included her parents, Constantine and Litsa Menounos, who has stage 4 brain cancer, and the many people in Times Square and in TV land.

    "title": "States Across U.S. See Record-Cold New Year's Day As Rest Of The World Boils",
    "text": "As morning temperatures across the U.S. broke records Monday ― residents of Watertown, New York, woke up to minus 31 degrees Fahrenheit and temperatures plunged to minus 19 degrees in Des Moines, Iowa ― many other parts of the world were warmer than usual. Huge sections of the Arctic were among the areas that saw temperatures well above average, according to the University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer, which compares daily temperature anomalies to a baseline of data from between 1979 and 2000. Temperatures around the globe were nearly one full degree Fahrenheit, or 0.5 degrees Celsius, above average on Monday. The Northern Hemisphere, which is currently experiencing winter, was 1.6 degrees F (0.9 degrees Celsius) warmer than usual. In Antarctica, where a Delaware-sized iceberg broke off last summer, temperatures were 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees C) higher than normal. And the Arctic, which is warming about twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet, started 2018 with temperatures 6.8 degrees F (3.4 degrees C) warmer than average. A peer-reviewed report released last month by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that the Arctic is warming faster than at any point in the past 1,500 years, with 2017 its hottest year on record. Still, President Donald Trump ― who gutted environmental regulations and attacked efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions during his first year in office ― has seized on the cold snap in the northern Midwest and eastern United States in an attempt to refute the existence climate change. In a tweet on Thursday, the president conflated cold winter weather with climate, and suggested that the nonbinding Paris Agreement ― from which he announced plans to withdraw in June ― would cost the United States trillions of dollars. In reality, the U.S. contributed just $1 billion to the $100 billion Green Climate Fund set up under the Paris climate accord to help poorer countries invest in renewable energy and forgo coal-fired plants. In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! “This one-week cold snap or two weeks, as it might end up being, isn’t going to change anything about any global climate signal,” Ryan Maue, an Atlanta-based meteorologist at Weather.us, told HuffPost. “When you have these cold events, how do you place these in a climate context?” he added. “This is just a typical January cold outbreak, and we still have record cold sometimes.” Breitbart’s James Delingpole, a conspiracy theorist and columnist who made his name attacking scientists, interpreted Trump’s tweet as the president “trolling his enemies like a boss” and baiting “climate loons.” “What normal people are seeing right now when they look out of their windows is weather so cold that the very last thing on their minds is trying to prevent ‘global warming,’” he wrote. However, weather and climate are two different things. Weather describes conditions of the atmosphere over a short period of time, while climate denotes long-term trends in how the atmosphere behaves, according to a succinct summary that has been available on NASA’s website since February 2005. Sixteen of the 17 hottest years in NASA’s 137-year record have occurred since 2001. The warmest year on record is 2016, and 2017 is in second place.

    "text": "The New York Daily News has branded President Donald Trump’s feud with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon a “cuck fight.” The tabloid edited the warring pair’s heads onto the bodies of fighting chickens for its Thursday cover: August 2017: \"I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service.\"January 2018: \"When (Steve Bannon) was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind.\" Life comes at you fast: https://t.co/e3XLd4xDG9 pic.twitter.com/jP1rehvnoI Its headline played on the word “cuck,” a term often used by the alt-right to belittle liberals. It comes from “cuckold,” or “a man whose wife is unfaithful.” The cover was published amid an escalation in tensions between the former colleagues. On Wednesday, Trump took aim at Bannon in a statement after the former staffer reportedly slammed his administration in Michael Wolff’s upcoming book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. The New York Post also riffed on the feud: Tomorrow's cover: In a Shakespearean twist, Steve Bannon called Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with Russians \"treasonous,\" prompting President Trump to say his former chief strategist had \"lost his mind\" https://t.co/GYUYfMa07p pic.twitter.com/0oGv4rDjyW By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "text": "Two men wanted in a quadruple homicide that traumatized an upstate New York town have been captured. Justin C. Mann and James W. White of Schenectady, New York, were charged with first-degree murder and four counts of second-degree murder, Troy police Capt. Daniel DeWolf told CNN. Mann, 24, and White, 38, pleaded not guilty during arraignments Dec. 30. Preliminary hearings are set for Thursday. The men allegedly bound and killed Shanta Myers, 36, her partner Brandi Mells, 22, and Myers’ children, 5-year-old Shanise Myers and 11-year-old Jeremiah Myers, in an apartment in Troy, New York, just north of Albany. The victims’ throats had been slit, the Albany Times Union reported. The victims were slain around 9 p.m. on Dec. 21, according to the Times Union. Their bodies were discovered Dec. 26 by the apartment property manager, who had been contacted by the mother of one of the victims after she couldn’t reach her daughter over Christmas. Myers and Mells reportedly had gotten engaged last year. At a Dec. 30 news conference, Police Chief John Tedesco said one of the suspects knew one of the victims, but he did not elaborate. No additional arrests were expected. “I don’t have to tell you what a good feeling it is to have these two in custody. It’s a great relief,” Tedesco told the Times Union. He did not say whether investigators had determined a motive. “The investigation is still ongoing,” the chief said, “and that’s one of the things that we’re looking for.” Rensselaer County District Attorney Joel Abelove, who was also present at the news conference, offered similar sentiments. “The savagery and barbarism of what happened to these people has been well-reported on by now,” Abelove said. “Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. They’ve suffered an unspeakable loss, they’re trying to gets their heads around; as is most of the public.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

He was described to the Albany Times-Union as “very troubled” by Michael Saccocio, the executive director of the City Mission shelter, where he’d previously sought food and housing.

    "text": "The New York Times will remind TV viewers that “the truth has a voice” during one of the biggest nights in Hollywood. The newspaper, which broke the bombshell exposé of accusations of sexual misconduct against Harvey Weinstein, emboldening victims to share their stories and sparking the #MeToo campaign, is airing a forceful ad during Sunday’s Golden Globes that addresses sexual harassment and assault. The TV spot, which you can watch in the video above, features simple black text on a white background. The ad begins by repeating, “He said. She said,” a phrase that has been used to signify the way victims of sexual misconduct have been discouraged from coming forward with their stories in the past. It ends with, “He said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said. She said…” signifying the flood of women who have shared their harrowing experiences since the Weinstein story broke. “We thought that using language that has been used to silence women in the past and turning it on its head was a simple way to show the clear distinction between the way the world was merely a year ago and the way it is now,” Julie Matheny, associate creative director of Droga5 ad agency that created the campaign, told Ad Age. The ad ends with the sentences: “The truth has power. The truth will not be threatened. The truth has a voice.” The 30-second television spot kicks off the second phase of the paper’s current brand campaign and is “the first in a series of new ads the Times is planning for this year that will focus on its unwavering commitment to original, independent journalism that holds power to account,” according to a press release.

    "title": "5 Stories You Might've Missed While Following That Bombshell Book On Trump's White House",
    "text": "A lot of news happened this week, and if you’ve spent the past few days following the drama around journalist Michael Wolff’s new book on the Trump White House, you might have missed some of it. But never fear: We’ve got you. Wolff’s book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House ― which had some people lining up at midnight on Thursday for its release, and which has since shot to the top of Amazon’s best-seller list ― promised a candid look into President Donald Trump’s administration. The book has been making waves for days: Excerpts published earlier this week included explosive comments from former chief strategist Steve Bannon on Trump, his family and Russia. Trump, for his part, has dismissed the book as “phony,” and his lawyers tried unsuccessfully to stop its release. It’s all added up to a major media frenzy (which, uh, HuffPost has not abstained from). But if the imbroglio has taken up all your attention this week, here’s a guide to a few of the other major events that happened. On Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced that the U.S. would be cutting $255 million in aid to Pakistan, a key ally in the fight against terrorism. Haley told reporters the U.S. expected more support from Pakistan in counterterrorism. Later that day, Trump took to Twitter to threaten aid to Palestinians, blaming Palestinians’ reluctance to negotiate a peace treaty with Israel. This was almost exactly a month after Trump roiled the peace deals himself by officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and saying the U.S. would move its embassy there, provoking anger among Palestinians and disappointment from U.S. allies. “It’s not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing,” Trump tweeted Tuesday. “We pay the Palestinians HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.” It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue... Read more about Trump’s Palestine comments here. On Thursday, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke proposed a new offshore drilling plan that would open up nearly all U.S. waters to oil exploration. Environmental groups were not thrilled about the proposal, which would allow oil and gas companies to drill on the Atlantic coast for the first time since the 1980s. Perhaps surprisingly, Republican legislators in some coastal states weren’t happy either. “I have already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration,” Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R), a close Trump ally, said in a statement Thursday. “My top priority is to ensure that Florida’s natural resources are protected.” Read more about the offshore drilling proposal here. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a change in policy on Thursday, allowing the nation’s top federal prosecutors to decide how to handle marijuana cases in states where the drug has been legalized. Because federal law still regards marijuana as illegal, the decision spread uncertainty in the nascent legal marijuana industries in states like Colorado and California. Representatives from legal-marijuana states on both sides of the aisle denounced the decision. We'll give Jeff Sessions our legal pot when he pries it from our warm, extremely interesting to look at hands. https://t.co/LF0RpdCiHG This reported action directly contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation. With no prior notice to Congress, the Justice Department has trampled on the will of the voters in CO and other states. Read more about Sessions’ announcement on marijuana here. On Thursday, North Korea agreed to hold official talks with South Korea next week, for the first time in over two years. After North Korean leader Kim Jong Un indicated he was open to dialogue in a New Year’s address, South Korea offered talks on Tuesday, after discussions with the U.S. Later on Tuesday ― in response to Kim mentioning the “nuclear button on the desk in my office” ― Trump taunted Kim on Twitter, writing: “I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!” North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! On Thursday, Trump took credit for the dialogue between North and South Korea. “Does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total ‘might’ against the North,” the president tweeted. “Fools, but talks are a good thing!” Early Thursday morning, an earthquake centered near Berkeley, California, shook many Bay Area residents awake. The 4.4-magnitude quake at 2:39 a.m. local time affected an estimated 9.8 million people around the San Francisco Bay, with some reporting feeling shakes for up to 10 seconds ― though no significant damage was reported as a result of the quake. Residents took to Twitter in the middle of the night to check if others felt it too: Ok.... that just woke me up. A heavy rolling #earthquake few seconds long. Anyone else in #Marin feel that? Felt a big jolt and rolling. Picture frames, etc, fell down. We are standing outside because the fire alarm went off.

    "text": "Newsweek posted a tweet on Monday that referenced the death of Martin Luther King Jr. and deleted it after his daughter called out the publication for being thoughtless. The post included a photo of the civil rights leader in his casket and the caption “Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin?” The quote is from “Abraham, Martin and John,” a song Dick Holler wrote in 1968 to memorialize the lives of Abraham Lincoln, MLK, former President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert ― all of whom were assassinated after promoting social change. The publication also linked to an article listing several upcoming milestones, including the 50-year anniversary of the assassination of MLK. “Why, @Newsweek? Wow,” Bernice King tweeted in response. Many Twitter users replied to her, agreeing that Newsweek’s post was insensitive. Newsweek deleted its post shortly after King tweeted at the publication, and apologized. “@BerniceKing Earlier this afternoon we published an opinion piece with an insensitive image of Martin Luther King Jr.,” it said. “We sincerely apologize to the King family for this egregious error.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the song referenced in Newsweek’s tweet.

    "title": "We Found The Neo-Nazi Twitter Account Tied To A Virginia Double Homicide",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — The warning signs were there, flaring up from Nicholas Giampa’s pseudonymous Twitter feed for over a year. The alt-right lingo and the swastikas. The advertisements of violence. Giampa’s girlfriend’s parents, Buckley Kuhn-Fricker, 43, and Scott Fricker, 48, were aware of the teenager’s burgeoning extremism. Kuhn-Fricker had found frightening tweets from Giampa on her daughter’s phone. Twitter was where Giampa, a Papa John’s employee and an anime enthusiast, let his malevolence run amok. Kuhn-Fricker and Fricker had seen enough to say something. Days later, Giampa fatally shot them in their Virginia home, police say. HuffPost has found his tweets, written by “Kevin Gallo” under the handle @doctorpepper35. They suggest a 17-year-old who’d drifted beyond the trolling of his teenage peers on the internet far-right and was fully in thrall to the racist, apocalyptic fantasia of white nationalism. As @doctorpepper35, Giampa tweeted about his hatred of transgender people and his admiration for Adolf Hitler. He tweeted about using Jews as target practice. Almost three months before the murders, the teenager from Lorton, Virginia, praised a book called Siege, an obscure, ominous work written by James Mason, a neo-Nazi devotee of Charles Manson. The 1992 book, republished last year by hyperviolent white nationalist sect Atomwaffen Division, is essentially a call to “Helter Skelter” racist insurrection. Giampa also retweeted an endorsement of The Turner Diaries, William Luther Pierce’s infamous white nationalist novel about race war, often found on the bookshelf of American domestic terrorists. Kuhn-Fricker had tried to keep her 16-year-old daughter away from Giampa. The teenagers met at the same private high school for students with special needs. One of Giampa’s family members described the boy as struggling with mental illness for years and being “on the spectrum” for autism. At one point last year, it seemed like Giampa’s life was improving. He was proud of his job. He had a girlfriend. “They dated for six months and it was a very happy dating period ― brunches and beaches and lots of good times,” said a family member. But a darker side of the teenager was emerging on social media. By November, Giampa, under his Twitter pseudonym, was referring to himself as a Nazi. Days before Kuhn-Fricker was murdered, she alerted the high school principal to neo-Nazi content on a Twitter account she believed was operated by Giampa, The Washington Post reported. Kuhn-Fricker urged her daughter to break up with Giampa and, after some initial resistance, the girl seemed to agree. On Dec. 22, police say Giampa sneaked into his girlfriend’s house in Reston, Virginia, and shot Kuhn-Fricker and Fricker dead, then turned the gun on himself. Four other family members were in the house during the shooting, including the couple’s 10-year-old son, who was out on the lawn when police arrived, according to dispatch audio obtained by ABC7. Giampa is currently at the Reston Hospital Center, where he is being treated, under police guard, for life-threatening wounds, including what a family member described as a brain injury. Fairfax County Police Department has charged him as a minor for the murders of Fricker and Kuhn-Fricker, but they are waiting for his medical condition to improve before serving him, Reem Awad, a spokeswoman for the police department, said. Police have withheld Giampa’s name because he is a minor. HuffPost identified him through his Facebook profile, where he goes by Nick Breedlove, using his mother’s maiden name. Until recently, he listed the daughter of the slain couple as his girlfriend. (The teen girl’s Facebook page has since been removed.) A hospital operator at Reston Hospital Center confirmed on Wednesday that Giampa was a patient there. Friends of the victims’ family spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity about the teen girl’s relationship with Giampa. While his Twitter account is under a pseudonym, Huffpost found that the email address associated with @doctorpepper35 is also linked to Giampa’s Facebook profile. In July, @doctorpepper35 wrote to a Twitter user with a name that matched the one Giampa’s girlfriend used on Instagram. The user @doctorpepper35 also referred to Virginia as “my state” in a tweet. The avatar for the Twitter account is currently a skeleton wearing a Nazi SS military hat. The bio reads, “Read Siege,” a reference to Mason’s book. The Twitter account Kuhn-Fricker found and alerted the school principal to “retweeted missives praising Hitler, supporting Nazi book burnings, calling for ‘white revolution,’ making derogatory comments about Jews and featuring an illustration of a man hanging from a noose beneath a slur for gay people,” The Washington Post reported, without identifying the account. That description matches @doctorpepper35’s tweets. It’s unclear how Giampa arrived at such extreme views. Little has been made public about him. His parents, Marilyn Breedlove-Giampa and Michael Troy Giampa, took down their Facebook pages after the shooting. HuffPost has obtained screenshots of Breedlove-Giampa’s Facebook account, where she posted tributes to Confederate generals and argued in favor of keeping Confederate statues in various cities. She also posted a photo of her son at a shooting range, holding what the caption says is a Thompson submachine gun. The target is a “Nazi Hans” zombie cartoon. When Giampa first started tweeting from the @doctorpepper35 account in May 2016, he already espoused far-right views. An enthusiastic supporter of then-candidate Donald Trump, he often used racist slurs to attack Trump’s critics. In the summer of 2016, Giampa told one Twitter user to “go back to the gas chamber,” called another a “kike” and labeled several users whom he disagreed with as “cucks.” He talked about “globalist scum” and, a few weeks later, referred to a right-wing conspiracy theory about “how hillary has literally murdered people.” Most of Giampa’s Twitter activity consists of retweets and replies to other Twitter users. He retweeted Trump in July when the president called for a ban on transgender people serving in the military. During the first several months Giampa tweeted under @doctorpepper35, he was closely focused on the ongoing civil war in Syria, frequently tweeting in support of President Bashar Assad, a strongman who has slaughtered his own people throughout the conflict. Although Giampa did not yet openly associate with white nationalist groups on Twitter at the time, his defense of Assad gave him a common cause with the far-right community. White nationalists have lionized the brutal leader as a hero who stands up to Zionists in Israel and purges Islamic terrorists from his country. (In reality, Assad has targeted anyone who opposes his rule — including peaceful protesters.) For unknown reasons, Giampa’s Twitter activity all but stopped from November 2016 to June 2017. He didn’t tweet about Trump’s electoral victory or when the president ordered airstrikes targeting the Assad regime in April, a move that was heavily criticized by his alt-right fans. During the first six months of 2017, the teenager tweeted only one time. Kuhn-Fricker seemed to have become concerned about Giampa’s ideology soon after he started dating her daughter, The Washington Post reported. Over the summer, her daughter told her that Giampa was good at history and had asked her, “Did you know that Jews are partly to blame for WWII?” When Giampa returned to Twitter this past summer, around the time he started dating the daughter of Kuhn-Fricker and Kuhn, his tweets were vicious. On July 26, the same day Trump announced the transgender military ban, Giampa fired off a series of threatening tweets targeting gay and transgender people. “I’ve already talked 1 tranny into suicide and I’m working on another 2 😳,” he bragged. Then he posted a rainbow lynching image, encouraging gay and transgender people to commit suicide. “#transrightsarehumanrights is an oxymoron because trannies aren’t ‘people,’” Giampa tweeted that day. Giampa retweeted Trump’s announcement of the transgender military ban, but he appeared to have been wavering in his overall support for the president. “I don’t even support trump lol I just think it’s funny how easy it is for him to piss people off,” he tweeted on July 26, months after Trump’s airstrikes against the Assad regime. In addition to tweeting his own racist views, Giampa, as @doctorpepper35, began to embrace well-known neo-Nazis and their ideology. He retweeted prominent figures in the alt-right white supremacist movement such as Mike Peinovich (aka “Mike Enoch”) and tried to engage with the official accounts of white supremacist organizations such as the Traditionalist Worker Party, Identity Evropa and VDARE. He also tried to interact with Twitter users who identified as being affiliated with neo-Nazi groups such as Vanguard America, which showed up for the August white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. James A. Fields marched with Vanguard America in Charlottesville, dressed in the group’s ad hoc uniform and carried a shield with the group’s logo during the violent gathering before he drove his car into a crowd and killed Heather Heyer. On Sept. 14, Giampa retweeted a quote attributed to Oswald Mosley, the 20th-century leader of the British Union of Fascists, defending the Nazi salute. But it was with Atomwaffen Division that Giampa seemed most taken. The violent anti-American group’s name translates to “Atomic Weapons Division,” and its members like to post photos of themselves wearing skull masks and camouflage outfits while sieg heiling or posing with assault rifles and the organization’s yellow-and-black nuclear-themed flags. Some of Atomwaffen’s YouTube videos look like propaganda in the style of the so-called Islamic State, with heavily armed young men conducting training exercises. In May, an Atomwaffen member murdered two of his neo-Nazi roommates in Tampa. Atomwaffen has moved to revive the racist career of Siege author and Charles Manson devotee Mason, a onetime member of George Lincoln Rockwell’s American Nazi Party. Mason had formed a splinter group devoted to promoting the views of the murderous cult leader, whom Mason saw as a continuation of Hitler’s legacy. Although Mason had faded into obscurity, Atomwaffen tracked him down and earlier last year began republishing Siege. A few months before Giampa allegedly murdered his girlfriend’s parents, the teenager began tweeting about Siege and Mason, a man who once described Anders Breivik, the far-right Norwegian terrorist convicted of killing 77 people in a 2011 bombing and mass shooting, as “dead-on.” Giampa retweeted a photo of Mason reading a new copy of Siege. He later praised @RyanAtomwaffen for his book collection, which included Siege and Mein Kampf. He encouraged another user to buy a copy of Siege for his mother, and tweeted about his own effort to get a copy of the book. In late October, around the same time Giampa started ramping up his neo-Nazi tweets, he took his extremism public: He mowed a 40-foot swastika into the grass of a community field in his neighborhood. The Washington Post reported that neighbors considered calling the police, but ultimately decided to talk to Giampa’s parents instead. When the neighbors confronted the teen boy’s parents, they said they were aware of their son’s behavioral issues and would take care of it. Days later, Giampa retweeted a meme praising Hitler as a hero. By November, Giampa was identifying himself as a Nazi on Twitter. In the lead-up to the Nov. 7 gubernatorial race in Virginia, Giampa described Democratic candidate Ralph Northam as a “jew puppet” and told a pro-Northam Twitter user to “Get the fuck out of my state you white guilt slut.” A white Europe without Jewish or Muslim individuals “sounds like heaven,” Giampa tweeted on Nov. 11. The next day, he tweeted “The jews are everyone’s enemy.” He tweeted in support of nationalist marchers in Poland seeking to rid the country of Muslims and Jews. “Muslims and jews are incapable of assimilating and a threat to their culture,” he wrote. Throughout his Twitter feed, Giampa expressed concern that white men were at risk of losing their access to guns. By late November, he was actively advocating violence. He tweeted on Nov. 20 that Charles Manson, who had died a day earlier, “did the right thing.” On Thanksgiving Day, he advocated shooting transgender and Jewish people. That same day, Giampa retweeted a pro-Hitler meme. Giampa retweeted a Nov. 25 tweet blaming Jews for communism and World War II. On Nov. 26, Giampa tweeted a denial of the Holocaust. Days later, he retweeted a call for Vanguard America, the Atomwaffen Division, and other neo-Nazi movements to come together as part of a “white revolution.” On Dec. 5, Giampa tweeted several times at Paul Nehlen, a Wisconsin candidate for Congress who has appeared on an anti-Semitic white power podcast, called for an indefinite Muslim ban, promoted white contributions to western civilization and complained about Jewish billionaires and CEOs. Giampa last tweeted on Dec. 21. By 5 a.m. the next morning, Fricker and Kuhn-Fricker were dead and Giampa was critically injured. “I apologize for all the unhappiness for everyone. I am sincerely sorry,” said one of Giampa’s family members, who broke into tears on the phone. “In the end, we need one more gun law. Any address, anywhere, that has mental illness, there cannot be guns.” On Saturday morning, a little more than a week after the double homicide, hundreds of mourners gathered at Trinity Presbyterian Church in Herndon, Virginia. The overflow crowd spread into the aisles, listening to friends and family share stories about Fricker and Kuhn-Fricker’s kindness, warmth and devotion to their children.

    "title": "Indian Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil To Open LGBTQ Center On Family's Royal Grounds",
    "text": "Each week,  LGBT HealthLink , a program of CenterLink, and researcher and blogger Corey Prachniak-Rincón bring you a round-up of some of the biggest LGBTQ wellness stories from the past seven days. For more LGBTQ Wellness, visit a page dedicated to the topic here. Gay Prince to Open LGBT Center Gay Star News reported that Prince Manvendra of India, who came out as gay in 2006 and faced significant backlash as a result, is now seeking to open an LGBT center on his family’s royal grounds. The center will feature support groups, a music therapy room, a healthcare clinic, and more, as well as seek to bring visibility to a community that still faces stigma. New Tools to Stop Smoking SF Stop Smoking launched a study aiming to help people quit smoking with Spanish-language and English-language resources, as well as a great online guide. Participants will comprise a study that hopes to teach researchers more about tobacco cessation. LGBT people are especially in need of such novel interventions, given that they smoke about 50% more than others. Understanding Trans Men and HIV Researchers found that 11% of transgender people receiving HIV-related care are trans men, a small but sizable number given that they are often ignored in HIV prevention and care efforts. 47% of these men live in poverty, 23% have depression, and only 60% had sustained viral suppression for the past year, suggesting the population has complex needs and is underserved. Queer Women of All Races Face Disparities Researchers examined data from 14 states and found persistent health disparities for queer women of all races – for example, queer Asian and Pacific Islander women had four times the odds of smoking compared to their heterosexual peers. Results for men were more mixed, with queer men sometimes having better health indicators than their heterosexual counterparts. HPV, Sexuality, and Smoking A study of men living with HIV found that 95% of men who have sex with men had anal HPV compared to 59% of other men; queer men were also more likely to have high-risk HPV types and to have abnormal anal cytology. Smoking also proved to be a risk factor, with researchers thus recommending that smoking cessation be encouraged for people living with HIV. Objections Could Hurt Queer Health The Fenway Institute released a report explaining how policies that allow companies to exercise “religious objection” to following various laws, including those requiring healthcare coverage, could negatively impact LGBT health. The report examines both state and federal law, and calls on the federal government to protect against discriminatory healthcare practices. The Deadly Disparity Facing Queer Teens Researchers found that approximately 25% of queer adolescents had attempted suicide in the past year, nearly four times the rate for heterosexual teens; even more queer teenagers, 4 in 10, had seriously considered suicide during that timeframe. The troubling findings have garnered press coverage, and researchers say policy makers, clinicians, and more should respond to the crisis now. Exploring the Needs of LGBT Older Adults LGBT Health published a special edition on older adults, who (as noted in the issue’s opening editorial) face disparities compared to their peers but also show high levels of resilience. One article found that while there were some troubling health indicators for older sexual minority adults, they were more likely than their peers to self-report excellent or very good health. Physician Calls for Trans Solidarity Huffington Post published an op-ed from a physician at the New York City Health Department, explaining why she stands in solidarity with transgender people. The author notes the widespread disparities that trans people (especially those of color) encounter, and lists several key steps that health professionals can take to be better allies. Sounds like a great New Year’s resolution to us! CDC Releases Fact Sheet on Viral Suppression The CDC released a new fact sheet on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and its role in viral suppression, a topic of interest as studies show that those with suppressed viral loads are very unlikely to retransmit the virus. The fact sheet notes that as of 2014, 58% of people living with HIV were virally suppressed, leaving about 4 in 10 needing more support in reaching that goal. HPV and Queer Black Men A study of queer men in Texas found that three out of four had at least one high-risk type of HPV, which can cause cancer, and that those who were living with HIV were at increased risk. Researchers recommended tailored interventions for Black queer men (who comprised most of the study) given their risk for HPV and lower likelihood of completing the vaccine series. The Health of LGBT Orgs Movement Advancement Project issued its annual report on the state of leading LGBT organizations. While sexual orientation diversity was strong, people of color were not proportionately represented in senior staff and board roles. Most organizations were advocacy-focused, with those centered on research and education comprising the smallest group.

    "title": "North Korea Accepts Offer For Dialogue From South Korea",
    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korea will hold official talks next week for the first time in more than two years after Pyongyang accepted Seoul’s offer for dialogue, just hours after the United States and South Korea delayed a joint military exercise. The South’s unification ministry said North Korea had sent its consent for the talks to be held on Jan. 9 in a statement at 0116 GMT. The last time the two Koreas engaged in official talks was in December 2015. The talks will be held at the border truce village of Panmunjom and officials from both sides are expected to discuss the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the improvement of inter-Korean relations, ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun told a regular briefing. North Korea asked for further negotiations regarding the meeting to be carried out via documented exchanges, Baik said. The officials to represent the two Koreas have yet to be confirmed. The spokesman added there was no change to South Korea’s stance that efforts aimed at the denuclearization of North Korea should be continued, while Seoul would engage Pyongyang as it keeps close communications with the United States and allies. North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un opened the way for talks with South Korea in a New Year’s Day speech in which he called for reduced tensions on the Korean peninsula and flagged the North’s possible participation in the Winter Olympics. But Kim remained steadfast on the issue of nuclear weapons, saying the North would mass produce nuclear missiles for operational deployment and again warned he would launch a nuclear strike if his country was threatened. U.S. President Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in announced late on Thursday that annual large-scale military drills usually held in spring would now take place after the Winter Olympics scheduled for February in Pyeongchang. The North sees these drills as exercises for a possible invasion. South Korea and the United States are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty. Trump had called the proposed inter-Korean talks a “good thing” and that he would send a high-level delegation, including members of his family, to the Winter Olympics, according to South Korea’s presidential office. In a tweet, Trump, who hurled fresh insults at the North Korean leader this week, took credit for any dialogue. “Does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and SouthKorea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total ‘might’ against the North,” Trump tweeted. The ramped-up momentum for inter-Korean dialogue follows a year of missile and nuclear tests by North Korea as well as an exchange of bellicose comments from Trump and Kim, which raised alarm across the world. Earlier this week, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Washington was hearing reports that Pyongyang might be preparing to fire another missile. South Korea’s defense ministry said on Thursday they had yet to see any evidence of an imminent missile launch but there was always a chance North Korea could test missiles at any time. Analysts with the website 38 North, which tracks North Korea, reported Pyongyang may be preparing to test a rocket engine at a facility in Sohae, North Pyongan Province where all of the North’s satellite launches have taken place since 2012.

Commercial satellite imagery from Dec. 25 showed a rail-mounted environment shelter had been moved away from a test stand, indicating that an engine test may be in the near future, the website said.

    "title": "Norway Suspends Arms Sales To United Arab Emirates Over Yemen War",
    "text": "OSLO (Reuters) - Norway has suspended exports of weapons and ammunition to the United Arab Emirates over concerns they could be used in the war in Yemen, the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday. The UAE is part of a Saudi-led coalition formed in 2015 to fight the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa, in a war that has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than 3 million. While there is currently no evidence that Norwegian-made ammunition has been used in Yemen, there was a rising risk related to the UAE’s military involvement there, the ministry said. Existing export permits had been temporarily revoked and no new licenses would be issued under the current circumstances, Norway said.

    "title": "NYC Crime Hits Historic Low, Defying Dire Predictions About End Of Stop And Frisk",
    "text": "Crime rates in New York City reached their lowest levels in recorded history last year, even as police continued to phase out the controversial stop-and-frisk policy. The decrease across all major felony categories followed nearly three decades of declines ― a trend that some pundits predicted would end once police scaled back the widespread practice of targeting people for warrantless searches. There were a total of 290 killings across New York in 2017, according to preliminary figures from the New York City Police Department, down from 335 homicides in 2016 and a peak of 2,245 in 1990. Other crimes, including rape, assault, grand larceny and car thefts, also fell from the previous year. The last time crime rates were this low was in the 1950s, NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill said in December. They were the “lowest since reliable records have been kept,” according to The New York Times. The steep declines suggest that defenders of New York’s stop-and-frisk policing were wildly off-base with their apocalyptic predictions. Much of this hand-wringing began in the run-up to the 2013 mayoral election, when many of the Democratic candidates, including the eventual victor, Bill de Blasio, ran as outspoken opponents of the policy. NYPD officers had sharply increased their reliance on stop and frisk in the preceding years, making a record 686,000 stops in 2011, with the vast majority involving younger African-American or Hispanic men. Nearly 90 percent of the people subjected to stops that year were completely innocent, while many others were ticketed or arrested for lower-level charges, often including drug possession, according to NYPD data cited by the New York Civil Liberties Union. And although supporters have touted stop and frisk as an effective deterrent of violent crime, a 2013 review of 4.4 million stops showed that police confiscated just 5,940 firearms, a rate that amounted to roughly 0.1 percent of all encounters. In August 2013, a federal judge ruled NYPD’s broad practice of stop-and-frisk policing unconstitutional, calling it “a demeaning and humiliating experience” for communities of color and a “policy of indirect racial profiling.” The department began to drastically reduce its use of the tactic, and by 2016, it had fallen 98 percent to 12,000 stops. Preliminary figures suggest the number of stops fell again in 2017, though racial disparities are still present. A federal official overseeing police reform efforts in New York also said last year that some officers aren’t properly documenting these encounters. According to defenders of stop and frisk, this downturn in stops should have been disastrous. In the lead-up to the 2013 ruling, then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg lambasted opponents of the tactic, calling the New York Civil Liberties Union “no better than the NRA” for suing the city over the policy. After the ruling, editorials from the New York Daily News and New York Post regularly warned that crime would rise as police backed away from stop and frisk. The outlets published a number of articles that seized on cherry-picked data to fit this narrative, even as overall violent crime continued to decline each year. In an August 2016 column, the editorial board of the New York Daily News finally said it had been wrong about the consequences of reducing these stops. A month later, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump proposed reinstating stop and frisk as a solution to violence in black communities, inaccurately claiming it had “brought the crime rate way down” in New York. With the nation’s most populous city now experiencing historically low crime rates, even some conservative critics are making an about-face. Kyle Smith, a columnist at the National Review, wrote a piece this week admitting “We Were Wrong about Stop-and-Frisk.” Although Smith had predicted that ending the practice would “cause an uptick, maybe even a spike, in crime rates,” he said de Blasio “was correct in saying the city could withstand a sharp decrease in “stop-and-frisk” and “was right to draw attention to the social cost of the practice.” In an email to HuffPost, Smith said he wasn’t a criminologist, but suggested New York’s experience should lead people of all political stripes to ask questions about policing tactics that incur a relatively high social cost for an uncertain benefit. “On the other hand, why has crime come down so much further in New York City than, say, New Orleans or Baltimore or St. Louis? That would seem to draw attention to the quality of policing,” he said. “Because we can’t study crime under lab-controlled conditions, we may never figure all of this out.” “With the nation’s most populous city now experiencing historically low crime rates, even some conservative critics are making an about-face. Kyle Smith, a columnist at the National Review, wrote a piece this week admitting “We Were Wrong about Stop-and-Frisk.”” Smith’s article gratified vocal opponents of stop and frisk. “If conservatives could just acknowledge that some of their racist and s**tty arguments were racist and s**tty, we might be on the road back to a broadly agreed-upon reality upon which we can base our political and legal debates,” wrote Elie Mystal, executive editor of the Above the Law blog. But other conservative pundits continue to claim that New York’s lower crime rates are not evidence of the ineffectiveness of stop and frisk. In a separate column for National Review, Heather Mac Donald argued that “proactive-policing enabled gentrification” had led white “urban hipsters” to replace black “drug dealers and pimps” in many New York neighborhoods, fueling the city’s drop in crime. Mac Donald has been a chief proponent of the so-called “Ferguson effect,” a hotly contested theory holding that recent increases in crime are due to increased scrutiny of law enforcement following the fatal 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. In her column, Mac Donald cited a recent National Academy of Sciences study on proactive policing methods as proof that tactics like stop and frisk have short-term crime reduction effects. They should therefore be replicated in other cities, she wrote, regardless of concerns about racial bias or their potential to fracture relationships between police and the community. While the National Academy of Sciences study does show that stop and frisk can be effective, New York’s program was “indefensible” as it existed at its height, David Weisburd, chair of the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Proactive Policing and a professor of criminology at George Mason University, told HuffPost. NYPD’s indiscriminate use of the tactic provided relatively few benefits in exchange for a high potential for negative effects in the community, he said. “There’s a place for stop, question and frisk in policing, but it’s not a 700,000-stops-in-a-city place, carried out by untrained police officers, newly out of the academy,” Weisburd said. “It shouldn’t be used as a general strategy.

Weisburd said it might still make sense to apply it in a limited fashion in certain “hot spots” as a specific response to elevated levels of gun violence, in which a small percentage of offenders are often responsible for a high proportion of the crime. Such nuanced support for these tactics often gets lost in the current political climate, he said. But more generally, Weisburd cautioned against focusing on a specific data point to make broader arguments in favor or against a policy. “Police aren’t the only thing affecting crime. Economic situations, social factors, shifting norms in the community, those also might affect crime,” he said. “The world is complicated.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Here Comes Another Effort To Undermine Obamacare's Rules For Health Insurance",
    "text": "President Donald Trump’s campaign to roll back the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance reforms just took a step forward. The Department of Labor on Thursday proposed a regulation that would make it easier for some individuals and small businesses to get coverage exempt from some key Obamacare rules, including a requirement that all plans cover 10 “essential” benefits. It’s impossible to say definitively how big an impact the proposed changes would have, or even when or if they will take effect. Like all new regulatory shifts, they must first go through a formal review process, with opportunity for public comment, before they become final. The proposal is also likely to prompt legal challenges, because it calls for changes that may exceed what executive agencies can do on their own, without new acts of Congress. But if the regulation eventually takes effect, Republicans will be closer to their goal of creating an insurance system with fewer rules on what or whom plans must cover. And the health care landscape would look very different as a result. People in good health would have access to cheaper, less generous policies. But it would also mean those who want or need more comprehensive coverage would have a harder time finding it. The Trump administration’s proposed rules focus on association health plans ― AHPs ― which are policies that organizations sell to small businesses or individuals. An example of an AHP would be a policy that a Realtor’s association sells to individual real estate agents, or one that a state business organization sells to family-owned businesses. When the Obama administration wrote the regulations to implement the Affordable Care Act, it was careful to make sure AHPs were subject to the same guidelines on benefits and pricing ― including protections for people with pre-existing conditions ― as other insurance plans serving individuals and small businesses. In other words, the Realtor association’s AHP is subject to the same rules as policies that insurers sell to individuals, directly or through Obamacare’s exchanges. Similarly, the state business organization’s plan is subject to the same rules for all small employers. By writing the regulations in this way, the Obama administration had two goals in mind. One was to protect consumers by making sure all policies were sufficiently comprehensive to cover all medical needs. The other was to ensure all individuals and small businesses were part of the same insurance pool, so that there were enough healthy people paying premiums to cover the high bills of those who needed extensive medical care. Combined with Obamacare’s other features, including subsidies for low- and some middle-income people, this put comprehensive coverage within reach for millions who couldn’t get it before. But it also raised premiums for individuals and small businesses who previously were able to find coverage for much less money ― in part because their plans lacked full coverage for mental health, maternity care, rehabilitative services, or prescriptions. Association health plans could not explicitly discriminate based on health under the proposed new rules. But I have no doubt they would find clever ways of cherry picking healthier people implicitly -- e.g., based on what benefits they cover. Unwinding those changes ― going back to a time when healthy people could get less expensive, less generous policies, even if it raises premiums for more comprehensive coverage ― has been the common thread in pretty much every GOP health policy effort of the last year, including proposals to repeal Obamacare. And that’s very much the goal of the new regulation. Like all such proposals, Thursday’s is dense and will require several days for experts to parse fully. But the gist seems clear. The regulation would modify the regulatory treatment of AHPs so that small businesses and certain individuals ― in particular, sole proprietors who are part of the same industry or live in the same area ― would have access to plans that don’t comply with all of Obamacare’s insurance rules, including the requirement to cover those 10 essential benefits. The primary mechanism for doing this involves a reinterpretation of a separate federal law, called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which governs the insurance plans of large employers and is under the jurisdiction of the Labor Department. That’s why it’s Labor and not, say, the Department of Health and Human Services, proposing the new regulation. And the reinterpretation appears to have some limits. A senior Labor Department official told Stephanie Armour of the Wall Street Journal, who was first to report on the proposal’s substance, that AHPs still could not vary premiums based on health status. That seems to be consistent with the regulation’s wording. But there’s enough confusing language in it ― including a reference to Obamacare’s individual mandate, which Republicans just repealed ― to make the exact significance of many sections ambiguous. That’s especially true because insurance regulation involves multiple, overlapping statutes, and even experts can’t be sure how they are supposed to interact. Several analysts told HuffPost that the proposed regulation might allow AHPs to adjust premiums based on gender, charging women more than men. But the analysts cautioned that they couldn’t be sure of this, because other federal laws might still prohibit that practice. Whatever the regulation’s true limits, it would likely have significant effects. Consider what it would mean for a hypothetical real estate agent. Today, he or she can get an AHP, but it probably doesn’t look much different than the policies available at HealthCare.gov or from insurers directly. If the new regulation goes through, that agent could find an AHP with fewer benefits. It’d probably be cheaper, maybe significantly so, because it wasn’t designed to cover as many medical bills ― and because sicker people would be unlikely to buy it in the first place. As long as that hypothetical agent didn’t need a lot of medical care, he or she would end up saving money. But one who had medical conditions or developed them would end up paying more, because AHPs wouldn’t cover medical bills as completely. Meanwhile, the more comprehensive plans available through HealthCare.gov would be getting more and more expensive, because they’d be attracting a sicker group of enrollees. “My quick take is that they are creating new sets of winners and losers here,” Sabrina Corlette, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms, told HuffPost on Thursday. “In the individual market, winners will be younger people who are ok with skimpier benefits, losers are older folks like early retirees.” Expanded use of AHPs also create more opportunities for deceptive advertising ― or outright fraud ― surrounding the policies. Recent history is littered with cases of people buying AHPs, only to discover gaps in benefits they never knew existed. Other folks have purchased plans that quickly became insolvent. Under the proposed regulation, it’s possible ― although not certain ― more people could end up in plans that the federal government has primary responsibility for regulating, rather than states. But when it comes to issues like insurance fraud and solvency issues, states have more significantly more experience, knowledge, and resources. Since October, when Trump signed an executive order calling on the Labor Department to develop new rules for AHPs, an array of experts and health care groups have warned about the potential to divide insurance markets between healthy and sick ― and to leave patients more exposed to crippling medical bills. On Thursday, those warnings were reiterated. “The rule proposed today will almost certainly result in more people facing financial distress when an unexpected health crisis happens and they discover their AHP coverage is inadequate,” Chris Hansen, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said. But some organizations representing small businesses, including the kind that could have a role in selling AHPs, are welcoming the move. “For years, we’ve called for AHPs to ensure that heath care coverage is within reach for small retailers and their employees, and today’s action by DOL brings us one step closer to making this common sense reform a reality,” David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, said. The proposal is also winning praise from conservatives, especially Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has been talking up the idea for years.

Insurance regulation falls under multiple federal laws and it’s entirely possible that the attempt to change AHP regulations go beyond what those statutes allow. Lawsuits are a near certainty and they could tie up the regulation in courts for months, maybe years. But Republicans have been pushing to relax the rules for AHPs for a long time.

    "title": "Oil Industry Seals Two Arctic Drilling Wins As Fierce East Coast Storm Fuels Climate Fears",
    "text": "With timing too unsubtle for fiction, the oil industry notched two major victories on Thursday as a “bomb cyclone” storm battered the East Coast ― a sign, scientists say, of things to come as the Arctic warms. On Thursday afternoon, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced plans to open virtually all U.S. waters to drilling, include huge swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific oceans. On the opposite side of the Atlantic, a Norwegian court ruled against environmentalists who sued to block the oil-rich Scandinavian nation from allowing Arctic drilling. The Trump administration’s decision could have much farther-reaching consequences. The draft plan, released Thursday, makes roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf available for leasing. The Interior Department already identified 47 potential lease sales, including 19 off Alaska’s coast and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico, Zinke said in a call with reporters. The five-year plan opens the Atlantic to drilling for the first time since the 1980s, drawing criticism from even hardline Republicans, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R). Yet the decision marked a clear win for the oil and gas industry, which began pushing its lengthy wishlist to the administration the weeks after Trump won in November 2016. The American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s main lobby, said the announcement put the country “on the right track towards increased energy production, economic growth, and job creation.” “This new offshore leasing plan is an important step towards harnessing our nation’s energy potential for the benefit of American energy consumers,” Erik Milito, API’s upstream director, said in a statement. “The ability to safely and responsibly access and explore our resources in the Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific and the Eastern Gulf of Mexico is a critical part of advancing the long-term energy security of the U.S.” The Interior Department did not take questions from HuffPost during the call, and did not respond to an email asking whether its officials had calculated the impact the increased drilling would have on climate change and sea-level rise. But the announcement, buttressed by the Norwegian ruling, comes as an unusual cold snap culminated with a monster storm blanketing states from Maine to north Florida with snow. The hurricane-like storm, called a “bomb cyclone,” occurs when hot and cold temperatures collide over water and cause pressure to drop rapidly, at a rate of 1 millibar per hour, over a 24-hour period. It’s difficult to draw a straight line between an individual weather event and the warming climate. But a study released in September found a growing number of extreme cold fronts hitting northern regions as the Arctic heats up at a rate twice as fast as the rest of Earth. That may seem counterintuitive, but the researchers argued that the rising temperatures cause a chain reaction. With less sea ice, the ocean releases more energy. That heat escapes into the atmosphere and weakens the polar vortex winds that swirl over the Arctic and normally keep cold air contained to the region. That weakening allows the frigid air to slip southward more frequently. “These cold air masses, when they travel over warming waters, the possibility, the probability, of more of these explosively developing cyclones, particularly in populated coastal areas are going to get much more severe,” John Gyakum, the McGill University meteorology professor who helped coin the term “bomb cyclone” in 1980, told HuffPost on Wednesday.

    "title": "'One Day At A Time' Trailer Reveals New Season Will Tackle Xenophobia",
    "text": "The Alvarez family will soon be bringing the laughs ― and the feels ― to Netflix once again. The streaming service released a trailer on Thursday for Season 2 of “One Day At A Time,” which follows single mom and Army vet Penelope Alvarez (Justina Machado) as she raises her two children with the help of her mother, Lydia (Rita Moreno). All three generations of the Cuban-American family tackled some big changes last season, which included a coming-out arc for Penelope’s daughter and a storyline about divorce. The show doesn’t seem to be shying away from big topics in its second season, either, as the trailer shows Penelope’s son, Alex, dealing with xenophobic comments. In the trailer, Penelope enters the apartment with Alex and tells the family he punched another kid. When it comes time for Alex to explain himself, he says that the other boy had used the terms “beaner” and “wetback” ― derogatory expressions often used against Latino immigrants. “One Day At A Time” is a reboot of Norman Lear’s 1970s sitcom of the same name. Netflix first did a 13-episode straight-to-series order for the show in January 2016, and the remake featuring a Latino family debuted a year later. The entire second season will be available Jan. 26. Watch the full trailer above.

    "title": "Internet Trolls Oregonians After Self-Serve Gas Law Takes Effect",
    "text": "It’s a new year with a bevy of new rules. For Oregonians, a self-serve gas law that took effect Monday has ricocheted to the top of Internet chatter. House Bill 2482, which was signed into law last year by Gov. Kate Brown, allows motorists to pump their own gas in nearly half of Oregon’s 36 counties. Oregon and New Jersey had long been the only two states in the U.S. to bar customers from pumping their own fuel ― a job performed by gas station attendants. The new law likely would have gained little notice if not for a CBS affiliate in Medford, Oregon, which asked its Facebook followers to weigh in. The responses they received ― both serious and whimsical ― prompted the post to go viral over the weekend. As of Tuesday, it had been shared more than 20,000 times and drew more than 18,000 comments. A sampling of concerns: “I don’t even know HOW to pump gas and I am 62, native Oregonian … I say NO THANKS! I don’t want to smell like gasoline!” “I’ve lived in this state all my life and I REFUSE to pump my own gas … This a service only qualified people should perform. I will literally park at the pump and wait until someone pumps my gas.” “I go to work at 5 in the morning. Not a lot of people at the gas pumps at that time in the morning. And yes, I will not feel safe pumping my own gas … Not to mention it’s freezing and rainy. So thank you to all who voted to change it. You have now taken away a nice luxury that most of us enjoyed.” “Many people are not capable of knowing how to pump gas and the hazards of not doing it correctly. Besides I don’t want to go to work smelling of gas when I get it on my hands or clothes. I agree Very bad idea.” “Yuck! Pumping my [own] fuel in freezing temperatures and handling a nasty ole fuel nozzle that 50 other people have touched that day (and who knows what cooties are on there), no thank you. It’s nice to not have to pump your own fuel.” While it’s impossible to determine which comments are genuine and which are sarcastic, the Internet was quick to poke fun at the Beaver State. Here’s a sampling of the responses: “Apparently there’s an entire state of people in America who are incapable of filling their own car with petrol.” “FEAR NOT OREGON!!!! I’ve decided to move to Oregon to open a school to teach people how to pump their own gas … I understand Oregon, adulting is hard and sometimes you [need] someone to show you how. I’m here for you.” “Omg this post is hilarious!! I’m in Wisconsin and with the wind chill it’s currently -17. You know what I did this morning?! Had to pump my own flipping gas!! It’s not that hard people!!” “Apparently most people in Oregon assume that in order to pump gas you must first remove all people from the vehicle and stand in the open while thugs attack from all angles, all while being sprayed with gas.” “ERMAHGERD we gotta pump our own petrol!!! These comments have made my day.” Obviously, not everyone in Oregon is an entitled snowflake, and for those who do have real concerns ― the elderly or disabled ― they should rest easy knowing that the Americans With Disabilities Act mandates that service stations offer aid. Still, some of the comments and responses are pretty funny. And for those who really hate pumping gas, The Bend Bulletin reports that several gas stations they contacted had no plans of changing from full service. “Honestly, I don’t think we’re going to make a change,” said cashier Shelby Perkins at the 76 station in Prineville. “Our regular, longtime customers love coming here and talking to us while we pump their gas.” Besides, she added, many of their regulars probably don’t know how to work a gas pump. Corina Wright, manager of Towne Pump & Pantry in Prineville, told The Bulletin that their attendants will also continue to pump gas for customers. “It’s staying the way it is,” she said. And for those who’ve never pumped gas and find themselves in a situation where they have no choice, there’s always YouTube: Send David Lohr an email or follow him on Facebook and Twitter.

    "title": "Utah Senator Orrin Hatch Announces Retirement",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), the longest-serving Senate Republican, announced on Tuesday that he will retire at the end of this year. “After much prayer and discussion with family and friends, I have decided to retire at the end of this term,” Hatch said in a video posted on Twitter. An announcement from Senator Orrin G. Hatch. #utpol pic.twitter.com/UeItaLjR3j The announcement has reignited speculation that 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has been exploring a possible Senate bid, will seek the seat. Romney’s Twitter account was updated on Tuesday with a new location, hinting at a future run for Senate. Instead of “Massachusetts,” it now reads “Holladay, Utah,” where he owns a home. Hatch’s expected retirement is a blow for President Donald Trump, who considered the seven-term senator a close ally and had urged him to stay in office. The Utah senator recently helped lead Republican efforts to pass a tax reform bill last month, and gave an effusive speech praising Trump at a White House celebration. Responding to Hatch’s announcement on Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump is “very sad” that Hatch is leaving, singling out his efforts on tax reform. “The president certainly has the greatest and deepest amount of respect for Sen. Hatch and his over four decades of experience in the Senate,” she said. It would be a thorn in Trump’s side if Romney runs for Hatch’s seat. The 2012 GOP nominee has continually spoken out against the president, criticizing his comments about white supremacists over the summer. In a March 2016 speech during the Republican presidential primaries, Romney went after Trump as a “phony” and a “fraud.” Hatch, 83, has grown unpopular among Utah voters. A Salt Lake Tribune poll in October found that 75 percent of respondents said he should retire, including 56 percent saying that he “definitely should not” run again.

Last month, the newspaper published a scathing editorial on Hatch, calling for his retirement and criticizing his support of Trump’s policies and “utter lack of integrity that rises from his unquenchable thirst for power.” “It would be good for Utah if Hatch, having finally caught the Great White Whale of tax reform, were to call it a career,” the editorial board wrote. “If he doesn’t, the voters should end it for him.” The editorial also characterized Trump’s recent decision to slash the size of two national monuments in Utah, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante, as “a political favor...done in return for Hatch’s support of the president generally and of his tax reform plan in particular.” Two other GOP senators have announced their 2018 retirements: Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who have been much more critical of Trump. This story has been updated to reflect that Romney’s Twitter account was changed to a new location.

    "title": "America Is Sinking, And Only The People Can Rescue It. Here's How.",
    "text": "We are in the midst of a national emergency, and the elections in November will signal whether America is still serious about being a democracy. A president is actively attacking democratic structures and norms while intentionally stoking racial tensions. Civility itself is endangered. Our elections are not secure and voter suppression is on the rise. There is an active campaign by a foreign government to interfere directly in our discourse, sow chaos and impact our vote. Dark money is everywhere. And on top of all that, a good third or more of the country does not believe any of the above. And they will not believe it for the foreseeable future: right wing media will continue to spin lies and paint alternative realities, facilitating doubt and muddying facts. In other words, the democracy is in peril. Our ship is sinking. America is a majestic ship, constructed in the late 1700s ― it’s worn-in, but still seaworthy. We (the passengers) co-own the vessel and hire the crew. For the most part, we agree on certain things: people should have a right to live peacefully; we should come together in times of distress and when our values are threatened; we should treat each other fairly and aspire to provide everyone with access to essential resources needed to exist free of suffering. There are many destinations to sail toward, and we are generally split between a few options. We disagree ― often passionately ― about which island to head for. But at the moment, we have a bigger problem than arguing over where to steer. The crew, led by an unpredictable and arrogant captain, has started sabotaging the USS America: disrupting the communication systems, drilling holes in the hull, hoarding rations for allies. They’ve started false rumors to pit groups of passengers against each other. The ship is taking on water. Systems are in disarray. Communications are down. If we argue right now about which island to go to, we’ll be arguing as the ship sinks into the cold, dark waters of the night. We’ll never see any island. So, we are left with a choice. Do we, the passengers and owners of the vessel, band together to save the ship, or do we keep arguing about which island to steer toward? Hopefully the answer is obvious. We, the rational passengers, must see past our ideological differences and band together to see that our ship gets repaired. This will require replacing all of the sycophantic crew members with people who have the moral foundation and the guts to wrestle control of the ship’s systems from the unprincipled captain. First, we need to define a plan: a set of policies and principles that we expect the next Congress to take immediate and decisive action on to ensure our vessel remains seaworthy. Second, we need to replace all crew members who have aided and abetted the sabotaging of our democracy with honorable citizens who will commit to doing the repair work. The GOP in its current form simply cannot be trusted with legislative control or executive oversight. They must be replaced with Democrats in massive numbers. As we vet candidates during this campaign season, we should ensure that they are ready to engage in the hard work ahead. Keeping in mind that the next Congress will have the unique historical role of shepherding our very democracy, here is a draft action plan for their repair work and the rhetorical/ethical postures they must take: The fact that the ship is taking on water has ― at the very least ― awoken the passengers to the reality that America can actually sink. Our appreciation for the builders’ original vision has been renewed, but the sabotage wrought by Trump & the GOP has also exposed some long-concealed (or long-ignored) vulnerabilities. What if American citizens of disparate ideology took a step back to survey our ship’s damage and decided to come together and demand that our elected officials actually fix what needs fixing?

    "title": "U.S. To Suspend Security Aid To Pakistan",
    "text": "WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it was suspending security assistance to Pakistan, which one official said was worth more than $255 million, until Islamabad takes action against the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. The U.S. State Department announced the decision, saying it reflected the Trump administration’s frustration that Pakistan has not done more against the two groups, which have long used sanctuaries in Pakistan to launch attacks in neighboring Afghanistan that have killed U.S., Afghan and other forces. The State Department declined to say precisely how much aid would be suspended, saying the numbers were still being calculated and that they included funding from both the State and Defense departments. However, a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the newly suspended aid, which covers transfers of military equipment as well as reimbursements for Pakistani counterterrorism operations, would amount to more than $255 million. Earlier this year the United States suspended a separate $255 million in so-called foreign military financing, which funds purchases of U.S. military hardware, training and services. “It’s north of $255 million,” said the U.S. official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, of the newly suspended sums. Earlier, a State Department spokeswoman said the money could go through if Islamabad took decisive action against the groups. She also said exceptions could be made to the suspension. “Today we can confirm that we are suspending ... security assistance only to Pakistan at this time until the Pakistani government takes decisive action against groups including the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. We consider them to be destabilizing the region and also targeting U.S. personnel,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a regular news briefing.

    "text": "Paris Hilton is trading the simple life for the married life. The reality TV star and heiress said she’s engaged to actor Chris Zylka after nearly a year of dating. He popped the question atop a mountain in Aspen, Colorado, during a New Year’s weekend ski vacation. “I am so excited to be engaged to the love of my life and my best friend,” Hilton told People. “I have never felt so happy, safe and loved. He is perfect for me in every way and showed me that fairytales really do exist!” Hilton was briefly engaged to fashion model Jason Shaw in 2003, and later to Greek shipping heir Paris Latsis. Zylka and Hanna Beth, a model and designer, were set to be married in 2014, but ended their engagement the following year. A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton) on Dec 30, 2017 at 3:14am PST “Paris is the most beautiful and incredible woman both inside and out,” Zylka told People. “I feel like the luckiest man in the world to be marrying my dream girl. I can’t wait to spend the rest of our lives together.” The socialite called her new diamond sparkler the “most beautiful ring that I’ve ever seen,” and flashed the bling for a photo shoot because, of course, she did. The impossibly blonde duo first met at an Oscars party eight years ago, but their paths didn’t cross again until 2015, when their romance began. Hilton made the relationship Instagram-official in February with a series of Valentine’s Day tweets featuring “The Leftovers” star. “Ever since our first date I knew there was something special about him,” Hilton explained. “I have never in my life met a man so loyal, dedicated, and loving. I knew right from the start that I wanted to be with him forever.” A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton) on Dec 30, 2017 at 4:40am PST A post shared by Paris Hilton (@parishilton) on Dec 26, 2017 at 12:41am PST And if you needed any more convincing that Zylka is the real deal, he actually got Hilton’s name inked on his forearm (in her favorite Disney font, of course), because nothing says commitment like a tattoo you’ll probably regret later. 2018 ...

    "title": "Paul Sorvino Threatens To Kill Harvey Weinstein For Blacklisting Daughter Mira",
    "text": "Paul Sorvino said he was “furious” to find out that Hollywood heavy Harvey Weinstein derailed his daughter’s acting career because she spurned his sexual advances, and threatened, “I will kill that motherfucker.” “He ought to hope he goes to jail, because if we come across [each other], I think he’ll be lying on the floor, somehow, magically,” Sorvino, a singer and “Goodfellas” actor, said in a TMZ video interview published Wednesday. Sorvino’s daughter, Mira Sorvino, has revealed that she rejected Weinstein’s unwanted sexual advances when they worked together on the 1995 comedy “Mighty Aphrodite.” Two directors ― Terry Zwigoff of “Bad Santa” and Peter Jackson of the “Lord of the Rings” franchise ― recently came forward to say Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein orchestrated a smear campaign against Mira Sorvino to prevent her from movie roles. Paul Sorvino said he didn’t know about the blacklisting before his daughter and other actresses spoke out against Weinstein’s predatory behavior last year ― and was “furious” to find out. He predicted Weinstein will end up in jail. The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office is considering charges against Weinstein involving two sex-crimes complaints. “Oh, yeah. That son-of-a-bitch better hope that he goes, because if he doesn’t, he’ll have to meet me, and I will kill that motherfucker,” Sorvino said in the TMZ interview. “It’s real simple.” Mira Sorvino told The New Yorker in an article published in October that Weinstein pursued her in a hotel room during promotions for “Mighty Aphrodite.” He started massaging her shoulders before trying “to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,” Sorvino said. Weeks later, Sorvino said Weinstein invited himself to her New York City apartment after midnight on the pretense of work. He “became dejected and left” when she mentioned a fake boyfriend, according to the report. Mira Sorvino said in a tweet that she “burst out crying” after Jackson apologized for going along with the Weinsteins’ blacklisting. “There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure,” she wrote. She said in The New Yorker report that she hesitated to share her story about Weinstein because it wasn’t as bad as other women’s experiences, and because of the producer’s role in “Mighty Aphrodite.” Sorvino won an Oscar in 1996 for the film. Still, Paul Sorvino told TMZ that if he had known how Weinstein treated his daughter, “he would not be walking.” “He would be on a wheelchair,” the father said. “He’s gonna go to jail and die in jail,” Paul Sorvino continued. “If he doesn’t, Harvey, I’ve got some news for you.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "Philip Morris Says It's 'Trying To Give Up Cigarettes' In 2018",
    "text": "Tobacco giant Philip Morris International took out full-page ads in several British newspapers this week proclaiming the company’s 2018 New Year’s resolution as “trying to give up cigarettes.” “Our ambition is to stop selling cigarettes in the UK,” the ad says, according to a screenshot from Business Insider. The message says even though it’s best for smokers to quit, many will continue to smoke. “That’s why we want to replace cigarettes with products, such as e-cigarettes and heated tobacco, which are a better choice for the millions of men and women in the UK who would otherwise not stop smoking,” the ad says. E-cigarettes carry health risks, so much so that they are banned in public spaces in some U.S. states. In October, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed a law prohibiting individuals from using e-cigarettes and other vaping systems in public indoor spaces. “These products are marketed as a healthier alternative to cigarettes, but the reality is they also carry long-term risks to the health of users and those around them,” Cuomo said at the time. Anti-smoking advocates called Philip Morris’ full-page ad a “PR stunt,” according to the BBC. And, as USA Today points out, the World Health Organization has made it clear that it would not engage with the tobacco giant’s efforts to promote alternative smoking methods. “The tobacco industry and its front groups have misled the public about the risks associated with other tobacco products. This includes promoting so-called light and mild tobacco products as an alternative to quitting, while being fully aware that those products were not less harmful to health,” WHO said in September.

WHO said Philip Morris continues its “misleading conduct” by “marketing tobacco products in ways that misleadingly suggest that some tobacco products are less harmful than others.” According to the U.S. surgeon general, e-cigarettes pose health risks to users and those around them. “Besides increasing the possibility of addiction and long-term harm to brain development and respiratory health, e-cigarette use is associated with the use of other tobacco products that can do even more damage to the body,“ the surgeon general’s website states. “Even breathing e-cigarette aerosol that someone else has exhaled poses potential health risks.”",

    "text": "The evidence in favor of America’s independence from British rule continues to accumulate. In an interview with U.K.’s iNews on the importance of breakfast for hungry schoolchildren, Pippa Middleton, sister to the Duchess of Cambridge, fired a shot at a delicious breakfast favorite. “Pancakes with bacon and maple syrup — that certainly doesn’t do it for me,” said Middleton, a spokesperson for the charity Magic Breakfast, which aims to feed children who don’t eat breakfast before school. Since she’s advocating for a good cause, we’ll give her a pass. Sure, heading into work with a belly full of pillowy starch cakes swimming in sugary tree juice doesn’t sound very ... comfortable. But on a Saturday morning, with no reason to wear pants for the rest of the day, hit us with some flapjacks. Middleton says her breakfasts usually consist of “plain yogurt with chopped fruit and toasted seeds, oats and nuts or toasted rye bread with eggs or avocado.” It should be noted that the interview did not specify whether Middleton thought pancakes for dinner was acceptable.

    "title": "Politically Homeless: How Both Parties Are Leaving A Generation Of Christians Behind",
    "text": "I feel politically homeless as we enter 2018, and I know I am not alone. Many Christians are feeling the same, as other Christians ― especially white evangelicals ― have undertaken completely uncritical support for a president who is the antithesis of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, endangering the reputation of Christianity, especially among a new generation. Of course, the two political parties are not morally equivalent; it makes a great difference how we vote, as we will have the opportunity to do later this year. The Republican Party’s political sellout to Donald Trump ― and the lack of a clear moral alternative by the Democrats many people of faith are excited to support — leaves many of us feeling politically homeless. Republican leadership has sold its party’s soul to a bad, amoral, childish and dangerous man. Most of my Republican friends agree. Trump was elected president by anti-establishment backlash and in a series of political accidents by both parties, many candidates and our electoral system. He has been revealed as an intellectually shallow and mentally incompetent leader; a person who lacks any moral conscience; an unapologetic promoter of racial bigotry and misogyny; a personality with embarrassing emotional immaturity and alarming instability that threatens disorder in the nation; and a leader whose disrespect for the rule of law and our political system of checks and balances can best be described as narcissistic and authoritarian paranoia. The President of the United States is now a very dangerous threat to American democracy and national security. While there are some Republican commentators and elected officials who have voiced opposition to the president’s behavior, the Republican Party has shown itself unable or unwilling to hold him accountable and has, in fact, become a captured party by an aspiring autocrat who is telling the world that he has the biggest nuclear button. The GOP has disregarded the best values of principled conservatism: fiscal integrity and responsibility, an allegiance to truth and honesty, genuine pro-family values, national security through global engagement, the commitment to opportunity for all, the value of empathy for those in need and the worth and equality of every person under the law. The Republicans have substituted a moral relationship to the presidency for a transactional one, ignoring Trump’s consistent incompetence, immorality and hateful divisiveness of the tweeting President. In exchange for economic and environmental regulations and tax cuts that support the greedy demands of their wealthiest donors. All this makes many conservatives with Christian and other moral values feel politically homeless. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, has lost its historic relationship to working class people around the country, and has indeed become dominated by cultural elites who have little connection to ordinary families and the many pressures on their lives. Democratic Party rhetoric doesn’t appeal to the values of many Christians who care most about poverty and racism. For many election cycles, Democratic consultants have replaced the word “poor” with the words “middle class,” and the party is no longer perceived as one that cares nearly enough about the needs of people on the margins of life in America. The text from Matthew 25 that draws many Christians into engaging in politics does not say, “As you have done to the middle class, you have done to me.” It rather has Jesus saying to us, “As you have done to the least of these, you have done to me.” It’s a Biblical text many Democratic consultants seem not to have read or have forgotten. “It was once said that the moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.” Those words from Hubert H. Humphrey would likely not be described as the mission of Democrats today, many of whom are as connected to the Wall Street elites as the Republicans are. Despite being dependent on African-American voters, the Democratic Party has often taken them for granted instead of courageously addressing the realities of institutionalized racism and by refusing to invest in organizers, mobilizers and candidates in African-American and Latinx communities. Unfortunately, the Democrats are no longer a faith-friendly party. Voters with religious faith are often ignored or even dismissed without serious outreach or respectful dialogue. I have fought religious fundamentalism for most of my life, but the secular fundamentalism that controls much of the left and the Democratic Party at the national level can be equally ideological, irrational and divisive ― too often even seeming to attack religion itself. Moral issues of intrinsic concern to the faith community are often disregarded or disrespected by Democratic Party orthodoxy, which often takes extreme or overly strident views on issues like abortion. Many of us in the faith community regard abortion as a moral issue and part of a consistent ethic of life and seamless garment of concern for the many threats to human life and dignity. While many of us pro-life Christians don’t support the criminalization of often desperate and tragic choices, we find the Democrats even reluctant to make a commitment to reducing abortion by supporting women with health care, nutrition and social services. Many in Democratic leadership don’t seem to want to talk about or even being willing to use the word “reduction” as a positive term in relation to abortion.

While you can’t resolve an issue as complex as abortion in a couple of paragraphs, the denial of a moral conversation about it within the Democratic Party continues to alienate many people of faith. While a younger generation in the faith community is indeed more welcoming of LGBTQ people than their parents have been, they are not so welcoming of abortion as the Democratic elites seem to be, and the Democratic Party needs to figure that out. Gratefully, there are Democrats who want a more faith-friendly party and wider inclusion of ideas, but I still hear many progressive Christian women and men feeling that the Democratic Party makes no outreach to them and offers them very little. Elements of the Democrats’ richest donor base continue to enforce extreme positions on abortion, not allow serious moral discussions and seem to want to close the party’s tent to pro-life Democrats. Similarly, the central importance of marriage, family and parenting for the common good of society is not a central topic in Democratic Party language and policy. Many people of faith are turned away by Democrats’ perceived endorsement, whether intentional or by marked silence, of recreational sexuality over covenantal sexuality and an “anything goes” attitude when it comes to sex. Why is the discussion of family values ― among every type of family ― so absent from conversations on the left when we know it is a part of critical solutions to overcoming issues of poverty? Those voices on the left advocating for strengthening families are seldom heard. With part of the Christian community putting faith at risk by their idolatrous support of Donald Trump, and other Christians feeling alienated by the other party’s dismissal of faith and the moral questions it raises, our nation’s moral discourse is in serious trouble. Third parties have not been a successful way forward in the American system of politics. But perhaps a “third way” or better yet a “moral movement” to revive and renew American politics, on both sides of the aisle, is the way forward for people of faith who put the poor and vulnerable, the consistent dignity of human life, strong families and gender equality and the priority of racial and economic justice and peace at the center of their political convictions.

    "text": "Three days after California legalized the use of recreational marijuana, Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday indicated he intends to reverse an Obama-era federal policy that discouraged federal prosecution of the drug in states where it was legal. Lawmakers in states that have legalized the drug for medical and/or recreational purposes reacted negatively to the news, many of them calling out Sessions’ inconsistency on states’ rights. Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), whose state legalized recreational use of the drug in 2012, called out the attorney general in a fiery speech on the Senate floor Thursday, claiming Sessions has gone back on a private assurance he gave before his confirmation at the Justice Department. Gardner also railed against the Trump administration’s habit of making drastic policy changes on a dime. “One tweet later, one policy later ― a complete reversal of what many of us on the Hill were told before the confirmation,” he said. “Without any notification, conversation or dialogue with Congress, completely reversed.” Sen. Cory Gardner angrily responds to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' memo on marijuana policy. \"One tweet later, one policy later, a complete reversal of what many of us on the Hill were told before the confirmation.\" https://t.co/NkJuIoh4fP pic.twitter.com/J4RZmkVM8U “This must be left up to the states,” Gardner had tweeted earlier, adding that he is “prepared to take all steps necessary,” including holding up Justice Department nominees, until Sessions stands down. This reported action directly contradicts what Attorney General Sessions told me prior to his confirmation. With no prior notice to Congress, the Justice Department has trampled on the will of the voters in CO and other states. I am prepared to take all steps necessary, including holding DOJ nominees, until the Attorney General lives up to the commitment he made to me prior to his confirmation. Colorado has so far collected over half a billion dollars in cannabis tax revenue. The funds have become essential for lawmakers as they seek to patch holes in the state budget. Other lawmakers ― Democrats, Republicans and independents alike ― also reacted negatively to Thursday’s news. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) called Sessions’ act “disruptive” and “regrettable”: pic.twitter.com/xjQOTx6MtS Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) called it a “direct attack on patients”: This reported decision is a direct attack on patients. Parents should be able to give their kids the medicine they need without fear of prosecution. Veterans should be able to come home from combat and use the medicine they need without fear of prosecution. https://t.co/ra43TqWsQE This is about public health. You can join me in fighting back by calling for support for my bill, the CARERS Act, which keeps the federal government out of the way when doctors and patients decide that medical marijuana is the best treatment for them. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) pledged to “vigorously defend our state’s laws against undue federal infringement”: Make no mistake: As we have told the Department of Justice ever since I-502 was passed in 2012, we will vigorously defend our state’s laws against undue federal infringement. https://t.co/R3jJrncN9X pic.twitter.com/uM48hVH26q In Massachusetts, which only recently legalized the drug, the state’s Cannabis Control Commission said its role of fulfilling the will of the voters “remains the same.” .@MA_Cannabis statement regarding anticipated repeal of @TheJusticeDept Cole memo which has allowed cannabis industry to go forward despite federal laws against it. #mapoli pic.twitter.com/LQnQP2UeCM In Vermont, where the state legislature is expected to vote early this year to legalize the drug, lawmakers declined Thursday to delay that decision in spite of the news from Washington. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) also called out Sessions on Twitter: No, Attorney General Sessions. Marijuana is not the same as heroin. No one who has seriously studied the issue believes that. Quite the contrary. We should allow states the right to move toward the decriminalization of marijuana, not reverse the progress that has been made. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) suggested the Trump administration would do better to focus on the opioid epidemic: We have an opioids epidemic. But there is no such thing as a marijuana epidemic. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) also angrily voiced his dissent. Dear Attorney General Jeff Sessions and @TheJusticeDept: Let me give you a list of things more important for federal prosecutors and federal law enforcement to pursue other than marijuana:1. Basically anything. https://t.co/ctyJui7g4c AG Jeff Sessions apparently wants to take America back to the 1920s. Prohibition didn't work then and it will not work now. Congress needs to pass sensible laws to prevent a monumental waste of precious federal resources chasing Americans who use #cannabis. #thursdaythoughts https://t.co/GP3qPyKIve Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) also called out President Donald Trump for breaking his promise to uphold states’ rights. Trump promised to let states set marijuana policies. Now he's breaking that promise so Jeff Sessions can pursue his extremist anti-marijuana crusade. https://t.co/EhxfVdC3so Wyden’s colleague, Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) went a step further, calling Sessions’ move “perhaps one of the stupidest decisions the Attorney General has made” and noting that it directly contradicts a Trump campaign promise: This is outrageous. Going against the majority of Americans—including a majority of Republican voters—who want the federal government to stay out of the way is perhaps one of the stupidest decisions the Attorney General has made. https://t.co/favJUDVBiA One wonders if Trump was consulted—it is Jeff Sessions after all—because this would violate his campaign promise not to interfere with state marijuana laws. It’s time for ANYONE who cares about this issue to mobilize and push back strongly against this decision. https://t.co/S0neITlP5q Rep. Dina Titus (D-Nev.) also called out Sessions’ hypocrisy on states’ rights: I will fight for businesses that are legally operating in states, contributing to tax bases, & creating jobs. We don't need a crackdown. We need to protect states' rights, respect the voice of voters, and pass laws to prevent this from happening again. https://t.co/0XBLrgf0iM As did Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.): The war on drugs didn’t stop drug usage; it just ruined a lot of lives. Jeff Sessions is reviving it because he believes in using the criminal justice system as an instrument of racial and economic control of poor people and brown people. https://t.co/XRd8OldE2N Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) used the moment to go on the offensive and push for the government to remove marijuana from the list of federally controlled substances. RT if you think it's time Congress takes up my bill H.R. 1227, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act to remove marijuana from the list of federally controlled substances. https://t.co/SbJjFcz05n Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also echoed the states’ rights line: Statement from @RandPaul on Sessions rescinding Obama-era marijuana guidance to U.S. Attorneys: \"I continue to believe that this is a states’ rights issue, and the federal government has better things to focus on.\" As did Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.): Sessions will end policy that allowed legalized marijuana to prosper https://t.co/Jrx50hRwme Sessions & Trump for states rights to secede and discriminate but not to innovate and be as Justice Brandeis said,”the laboratories of democracy.”Opioid crisis and no action.Pot?Get real Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson (D) said he was taken aback that Sessions would make such a move “after refusing multiple requests” to meet with state officials there: AG Ferguson response on reported action by US AG Jeff Sessions on federal marijuana policy.

Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) reminded everyone that Sessions’ decision will ultimately hurt people of color the most: Let’s be clear: Trump’s decision to prosecute marijuana use will hurt Black and Latino youth the most.

    "title": "Why Kids Across The U.S. Are Writing Books About Female Heroes",
    "text": "At a time when the news seems to be an endless cycle of stories about powerful men abusing women, one initiative is seeking to lift up stories of strong women by having kids write about them. The National Youth Foundation, a small nonprofit that three Pennsylvania women started last March to improve literacy and educate children about social justice, organizes book-writing competitions for kids. Its first project was centered on tolerance, and the theme of its latest contest is “local heroines” ― which kids can interpret however they’d like. A girl in Philadelphia wrote her book about Lady B, one of the earliest female rappers. Another writer in Wyoming interviewed Gillette Mayor Louise Carter-King, the first female mayor of the city. Recent news about sexual harassment has made the theme feel all the more urgent, National Youth Foundation co-founder Sophia Hanson told HuffPost in November. “This is a very difficult time to be raising daughters,” said Hanson, who is the mother of two girls, ages 7 and 11. “I think what we’re experiencing in our society is a fundamental disrespect for women ― you’re not valued for your work, you’re seen as an object. For the students writing these books, they’re going to gain some respect for women.” Hanson, along with co-founders Jamee Joppy and Carolyn Crawford, said the writing competition started last year, after Scholastic ended a national book-writing contest it had organized for 30 years. Hanson, who had volunteered to help kids in that contest and whose daughters had participated, saw its ending as “a huge void.” The organization also conducts writing workshops for kids in low-income communities, working in classrooms to help students write a book together and get it printed. The women run the grassroots nonprofit on a volunteer basis, relying on donations from individuals and some business sponsorships. “We promote diversity and equality through children’s literacy,” Hanson said. “We’re letting the kids tell the stories on how to make the world more tolerant. It lets kids know they can take action.” “We’re letting the kids tell the stories on how to make the world more tolerant.” Hanson and her co-founders said they decided to focus on female leaders because they believe that not enough women are recognized for their achievements and contributions to society. She recalled sending her daughters into the aisles of an Ivy League school’s bookstore this year, asking them to find biographies on women. All they could find were books on Harriet Tubman and Queen Victoria. In an analysis of history books published in 2015, Slate found that more than 70 percent of the biographies were written about men. “How can you aspire to be that if you’ve never seen it? You don’t know it exists,” Hanson said. “It’s usually the same standard women that you read about ― but for men, you have much more. We need this to inspire the next generation.” The theme of local heroines in particular has resonated with two educators whose students are participating in the new contest. Both said students often point to celebrities when asked to name remarkable women. “This initiative is so important because strong girls need to be writing strong pieces about other strong women in our communities,” said Maggie Unterseher, an elementary school librarian in Gillette, Wyoming. Sandrien De Brujuin, an immigrant from the Netherlands, said simply joining the competition has been a major victory for her daughter, Carlijn.

Last fall, the fourth-grader had a sign taped to her door as she worked on the competition: “Writing a book, please do not come in!” Kids entering the competition had until Jan. 4 to write and illustrate a 20- to 30-page book about a woman they admire. The winner, announced by March 26, will get $500 in prize money, and their book will get printed in hard copy and donated to libraries and schools across the country. By December, several dozen kids across the country had planned to submit their work, and libraries and schools in at least 10 states had agreed to feature the winning book.",

    "title": "Quarter Of World's Land Will Be Permanently Drier If Paris Climate Goals Not Met: Study",
    "text": "If the Earth’s temperature rises by 2 degrees Celsius in the next 30-some years, more than 25 percent of the earth will dry up, according to a new climate study. Projections of 27 global climate models determined that 24 to 32 percent of the world’s total land surface would suffer from aridification with a 2 degree increase, according to a Nature Climate Change study published Monday. But efforts to limit that temperature change to only 1.5 degrees would prevent the drying out of about two-thirds of the areas that are at risk, according to the report. Major population areas, including Southern Europe, Southern Africa, Central America, coastal Australia and Southeast Asia, would be spared from significantly drying out. The Paris climate accord set out to keep the global temperature rise below the 2 degree mark this century, aiming to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees. Yet the study predicts changes that would occur before 2070, and recommended that countries act even sooner than that to forestall increasing dryness. Taking early action on combating temperature increases, the report added, can “markedly reduce the likelihood that large regions will face substantial aridification and related impacts.” While some countries are encouraging the world to meet these targets, the United States has relinquished responsibility in doing its share, even though Americans produce more carbon dioxide per person than any other country ― in 2014, the per capita figure was more than double that of China. President Donald Trump, who had advocated a resurrection of the coal industry, withdrew from the climate pact in June and his administration has tirelessly worked to dismantle numerous Environmental Protection Agency regulations. “In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against,” he tweeted last week.

    "title": "Rashida Jones: The Golden Globes' Red Carpet Blackout Won’t Be A Silent Protest",
    "text": "The Golden Globes should be an affair to remember this year, as many actresses prepare to take a stand against sexual harassment on Sunday night. Rashida Jones is just one of the 300 women in television, film and theater who launched the Time’s Up initiative on Monday, a campaign that seeks to end sexual harassment and inequality in workplaces nationwide. The “Parks and Recreation” star is also one of many actresses planning to wear all black to the event to protest sexual harassment. Actresses will likely also wear a small black-and-white “Time’s Up” pin as an accessory. Ahead of Sunday night, Jones spoke to InStyle about the protest and defended the red carpet blackout from critics who view it as divisive or ineffective. “This is not a silent protest,” the actress told the magazine Thursday. “I don’t think why we wear black is divisive as much as it is being discussed and debated without all the facts. Many women on the red carpet will discuss what’s important to them about their choice to protest and wear black.” “We wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say time’s up on this imbalance of power and the abuses that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in,” Jones added. “It’s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where women have equal representation.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Actress America Ferrera, another supporter of the campaign, recently explained why the initiative is important and is inclusive. “We’re saying Time’s Up on silence, Time’s Up on waiting for things to change, Time’s Up on any behavior or culture that makes women less safe in the workplace,” Ferrera said on “The Late Show” on Wednesday night. “Women and people of color and LGBTQ people and disabled people and anyone else. It stands for all of us.”",

    "title": "Republican Sen. Gardner Torches Sessions Over Pot Reversal",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — Sen. Cory Gardner, R.-Colo., on Thursday threatened to block all nominees to Justice Department posts in response to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s decision to end Obama-era policies that let legal marijuana thrive. Gardner also warned that the looming Justice Department announcement would make things harder for 2018 Republican candidates in states where pot is legal. “It certainly lights up a new challenge for them,” Gardner told Yahoo News in a telephone interview. The Colorado lawmaker said Sessions had personally promised him prior to his confirmation that he would not take steps to tighten enforcement of federal pot laws. “I’m prepared to hold every Justice Department nominee until Jeff Sessions lives up to what he told me, lives up to his commitment,” Gardner said. A “hold” is a senatorial threat, frequently invoked to gain leverage over the executive branch, to filibuster nominees. “Jeff Sessions told me this wouldn’t be a priority. Jeff Sessions told me the policy would not be reversed, and today Jeff Sessions went back on his word,” the senator said. Gardner said Sessions made the assurances in “a call specifically set up because I would not release my vote [to confirm him as attorney general] until I got an answer.” “He said, ‘This is just not something that President Trump is focused on.’ And apparently, it’s not just a focus, it’s a primary initiative of the new year,” Gardner fumed. The senator’s comments came after the Associated Press reported that Sessions would let federal prosecutors in states where marijuana is legal determine how tightly to enforce federal laws that prohibit growing, selling, buying and using pot. Eight states and the District of Columbia have passed laws legalizing marijuana for recreational use. In Gardner’s home state of Colorado, pot has become big business, though constrained by some federal laws that hamper the industry’s ability to use U.S. banks. “What it means is uncertainty, instability and a thumbing of noses at the people of Colorado,” where legalized marijuana is a $2 billion industry, supporting thousands of jobs and generating millions of dollars in tax revenue, Gardner said. During the 2016 campaign, Trump said “it’s up to the states” to decide whether marijuana is legal. Asked whether he would order a federal crackdown on pot, he replied: “I wouldn’t do that, no.” Pointing to that exchange, Gardner told Yahoo News: “President Trump was right. Why does Jeff Sessions think he was wrong?” The announcement put the Trump administration at odds with an important ally: Gardner heads the National Republican Senatorial Committee — the party organization devoted to retaining the GOP’s Senate majority. In that capacity, he withdrew NRSC support from Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore in the Alabama special election, which yielded a surprise Democratic upset victory. Trump had thrown his support to Moore, despite sexual misconduct allegations against the former judge. The announcement could also complicate Republican fortunes in states like California, amid growing GOP concerns that the 2018 political climate could generate a Democratic wave that risks swamping their House majority. Gardner noted that he himself had opposed legalizing marijuana “but the people of Colorado felt otherwise.” “If you’re a Republican in Washington, if you’re a Republican in California, if you’re a Republican in other states that have legalized, then this becomes a significant barrier toward understanding this administration’s policy,” he said.

    "title": "East Coast Republicans Slam Trump Administration’s Offshore Drilling Plan",
    "text": "The Trump administration’s plan to open nearly all U.S. waters to oil drilling is already taking heat from an unlikely source: Republicans. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) swiftly released statements on Thursday opposing Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s proposal to allow oil and gas companies to drill on the Atlantic coast for the first time since the 1980s. “I urge Secretary Zinke to recognize the Florida Congressional delegation’s bipartisan efforts to maintain and extend the moratorium in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, and remove this area for future planning purposes,” Rubio said. In a tweet, Scott, a close Trump ally, said he “already asked to immediately meet with Secretary Zinke to discuss the concerns I have with this plan and the crucial need to remove Florida from consideration.” Asked during a Thursday call with reporters about opposition from Scott and others with whom the administration typically aligns, Zinke said states and local communities will have a voice in the process. “Governor Scott has been a great governor in Florida,” he said. “This is the beginning, opening up and saying this is what’s available. At the end of the plan, we are going to listen to the voices of communities, all of the stakeholders. So I look forward to having a dialogue with Governor Scott.” He added that the Trump administration is “sensitive to the needs and requirements of Florida” and understands the state relies heavily on tourism. “Our goal certainly isn’t to cross Governor Scott,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Thursday. “Just because we may differ on issues from time to time doesn’t mean that we can’t still have an incredibly strong and good relationship.” The draft plan calls for making 25 of 26 offshore planning areas ― roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf ― available for lease. (The only areas excluded are marine sanctuaries and the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area in Alaska — which former President George W. Bush set aside for protection with an executive order.) The administration already identified 47 potential lease sales, including 19 off the coast of Alaska and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico, Zinke said. If approved, the plan would be in effect from 2019 to 2024. Disapproval poured in from lawmakers in Florida, a state with a massive tourism industry where climate change is made extraordinarily visible by sea-level rise and fierce storms. “The people of Florida and its leaders have made it clear over and over again,” said Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), the co-chair of Climate Solutions Caucus. “We do not want drilling near our shores.” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who introduced a bill last year to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, tweeted that he was “100 percent opposed.” In his own tweet, Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) called drilling off Florida’s coast “extremely alarming & unacceptable.” “Our voice has been clear from start: we will not tolerate drilling near our coast,” he said. In the sternest statement yet, Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) skewered the administration for its plans to include the Gulf of Mexico, where a BP rig lost control of an undersea well in 2010 and spilled 4 million barrels of crude oil. “Not acceptable to include Gulf of Mexico off Florida’s coast!” he tweeted. “Zinke must reject plans to gut safety rules implemented after Deepwater Horizon disaster. Short memory = recipe for disaster.” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) told The Baltimore Sun he too opposes the move and that “such drilling would create too great a risk.” Rep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) said “this decision strikes me as unnecessary at this time.” “We must prioritize being good stewards of the environment,” Costello, who has a 27 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement. In a statement to the Associated Press, Rep. Tom Rice (R-S.C.) also highlighted the risks associated with drilling off his state’s coast. “While drilling off the coast of South Carolina may have economic benefits, it comes with potential risks,” he said. “I oppose opening up the coast of South Carolina for oil and gas production.” Tom Davis, a Republican member of the South Carolina Senate, told the AP that the Trump administration’s proposal is “horrible public policy” that is “simply not compatible with coastal South Carolina.” “Zinke must reject plans to gut safety rules implemented after Deepwater Horizon disaster. Short memory = recipe for disaster.” In June, 14 House Republicans ― mostly from Florida ― signed a letter opposing the Trump administration’s proposal to allow companies to search for oil and gas by blasting extremely loud air guns on the Atlantic seabed, a process called seismic testing. Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) told McClatchy in November that he was trying to rally a coalition of Republicans against drilling on the East Coast. On Thursday, Sanford noted that every coastal municipality in South Carolina, as well as more than 140 along the East Coast, have come out against fossil fuel development in Atlantic waters. “Unfortunately, this proposal explicitly ignores local opposition because it is the single largest expansion of offshore drilling activity ever proposed,” he said in a statement. “In the case of the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf, drilling hasn’t been allowed in over thirty years. I don’t think the arguments in favor of changing this policy are there, particularly when weighed against what most engineers suspect would be at most a four-month supply of oil reserves for our country.” Despite touting the plan as a boon to the administration’s “energy dominance” goals, Zinke struck a conciliatory tone in a call with reporters, insisting “this is a start,” “this process will take months,” and “this is a draft program.” “Nothing is final, and our department is continuing to engage the American people,” he said.

    "text": "Mayo Clinic researchers show that hysterectomy with ovarian conservation is associated with a significantly increased risk of several cardiovascular diseases and metabolic conditions. The findings are published in Menopause. “This is the best data to date that shows women undergoing hysterectomy have a risk of long-term disease ─ even when both ovaries are conserved,” says Shannon Laughlin-Tommaso, M.D., study author and Mayo Clinic OB-GYN. “While women are increasingly aware that removing their ovaries poses health risks, this study suggests hysterectomy alone has risks, especially for women who undergo hysterectomy prior to age 35.” Women in this study were identified using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a medical records database that includes the complete inpatient and outpatient records of all medical providers in Olmsted County, Minnesota. The researchers identified 2,094 Olmsted County resident women who had a hysterectomy with ovarian conservation for benign disease between Jan. 1, 1980, and Dec. 31, 2002. The women were 18 years old or older on the date of their hysterectomy (index date). Each woman was age-matched to a woman residing in the same county on the index date who had not had a hysterectomy or any ovarian removal. The study determined prior cardiovascular and metabolic conditions prior to surgery and looked only for new onset of disease after hysterectomy. The study shows that women who had a hysterectomy without any ovary removal had a 14 percent increased risk in lipid abnormalities, a 13 percent increased risk of high blood pressure, an 18 percent increased risk of obesity and a 33 percent increased risk of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, women under the age of 35 had a 4.6-fold increased risk of congestive heart failure and a 2.5-fold increased risk of coronary artery disease. “Hysterectomy is the second most common gynecologic surgery, and most are done for benign reasons, because most physicians believe that this surgery has minimal long-term risks,” says Dr. Laughlin-Tommaso. “With the results of this study, we encourage people to consider nonsurgical alternative therapies for fibroids, endometriosis and prolapse, which are leading causes of hysterectomy.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "CEO Of World’s Biggest Catering Company Among Those Killed In Seaplane Crash",
    "text": "Richard Cousins, the CEO of one of Britain’s biggest companies, was among those killed in Sydney on New Year’s Eve when their sightseeing seaplane plunged into a river, according to multiple reports. Cousins, 58, was the chief executive of the world’s largest catering company, the Compass Group. According to Bloomberg, Cousins — who was ranked 11th in Harvard Business Review’s 2017 list of best-performing CEOs in the world — had intended to step down as Compass CEO in March. The Briton was on a chartered sightseeing flight in Australia on Sunday afternoon with his fiancee, 48-year-old Emma Bowden; her daughter, 11-year-old Heather; and his sons, 23-year-old Edward and 25-year-old William, when their seaplane crashed into a river near Jerusalem Bay. The group had been on a sightseeing tour with Sydney Seaplanes, a popular tour operator, reported The Guardian. All six people on board, including the pilot, identified as 44-year-old Gareth Morgan, were killed, local police said in a statement. Catering giant CEO Richard Cousins and family killed in #HawkesburyRiver seaplane crash, police confirm https://t.co/rRWkri1qxS pic.twitter.com/geaearokEH The cause of the crash remains unknown but the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it was launching an investigation into the accident. The managing director for Sydney Seaplanes, Aaron Shaw, said the aircraft’s pilot had more than 10,000 hours of flying experience. The company, he added, had an “unblemished” flying record. The weather on Sunday afternoon had been “perfect,” Shaw said, telling The Guardian that the company was cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull offered his condolences to the loved ones of those who perished, calling the crash a “tragic accident.” “Our hearts go out to the families of those whose lives were lost,” he said on Monday. Paul Walsh, chairman of Compass, said in a statement that the company was “deeply shocked and saddened” by Cousins’ death. The late CEO, who had led Compass for 11 years, was “known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain’s leading companies,” Walsh said. Compass, which operates in about 50 countries, reported an annual revenue of $31 billion in 2017. Several tragic aircraft crashes have made headlines this holiday season. On Christmas Eve, a Florida attorney and four members of his family, including his two daughters, died after their twin-engine plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Polk County. On New Year’s Eve, a plane carrying 10 American tourists, including a family of five, and two Costa Rican pilots crashed in northwestern Costa Rica, killing everyone on board.

    "title": "Ricky Martin Talks Homophobia And Showing 'Tush' On TV",
    "text": "Ricky Martin returns to television in 2018. The singer appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Tuesday to discuss his role in Ryan Murphy’s “American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace.” The interview was an important first for Martin, who previously starred in television series in Latin America and appeared on “General Hospital” in the U.S. “Can we just take a moment to absorb the fact this is my first interview in America as an actor? I love this,” he told DeGeneres. The new season of FX’s award-winning anthology series, which premieres Jan. 17, delves into the murder of famed fashion designer Gianni Versace, the last of five people killed by Andrew Cunanan over a three-month period in 1997. The series also examines what fueled the killing spree by Cunanan, who killed himself a few days after Versace’s murder. Martin portrays Versace’s longtime boyfriend, the model Antonio D’Amico, joining Edgar Ramirez as Versace, Penelope Cruz as the designer’s younger sister, Donatella Versace, and Darren Criss as Cunanan. When DeGeneres showed a photo of Martin as D’Amico in a swimsuit, the audience cheered. A post shared by Ricky (@ricky_martin) on Nov 22, 2017 at 1:39pm PST “Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do,” he responded with a laugh. “And it gets better though, to be honest. I show my tush for the first time on television.” “You sure do, and more than that,” DeGeneres added. The Puerto Rican star told her that the series tackles the rampant homophobia that existed in the 1990s, which he said set the stage for Versace’s death, and the relevance of that issue today. “We’re still dealing with things that we dealt with in the ’90s,” Martin said. “[Cunanan] went on a killing spree for months ... and he was on the list of most wanted of the FBI. He was not hiding, but for some reason they never found him. So it’s like, ‘Wait, he’s killing gay men, let’s look the other way.’ And that’s what we’re trying to confront at this moment.” Series creator Murphy has also spoken about this theme. “We’re trying to talk about a crime within a social idea,” Murphy told reporters during the summer, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “Versace, who was [Cunanan’s] last victim, did not have to die. One of the reasons [Cunanan] was able to make his way across the country and pick off these victims, many of whom were gay, was because of homophobia at the time.” Watch Martin’s full interview above.

    "text": "Things got surprisingly philosophical when a teacher in California posed a riddle for his first-grade students. Bret Turner said an “awed, somber, reflective hush fell over his class” at Head-Royce School in Oakland after one child responded to his “Puzzle of the Week,” below, with the answer “death.” The first guess from one of my 1st graders was “death” and such an awed, somber, reflective hush fell over the class that I didn’t want to tell them that actually the answer is the letter e, which just seemed so banal in the moment pic.twitter.com/7sYFxHNcZk “I didn’t want to tell them that actually the answer is the letter e, which just seemed so banal in the moment,” Turner wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. His post since has gone viral. In a later tweet, Turner, the father of two, said the unidentified youngster’s classmates “continued along a similarly existential vein” by suggesting “all stuff,” “the end” and “nothingthing” as follow-up guesses. Before I finally revealed the \"correct\" answer to the riddle, to a largely unimpressed audience, I fielded other guesses that continued along a similarly existential vein. There was \"NOT everything,\" \"all stuff,\" \"the end,\" and maybe my favorite, \"nothingthing.\" Turner didn’t immediately answer HuffPost’s request for details. His posts did, however, prompt a flurry of debate on Twitter: How is death the beginning of everything exactly? See, its things like this (as well as my own son's insights) that give me a lot of hope for the future.

    "title": "Right-Wing Israeli Government Moves Even Further Away From 2-State Solution",
    "text": "By Maayan Lubell JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s parliament passed an amendment on Tuesday that would make it harder for it to cede control over parts of Jerusalem in any peace deal with the Palestinians, who condemned the move as undermining any chance to revive talks on statehood. The legislation, sponsored by the far-right Jewish Home coalition party, raises to 80 from 61 the number of votes required in the 120-seat Knesset to approve any proposal to hand over part of the city to “a foreign party”. Last month U.S. President Donald Trump angered the Palestinians, Middle East leaders and world powers by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. As home to major Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites, Jerusalem’s status is one of the most sensitive issues in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump’s Dec. 6 decision sparked regional protests and prompted the Palestinians to rule out Washington as a peace broker in any future talks. Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described Trump’s policy shift on Jerusalem and the passage of the amendment as “a declaration of war against the Palestinian people”. “The vote clearly shows that the Israeli side has officially declared an end to the so-called political process,” Abu Rdainah said, referring to U.S.-sponsored talks on Palestinian statehood that collapsed in 2014. Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. It says the entire city is its “eternal and indivisible” capital. Palestinians seek to make East Jerusalem the capital of a state they seek to establish in the occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip. The amendment, long in the legislative pipeline, was passed with 64 lawmakers voting in favor and 52 against. Opposition head Isaac Herzog said Jewish Home was leading Israel “toward a terrible disaster”. Jewish Home’s leader, Naftali Bennett, said the vote showed that Israel would keep control of all of Jerusalem forever. “There will be no more political skulduggery that will allow our capital to be torn apart,” Bennett said on Twitter. A bid to revive Israeli-Palestinian negotiations led by the president’s adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has so far shown no progress. On Sunday, Netanyahu’s Likud party unanimously urged legislators in a non-binding resolution to effectively annex Israeli settlements built in the West Bank. [L8N1OV0GP] Political commentators said Likud’s decision might bolster right-wing support for Netanyahu, who could seek a public mandate in an early election while he awaits possible criminal indictments against him on corruption suspicions. He denies wrongdoing. Parliamentary elections are not due until November 2019 but the police investigations in two cases of alleged corruption against Netanyahu and tensions among coalition partners in his government could hasten a poll. Some commentators, pointing to an existing law that already sets a similar high threshold for handing over territory in a land-for-peace deal, have said Jewish Home was essentially competing with Likud for support among the right-wing base.

    "title": "Rob Bishop Continues His Taxpayer-Funded Feud With Patagonia",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — For the second time in as many months, the House Committee on Natural Resources has taken a public swing at Patagonia. This time it’s after the outdoor retailer turned down an invitation to testify before the legislative body about its opposition to the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle national monuments. On Friday, the committee — which is chaired by Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah) — posted an image to Twitter that reads, “Patagonia Is Lying Hiding.” The post from the official government account links to a letter Bishop sent Friday to company CEO Yvon Chouinard in which he accuses the company of “living in a bubble” and shielding itself from competing viewpoints. “In my 15 years of congressional service I have found most people jump at the opportunity to share their views before Congress — at least those who are confident in their positions,” Bishop wrote. Unfortunately, @Patagonia refused to appear publicly to defend their liesLetter → https://t.co/oZdZumDpnk pic.twitter.com/hMy4BToxr8 A fierce critic of the Trump administration’s monthslong review of protected national monuments, Patagonia has joined a coalition that’s suing to block the sweeping cuts that President Donald Trump made last month to Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments. After Trump signed a pair of proclamations to dismantle the protected Utah sites, the company updated its home page with the words “The President Stole Your Land.” In a post that closely resembled the one from Patagonia, Bishop’s committee accused the outdoor retailer of lying in order to sell its merchandise. The response raised both ethical and legal questions. Walter Shaub, the former director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, said at the time that the “attack” on Patagonia “sure looks a lot like a violation” of House committee rules on social media communication. .@Patagonia doesn't want #MonumentsForAll, they just want your money #BearsEars pic.twitter.com/2nuvfS0imZ A week later, on Dec. 15, Bishop invited Patagonia to join the committee to discuss its views on monuments and federal land management. Chouinard declined for his company. In a Dec. 19 response he said has “little hope” that Bishop’s invitation was in good faith. “I find it disingenuous that after unethically using taxpayers’ resources to call us liars, you would ask me to testify in front of a committee for a matter already decided by the administration and applauded by the Utah delegation just a week ago,” he wrote. “A macabre celebration of the largest reduction in public lands in American history.” Chouinard accused Bishop’s committee of being “like many committees in this failed Orwellian government” and “shackled to special interests of oil, gas, and mining.” In his letter Friday, Bishop again blasted the company for its “continued effort to mislead the public” about the Utah monument rollbacks, in particular its claim that the move represents the “largest elimination of protected land in American history.” “High-profile corporate citizens who make factually inaccurate and misleading statements and then hide from further scrutiny do a disservice to their customers and the American public,” Bishop wrote. He added that “although it is your right, living in a bubble isn’t healthy, nor is it conducive to a robust discussion on important matters of public policy.” While it’s true that the collective 2 million acres that the Trump administration has stripped from the two Utah monuments remain public and under federal control, withdrawing monument status opens the door for drilling, mining and other development. Bishop hasn’t been alone in the fight against Patagonia. Following the administration’s rollbacks in Utah, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke — who led the controversial monuments review — dismissed the private company as a “special interest” that makes its products in China. He told Fox Business that it “should focus on how to bring manufacturing back into the country instead of lying to the public about losing federal land.” Bishop Response to Patagonia by CM D'Angelo on Scribd By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Some Trump Supporters Think Mueller's Grand Jury Has Too Many Black People",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Supporters of President Donald Trump have opened a new line of attack on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election: They think special counsel Robert Mueller’s federal grand jury has too many black people on it. A Trump associate who “recently testified” complained to New York Post columnist Richard Johnson that the members of the grand jury in Washington looked like they came from a Black Lives Matter protest. “The grand jury room looks like a Bernie Sanders rally,” the witness told Page Six. “Maybe they found these jurors in central casting, or at a Black Lives Matter rally in Berkeley.” The complainant contended that 11 of the 20 grand jurors in the room during the testimony were African-Americans, which isn’t a surprising figure because it roughly lines up with the percentage of black residents of the District of Columbia. The witness also told Page Six that there “was only one white male in the room, and he was a prosecutor.” If the witness recently testified before the grand jury, which is charged with determining whether there’s probable cause to indict any additional Trump campaign figures, that witness presumably knows a lot about what precisely the grand jury inquiry is focused on at this point. But instead of pursuing that story, Page Six gave a sympathetic airing to the witness’s complaints about the racial makeup of the grand jury ― though the story did include a “racism” tag. The complaint about who serves on the D.C. grand jury was clearly a bad faith argument from someone who appears sympathetic to Trump and ― based on the fact that they were called to testify ― may have information of interest to Mueller’s team. Natasha Bertrand, a reporter for Business Insider, tweeted that she was pitched the story about the grand jury’s racial makeup about a month ago and “genuinely thought the person was joking.” Yet the Page Six column quickly gained traction in conservative media circles Tuesday night. Gateway Pundit wrote that the Page Six report indicated the grand jury was completely biased “and full of liberal hacks who most likely hate President Trump” and said it was “way past time for the unconstitutional witch hunt to be shut down.” Setting aside the precise demographics of this particular grand jury, it’s no secret that a selection of D.C. voters isn’t likely to include many Trump fans. The president received just 4.1 percent of the District’s votes in 2016, 90.9 percent of which went to Hillary Clinton. Page Six reported that the grand jury “doesn’t appear to include any supporters of President Donald Trump,” an assertion evidently based upon a Trump associate’s assumptions about the individuals in the room. But the complaints about the racial makeup of the jury seize upon widespread misunderstanding of the role of a federal grand jury and represent an attack on a fundamental component of the federal criminal justice system that you wouldn’t typically expect to hear from supporters of a president who ran a “law and order” campaign. The witness who testified before the grand jury complained to Page Six that it wasn’t “a room where POTUS gets a fair shake.” It is not, nor is it set up to be. Nobody gets a “fair shake” before a grand jury because its role is to serve as a (relatively weak) check on prosecutors, not to determine whether defendants are guilty of a crime. More broadly, the attacks on the grand jury fit into a larger pattern of Trump supporters undermining the entire Russia investigation by attacking Justice Department employees, the FBI and, most recently, Mueller ― a Republican former FBI director appointed as special counsel by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, also a Republican. On Tuesday, Trump tweeted his complaints about the “deep state” Justice Department and called for it to jail a former top Clinton aide. The complaints about the racial makeup of the grand jury might give him new ammunition. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "text": "Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts promised in his end-of-the-year report on the federal judiciary that misconduct policies would be re-evaluated with an eye to more effectively protecting employees from sexual harassment. “Events in recent months have illuminated the depth of the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace, and events in the past few weeks have made clear that the judicial branch is not immune,” Roberts said in the report released Sunday. In the wake of months of sexual harassment complaints in Hollywood and the media industry, The Washington Post reported that female law clerks had accused prominent Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in California of making sexual remarks or showing them pornography. Kozinski stepped down in mid-December. He apologized for his actions, but he also defended his “broad sense of humor.” In 2018, the federal judiciary will carry out a “careful evaluation of whether its standards of conduct and its procedures for investigating and correcting inappropriate behavior are adequate to ensure an exemplary workplace for every judge and every court employee,” Roberts said in his report.

    "text": "Actress and activist Rose McGowan is opening up her life for the cameras. The former “Charmed” star, who was one of the early adopters of the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct and predatory men, will star in and produce her own five-part E! documentary series titled “Citizen Rose,” the network announced Tuesday. The series, timed to coincide with the release of McGowan’s memoir, Brave, is scheduled for a two-hour premiere on Jan. 30, with four more installments to air sometime in the spring. “You are formally invited into my mind and world,” McGowan said in a statement. “I am thrilled to partner with E! to amplify my message of bravery, art, joy and survival. As I ready my book, Brave, I realized I wanted to show how we can heal through art even when being hounded by evil.” A post shared by Rose McGowan (@rosemcgowan) on Dec 27, 2017 at 9:26am PST McGowan was one of the first to speak out against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, who she says raped her in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. Multiple damning investigative reports soon followed, describing Weinstein’s decades of predatory behavior and sparking a nationwide conversation about sexual harassment and assault. E! has a history of tapping high-profile figures for limited reality series. Cameras followed Caitlyn Jenner for two seasons of “I Am Cait” and, more recently, Mariah Carey on the short-lived “Mariah’s World.” “Rose McGowan’s courage in addressing sexual abuse and harassment in Hollywood ignited a conversation and inspired other women to speak out against their abusers,” E!’s Amy Introcaso-Davis said. “We look forward to taking viewers inside this talented, dynamic woman’s world as the first allegations unfold and she becomes a leading voice in a critical cultural change.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "text": "Leigh Corfman, one of several woman to accuse U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct in November, is suing him for defamation, The Washington Post reported on Thursday. The suit alleges that Moore made defamatory remarks and personally attacked Corfman after she alleged that he touched her sexually in 1979, when she was 14 and he was 32. Her allegations, published in the Post a month before Moore ran in the Alabama special election, inspired several other women to come forward with their own allegations of the candidate’s sexual misconduct. “We look forward to transparently discussing these matters in a court of law,” Moore’s campaign said in a statement Thursday. Corfman’s lawsuit does not seek financial compensation beyond her own legal costs, but instead asks for “a declaratory judgment of defamation, a public apology from Moore, and a court-enforced ban on him or his campaign publicly attacking her again,” the Post reports. Moore, who lost the U.S. Senate race to Democrat Doug Jones in a stunning upset last month, firmly denied Corfman’s and others’ accusations. “These allegations are completely false and misleading,” Moore said during an appearance on Sean Hannity’s radio show shortly after the Post bombshell. “I believe they’re politically motivated, to stop a successful campaign.” Following his denial, far-right outlet Breitbart and other Moore supporters came to the candidate’s defense and attempted to disprove Corfman’s account of Moore’s behavior.

    "text": "The Jewish lawyer Roy Moore’s wife invoked when responding to anti-Semitism claims on the eve of Alabama’s special election is now an evangelical Christian. In an email to AL.com, Kayla Moore said she was referring that night to Martin Wishnatsky, a lawyer who works for the Foundation of Moral Law, which was founded by the former judge in 2003. Wishnatsky gave an interview to AL.com in which he discussed his faith in detail. He was born and raised Jewish, he said, but became a Christian in his 30s. He says he is a Messianic Jew, a term he says is used for a Jewish person who has accepted Christ. According to AL.com, Wishnatsky became a Mormon first, then an evangelical Protestant Christian. He is staunchly against abortion rights and has spent a total of 18 months behind bars for protests against women’s access to health care, including blocking clinic entrances. Kayla Moore’s comments came under fire as she was introducing her husband at the final campaign event before the special election for Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ former Senate seat. She lashed out at the media, calling reports on Moore’s history of sexual misconduct and harassment “fake news.” She also responded to the backlash her husband received after suggesting Democratic donor George Soros would go to hell for his Jewish faith. “Fake news would tell you that we don’t care for Jews,” Kayla Moore said. “I tell you all this because I’ve seen it also; I just want to set the record straight .... One of our attorneys is a Jew. We have very close friends who are Jewish and rabbis, and we also fellowship with them.” Moore lost the election to career prosecutor Doug Jones, who became Alabama’s first Democratic senator in 25 years.

    "text": "Roy Moore accuser Tina Johnson lost her home in a fire on Tuesday, and an investigation is underway. Johnson was one of several women who came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Moore during Alabama’s special Senate election. She said that Moore ― who was defeated by Democrat Doug Jones last month ― had groped her in his office in 1991, when she was 28 years old. On Tuesday morning, her house in Gadsden, Alabama, caught fire, AL.com reports. While no one was hurt ― Johnson, her husband and her grandchild were all out of the house at the time ― the family lost all their possessions in the blaze. “I am devastated, just devastated,” Johnson told the news site. “We have just the clothes on our backs.” The Etowah County Arson Task Force and its sheriff’s office are looking into the fire, the sheriff’s office said on Friday. “The ongoing investigation does not lead us to believe that the fire is in any way related to Roy Moore or allegations made against him,” the statement noted. Johnson and one of her neighbors told AL.com that other neighbors had seen a young man with a history of public intoxication walking around the house around the time of the blaze.

    "title": "Ryan Reynolds Totally Delivered When Asked Which Famous Chris Is Hottest",
    "text": "Ryan Reynolds gave a very Ryan Reynolds answer when asked an impossible question over Twitter on Tuesday. It all started when Reynolds tweeted about the Kardashians. Can someone settle an argument between me and my priest? Which Kardashians are pregnant? Shortly thereafter, a fan decided to strike a deal with the “Deadpool” actor, asking him a question about Hollywood’s hunkiest Chrises. only if you can settle an argument with me and my friends. Which Chris is hotter, Hemsworth, Pratt, or Evans? But instead of choosing just one yummy Chris, Reynolds opted for the ultimate flavor combination. When ordering ice cream, I like to get all three scoops. https://t.co/6H13DgssrG He also dragged Chris Pine into the sexy scenario. And of course, some Pine nuts generously sprinkled on top. Tasty.

    "title": "Sam Smith: 'I’m Just Figuring Out What It Means To Be Gay'",
    "text": "Sam Smith kicked off 2018 by sitting down with pal (and longtime fan) Sarah Jessica Parker for a no-holds-barred V magazine interview. The singer-songwriter, 25, looks more dapper than ever on the cover of the magazine’s “Discovery” issue, which hits newsstands on Jan. 11. His chat with Parker touches on everything from music to sexuality to his much-talked-about weight loss. In between the release of his 2014 debut album, “In The Lonely Hour,” and its acclaimed 2017 follow-up, “The Thrill of It All,” Smith says he “became a gay man properly.” Most importantly, he adds, he’s had intimate relationships with other gay men, too. “When I wrote that first album, I was in love with a straight man, he didn’t love me back, and I was very comfortable in my longing,” he said. “With this record, I became a gay man. I started having proper relationships with men. Sometimes they were in the wrong and treated me in a bad way, and sometimes I was in the wrong.” Honoured to be on the cover of @vmagazine & to have got the opportunity to sit down with the sensational @SJP and talk about life and love. And thank you to @formichetti for making me feel so comfortable in front of your lens x pic.twitter.com/scs8F3LwM5 Smith has, of course, had a few stumbles along the way. In 2014, he said the queer community’s use of dating apps like Grindr and Tinder was “ruining romance,” a comment widely interpreted as slut-shaming. Two years later, Smith implied that he was the first openly gay man to ever win an Oscar when picking up the Best Original Song award for “Writing’s on the Wall” at the 2016 Academy Awards. It didn’t take long for other celebrities, media outlets and social media to point out the fact that he wasn’t. But Smith isn’t deterred. “I’m just figuring out what it means to be gay,” he said. “Also, I don’t have a lot to go by as a gay man in music: Even the George Michaels and Elton Johns weren’t out at the beginning of their careers.” #V111 pic.twitter.com/UnzyIvd4uB Though there’s been lots of buzz about Smith’s weight loss, he also shared that he still struggles with body image. “When I was shooting my first music videos, I just wasn’t happy with the way I looked, so I was trying to control the way the camera moved,” he said. “I was constantly looking in the mirror, pinching my waist, weighing myself every day.” While Smith has learned to “really love my stretch marks,” he added, “I need to constantly train myself to watch the right sort of films, to not look at certain ads and think that’s how my stomach should look. It’s something that I’m fighting every day. I think men should talk about it more.” Smith also opened up about his new relationship. Though he doesn’t mention any names, the star has been photographed holding hands and kissing “13 Reasons Why” actor Brandon Flynn, 24, in New York and Florida in recent months. “On a personal level, I’m in a relationship right now and for the first time, I think I deserve to be happy,” he said. “I’m actually asking myself if I’m going to be writing some happy love songs soon.” Read the full V magazine interview here.

    "title": "Grab The Wine! 'Scandal' And 'How To Get Away With Murder' Are Crossing Over",
    "text": "The TGIT crossover you’ve been waiting for? It’s handled. The ABC series’ “Scandal” and “How To Get Away With Murder,” both executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, are set to crossover sometime this season, Deadline exclusively reports. The twisty political drama starring Kerry Washington is midway through its final run, while “HTGAWM” wrapped its first batch of Season 4 episodes in November. Both air on Thursday nights alongside “Grey’s Anatomy” (another Rhimes hit) as part of ABC’s must-watch #TGIT lineup. It’s unclear exactly how the two universes will overlap, considering “Scandal” takes place in Washington, while “HTGAWM” is based in Philadelphia. This will be the first time any of the shows under the Shondaland umbrella will have crossed over, excluding “Grey’s Anatomy” and its spin-off “Private Practice. Rhimes and “HTGAWM” creator Pete Nowalk confirmed the news on social media by revealing an excerpt from the episode’s script that reveals just how Olivia Pope (Washington) and Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) meet. A post shared by Shonda Rhimes (@shondarhimes) on Jan 3, 2018 at 12:01pm PST Nowalk also explained to Deadline that the episode will air a few episodes before the series finale of “Scandal.” Washington started the speculation when she shared a photo of herself from what looks like the court room set of “HTGAWM” with the caption, “Hey Ms @violadavis ❤️ check it out. This spot look familiar?! Where are you?” A post shared by Kerry Washington (@kerrywashington) on Jan 3, 2018 at 9:00am PST Davis responded in kind with an Instagram of herself seated in the Oval Office from “Scandal” with an expression that basically sums up how TV fanatics everywhere feel about this news. “Hey @KerryWashington, guess where I am?!” she wrote alongside the photo.

    "title": "Public School Ends Bible Giveaway Tradition After Humanists File Complaint",
    "text": "A public elementary school in Kansas has agreed to end its yearly tradition of facilitating a Bible giveaway on school grounds. In the past, Herington Elementary School allowed the Christian organization The Gideons International to distribute free Bibles to fifth-graders once a year. But the school recently received complaints from local parents and the American Humanist Association, an advocacy organization for nontheists. Monica Miller, senior counsel at the AHA’s legal arm, said assisting the Gideons in distributing Bibles represents a clear breach by the school of the Constitution’s establishment clause. “Anyone, religious or not, can see that the purpose of this is to promote Christianity,” Miller said in a statement. The Gideons International is a Christian organization commonly known for placing free Bibles in hotel and hospital rooms. The group has run into legal challenges numerous times as a result of its efforts to distribute Bibles to children in public schools during school hours. The latest Bible giveaway at Herington Elementary School took place right before students took their winter break. The books were reportedly placed on a table in a common hallway. A sign placed nearby invited fifth-graders to take the Bibles for free. Superintendent Ron Wilson told HuffPost that a Gideons representative placed the sign in the hallway. “The practice of making Gideon Bibles available to 5th Grade Students has been in place for a long time,” Wilson wrote in an email. “Our current principal who was a teacher before becoming principal has said that it is been a practice ever since she’s been there at the school.” Concerned parents reportedly contacted the American Humanist Association, which sent a letter to Herington Schools officials threatening litigation if the practice didn’t come to an end.

Wilson told HuffPost that “our intent was never to impose our beliefs on anyone, but rather we were just the sustaining a practice that [had] been in place for a long time.” In the future, the school will no longer allow the distribution of religious materials “in order to respect everyone’s rights and to follow recent court rulings,” Wilson wrote.

    "title": "GOP Senators Recommend Criminal Investigation Of Trump Dossier Author",
    "text": "The Senate Judiciary Committee, which is supposed to be probing whether the Russian government actively colluded with President Donald Trump’s campaign team to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, made its first public criminal referral on Friday, targeting a former British intelligence agent who sought to reveal that alleged collusion. The recommendation fuels criticism that the committee’s investigation has splintered along party lines, with Republicans reportedly more interested in probing matters involving Trump’s 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton, as Trump grows increasingly frustrated with the FBI’s Russia probe. In a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray, Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) recommended a criminal investigation of Christopher Steele for possibly violating the U.S. law that prohibits individuals from making false statements to federal investigators. Steele is the author of a now-infamous dossier of research memos that include damaging claims about Trump and his business dealings in Russia. The dossier was commissioned in June 2016 by Fusion GPS, a Washington, D.C.-based research firm. Senators @ChuckGrassley and @LindseyGrahamSC have referred Christopher Steele to @TheJusticeDept for investigation after information reviewed by committee investigators revealed significant inconsistencies in statements provided to authorities pic.twitter.com/MKhJlscdKP Fusion GPS attorney Joshua Levy criticized the senators’ letter as a potential “attempt to discredit government sources, in the midst of an ongoing criminal investigation.” “We should all be skeptical in the extreme,” he told The Washington Post. The dossier has been a source of controversy since its contents were made public early last year. The document includes several incendiary claims about the president, including that his campaign colluded with Russian officials. It also includes an unsubstantiated account of Trump hiring Russian prostitutes to perform “golden showers” in front of him at a Moscow hotel suite. Trump has denied the claims and called the document “fake.” In October, details emerged about how the Fusion GPS research was funded. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative-leaning news site, hired the firm to do opposition research about Trump during the Republican primaries, but stopped funding the work after Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee in spring 2016. The firm was then hired by the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s presidential campaign, after which it tapped Steele to compile information on Trump. The revelation about the Clinton campaign’s ties to the document renewed Trump’s attacks. In December, he called the dossier a “Crooked Hillary pile of garbage.” While the dossier’s claims have not been verified, Robert Mueller — the special counsel leading the FBI’s Russia probe — reportedly had his investigators speak to Steele last year.

    "title": "Seth Meyers Plans To Tackle Hollywood's Sexual Harassment At Golden Globes",
    "text": "Seth Meyers has the unique challenge of being the host for the first major awards show amid Hollywood’s reckoning with sexual abuse and harassment. Ahead of the 75th annual Golden Globes on Sunday, where actresses and actors alike are set to wear black as a form of protest, the late-night comedian says he has a plan to address it all in a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter. While he expressed some apprehension amount the sensitivity of the task at hand, Meyers said he’s sought advice from women in his own life, who pushed him to realize that this year as host he can “say some things that you wouldn’t be able to say.” “Women in general have been thinking about this stuff a lot longer than men. Now, I was lucky enough to have a head start in that this was what my wife did for a living, but for a lot of men, this seems like something that just happened,” he told the outlet. “And for a lot of women, this is not something that just happened. So the best thing any man can do right now is listen and try to learn, because none of us are experts in this thing that we have not experienced.” Meyer’s wife, Alexi Ashe, whom he wed in 2013, is an assistant district attorney prosecuting misdemeanor sexual assault cases in Brooklyn, New York. “This is stuff we talk about all the time at home, so this year has been a convergence of our worlds,” he added. “I don’t know if I would’ve wanted to do this without her counsel in talking about it, and she’s a smart enough woman to know that I probably shouldn’t have done it without her help.” He’s also getting by with a little help from his friends Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, who’ve hosted the ceremony in years past, by giving them a peek at his opening monologue. But perhaps his greatest preparation comes from his talk show, “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” where he’s distinguished himself by tackling complex issues with aplomb on a daily basis. “We have at least a slight advantage in that we’ve been having those conversations each night on our show, addressing that and other issues that don’t naturally lend themselves to a lightness of mood,” Meyers explained. While President Donald Trump is a frequent topic on his show, Meyers says he’s aiming to focus on Hollywood, not Washington, at the ceremony, which he hopes will in the least inspire some tweets from the White House. “If he tweets that he’s disappointed we didn’t bring him up, I’d be thrilled,” he told THR. “That would fly in the face of what currently he believes is the problem, which is that we won’t stop talking about him.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "Should Religious Freedom Advocates Cheer Trump On Pakistan?",
    "text": "On Thursday, the U.S. State Department added Pakistan to a watch list for religious freedom violations. This follows an angry tweet from Donald Trump about Pakistan, and a more substantive cut-off of U.S. security assistance. Pakistan has faced years of criticism for its failure to disrupt terrorist activity within its borders and its persistent violations of religious freedom. Should those of us worried about the status of religious freedom be heartened by this move? Unfortunately, the answer is no. There is no indication the Trump Administration will actually follow through with these actions to call for reforms in Pakistan. Tensions between Trump and Pakistan have been growing for months. In an August 2016 speech on his Afghanistan strategy, Trump criticized Pakistan, accusing it of “housing the very terrorists we fight.” And then on New Year’s Day, Trump sent an angry tweet about Pakistan, threatening to cut off U.S. aid. This week, he followed through, suspending U.S. aid. To the surprise of some, the Administration also called out Pakistan for human rights abuses, placing it on a watch list for religious freedom violations. The Trump administration’s actions may appear abrupt, but they reflect long-standing concerns. Pakistan and the United States have had a tense relationship on counterterrorism since the 1990s. The United States was initially critical of Pakistan’s support for Kashmiri militant groups. This expanded to concerns about al-Qaeda due to Pakistan’s ties to the Taliban — which hosted Osama bin Ladin — and blind eye towards al-Qaeda operatives. As I discussed in my book, while Pakistan did cooperate with America in some very important ways after 9/11, it continued to allow terrorists to operate in its territory. Pakistan’s religious freedom record is also a problem. The country’s blasphemy laws have enabled vigilante violence against religious minorities — particularly Christians — and the authorities have done little to stop this violence. Additionally, Ahmadi Muslims face both social and governmental discrimination and harassment. The government also has favored hard-line Islamist groups for decades, giving these groups significant sway over the society to the detriment of Muslims and non-Muslims. When I ran the Pew Research Center’s work on religious freedom, Pakistan was consistently among the most repressive countries in the world. So I should be happy with the Trump administration’s actions. It is taking steps to pressure Pakistan on counterterrorism while also clearly condemning its religious freedom violations. But as with other aspects of its foreign policy, this administration is doing the right thing for the wrong reason. It is also unlikely to follow through. First, there is no indication this administration is committed to religious freedom. While Trump has made a big show of domestic religious freedom debates, international human rights promotion is not a priority. Secretary of State Tillerson announced that advancing U.S. values can be “an obstacle” for U.S. interests. In this case, condemning Pakistan is in line with Trump’s security priorities, but religious freedom is clearly the secondary issue here. Advancing religious freedom requires not just cutting off aid, but working with states to reform their policies. I don’t see that happening under Trump. Second, even if Trump was serious on increasing religious freedom in Pakistan, how would he do it? Under Tillerson, the State Department has been gutted. State Department employees — including its religious freedom office — appear to be valiantly attempting to continue their mission despite Tillerson’s cuts. But actually advancing religious freedom will require engagement on religious issues and close monitoring to ensure compliance. As with Trump’s declaration on ISIL’s genocide, rhetoric will not translate into actions without a fully-staffed, well-supported State Department. Moreover, Trump’s belligerent, confrontational style will undermine existing initiatives; Pakistani political figures are calling on their government to “remove” U.S. diplomatic personnel in response to Trump’s actions. Some may accuse me of being cranky, or biased against Trump. But religious freedom advocates need to be very careful. Trump is saying the right things, but there is little indication he will actually act on international religious freedom. We have seen this repeatedly over the past year. Besides Tillerson’s dismissal of “values,” there is also Vice President Pence’s trip to the Middle East, meant to show solidarity with Middle East Christians; it was postponed after the furor over Trump’s statements on Jerusalem, and there is no indication it will be rescheduled. If religious freedom advocates cheer nice-sounding words from Trump but don’t pressure him to follow through, we undermine our cause. In response to critics of his human rights policies, the Administration can point to support from religious freedom advocates for cover. Meanwhile, countries around the world will intensify limits on religious freedom, as they know the United States will do little to pressure them. Instead of cheering, the response to every action like this from Trump should be, “ok, great; so what are you going to do about it?” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But if you’re overly close with a superior ― namely, your boss― the bond could actually do more harm than good, according to psychologist and executive coach Kate Snowise. “It is great to have personal relationships at work, and research demonstrates that having a close friend at work is one of the greatest contributors to job satisfaction, but things can get weird if this person is your boss, due to the potential power they have with your career,” she told HuffPost. We asked experts to share the telltale signs that the relationship with your boss has ventured into unhealthy or inappropriate territory. “There is a fine line between being a boss and a friend, and being a boss requires sometimes having the hard conversations. If you’re getting too close to your boss, you may have found that you haven’t received any constructive feedback or don’t get any guidance on how you can take your career to the next level. Friends usually don’t want to upset or offend us, but it’s often the hard feedback delivered by a boss that can be some of the greatest fuel to help us move forward in our careers.” ― Kate Snowise “This is often the first red flag. You feel singled out for plum projects and are taken to lunch more often than other members of the team. You may also get more face time with you manager. This is dangerous territory not only for the manager and company ― particularly with the greater awareness of bullying and sexual harassment claims of late ― but for you. You risk being ostracized by your peers and may find it difficult to get cooperation from coworkers.” ― Lynn Taylor, workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior & Thrive in Your Job “It’s OK if you develop a friendship with your boss outside of work. But it can be detrimental if you start forming inside jokes that spill into the workplace. If you find yourself sitting in meetings and you and your boss are sharing knowing glances with each other in reference to colleagues, you’re too close. This sort of behavior diminishes workplace morale and will damage productivity at work.” ― Alena Gerst, psychotherapist “If you’re too close to your boss, often the line between work and play can get blurred. The danger is that you may find that you don’t get the direction or support you need, as your meetings can often become more of a social catch-up than an opportunity to discuss real work-based issues or the need for guidance. You can help get around this by sending your boss agenda items of the things you want to discuss before any meeting.” ― Kate Snowise “It’s one thing to be invited to an occasional lunch alone by your manager. But if you’re being singled out, it’s happening often and it starts being combined with other outings, such as drinks or dinner, the relationship is likely crossing a healthy boundary. You should be able to do your job during normal working hours and never feel uncomfortable about the time and/or place. If you do, it’s your right to speak up immediately, with diplomacy.” ― Lynn Taylor “As much as someone can say that whatever you say to them won’t affect their impression of you, we’re all human and certain things can’t be unheard. So be careful what you share with your boss. If you find yourself using your boss as a venting buddy, telling them about your frustrations with the workplace and how you’re so hung over you can barely function, you might want to learn to keep your mouth shut.” ― Kate Snowise “If you feel like you’re on a date versus ‘on the clock,’ there’s reason to develop an immediate strategy to deal with it. Your manager may call you by an affectionate name or cross the line with an unwanted hug, and you see this repeated. You’re made to feel awkward, and it’s difficult to be productive. The longer you wait to put a stop to their behavior, the more challenging it will be ― and the legal ramifications of this can be significant. The employer, your boss and you could all be part of a hostile work environment legal claim from other workers.” ― Lynn Taylor By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Silicon Valley's Problematic Sex Parties On Blast In Upcoming Book",
    "text": "It’s no secret that women looking to get ahead in the tech industry often grapple with sacrifices and risks that their male counterparts don’t, but an upcoming book offers a glimpse at a lesser known element at play: exclusive, drug-fueled sex parties where claims of carnal liberation mask a problematic power dynamic. Bloomberg veteran Emily Chang’s upcoming book, Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley, denounces these freewheeling gatherings. An adaptation appeared in Vanity Fair on Tuesday. Chang spoke to nearly two dozen people familiar with these parties, in which men ― typically first-round investors, prominent entrepreneurs and high-ranking executives ― mingle with young, attractive women working in tech or other tech-aligned industries. Anonymous sources described gatherings that are kept under wraps and often involve drugs, Chang wrote: This is how the night goes down, according to those who have attended. Guests arrive before dinner and are checked in by private security guards, who will turn you away if you’re not on the list. ... Alcohol lubricates the conversation until, after the final course, the drugs roll out. Some form of MDMA, a.k.a. Ecstasy or Molly, known for transforming relative strangers into extremely affectionate friends, is de rigueur, including Molly tablets that have been molded into the logos of some of the hottest tech companies. Some refer to these parties as “E-parties.” The sources said attendees are encouraged to become intimate with other guests. Oftentimes, the hosts enforce a higher ratio of women to men and lean “heavily toward male-heterosexual fantasies,” Chang observed. “Women are often expected to be involved in threesomes that include other women; male gay and bisexual behavior is conspicuously absent.” While many of the men Chang spoke to view these gatherings as another way they’re disrupting the world, women face a dilemma: Skipping the party means missing out on the business deals and networking that take place there, but attending may have its own set of consequences. “If you do participate in these sex parties, don’t ever think about starting a company or having someone invest in you,” one female entrepreneur told Chang. “Those doors get shut. But if you don’t participate, you’re shut out. You’re damned if you do, damned if you don’t.” Other women who spoke to Chang said their male colleagues aggressively pursued and sexually harassed them after they found out they had attended some of the gatherings. That predicament isn’t surprising, given Silicon Valley’s history of gender discrimination: Women in tech are paid less, kept out of high-ranking roles and face rampant sexual harassment. The biggest tech sexual misconduct scandal to unfold last year was at Uber, which fired 20 employees after harassment allegations blew up.

The court rejected his adoption last month on the grounds that the steps he had taken to have the baby in the United States would not have been possible in socially conservative Singapore. “Our client has filed an appeal against the decision,” said one of his lawyers, Ivan Cheong. The man’s name has been withheld because the case involves a minor. Cheong said the appeal would be heard by the family division of the high court in Singapore, but that no date had been set.

    "title": "14 Dead, Hundreds Injured In Fiery South Africa Train Crash",
    "text": "JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - More than a dozen people were killed and hundreds were feared injured after a train struck a lorry, derailed and burst into flames in South Africa on Thursday. Footage from television news showed fire engulfing one of the train’s carriages after the accident, which occurred as it traveled between Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg. Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi said the train, which was carrying 700 passengers, jumped the tracks after hitting the truck, which was attempting to negotiate a level crossing. He said preliminary investigations suggested 12 people had died in the crash and 268 were injured, including four critically. Emergency services said 14 people had died, and dozens were hurt, calling the minister’s injury estimate premature. “I have been briefed that the accident was the result of a truck that was driving through a level crossing... You can see for yourself the truck driver was taking chances,” Maswanganyi said on the news channel of national broadcaster SABC. He said the driver had survived and police were investigating. Emergency services and rail officials were not immediately able to confirm the circumstances of the crash. South Africa has the continent’s largest railway network, but it has been plagued by mismanagement and under-investment that has seen train use dwindle despite it being the cheapest from of public transportation. In a recent report, the government’s Rail Safety Regulator (RSR) said that, in the 2016/17 financial year, 495 people lost their lives in the country’s railway environment and 2,079 were injured. The death toll was up 5 percent increase from the previous year.

    "title": "South Korea Offers Talks With Defiant North Ahead Of Olympics",
    "text": "South Korea on Tuesday offered talks with North Korea amid a standoff over its weapons programs, a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he was open to negotiations but that his country would push ahead with “mass producing” nuclear warheads. The offer for high-level talks next Tuesday had been discussed with the United States, the South’s unification minister said, while a decision on whether to push back a massive joint military drill between South Korea and the United States until after the Winter Olympics was pending. Tension has been rising over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, which it pursues in defiance of years of U.N. Security Council resolutions, with bellicose rhetoric coming from both Pyongyang and the White House. The North sees the regular war drills between the South and the United States as preparations for war. “We look forward to candidly discussing interests from both sides face-to-face with North Korea along with the North’s participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics,” Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon told reporters. “I repeat, the government is open to talking with North Korea, regardless of time, location and form.” Cho said he expects the dialogue at the border village of Panmunjom, if it happens, to be focused on North Korea’s participation at the Olympics in February, but other issues would likely arise, including the decentralization of North Korea. Should the talks be held on Jan. 9, it would be the first such dialogue since a vice-ministerial meeting in December 2015. The offer landed after a New Year’s Day speech by Kim who said he was “open to dialogue” with Seoul, and for North Korean athletes to possibly take part in the Winter Games, but he persistently declared North Korea a nuclear power. After welcoming Kim’s address, South Korean President Moon Jae-in had asked his government earlier in the day to move as quickly as possible to bring North Korea to the Olympics. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the recent positive comments from both sides about improving relations, and Kim’s remarks about participating in the upcoming Olympics, were a “good thing”. “China welcomes and supports North Korea and South Korea taking earnest efforts to treat this as an opportunity to improve mutual relations, promote the alleviation of the situation on the Korean peninsula and realize denuclearization on the peninsula.” Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean national security adviser, said Seoul should have taken more time before reacting to Kim’s comments. “I regret the government had even lost the flexibility to spend one day or two taking a deep breath and meticulously analyzing Kim Jong Un’s ulterior motive before hastily issuing a welcoming statement,” he said. “The government will have to strive more to come up with a countermeasure not to get caught in a trap set by Kim Jong Un.” Choi Moon-soon, governor of Gangwon Province where the Olympics are to be held next month, has proposed South Korea send cruise ships to bring North Korean athletes and officials to Pyeongchang, according to South Korean media. Choi met North Korean sports official Mun Woong in China on Dec. 18 on the sidelines of a international youth football tournament where North and South Korea soccer teams competed, the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported. The governor did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment. This week’s exchanges follow a year dominated by fiery threats form Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump who vowed to destroy North Korea if threatened, even as U.S. diplomats pushed for a diplomatic solution. North Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan, tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile in November, which it said was capable of delivering a warhead to anywhere in the United States. Kim said in a New Year’s Day speech on Monday he would consider sending a delegation to theOlympics. “North Korea’s participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to showcase the national pride and we wish the Games will be a success. Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility,” Kim said. North Korea would focus in 2018 on “mass-producing nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles for operational deployment”. “The whole territory of the U.S. is within the range of our nuclear strike and a nuclear button is always on the desk of my office and this is just a reality, not a threat,” he said, while emphasizing that the weapons would only be used if North Korea was threatened. The U.S. State Department did not respond to a requests for comment on Kim’s address, but analysts said it was an attempt to weaken the U.S.-South Korean alliance.

A post shared by DeWanda Wise (@dewandawise) on Jan 1, 2018 at 3:51pm PST “She’s Gotta Have It” follows Wise, a young Brooklyn-based artist, as she juggles several romantic relationships. In the first season, the show took a stance on the issue of street harassment with the social media campaign ”#MyNameIsnt.” According to Variety, season two will feature eight new episodes. Spike Lee said happy fans should thank Lewis Lee for making the Netflix series possible. “It was my wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, producer in her own right, who had the vision to take my film from the big screen and turn it into an episodic series,” Spike Lee said in September, according to Deadline. “It had not occurred to me at all.

Many got the joke, however, but said it gained traction because it was “so plausible.” A sampling of the responses are below: 😂😂😂😂 I'm laughing so hard because it's so plausible https://t.co/WZIyhhf5EE The fucking insane thing about this is that you really didn't fly too close to the sun until that final paragraph.

    "title": "Spotify Hit With $1.6 Billion Lawsuit From Publisher Representing Tom Petty, Neil Young",
    "text": "(Reuters) - Music streaming company Spotify was sued by Wixen Music Publishing Inc last week for allegedly using thousands of songs, including those of Tom Petty, Neil Young and the Doors, without a license and compensation to the music publisher. Wixen, an exclusive licensee of songs such as \"Free Fallin\" by Tom Petty, \"Light My Fire\" by the Doors, \"(Girl We Got a) Good Thing\" by Weezer and works of singers such as Stevie Nicks, is seeking damages worth at least $1.6 billion along with injunctive relief. Spotify failed to get a direct or a compulsory license from Wixen that would allow it to reproduce and distribute the songs, Wixen said in the lawsuit, filed in a California federal court. Wixen also alleged that Spotify outsourced its work to a third party, licensing and royalty services provider the Harry Fox Agency, which was \"ill-equipped to obtain all the necessary mechanical licenses\". Spotify declined to comment. In May, the Stockholm, Sweden-based company agreed to pay more than $43 million to settle a proposed class action alleging it failed to pay royalties for some of the songs it makes available to users. Spotify, which is planning a stock market listing this year, has grown around 20 percent in value to at least $19 billion in the past few months.

    "title": "What Really Happened To Luke At The End Of 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'",
    "text": "Warning! “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” spoilers below. He started as a starry-eyed kid who just wanted to go to Tosche Station to pick up some power converters. Now, 41 years later, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has leveled up to legend status. In “Star Wars: The Last Jedi,” Skywalker heroically casts some sort of Force-fueled astral projection to stall Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), affording the rebels a last-minute escape from a planet called Crait. Skywalker, whose body was actually back on another planet called Ahch-To during his entire battle with Ren, collapses afterward, looks off into the distance at two different suns and disappears, leaving behind his Jedi robe. And we’re all like ... VFX Supervisor Ben Morris described the fatal “Last Jedi” shot ― with that memorable sunset ― as mostly real, though he said the filmmakers added a second sun in post-production. The two suns serve as a callback to the pair of setting stars Luke sees early on in “A New Hope.” Ultimately, Luke went out the same way he came in. That final sequence was a challenge, however, for editor Bob Ducsay. “It’s a purely cinematic scene. There’s no dialogue. There’s no action. It’s all emotion and character and figuring out exactly how to communicate to the audience what we want to communicate.” Ducsay continued, “We spent an enormous amount of time on it.” Ducsay told HuffPost he felt the final cut was a success because it was both “nostalgic and hopeful.” But, after our hero artfully embarrassed the Dark Side’s Ren, some viewers were left wondering, “Why the heck did Luke have to disappear?” “I don’t want to get too explicit, because I like people being able to have their own interpretations,” director Rian Johnson told HuffPost, “but I think definitely the act of what he does at the end literally just takes everything out of him. That’s a huge thing. Also ... he’s having his final act be something of myth-making in a way.” Johnson continued: It does go back a little bit to what he said at the beginning [of “The Last Jedi”]. “What do you think one guy walking out there with a lightsaber [can do]?” ... The answer is: Create a legend that will spread hope. And once he’s done that, combined with the physical toll it’s taken on him, you can make the case that then there’s nothing more powerful that he could accomplish. Johnson said he knew early on that “The Last Jedi” was going to revolve around Skywalker’s journey to take on the “mantle of the legend of Luke Skywalker,” despite the fact that the disillusioned Jedi had rejected that characterization earlier in the film. “The galaxy needs legends,” Johnson explained. “I think about the look in Rey’s eyes in ‘The Force Awakens,’ when she says, ‘Luke Skywalker, I thought he was a myth,’ and that gleam in her eyes. And I think about how I felt when I showed up to work the first day to meet with Mark Hamill, and I sat down and started talking to him, and I could only see Luke Skywalker. He made it very hard to talk, and [it’s] the idea that there’s value in that, in terms of inspiring us to fight the good fight and to be our best.” Johnson was candid about Luke’s “death scene,” saying he was actually “dreading” it. But if it was going to happen, it had to be then, he argued. “When I realized that that’s where Luke was going to get to by the end of the movie, and when I realized this was gonna be an emotionally rich arc for him, it seemed like if there was a time to give him his moment, this would be it,” Johnson said. “I wasn’t looking forward to it. I was kind of dreading it, but at the same time it felt like the right moment. It felt like the right time in this trilogy.” Much like the story of Rey’s parentage, Luke’s journey may not be over quite yet. After all, with Yoda’s cameo in “The Last Jedi,” it seems like coming back as a Force ghost is always an option. And though Johnson isn’t writing the next film — that duty goes to J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio — he did talk about how Skywalker could possibly “now do more for the galaxy in another form.” Johnson said, “The idea of Luke having passed into another realm and what the potential could be there for his involvement, that seems like it just gives you a whole other realm to get into if [Abrams and Terrio] chose to in the next film.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But the “Late Night” host is clamoring to be considered for the president’s fake news awards. Tonight! My desperate bid to get Trump’s disapproval! #TheFakies pic.twitter.com/7exZSesI8m Soon after threatening nuclear war with North Korea over Twitter, Trump sent another tweet announcing “THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR.” The president said he’ll name the winners on Monday, and Colbert wants in. I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock. Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned! “Nothing gives you more credibility than Donald Trump calling you a liar,” Colbert said. So Colbert created a “For Your Consideration” ad and posted it on a billboard in New York City’s Times Square. The ad, which has a decidedly Edward R. Murrow-feel, says Colbert would like to be considered in all categories including “Outstanding Achievement In Parroting George Soros’ Talking Points” and “The Eric Trump Memorial Award For Disappointment,” among others. So excited for Monday’s “MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR!” See you on the red carpet, @AndersonCooper! #TheFakies pic.twitter.com/r8pYCj0g9r Check out Colbert describing the ad in the video above.

In his first live show back following the holidays, Colbert had plenty of material to dissect, including this tweet from Trump about the current cold snap and global warming: In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up! “See the logic here, because Donald Trump’s cold right now, that’s evidence that the earth is not getting warmer,” said Colbert.

    "title": "Steve Bannon Tries To Mend Ties With Trump, After Trump All But Erases Him",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is standing by Donald Trump, even after the president on Wednesday widened an extraordinary rift with him in response to explosive comments Bannon made in a forthcoming book. On his Breitbart radio show Wednesday night, Bannon reiterated that he supports Trump “day in and day out” and referred to the president as “a great man.” They were Bannon’s first public comments since excerpts of his remarks in the book were released, precipitating Wednesday’s cascade of events, which culminated in Trump and the White House issuing a furious denouncement of Bannon and Trump’s attorney threatening a lawsuit in a cease-and-desist letter. Bannon’s conservative allies also sought to distance themselves. On Thursday morning, Bannon returned to the airwaves, telling his followers that “there’s no one we think higher [of] than Donald Trump.” He also accused “left-wing” media of attempting to create the feud between him and Trump, assuring listeners that “we are tight.” “Nothing will ever come between us and President Trump and his agenda. Don’t worry about that,” the Breitbart chairman told a caller on his show. “Don’t worry about us and Trump and the [Make America Great Again] agenda. We are tight on this as we’ve ever been.” Trump and the White House all but cut off ties with Bannon on Wednesday, after it was revealed that he unleashed a bevy of criticisms and accusations against members of the Trump administration and the president’s family in journalist Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury.

    "title": "From ‘The Great Manipulator’ To ‘Sloppy Steve’ – The Fall Of Bannon",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Just a few months ago, Steve Bannon was warning “establishment” Republicans that a “day of reckoning” was at hand. As it turns out, he was right. Bannon, President Donald Trump’s initial top aide and self-described architect of his improbable victory, has fallen faster than might have seemed possible – from “The Great Manipulator” on the cover of Time magazine to the owner of a new, derisive Trump nickname in less than a year. “Sloppy Steve,” Trump called him Friday ― a continuation of the criticism that began on Wednesday when the president declared in a lengthy statement that Bannon had done little for his campaign or his presidency. Bannon did not respond to a query for comment, even as his erstwhile allies abandoned him to declare their loyalty to Trump. In a new book by author Michael Wolff, Bannon is quoted as describing first son Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with Russians as “treasonous” and calling first daughter Ivanka Trump “dumb as a brick.” The clearest beneficiary of the new schism: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose now 51-49 Republican majority was threatened by Bannon’s vow to defeat GOP incumbents and McConnell-backed challengers in the upcoming Senate primaries. “I’d like to associate myself with what the president had to say about Steve Bannon,” McConnell said, referring to Trump’s broadsides against his former “chief strategist.” “It kind of goes to what we’ve been saying all along. Candidates get themselves too close to Steve Bannon, they’re going to have to answer for his toxic views,” said Chris Pack, who is with the McConnell-endorsed Senate Leadership Fund super PAC. “It seems common sense at this point that you would not want to associate yourself with somebody who’s at war with the president of your own party.” Other Republicans, critics of Trump as well as Bannon, wonder whether Bannon’s exile matters at all. “At the end of the day, he is a fraud, and so is the president,” said John Weaver, who ran Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s GOP presidential campaign in 2016. Weaver added that what Bannon does next, or does not do, makes no difference. “Trump and Bannon are backing the same people. They’re backing nutjobs who would lose the general election. Trump was the original Bannon. It’s not like Bannon’s the only alt-right loon who’s talking to the president.” “It seems common sense at this point that you would not want to associate yourself with somebody who’s at war with the president of your own party.” Bannon was the earliest right-wing media impresario to champion Trump. In the summer of 2015, he threw his Breitbart website and radio show behind the New York City reality TV host in a field of GOP senators and governors. That move, though, was more about making Bannon’s anti-immigration ideology a central issue in the Republican primary ― Bannon had previously considered backing then-Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for the same reason ― than a belief that Trump could actually win. When Trump wound up defeating the last of his Republican rivals in the spring of 2016, Bannon was given much of the credit. He took on an unofficial advisory role in the campaign, and then was given charge of it in late summer at the urging of Robert and Rebekah Mercer. The billionaire father and daughter team had supported Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the primaries, but came over to Trump after he locked down the nomination. They had for years funded Bannon’s ventures, including Breitbart. Trump’s unexpected victory in November catapulted a man best known for running a white-nationalist-leaning, anti-immigrant website directly into the West Wing. On paper, Bannon was a co-equal with chief of staff Reince Priebus and on a key committee on the National Security Council. But because Bannon had no official job duties, he was free to do whatever he wanted. And what Bannon wanted was to push through as many of his Breitbart-world agenda items as possible, as fast as possible, from withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement to a disastrously implemented travel ban against a handful of majority-Muslim countries. The resulting chaos of those early weeks became the leitmotif of the Trump White House ― an outfit that could not get out of its own way, despite having a largely docile Republican Congress at its beck and call. As spring became summer, Trump’s own family began advocating for a more traditional structure. In August, that structure came in the form of John Kelly, the retired Marine general running the Department of Homeland Security. He took over as chief of staff with the understanding that everyone in the West Wing would henceforth report to him ― a condition that led to Bannon’s easing out by the middle of the month. Bannon claimed he had wanted to leave and that he was actually more powerful outside the White House. Always fond of apocalyptic themes and militaristic language, Bannon told The Weekly Standard: “I’ve got my hands back on my weapons. Someone said, ‘It’s Bannon the Barbarian.’ I am definitely going to crush the opposition.” To prove it, he inserted himself into a Senate primary race in Alabama ― on the side of Roy Moore, who had been twice removed from the state Supreme Court for defying federal court orders. Trump announced his support for Luther Strange, who had been appointed to the post after Sessions became Trump’s attorney general, at the request of McConnell. McConnell and other mainstream Republicans argued that Strange would certainly win the general election, while Moore could quite possibly lose. As it happens, that split with Trump wound up foreshadowing the even deeper, seemingly unbridgeable rift created by Wolff’s book. Bannon relished the fight. “Mitch McConnell and this permanent political class is the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country,” he said shortly before the September runoff election. When Moore easily won, Bannon promised that it was merely the first in a series of victories that his stable of populist insurgents would win over McConnell’s candidates. “Your day of reckoning is coming,” he said. When a series of women came forward accusing Moore of having sought sexual relations with them when they were teens ― including one who claimed Moore had sexually assaulted her when she was 14 ― Bannon refused to back down, even sending reporters from Breitbart to Alabama to destroy the women’s credibility. Trump, apparently consulting with Bannon, declared that he believed Moore’s denials. “Get out and vote for Roy Moore,” Trump said just days before the election at a rally in Pensacola, Florida, just over the bridge from Mobile, Alabama. When Moore lost to Doug Jones ― the first Democrat to win a Senate election in Alabama since 1992 ― Trump then turned the blame on Bannon. He even cited that race in his 266-word statement on Wednesday in response to Bannon’s quotes in the book. “Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans,” Trump said. “Steve doesn’t represent my base ― he’s only in it for himself.” “He was more of a barnacle on the side of the Trump movement than vice-versa … His political organization, whatever that was, was always an empty suit.” Trump’s feud with Bannon has cast his former top aide’s entire future in doubt. The Mercers have reportedly broken with Bannon, while candidates Bannon was hoping to call his own are distancing themselves from him. “Steve Bannon is only one of many high-profile endorsements Dr. Ward has received,” said the campaign of Kelli Ward, who is running for the GOP Senate nomination in Arizona. “Her focus remains on winning this race, which she is in a great position to do, and then helping President Trump advance an America First agenda.” New York Republican Michael Grimm, who left his House seat after his prison sentence for tax fraud and is now seeking to return, also disowned Bannon. “I strongly denounce the comments by Steve Bannon as quoted by Michael Wolff,” Grimm said in a statement. “When you’ve got people like Michael Grimm putting out statements, things aren’t going well,” said Rory Cooper, once an aide to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.). Cooper and other Republicans argued that Bannon had always been overrated. “He was more of a barnacle on the side of the Trump movement than vice-versa … His political organization, whatever that was, was always an empty suit,” Cooper said. “It also goes to the question of whether you can replicate the Trump situation to lower ballot candidates, and I don’t think you can.” What influence Bannon can retain in the coming months remains an open question. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders suggested from the podium that Breitbart consider firing Bannon. Breitbart did not respond to a query on Bannon’s status, but if he winds up being forced from his role as chairman, it could leave him without a platform at all, just as primary contests begin. “If a tree falls in the woods and nobody’s around to hear it make a noise, does it make a sound?” asked Pack, of the Senate Leadership Fund.

    "title": "Trump Feud Is Putting Steve Bannon’s Favored Primary Candidates In A Bind",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Just a few months ago, conservative candidates looking to topple GOP incumbents were jockeying to win the support of Steve Bannon, the Breitbart News executive chairman who had a finger on the pulse of Donald Trump’s America. Bannon’s stock dropped sharply Wednesday, however, after several news outlets published excerpts of an explosive new book by journalist Michael Wolff in which Bannon is quoted criticizing several members of Trump’s administration, including son Donald Trump Jr., daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. According to the book, the former White House strategist called the infamous meeting between Trump Jr. and Russian operatives at Trump Tower in June 2016 “treasonous.” The White House denied many other juicy details in the book and issued an angry statement from Trump that claimed his former staffer had “lost his mind.” “Steve Bannon has nothing to with me or my Presidency,” Trump said in the statement. “Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look.” Bannon has been a reviled figure among the Republican establishment for targeting vulnerable GOP incumbents across the country whom he deemed insufficiently supportive of Trump’s agenda. Now that Trump has distanced himself, it has put pressure on the candidates Bannon had endorsed to follow suit. “After Steve Bannon’s vicious attacks on President Trump and his family, [Attorney General] Patrick Morrisey should immediately disavow Bannon’s support,” Rep. Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.) said in a Wednesday press release, taking aim at his GOP primary rival for the Senate. “If he refuses, West Virginians will know that what President Trump said of Bannon today is also true of Morrisey: ‘he is only in it for himself.’” Morrisey’s campaign brushed off the attack by stating that he “does not support these attacks on President Trump and his family.” Several other Bannon-backed candidates similarly downplayed the Breitbart News chief’s endorsement, yet they did not break with him entirely. A spokesman for Kelli Ward, who is running to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), said that Bannon was “only one of many high-profile endorsements” she has received so far. The spokesman dismissed what he called the “daily parlor intrigue” in Washington but did not renounce Bannon’s support. In Wisconsin, U.S. Senate candidate Kevin Nicholson similarly rejected a call from a GOP primary rival to denounce Bannon, stating through a spokesman that it is “disappointing” that she would “take this moment to attack another Republican for an endorsement she herself aggressively sought.” Danny Tarkanian, a Bannon-backed conservative candidate seeking to unseat Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), meanwhile, said he’d still welcome Bannon’s support. “If Mr. Bannon chooses to support me in our effort to repeal and replace Dean Heller with someone who will truly have the President’s back, I welcome his support,” he said. Not every favored candidate of Bannon held their fire on the matter, however. Former New York congressman-turned-convict Michael Grimm, who is mounting a bid to win back his seat, said he “strongly” denounced Bannon’s comments. “They are baseless attacks against the President’s family, beyond disturbing, and I fully support our Commander in Chief,” Grimm said in a statement. Paul Nehlen, who is challenging House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and whom Bannon recently disavowed over his flirtations with white nationalism, had the last laugh. “Good thing I had already been disavowed by Bannon and Breitbart, or I might be in an embarrassing position!” Nehlen said. The ostracization of Bannon from the White House and on the campaign trail is good news for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who started the new year with one fewer GOP member in Congress. Bannon’s preferred candidate in Alabama’s Senate race, Roy Moore, lost to Democrat Doug Jones, who was sworn into the Senate on Wednesday. McConnell’s campaign couldn’t help but gloat on Twitter. pic.twitter.com/683UJFlKL4 Amanda Terkel contributed reporting.

    "text": "Steve Bannon suggested President Donald Trump was aware of Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with Russian operatives at Trump Tower in June 2016 ― because he met with them that day, too, according to an explosive new book by acclaimed journalist Michael Wolff. The former White House strategist was quoted by Wolff as saying there was “zero” chance Trump Jr. didn’t walk the Russian meeting attendees “up to his father’s office on the 26th floor.” SIREN: \"Steve Bannon was certain that after the (July 2016 Trump Tower) meeting, Trump, Jr. had taken the participants to see his father,\" per excerpts from new Michael Wolff book, \"Fire & Fury.\"Trump has claimed he was unaware any meeting with Russians took place. NEW: Here's the Bannon quote regarding the July 2016 Trump Tower meeting: \"The chance that Don Jr. did not walk these Jumos up to his father’s office of the 26th floor is zero,” per \"Fire & Fury.\" (pg. 255) Wolff met with Bannon during the nine months he was granted far-reaching access to the West Wing and senior administration officials to write a tell-all book about the White House, Fire and Fury, set for release on Jan. 9. The revelations appeared to contradict Trump’s repeated claims that he was unaware his eldest son, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner, had met with the Russians. Bannon also dubbed the infamous Trump Tower meeting as “treasonous” and “bad shit,” according to Wolff. The far-right icon mocked Trump Jr. and Kushner for taking the meeting in hopes of acquiring dirt on Hillary Clinton, Trump’s political opponent in the 2016 presidential race, as first revealed by The New York Times in July. “The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor — with no lawyers,” Bannon told Wolff, according to The Guardian, which obtained a copy of the book. “Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately,” he added. Bannon predicted special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and the Russian government will focus on money laundering. “This is all about money laundering,” Bannon told Wolff. “Mueller chose [senior prosecutor Andrew] Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy. Their path to fucking Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr and Jared Kushner … It’s as plain as a hair on your face.” Bannon suggested Kushner’s business dealings with German financial juggernaut Deutsche Bank, which has loaned hundreds of millions of dollars to the Kushner family real estate business, would be problematic for the administration. “The Kushner shit is greasy,” Bannon said. “They’re going to go right through that. They’re going to roll those two guys up and say play me or trade me.” Four Trump associates have been indicted in connection to the probe, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who also attended the Trump Tower meeting. Manafort was indicted by a grand jury in October on charges of conspiracy and money laundering. “They’re going to crack Don Junior like an egg on national TV,” Bannon said, adding that the White House should reconsider its apparent lack of concern over the Mueller investigation. “They’re sitting on a beach trying to stop a Category Five.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Widow Of Kansas Hate Crime Victim Makes Touching Plea For The New Year",
    "text": "As the New Year begins, the widow of an Indian hate crime victim is making a plea to Americans ― urging people to embrace each others’ differences. Sunayana Dumala, who lost husband Srinivas Kuchibhotla after a fatal shooting in Kansas last February, asked friends and well-wishers to add another resolution to their 2018 list. “Take some time to understand and embrace diversity in race, culture and religion. It is in our hands to make our society safe and secure for our future generations and create a fearless world,” Dumala wrote in a Facebook post late Monday night. “Please, make this as one of your priorities and work towards it as even though we know life is uncertain we are never prepared for that uncertainty. ” Dumala was thrust into the national spotlight after her husband was attacked at a bar in Olathe, Kansas, on Feb. 22. The suspect, Adam Purinton, reportedly shouted “Get out of my country” before shooting at Kuchibhotla and another Indian immigrant, Alok Madasani. Kuchibhotla died in the attack and Madasani was injured. Purinton has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder and attempted first-degree murder in Kansas’ Johnson County. He was indicted on federal hate crime charges in June. In her Facebook post, Dumala called 2017 one of the worst years of her life. “Like every other year both me and Srinu welcomed year 2017 with lot of hopes. A year of promises to be with each other and hopefully grow our family by adding new addition,” Dumala wrote. “Unfortunately, it didn’t turn out that way because of one man’s ignorance, hate and anger, giving our family an irreparable loss and shattering our dreams.” Dumala also addressed her husband directly in the post, telling him about how he continues to inspire her. “Srinu you are very dearly missed by everyone and nothing can replace your natural aura and charisma that made you special,” she wrote. “But it is your positive attitude that is driving us forward and it is with same positivity I welcome year 2018 with the hope that we spread the message of love and empathy.” Since her husband’s death, Dumala became an activist and a public figure in the Indian American community. She’s spoken out for immigration reform and has tried to spread a message of love and empathy. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Dumala spoke about the incredible amount of support she’s received since the tragedy from her neighbors, her employer and others. “This is what America stands for,” she said during the panel, according to KCUR. “We are one people.

    "title": "Wisconsin Is Quietly Becoming The Top Senate Race Of 2018",
    "text": "Ask a Democrat what Senate races worries them this year, and Missouri, Indiana, West Virginia and North Dakota will likely be near the top. All are states that Donald Trump won in 2016, and the Democratic senators seeking re-election in them have staked out moderate paths to appeal to some of their less liberal constituents. But increasingly, Democrats point to another race as one they’re worried about: Wisconsin. That’s where Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin already has been targeted by an onslaught of outside spending from conservative groups. Party leaders say the odds remain in her favor, but they’re sure not going to take the race for granted. Conservative groups have so far spent at least $3.1 million against Baldwin, which is more than what all the other Democratic Senate incumbents on the ballot this year have faced combined (under $550,000), according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Those figures reflect what these groups have publicly reported to the Federal Election Commission. But the Baldwin campaign has tracked the spending on ads and found there’s even more money flowing into the state that aims to undercut her political fortunes. So-called dark money groups don’t have to necessarily report this spending to the FEC because their efforts don’t specifically call for Baldwin’s defeat. Nine groups have spent more than $4.7 million on ads that attack Baldwin and/or boost one of the Republicans vying to oppose her, according to her campaign’s tracking (shown in the chart below). One of the groups, Freedom Partners, said it has actually spent $1.6 million on its TV and digital campaign in Wisconsin, although the Baldwin campaign has tracked only $600,000. Solutions for Wisconsin confirmed that it’s spent about $100,000. The other groups either didn’t return a request for comment or declined to confirm how much they’ve spent. Aside from the outside spending, Democrats have other reasons to closely watch Wisconsin. First, Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican machine he’s built in the state are formidable, as Democrats have seen from past elections and legislative fights. Baldwin is one of the last standing Democrats serving statewide in Wisconsin, and the GOP desperately wants to topple her. Walker is up for re-election in 2018, meaning he’ll help bring out Republican voters to the polls. A slew of Democrats seek their party’s nomination to defeat him, but there’s still no clear frontrunner and no one doubts that Walker is formidable. “Scott Walker’s got a great operation,” a GOP campaign aide said, predicting that the Senate race will be tight. The governor has “a fully formed, aggressive, well-funded effort already underway in every major voting population center in the state, and the nominee (to oppose Baldwin) will benefit from it.” Democrats are still stinging from what happened in Wisconsin’s 2016 Senate race. Nearly everyone ― including most Republicans ― expected Democrat Russ Feingold to retake his old seat from incumbent Republican Ron Johnson. Republicans were so convinced that Johnson would be gone that the National Republican Senate Committee cancelled its plans to spend $800,000 on TV ads in the final weeks before Election Day. But Johnson beat Feingold by nearly four percentage points, surpassing Trump’s victory margin in the state (which was less than one point). And a big reason for Johnson’s win, according to Patrick Guarasci, a Democratic political consultant based in Wisconsin, was the outside money that poured in on his behalf. Super PACs dumped millions of dollars into the race to defeat Feingold, known for the signature 2002 law restricting campaign spending that he co-sponsored with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). The Wisconsin State Journal called these contributions Johnson’s “secret weapon.” “The (Republican National Committee), the Republican Senate campaign ― a lot of folks started to decrease their support” for Johnson,” Guarasci said. “But these billionaires got together over the summer in 2016 and dumped millions of dollars into the election. No matter what, they were not going to leave Ron Johnson.” A big source of the money this year is coming from Dick Uihlein, a billionaire businessman who lives in Illinois but often invests heavily in Wisconsin politics. With his wife, he donated $23 million to Republicans in the 2016 cycle. This cycle, Uihlein has given at least $3.5 million to Solutions for Wisconsin, a super PAC backing Kevin Nicholson, one of the two major Republican Senate candidates. Uihlein also has donated to several other groups helping out Nicholson. Here are a couple of the pro-Nicholson ads: What’s significant about Uihlein’s support is that a hefty portion of his donations came before Nicholson even officially entered the race as an enticement for him to do so. “It’s so bizarre,” Guarasci said, adding, “It’s shocking to me that in 2017, more than a year before the election, they were already on television going after Tammy here. So that cannot be discounted, the amount of early money that is being spent to try to define Tammy in these contentious times. That is something that is almost unprecedented, in my view ― and potentially could be the new normal in some of these hot states like Wisconsin.” Nicholson is an untraditional GOP candidate, to say the least. Sure, he’s a clean-cut veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with degrees from Ivy League universities who expounds on conservative ideas. But he’s also the former president of the national College Democrats who spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. Supporters say he’s a fresh face who came around to the power of conservative ideas, while detractors say he’s an opportunist who can’t be trusted. In addition to Uihlein, Nicholson has attracted support from the Club for Growth, a group that promotes fiscal conservative policies, and Steve Bannon, the former Trump aide and current Breitbart News executive who loves to back outsiders willing to upend the establishment. “Tammy Baldwin has failed the people of Wisconsin on so many levels and will most certainly be defeated in November,” Nicholson spokesman Brandon Moody said. “Kevin Nicholson is a Marine whose commitment to public service is at his core. We’re thrilled with the growing momentum, and the many conservative endorsements Kevin has received as he earns the support of voters in every corner of this great state.” Challenging Nicholson for the Republican nomination is Leah Vukmir, a conservative member of the state Senate who has won endorsements from powerful Wisconsin GOP politicians and praise from talk radio hosts. Vukmir is backed by Wisconsin billionaire Diane Hendricks, who also pledged her support for the state senator before she even entered the race. Jess Ward, Vukmir’s campaign manager, said that despite the influx of cash backing Nicholson, the candidate with the most money doesn’t always win ― just look at Trump in 2016. Ward also took a subtle jab at the fact that Uihlein doesn’t live in Wisconsin. “Leah’s focus has been to run a Wisconsin-based campaign,” she said. “Her staff is from Wisconsin, her advisers and consultants understand Wisconsin, and that’s where we’re coming from.” Nicholson and Vukmir already have traded barbs. On Wednesday, Vukmir pressured Nicholson to disavow Bannon following reports on the one-time close Trump ally bad-mouthing the president’s family in a forthcoming book. Nicholson’s campaign responded by saying it was “disappointing” she was attacking a fellow Republican. GOP campaign aides who spoke with HuffPost said that yes, a bruising fight leading up to the Aug. 14 primary worries them. It’s a drain on resources, and attacks get thrown around that can then be used as ammunition in the general election battle. But the outside spending helps insulate against the first concern, since donors are allowed to give unlimited amounts of cash to the super PACS targeting Baldwin. And on the second point, Republicans hope that their eventual nominee can emerge from the primary the stronger for having been tested. Party officials also succeeded in getting Nicholson and Vukmir to sign a unity pledge, with each promising to support the primary winner. The dynamics of the GOP race could change if Eric Hovde, a millionaire hedge fund manager from Madison, decides to jump in. But regardless of what happens among the Republicans, there will be plenty of anti-Baldwin ads running on air. “It’s no surprise that Tammy Baldwin is the top target of big money special interests who want Washington to keep working for them, not Wisconsin,” said her campaign press secretary, Bill Neidhardt. “Regardless of how much these out-of-state billionaires and right-wing groups pump into Wisconsin, people here know that Tammy Baldwin has been listening to them and not the special interests. The fact is Tammy has reached across party lines to lead ‘Buy American’ reforms to protect the state’s economy, advocate for dairy farmers and our small towns, and lower Wisconsin families’ prescription drug costs.” While Democrats are keeping what happened to Feingold in 2016 in mind, they’re also looking back at what happened in 2012. Specifically, they’re looking at Sen. Sherrod Brown’s successful re-election that year. The Democrat from Ohio was that cycle’s biggest target of outside spending by conservatives. There are a couple of other similarities: Baldwin’s fight isn’t attracting quite as much attention right now as some other high-profile Senate contests, just as Brown’s wasn’t. Brown also never abandoned his progressive populist positions, even though he was running in a battleground state. Baldwin, similarly, remains one of the Senate’s most liberal members ― unlike some of her Democratic colleagues in Trump states that tend to tack more to the middle or the right. The site FiveThirtyEight, which tracks how often members of Congress vote with Trump, found that Baldwin is near the bottom of that metric ― right along with Democratic senators from significantly bluer states such as Massachusetts, New York and California. And that’s part of the reason she’s being battered so early by so much outside spending. “Tammy is one of the most liberal members of the Senate in a state won barely ― but won ― by Trump,” Charles Franklin, the polling director at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, said. “And Walker is on the ballot for a third term. I think structurally, those were reasons for outside groups in particular to think this would be a tough battle for her.” But Brown showed that liberals can win in highly competitive states. “The money ... spent (attacking) Sherrod Brown ― that dog didn’t hunt because people knew him,” Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said. And Democrats expect that rather than drift to the right, Baldwin will emphasize economic populist issues that appeal to voters regardless of party, in a similar way that Brown did. Baldwin often talks about manufacturing issues, and Trump has even said he supports her legislation to strengthen federal requirements that American-made products be used in certain construction projects. Outside money also has come to her aid. The Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic group, has spent $1 million on TV and digital ads. Majority Forward, America Working Together and Vote Vets partnered to spend $500,000 on TV and radio spots touting her. And a few months ago, the League of Conservation Voters spent $300,000 on a TV ad thanking Baldwin for a vote protecting the Great Lakes. Guarasci said that while Baldwin is a progressive champion, he views her as more in the mold of Herb Kohl, the low-key Democratic senator she replaced. Baldwin made history in winning the seat in 2012, becoming the first ― and so far only ― openly gay person elected to the Senate. (Pennsylvania Democrat Harris Wofford came out long after he lost his Senate seat in 1994.) “Tammy Baldwin believes in getting shit done,” Guarasci said. “She believes that if you call her office, you’re going to get excellent constituent relations. ... She’s not a bomb thrower.” A number of the ads run against Baldwin have focused on the GOP tax bill. How that will play in the 2018 midterms remains to be seen, but it will no doubt be a major issue: Democrats are going to emphasize the large corporate tax cut it delivered, while Republicans will say the measure’s opponents voted to oppose a middle-class tax cut and preserve a rigged system benefiting special interests. “When Wisconsin needed relief, Tammy Baldwin raised taxes,” said Freedom Partners spokesman Bill Riggs. “When Washington spent too much, Tammy Baldwin raised taxes.” Also likely to come up in the race is the scandal at the Veterans Affairs’ medical center in Tomah, Wisconsin. Baldwin has been accused of not acting aggressively enough to address the overprescription of opioids at the facility, where the Center for Investigative Reporting has noted there have been dozens of suspicious deaths. Baldwin ended up firing an aide and disciplined three others over the controversy and introduced legislation intended to address opiate drug prescriptions at the VA. “Whether it is her failure to help Wisconsin veterans at the Tomah VA, or her efforts to block tax cuts for Wisconsin middle-class families, Senator Baldwin has proven time and again that she is working for her radical friends in Washington, not for the people of Wisconsin,” NRSC Communications Director Katie Martin said. And then, of course, there’s Trump and how he will factor into the midterm elections. He may have eked out a win in Wisconsin in 2016, but Democrats carried it in the previous seven presidential elections. Franklin said he hasn’t polled Trump’s approval rating in the state since June, but it generally falls about where it is nationally ― and nationally, Trump’s approval is down.

    "title": "10 Democratic Primaries To Watch In 2018",
    "text": "After big wins in Virginia and Alabama last year, Democrats are poised to make gains in this November’s midterm elections. But first, a series of contentious Democratic primaries could shape how well the party fares in November, as well as the ideological character of the incoming Democratic elected officials. Here are some of the most pivotal Democratic Party primaries to watch in 2018. And here’s HuffPost’s rundown of fractious Republican primaries that bear watching this year. The battle to unseat Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, an unpopular former private equity titan, has already prompted massive spending on the Democratic side. J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire private equity magnate and heir of the Hyatt hotel chain, has already spent $21 million, and has an additional $21 million in cash on hand. Pritzker’s spending has bought him a place at the top of the pack, with 39 percent support among primary voters, according to an October poll conducted by Capitol Fax/We Ask America. Chris Kennedy, a businessman and son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, had just 15 percent in the same poll. Kennedy has lately made a play for the support of black voters, attacking Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D) for presiding over a “strategic gentrification plan ... to push people of color out of the city.” But more than one-third of Democratic voters remain undecided, according to the Capitol Fax/We Ask America survey, which means the race is very much in flux. Illinois’ diehard progressives may have a hard time getting excited about the contest. The most liberal competitive candidate, state Sen. Daniel Biss, rankled some left-wing activists when he jettisoned Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa as his running mate after Ramirez-Rosa refused to renounce the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel. Another progressive contender, Chicago Alderman Ameya Pawar, dropped out of the race in October, citing his inability to raise the funds. Marie Newman, a progressive businesswoman, stands a fighting chance of unseating Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), an anti-abortion social conservative from Chicago’s southwestern suburbs. Newman, a former partner at an advertising agency who went on to found an anti-bullying nonprofit, is running on a mainstream liberal platform that would make her hard to distinguish from many other members of the House Democratic Caucus. But compared with Lipinski, she’s the second coming of Elizabeth Warren. In addition to favoring abortion restrictions, Lipinski has opposed a law that would protect LGBT Americans from workplace discrimination, and has taken several conservative stances on immigration, including by voting against a 2010 version of the Dream Act. (Last summer, Lipinski co-sponsored a bill extending legal protection for undocumented immigrants who benefitted from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.) Lipinski’s deviations from the increasingly progressive Democratic Party consensus have been enough for Newman to win endorsements from mainstream liberal groups, like NARAL Pro-Choice America, the Human Rights Campaign and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s political action committee, as well as more predictable players like Daily Kos, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Democracy for America and MoveOn.org. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Emily’s List and a long list of influential labor unions have yet to endorse in the race. In the campaign to succeed retiring Rep. Luis Gutíerrez (D-Ill.), whose majority-Latino seat in Chicago and its suburbs is reliably Democratic, the distinctions between two leading contenders ― Cook County Commissioner Jesús “Chuy” García, 61, and Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 28 ― can seem superficial to the point of insignificance. Rather than a fight over big policy differences, the battle appears to be a choice between García’s grandfatherly gravitas, decades of progressive experience and old-school mustache, and Ramirez-Rosa’s youthful exuberance, penchant for democratic socialism and hip undercut coiffeur. And indeed, assuming that either García or Ramirez-Rosa emerges as the Democratic nominee ― an outcome that is all but certain ― the district’s progressive activists are assured a reliable fighter in Washington. Both candidates are to the left of Gutíerrez, an outspoken immigrant rights champion who has nonetheless maintained close ties to establishment party leaders, including centrist Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel (D), whose 2015 re-election Gutíerrez backed. García, whose early endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 presidential race has earned him the senator’s backing this time around, ran a competitive, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, challenge against Emanuel in 2015 that forced the first mayoral runoff in Chicago history. And since Ramirez-Rosa’s 2015 election, he has become one of Emanuel’s most unrelenting critics on the Chicago city council. On policy, García and Ramirez-Rosa both embrace progressive priorities, from Medicare-for-all and a $15 minimum wage to the broadest possible protection of undocumented immigrants. An area of divergence is on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS, movement against Israel, which Ramirez-Rosa, unlike García, has refused to unequivocally condemn. But a victory for Ramirez-Rosa, the underdog in the race, would mark an historic milestone for the newly energized, socialism-infused American left. Ramirez-Rosa, who would be the first openly gay Latino member of Congress, would also be the only dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America in the current Congress. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has cruised to re-election four times since first taking office in 1992, now faces serious competition from the left. California state Senate President Kevin de León, 51, a former teacher union organizer whose parents were Guatemalan immigrants, is the most prominent challenger thus far. Alison Hartson, a 37-year-old leader of WolfPAC, a group trying to get money out of politics, is also mounting an underdog bid to unseat Feinstein. Hartson, a former high school teacher, enjoys the endorsement of left-leaning Justice Democrats, a group tied to The Young Turks, a popular progressive online outlet where Hartson announced her bid. Feinstein, a former San Francisco mayor who, at 84, is the oldest member of the Senate, has long attracted progressive ire for centrist positions on national security, such as support for the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of Americans’ phone data. Feinstein opposes single-payer health care and publicly disapproved of the 2016 ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana in California. She also frustrated liberals in August when she expressed her view that if Donald Trump can “learn and change,” he can be “a good president.” Feinstein holds major structural advantages in the race. She has $4 million in cash on hand, and the backing of other leading California Democrats, including Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a top contender in the 2018 gubernatorial race. California’s unique top-two “jungle primary” system also provides Feinstein a key edge. The senior senator will face De León, Hartson, Republican contenders, and other challengers in an all-party primary on June 5. The top two performers in that contest will then vie for votes in the general election on Nov. 6. If Feinstein and a more progressive candidate are on the ballot together, Republicans and moderate independents could propel her to victory out of disdain for the alternative. Even if de León loses in the general election, a Senate race without a Republican choice is liable to drive down overall Republican turnout. That could help Democrats unseat vulnerable Republican House members. Notwithstanding his 66 percent approval rating, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has drawn seven Democratic challengers. The contenders are Prince George’s County Executive Rushern Baker; Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz; former NAACP President Ben Jealous; state Sen. Richard Madaleno; attorney James Shea; tech entrepreneur Alec Ross; and former Michelle Obama aide Krishanti Vignarajah. Jealous, a prominent supporter of Sanders’ presidential bid, has attracted the most interest from progressive activists and organizations, and has the backing of Sanders and his group Our Revolution. Among other ambitious proposals, Jealous is campaigning for state-level single-payer health insurance in Maryland, and for free public college or vocational training. If Jealous performs well, it will likely reflect positively on the power of Sanders’ blessing and coattails. An eighth contender, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, a progressive policy consultant with years of experience fighting to protect and expand Social Security and Medicare, suspended her campaign on Friday for what she told supporters were “personal reasons.” Politico reported that Rockeymoore Cummings’ decision to leave the race was linked to a deterioration in the health of her husband, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who was hospitalized this week for a procedure to drain an infection. In an early October poll released before Rockeymoore Cummings entered the race, Baker fared the best in a hypothetical matchup against Hogan, followed by Kamenetz, Jealous and Madaleno. With Democrats eager to claw back a sliver of their former glory in Michigan, the Democratic gubernatorial primary is shaping up to be a heated battle over how best to do that. Former state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer (D), the establishment favorite, has the endorsements of Emily’s List, several fellow Democratic state lawmakers, former Gov. Jim Blanchard (D), and some labor unions. Whitmer, 46, has emphasized creating decent-paying jobs by promoting skilled trades and funding vocational training programs, as well as fighting for paid family leave and a $15 minimum wage. A December poll shows Whitmer trailing Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette by 3 percentage points in a hypothetical matchup. Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a 33-year-old former Detroit health director, is running against Whitmer from the left with a populist insurgent campaign that has excited the party’s Sanders wing. During his tenure as Detroit’s chief public health official, El-Sayed, a physician with a Ph.D. in epidemiology, drew accolades for, among other innovations, a program to provide free eyeglasses to Detroit’s low-income schoolchildren. He proposes creating a state-level public health insurance program to help achieve affordable coverage, and establishing universal pre-K education ― stances that have helped him pick up the backing of local chapters of Our Revolution and the Michigan Nurses Association. If elected, El-Sayed would be the country’s first Muslim governor. Some of the state’s most influential labor unions, including the United Auto Workers, Michigan Education Association and Service Employees International Union, have sat out the race thus far. Their involvement could prove pivotal later. In Georgia, where Democrats hope revulsion of Trump’s presidency and increasing diversity have put the state within their grasp for the first time since 2002, state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams is locked in an already-tight battle with state Rep. Stacey Evans. Abrams, who is black, has sought to claim the progressive mantle, locking up the endorsements of national groups like Emily’s List and Democracy for America. She has emphasized her desire to win without appealing to conservative whites, who have left the party in recent years. If she wins, she’d become the country’s first black woman governor. But Abrams has no shortage of detractors in Georgia’s Democratic ranks. Critics, including Evans, who is white, criticize Abrams for cooperating with Republicans too easily on cuts to liberal priorities, like the state’s HOPE scholarship program for public universities. On other issues, like her support for charter schools and state takeovers of challenged schools, Evans is more in line with the pro-business wing of the party. Evans, a HOPE scholarship recipient, is running on reversing cuts to the college-tuition program (a priority Abrams also supports). She wowed pundits with an opening advertisement about her rise from a childhood of rural poverty. In deep-blue New York, Republicans effectively control the state Senate. That’s surprising not so much because of the Empire State’s liberal reputation, but because Democrats technically have a 32-31 majority in the chamber. Republicans, though, have the support of eight Democrats in the GOP-aligned Independent Democratic Conference, and a ninth Democrat, Simcha Felder, who caucuses with Republicans. As a result, Democratic priorities that have passed the Assembly easily are stymied or watered down in the Senate. Since Trump’s election, top New York Democrats have made statements pressuring Felder and the Independent Democratic Conference to return to the fold. There also have been grassroots protests against the renegade members. Now, serious challengers have arisen to unseat the breakaway lawmakers in Sept. 13 primaries. Bronx attorney Lewis Kaminski and Alessandra Biaggi have signed up to take on Sen. Jeffrey Klein, the Independent Democratic Conference leader who represents the 34th Senate District. Brooklyn attorney Zellnor Myrie has announced a bid to unseat state Sen. Jesse Hamilton; former mayoral aide Jessica Ramos is challenging state Sen. Jose Peralta; and former City Councilman Robert Jackson is trying to replace state Sen. Marisol Alcantara. Three Democrats are vying to unseat Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.), the only vulnerable Republican in the Kentucky House delegation. Lexington Mayor Jim Gray (D), a popular, openly gay construction magnate, instantly became a front runner when he entered the race in December. Gray’s entry disrupts the plans of Amy McGrath, the first female Marine to fly a combat mission in an F/A-18 fighter jet, whose video advertisement touting her experience as a pilot turned her into a viral sensation in August. Reggie Thomas, an African-American state senator and law professor, is running as the most progressive contender. He vocally supports single-payer health care. Aside from health care, however, there are few major policy disagreements among the three Democratic candidates. All combine socially liberal and progressive economic positions. Instead, it is Gray’s popularity and broad name recognition in the district that led Democratic leaders to recruit him. Rep. John Yarmuth, Kentucky’s only Democratic congressman, does not endorse in party primaries, but was among those who encouraged Gray to enter the race. “Jim’s a superstar down there,” Yarmuth said. California has a number of U.S. House districts where Democrats are mounting competitive bids against Republican incumbents. And, in several of those races, progressive Democrats are battling other Democrats to make it into the top-two runoff. How those candidates fare will test the strength of left-wing organizations backing them, including Justice Democrats, a new group that has endorsed six Democratic House challengers in California alone.

Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) to represent the 49th District. Applegate, who supports single-payer health care and free public college, narrowly lost to Issa in 2016. Among the Democratic candidates, Applegate’s fundraising trails that of progressive clean energy professional Mike Levin, but is slightly ahead of businessman Paul Kerr.

    "title": "10 Humanitarian Crises To Look Out For In 2018",
    "text": "This article originally appeared on IRINnews.org, a news agency specialised in reporting humanitarian crises. By IRIN Editors The UN has appealed for record levels of funding to help those whose lives have been torn apart, but the gap between the funding needs and the funding available continues to grow. And what makes the outlook especially bad for 2018 is that the political will needed to resolve conflicts, welcome refugees, and address climate change also appears to be waning. What a difference a year, a new US president, and a German election make. Here’s our insider take on 10 crises that will shape the humanitarian agenda in 2018 (See 2017’s list here): As Syria heads towards seven years of war and Western governments quietly drop their demands for political transition, it has become increasingly clear that President Bashar al-Assad will stay in power, at least in some capacity. But that doesn’t mean the violence or suffering is over: pockets of resistance are still being starved into submission and being denied aid – nearly three million Syrians still live in areas the UN defines as besieged or “hard to reach” (see: eastern Ghouta right now), while chemical weapons are deployed to horrifying effect. There’s talk of reconstruction where the fighting has fizzled out, be it in areas brought under the government’s control or in cities like Raqqa, which is now controlled by Kurdish forces but has a mixed population that is beginning to come home, to utter destruction. Investors are lining up for a slice of the rebuilding pie. But an average of 6,550 Syrians were displaced by violence each day in 2017. So what of the 6.1 million and counting displaced inside Syria – many sheltering in tents or unfinished buildings and facing another long winter – not to mention the 5.5 million refugees abroad? Will they have a say in how Syria is rebuilt? With reconstruction already a major bone of contention in peace talks and the EU planning to get involved in 2018, how this plays out is important and worth watching. You know the situation is bad when people start fleeing their homes, and it doesn’t get much worse than the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Here, violence in its eastern provinces has triggered the world’s worst displacement crisis – for a second year in a row. More than 1.7 million people abandoned their farms and villages this year, on top of 922,000 in 2016. The provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, Kasai, and Tanganyika are the worst affected and the epicentres of unrest in the country. New alliances of armed groups have emerged to take on a demoralised government army and challenge President Joseph Kabila in distant Kinshasa. He refused to step down and hold elections in 2016 when his constitutionally mandated two-term limit expired – and the political ambition of some of these groups is to topple him. These rebellions are a new addition to the regular lawlessness of armed groups and conflict entrepreneurs that have stalked the region for years. It is a confusing cast of characters, in which the army also plays a freelance role and, as IRIN reported this month, as an instigator of some of the rights abuses that are forcing civilians to flee. As we enter 2018, more than 13 million people require humanitarian assistance and protection – that’s close to six million more people than at the start of 2017. Over three million people are severely food insecure in the Kasai region alone, their villages and fields looted. Aid is only slowly trickling in. The $812 million appeal for Congo is less than 50 percent funded. That lack of international commitment represents the single largest impediment to the humanitarian response. If we repeat the words “world’s worst humanitarian crisis” so often that they starting to lose gravity, here are a few numbers that might help hammer home just how grim life has become after more than two and a half years of war in Yemen, a country of more than 29 million: 8.4 million people are on the verge of starvation; 400,000 children have severe acute malnutrition (that’s as bad as it gets), and more than 5,500 civilians have been killed. Last January, we warned Yemen was at serious risk of sliding into famine. That now seems a near-certainty and may be unfolding right now, with the Saudi Arabian-led coalition continuing to restrict or at least delay commercial imports of food and fuel (among other goods), causing prices to shoot up and meaning those on the margin no longer have enough cash to buy the bare necessities. And what of that cholera epidemic that killed 2,226 and infected nearly a million since April before receding? Nobody has been vaccinated, fuel shortages mean less clean water, and the rainy season is coming. All of this combines to create a real risk that the disease will make a comeback. Diphtheria is on the rise, too. None of this happens in a vacuum: without proper nutrition, Yemenis are increasingly susceptible to illness. A much-anticipated ceasefire in South Sudan didn’t last long. It came into effect at midnight on Christmas Eve, and a few hours later government and rebel forces were fighting around the northern town of Koch in Unity State. The violence hasn’t derailed the peace talks underway in Addis Ababa, but it does point to how difficult it will be for the internationally-backed diplomatic process to shape events on the ground. The ceasefire is between President Salva Kiir and several rebel groups, but confidence is low that negotiations can bring a quick and decisive end to a war entering its fifth year. South Sudan has fragmented, with a host of ethnic militias emerging with shifting loyalties. The various members of this so-called “gun class” all want a seat at the table, in the belief that any future agreement will be based on a power-sharing deal and a division of the country’s resources along the lines of the last failed settlement. The international community lacks leverage and neighbouring countries don’t have the unity of purpose necessary to achieve a broad-based and sustainable peace agreement. What that means is that more refugees – on top of an existing two million – will continue to pour across the country’s borders as the fighting season resumes. It also means some seven million people inside the country – almost two thirds of the remaining population – will still need humanitarian assistance; hunger will also continue to threaten millions as a result of the war, displacement, and collapse of the rural economy. And yes, there will be the threat of renewed famine. One final ingredient in the brew of despair is that the humanitarian community’s access to those in need will be constrained by both the prevailing insecurity and the government’s cynical taxation of aid operations. There are many reasons why Central African Republic was officially the unhappiest country in the world in 2017. You can start with the 50 percent increase in the number of displaced, bringing the total to 633,000 people. Then there are the more than two million hungry people, and the half a million who have figured it’s just too hard to stay and have left for neighbouring countries. It’s not much fun being an aid worker either. In November another humanitarian worker was killed in the north of the country, bringing to 14 the number to have died this year. The level of violence has forced aid agencies to repeatedly suspend operations as their personnel, convoys, and bases are deliberately targeted. Behind the insecurity is a four-year conflict between competing armed groups that neither a weak government nor an under-staffed UN peacekeeping mission can contain. It pits mainly Muslim ex-Séléka rebels against Christian anti-Balaka, but some of the worst fighting has its roots in the splintering of the Séléka coalition and a feud between former allies. The violence across the country boils down to the lucrative control of natural resources and the taxes the groups raise from checkpoints. Such is the insecurity that the government’s writ doesn’t even cover all of the capital, Bangui. After a catastrophic year in which more than 655,000 people were driven out of Myanmar’s Rakhine State, it’s hard to imagine 2018 could go any worse for the Rohingya minority. But, with nearly a million Rohingya refugees crowded into overloaded settlements in southern Bangladesh, the new year brings a host of new questions. The sudden exodus of refugees captured the world’s attention, but as the crisis shifts from emergency response to long-term survival, will the focus – and funding – keep pace with the pressing needs on the ground? Can the fragile settlements withstand a significant storm, or even the seasonal monsoon rains that will fall in a few short months? And will the Bangladeshi and Myanmar authorities try to make good on a plan to repatriate Rohingya refugees despite warnings from any number of aid groups, rights monitors, and UN agencies, and a troubling history of less-than-voluntary returns? While Rakhine State smoulders, long-simmering conflicts continue to fly under the radar elsewhere in Myanmar. Clashes between Myanmar’s military and ethnic armed groups in the country’s north have escalated, largely out of the public spotlight. In northern Kachin and Shan states, some 100,000 people have been uprooted since 2011, when a government ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army collapsed. Roughly 40 percent of these people live in areas outside government control. But Myanmar has also put limits on aid access to areas even under its authority, mirroring the more publicised restrictions in place in Rakhine. Buried somewhere is Myanmar’s long-stalled peace process involving myriad ethnic armed groups operating across the country. A new round of talks is set for later in January. But with only a handful of armed groups on board with a tenuous ceasefire agreement and other key players excluded entirely, a politically negotiated peace remains elusive. Afghanistan begins 2018 facing another volatile year. Conflict has displaced more than one million Afghans over the last two years. But added to this are the ever-growing numbers of Afghans returning from (or rather kicked out of) Europe and neighbouring countries like Pakistan and Iran. They’re coming back to a country that the UN in August concluded was no longer in “post-conflict” mode but in active conflict once again, one where a resurgent Taliban and emboldened Islamic State-aligned militants vie for control as the government’s grasp weakens. The problem can be summarised in one ominous chart, which shows US military estimates that the Afghan government has influence in less than 57 percent of the country’s districts: The raging conflict has had disastrous impacts on Afghan civilians. Last year saw civilian casualties soar to near record-high levels, and an escalating number of people were killed in attacks targeting places of worship – something the UN has called a “disturbing” new element to the violence. Healthcare continues to come under siege, with skirmishes severing access to hospitals and clinics, and aid workers caught in the crossfire. The next 12 months could prove an even greater challenge. January is the start of Afghanistan’s food “lean season”, which will hit those already uprooted by conflict particularly hard. It’s now begrudgingly accepted that a viable peace settlement must include the Taliban – a once unthinkable suggestion – but there has been “no meaningful progress”. With parliamentary elections scheduled for July 2018, the battle for control of Afghanistan will continue on multiple fronts as the snows melt and the fighting resumes in earnest. The descent of Venezuela from oil-rich powerhouse to economic basketcase has been well chronicled. Less thoroughly reported, partly due to media restrictions under the increasingly authoritarian rule of Hugo Chávez’s successor, President Nicolas Máduro, has been the extent of the humanitarian crisis. Shortages of basic goods and soaring inflation have led to growing reports of severe childhood malnutrition in addition to a general healthcare crisis, and to more than a million Venezuelans fleeing the country. If 2017 was the year when the scale of crisis within Venezuela began to reveal itself, 2018 is set to be when the full effects are felt beyond its borders. The political situation underpinning this crisis is only likely to worsen. Elections, slated for December 2018, are expected to be brought forward and foisted upon a weary, hungry, and increasingly desperate electorate that is sharply divided. Unrest or government crackdowns will only send more Venezuelans pouring over the border. There are already signs that regional hospitality is wearing thin and of emergency camps being prepared. The International Monetary Fund predicted that Venezuela’s triple-digit inflation could soar to more than 2,300 percent in 2018. As the year closed out, opposition parties were barred from the election, a main opposition leader was banned from political activity for 15 years, and violent pro-democracy protests rocked the capital, Caracas. None of this augurs well. An AU-EU summit at the end of 2017 seemed to offer a glimmer of hope for the 700,000 to one million migrants stuck in the nightmare that is Libya. It produced a plan to repatriate those who want it, and to move others from squalid detention centres into better conditions. Some flights home did subsequently take off, and a first group (of 162 refugees and migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Yemen) was even evacuated by the UN on 22 December from Libya to Italy. But we’ve yet to see how this scheme will play out, and there are some serious obstacles. Many migrants have nowhere safe to return to, and it’s not clear how a UN-backed government that controls little in the way of territory or popular support will manage to move and protect migrants in a country with multiple governments, militias, and tribes. That the meeting even got press (in large part thanks to a CNN film of what appeared to be a slave auctions) in an oft-ignored country is a sign of how little the world cares about the mostly sub-Saharan African migrants in Libya, for whom kidnapping, extortion, and rape have become the norm. European policy has largely focused on keeping migrants from boarding boats in the Mediterranean or reaching their shores – creating a situation that is bad enough for Libyans and shockingly worse for Africans. At the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron mooted a military and police initiative inside Libya, plus UN sanctions for people-smugglers. How this could actually work is anyone’s guess, and it seems unlikely to get at the source of many migrants’ woes: the lack of legal avenues to get out of the desperate situations that brought them to Libya’s hell in the first place. It’s taken just over a year for political agitation in Cameroon’s anglophone region to turn into armed opposition against the government of President Paul Biya.

Now, government soldiers are being killed, Biya is promising all-out war, and thousands of refugees are fleeing into neighbouring Nigeria. Anglophone Cameroon is becoming radicalised. Refugees recounting experiences of killings by the security forces talk of revenge, and commentators worry that the opportunity for negotiations with more moderate anglophone leaders – those pursuing a policy of civil disobedience and diplomatic pressure on Yaoundé – may be rapidly shrinking. If the government believes there is a military solution to the activists’ demands for an independent “Ambazonia”, made up of the two anglophone regions of western Cameroon, they may well be mistaken. Where the separatists’ training camps are being established, next to the Nigerian border, is a remote and heavily forested zone – ideal for guerrilla warfare. Biya, 85 in February and in power for the past 35 years, is standing in elections once again in 2018. The “anglophone crisis” and the potential of an even larger refugee exodus will not only leave him politically damaged but could be regionally destabilising, especially as Nigeria faces its own separatist challenge.

    "title": "Texas Man Who Used Grindr To Assault And Rob Gay Men Gets 15 Years",
    "text": "A 21-year-old Texas man has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for using Grindr to rob and assault gay men. Nigel Garrett pleaded guilty in federal court to using the popular gay dating app to target victims in four home invasions over a three-week period in the Dallas area last year. With three other men, Garrett passed himself off as a single gay man, and made arrangements to meet victims at their homes in January and February 2017, according to The Dallas Morning News. Once inside the homes, Garrett and the three other men ― Anthony Shelton, Chancler Encalade Jr., and Cameron Ajiduah ― assaulted their victims, tied them up and shouted anti-LGBTQ epithets. In each case, the men carried a gun, and stole personal property, including a car, from their victims, The Washington Post reported in May. Garrett’s sentence followed a plea agreement with federal prosecutors. Shelton, Encalade and Ajiduah also have pleaded guilty, and are awaiting sentencing, the Tyler Morning Telegraph reports. The Justice Department touted the sentence to show its commitment to prosecuting hate crimes. “Hate crimes are an attack on a fundamental principle of the United States to be free from fear of violence because of your sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, religion, or national origin,” Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division said in a statement. “The Department of Justice is committed to using every tool at its disposal to combat this type of violence.” North Texas Gay and Lesbian Alliance President Jeanne Rubin said in May, when the charges were brought, that she was grateful prosecutors recognized the seriousness of the crimes. “You can be scared as a homeowner if your neighbor is robbed,” Rubin told CBS 11 News, “but it’s different if you feel like you’re being targeted for some reason, and in this case, a whole community can feel like they’re targeted.” A Grindr spokesperson told HuffPost in an email that the app was “committed to creating a safe environment through a system of digital and human screening tools to help its users connect and thrive,” and also “encourages users to report suspicious and threatening activities.” “While we are constantly improving upon this process, it is important to remember that Grindr is an open platform,” the spokesperson said. “Grindr cooperates with law enforcement on a regular basis and does not condone abusive or violent behavior.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "The 9 Most Important Scientific Studies For Parents Of 2017",
    "text": "As busy as 2017 was for parents, it may have been busier still for the development psychologists, biologists, neurologists and family-focused sociologists researching how children become functional adults — or why they don’t. The last year saw the publication of an outsized number of game-changing studies that might, over time, alter the way that parents go about parenting and, by the transitive property, the way that kids go about kidding. Do scientists know for certain how to raise the best possible person and how to track that persons progress from the crib to the board room? No, not by a long shot. But they know a great deal more than they did a year ago and, thanks to their diligent work, parents know more too and can make better informed decisions. Here are the scientific breakthroughs from 2017 most likely to inform parenting decisions for the next decade — or at least until the next breakthrough comes along. Researchers: Brandon McDaniel, a professor of family and consumer services, and Jenny Radesky, a physician and professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan. Why it matters: There’s a growing body of research that shows that smartphones are not the smartest thing for adults and kids to stare at, but the study by McDaniel and Radesky specifically links parents phone attention to children’s bad behavior. Working with 200 families, the researchers were able to demonstrate that when parents interrupt family time by checking their emails or texting, kids become more likely to exhibit oversensitivity, hot tempers, hyperactivity, and whining. What it means for parents: On some level, it seems that kids compete with phones for attention by acting out. Given that fact, it’s easy enough for parents to save both themselves and their kids some stress by checking the phone in a different room or turning it off at the dinner table. The short term dopamine boost of communication is not worth the long term price. Better to check emails on the toilet and raise a happy kid. Researchers: John Protzko, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Why it matters: The Marshmallow experiment was first developed in 1972 at Stanford University and showed if kids could delay gratification (i.e. eating a marshmallow) for 15 minutes with an incentive (more marshmallows) they would go on to lead more successful lives. Since then, the results have been duplicated over 30 times. This year, Protzko published a review of the literature and found that kids are actually getting better at the marshmallow test, giving hope for a new generation of successful adults with awesome impulse control. What it means for parents: The idea that “kids will be kids” informs a lot of parental decision making, but it’s actually not totally true across time and generations. Kids will be kids, but that doesn’t mean that they’ll be kids in the same way as their parents were. Researchers: Noelle Nelson, Selin Malkoc, and Baba Shiv of Ohio State University. Why it matters: Parents’ understandable impulse not to let their kids dwell on their mistakes or feel awful about their myriad failures may actually prevent kids from improving as much as they otherwise would. The Ohio State research team found that when people focused on failure, particularly how bad it felt, they were less likely to repeat the same mistakes. This lends some credence to the idea that you can frontload stress and be better of for it. What it means for parents: Feelings of failure may actually be an adaptive tool and shielding kids from those feelings might limit their potential to succeed. Don’t rub it in when kids make a mistake, but don’t minimize it either. And lead by example: Don’t hide disappointments. Researchers: Jeffrey Temple, a professor of women and child services at the University of Texas Medical Branch, and colleagues. Why it matters: There’s already ample evidence that when kids are subjected to corporal punishment their more likely to display violent and aggressive behavior later in life, but this is the first study to link childhood spanking to abusive relationships. Intimate partner violence accounts for approximately 15 percent of violent crime, but this study suggests some of that could be stopped with different disciplinary methods. What it means for parents: No matter how tired, frustrated and tested by your kid you may be, there’s never a good reason to spank your kid. It’s bad for them and it’s bad for people they’re going to interact with throughout their lives. Researchers: Chandran Paul Alexander, a professor of pediatrics at Penn State, and colleagues Why it matters: When mothers reported having more postpartum support from fathers, their babies experienced fewer symptoms of colic, a study of over 3,000 families shows. This adds to a growing body of research that shows when dads support moms during the postpartum period, babies are more set up for healthy development. What it means for parents: Always nice to your partner, but if you put in extra effort during this postpartum period, your baby’s belly will benefit. Researchers: Gail Heyman, a professor of psychology in the UC San Diego, and colleagues. Why it matters: The study of nearly 100 Chinese children demonstrated that teaching kids how to differentiate between different African American faces at age five reducing racial biases. The results suggest that when kids learn that people of a different race aren’t all the same, they’re less prone to make other generalizations about groups of people. What it means for parents: While racism may seem like a complex topic for 5-year-olds, teaching them how to tell individuals of a different race apart isn’t complicated at all and may inoculate them against later bigotry. Learning how to tell individual things with similarities apart is an important cognitive process for kids. Surrounding them with a diversity of characters as they learn may help them avoid becoming bigots. Researchers: Joseph Piven of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and colleagues. Why it matters: Brain scans of babies can help doctors predict autism with 96 percent accuracy as early as 6-months-old. Though the results are preliminary and need to be duplicated, they give hope for earlier diagnoses and interventions. What it means for parents: Part of the reason autism diagnoses are so emotional is the heartbreak of going two years believing your child is perfectly healthy. Even if earlier diagnoses doesn’t automatically translate to more effective treatments, but at the very least, it may lessen the blow and help moms and dads deal with the news in a more proactive, mentally resourced way. Researchers: Sandra E. Black, Erik Grönqvist, Björn Öckert of the IZA Institute of Labor Economics. Why it matters: The study, which only looked at Swedish boys, found that first-born children were 30 percent more likely to become managers and take on leadership positions than children born at a different spot in the birth order. The researchers concluded that this likely has something to do with firstborns receiving encouragement that makes them more likely to stay in school and do their homework. Having higher IQs also helps. What it means for parents: It’s OK to recognize that your oldest may be more predisposed to academics and leadership. You’re not playing favorites and their siblings will have different individual strengths to play to. Researchers: Rebecca Knickmeyer, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina, and colleagues. Why it matters: The research found that certain microbial communities in the poop of 1-year-olds predicted higher levels of cognitive development a year later. Interestingly, kids with more diverse microbiome performed worse on cognitive tests at age 2 than those with less diverse gut bacteria. What it means for parents: That’s not a dirty diaper in your hand. It’s an IQ test.

    "title": "This Season Of 'The Bachelor' Is 13.79 Percent Laurens",
    "text": "We’ve entered that time of year when we all tune in to “The Bachelor” to watch impossibly attractive women vie for the affections of one man. And this time around, a lot of those women seem to be named Lauren. Season 22 of ABC’s “The Bachelor” features Arie Luyendyk as the man-prize these Laurens (and others) are fighting for. If you don’t remember Luyendyk, it’s because he hasn’t been in anything related to Bachelor Nation since his debut in 2012 ― which is basically a millennium ago when you consider the sheer volume of detox teas and subscription boxes shilled by his peers in the interim. Luyendyk began Monday night with 29 women looking to win his love. Somehow, a whopping four of them, or 13.79 percent, were named Lauren. And nearly half of those 29 (including three of the Laurens!) were extremely blonde: How will the Bachelor ever choose which Blonde Ombre Woman to make his wIFE????? pic.twitter.com/JgmIFMbmIS As you might imagine, fans and hate-watchers of the show came together on social media to discuss the abundance of Laurens in Luyendyk’s dating pool: Producers: What's your type, Arie?Arie: Lauren#TheBachelor the laurens when another lauren walks into the house #TheBachelor pic.twitter.com/rTRfI52kw1 Ok, this Bachelor season has the most beautiful 25 girls ever. I don’t remember any of their names, so I’ll call them all Lauren 🤷🏼♀️ last bachelorette season: first black bachelorette! this bachelor season: literally four contestants named Lauren YOU GET A LAUREN, YOU GET A LAUREN, YOU ALL GET A LAUREN! #Bachelor pic.twitter.com/91WskwZG3f Gotta be horrible to get to #TheBachelor house and see that there's someone there with the same first name as you. \"Lauren will you accept this rose? Oh, sorry I meant Lauren 'B' 😬\" The chances of someone being personally victimized by a Lauren this season are high. #TheBachelor pic.twitter.com/AYWSpUWagX Feeling personally victimized The Bachelor didn’t cast me as the fifth Lauren “Lauren, can I borrow you for a second?” Four stand up. Sit down, be humble #firstimpression🌹 #thebachelor Well if Ari ends up with all 4 Lauren’s in the fantasy suites...at least he won’t accidentally call any of them the wrong name. #Bachelor If you are an American woman named Lauren, there is a 28% chance that you will at some point appear on #TheBachelor All these Lauren’s showing up to the bachelor house like no I’m Lauren no I’m lauren pic.twitter.com/wQUWAqoiKe The Bachelor, also called “OH MY GOD YOURE LAUREN TOO!!?” #thebachelor pic.twitter.com/SSWyLcTsSN Unfortunately ― SPOILER ― 33-year-old Louisiana native Lauren J. has already been knocked off, so as of this writing, we’re down to three Laurens. For now, we can hope that the Laurens make it to the final three, or that they band together to take down Bachelor Nation from the inside. Perhaps 2018 will be the year of the Lauren Insurrection...

    "title": "The Best Decluttering Advice We've Heard",
    "text": "1. Know Your Clutter Personality In order to maintain a clutter-free home, you need to get to the root of why things pile up in the first place. The NEAT Method founders Molly Graves and Ashley Murphy believe that most people fall into the following clutter personalities: Too Busy = Too Many Extras: You buy items you already own because you don’t have a system in place for where to store them or, when you need to find things fast, the time to search through all the possible storage spots. Constant Worrier = Must Save Everything: You’re concerned that you “might” need something in the future, so you save everything, “just in case.” Overwhelmed in Life = Overwhelmed at Home: You don’t know where to begin—so you just live with the chaos.  By identifying which category you fit into, you can avoid your weak spots. 2. Ask Yourself 3 Questions When You Go Through Your Belongings So, the first step to a clutter cure is to write down your favorite pack-rat phrases. My clients’ top three are: “I have to go through those,” “Someone could use that,” and “But I need it!” Unless you use the object in question at least once a year, such righteous exclamations are actually symptoms of dysfunction. Obeying these protests will keep you overstuffed and off balance forever.  Instead, use your powers of analysis to outwit the primitive logic of these phrases. When I ask clients what they long for, the most common responses are “peace,” “space” and “freedom.” Clutter keeps us from achieving these goals, and we spend hundreds of thousands of dollars buying larger homes. Empty space is more valuable—psychologically and physically—than almost any object.  With this in mind, walk into any room of your home and focus on 10 random objects. As you consider each, ask yourself (1) Do I truly need it?; (2) Do I truly adore it?; and, (3) Would I trade inner peace for this? The answers can help curb your pack-rat impulses, allowing you to clear out and move on. — Martha Beck, life coach and author of Finding Your Own North Star 3. Do the 10-Minute Declutter Exercise (aka the “Trash Bag Tango”) If you’re feeling overwhelmed and don’t know where to start, here’s a technique that will help you slowly eat away at it. I call it the “trash bag tango” and this is how it goes.  1. You get two trash bags, with the idea here being to clear the superficial clutter from your home. 2. In the first one you put trash; in the second bag, you put stuff that’s going to a charity or a yard sale, books that you’ve read or clothing that no longer fits you,—and anything else that you just want out of the house.  If you do this simple 10-minute routine every day for a week you’ll notice a difference. Do it every day for two weeks everyone will notice a difference. And do it every day for a month and you’ll really be on top of the clutter. — Peter Walsh, organizing guru and author of  Lose the Clutter, Lose the Weight 4. Manage Your Paper Trail If you can’t finish the mail, don’t start the mail. You can’t slice chicken for dinner and sort your bills at the same time, so when you come in the front door with a stack of mail, put it in the basket, box or whatever container you have handy for this purpose. You don’t have such a container? No wonder there are so many piles of mail around your house.  When you’re ready, take your mail basket to wherever you deal with paperwork. First, pull out the circulars and flyers and set them aside; you’ll either clip the coupons or put them in the recycling bin—later. Also set aside the catalogs. If you’re shopping for something specific, save them. (Caveat: no multiples. The new catalog replaces the old one, which gets recycled.) If you’re getting catalogs you never wanted in the first place, pull off the pages with the mailing label and put them aside; that’s an action item for later. Then separate the rest: bills, personal correspondence, time-sensitive invitations, requests for charitable donations, membership renewals, new credit card offers and so forth.  Open the bills first, because they represent a relationship that must be honored; if you want the services, you have to pay for them. All the stuffing that says, “You’ve been selected to receive these free gifts” goes into the recycling bin. All you want is the bill and the return envelope.  Put any invitations aside; later on, you’ll transfer those into your calendar and send your response.  If there’s room in your home office, have small bins in which to stack bills, invitations and the correspondence you’re keeping.  When you’re done sorting, then you can read your magazines. Or get those back pages you ripped out, call the companies that sent them and tell them what you don’t want—their catalogs. (You can also log on to Catalogchoice.org, a free service that will stop these unwanted mailings from being sent to you.) — Andrew Mellen, Professional organizer and author of Unstuff Your Life 5. Commit Fully to a Decluttering Routine Consider your washing machine: You’d never fill it with dirty clothes, let it run for 20 minutes then turn it off and let the clothes sit for two days. That would create a stinky mess! So it is with our daily routines: Doing things halfway wreaks havoc. That’s why it’s important to finish each cycle. For example, if you bring a dirty plate into the kitchen, don’t leave it on the counter—put it in the dishwasher! When you pull on sweatpants after work, don’t toss your skirt on the bed—hang it in your closet. ... Each of these tasks requires about a minute, which is minimal compared with the time you’d waste later looking for that skirt. — Peter Walsh 6. Memorize this Acronym for a Clean House Until further notice, do not go out and buy anything new and unnecessary—no retail therapy, no “great deals” and no sales! Instead, purge as much clutter as possible as quickly as you can using the F.A.S.T. method. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown on how to clean house and get organized. F: Fix a time. Schedule a time that suits everyone involved. Cleaning up is a family affair, so get everyone on board by scheduling your kick start at a time that works for everyone and make attendance mandatory! Set aside a Saturday or a Sunday, or a few hours every day, to start the process. A: Anything not used in 12 months. Face it: If you haven’t used an item in the last year, it is highly unlikely you really need it or that you are going to ever get enough use out of it to justify it cluttering up your home. Take the plunge and get rid of it! Ask yourself these questions as you encounter each piece of clutter: • Do I use this? • How long has it been since I’ve used it? • Will I use it again? • Is it worth the space it takes up in my house? Remember: The objective is to get stuff out of your home, not to move it into another room. You will be amazed by the sheer volume of unused and unneeded items in your home. Don’t spend time inventing reasons to keep these things. S: Someone else’s stuff. It’s bad enough when clutter is your own, but it is totally crazy when the clutter belongs to someone else. Your house should not contain anything that doesn’t belong to you. If it’s something you’ve borrowed, give it back. If you’ve ended a relationship or gotten a divorce, now’s the time to let your ex’s belongings go. If your kids have established their own households, it’s time for them to pick their stuff up. T: Trash. The trash can is your friend. It is your very hungry friend. Take pride in how much you throw away and make it fun. Compete with your family members to see who tosses the most or award a prize to the best purger. Remember the goal: You only want to keep the amount of stuff that makes sense for your space. — Peter Walsh 7. Part with Unnecessary Memory Clutter Your home is not a museum. Many people subscribe to the unwritten rule that you’re obligated to keep your great-aunt’s dishes, even if you don’t like them, just because she used them. But maybe your great-aunt never liked them either and also felt too guilty to let them go. Things don’t have to become yours simply because they belonged to a relative. You’re not living her life, and you’re not a bad person for giving inherited items away.  If the acquired stuff is worth money, you may feel bound to it financially: “It’s real silver—I can’t give it away.” Yes, you can. Donate it, document what it’s worth and take it off your taxes. Or give it to another family member who would really like it. Or sell it on eBay. And if you like something enough to keep it, consider it a replacement, not an addition—keep Grandma’s reading lamp, but donate the one you already have.  Mementos from your own life are harder to part with because when you see them, you relive the story: To you, it’s the cashmere V-neck you wore on your first date with the man who would become your husband; to anyone else, it’s just an old sweater full of holes. The key to parting with items suspended in time is not to replay that story. Leave the room, come back in and see what you’re really holding on to—a sweater that’s seen better days. Rule of thumb: If it serves no purpose, let it go. — Andrew Mellen Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

For the next six months, if you wear an item of clothing, return it to the closet with the hanger facing the correct way. If you try it on but decide not to wear it, make sure you put it back with the hanger turned backward—no cheating. Be prepared for a shock; you are going to find you own lots of clothes you have no use for. You should seriously consider getting rid of anything you don’t wear regularly. — Peter Walsh 9. Try the One-Month Cardboard Box Test Not sure what you use and what you don’t in your kitchen? Here is a tried and true way to find out. Empty the contents of your kitchen utensils drawer into a cardboard box. For one month, put a utensil back into the drawer only if you take it out of the box to use it. If it’s still in the box after four weeks—you don’t need it. Pass it on to charity. — Peter Walsh 10. Remember This Final Thought “Everyone has a place in their house for forks. If you found a random fork in the bathroom or under the couch, you’d immediately know it didn’t belong there and would return it to its drawer without another thought. Everything in your life should be this easy to put away. If an item occupies no specific location when not in use, it becomes clutter.” — Steve McClatchy, productivity consultant and author of Decide: Work Smarter, Reduce Your Stress, and Lead By Example By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "CDC To Teach The Public How To Prepare For A Nuclear Explosion",
    "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced this week ― days after President Donald Trump bragged about the size and effectiveness of his “Nuclear Button” (which doesn’t exist) ― that the agency will hold a public session on how to prepare for a nuclear explosion. The CDC said its briefing, which is scheduled for the afternoon of Jan. 16, will address “planning and preparation efforts” for such a strike. “While a nuclear detonation is unlikely, it would have devastating results and there would be limited time to take critical protection steps,” the CDC explained in its description of the event. “Despite the fear surrounding such an event, planning and preparation can lessen deaths and illness.” The agency said most people “don’t realize that sheltering in place for at least 24 hours is crucial to saving lives and reducing exposure to radiation.” Good to know. Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un have been engaged in an escalating battle of threats and taunts over their respective nuclear arsenals. A defiant Pyongyang has made major advances to its nuclear program over the past year, and has directly threatened Americans. Trump has responded by saying the U.S. would “totally destroy” the hermit kingdom, a nation of 25 million people, if provoked. In the event of an actual nuclear war, “there would be survivors for days trying to make their way out of the rubble and back home, dying of radiation poisoning,” Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear policy expert at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, previously told HuffPost.

    "title": "‘The Penumbra’ Is The Queer Audio Drama You Didn’t Know You Needed",
    "text": "Imagine every same-sex ‘ship’ , gender bend, and queer undertone in every piece of media you’ve ever consumed all of a sudden became canonical. Then imagine someone took all that queerness, wrote it into a script, and assembled a team of versatile actors, vibrant storytellers and innovative sound designers to bring that vision to life. Co-creators Sophie Kaner and Kevin Vibert were tired of imagining, so they forged their own reality in the form of The Penumbra Podcast. The bi-weekly, serialized audio drama — which is currently on hiatus – is a mix of anthological radio plays and the longform story of Juno Steel, the bisexual noir detective of Mars. Without revealing any spoilers, I can say the show follows P.I. Juno Steel’s quest to uncover the corruption in Hyperion City, where the lines between crime and law blur, the rich rule and everyone, it seems, has at least one skeleton in their closet. What starts out as the investigation of a high profile murder turns into a mystery millennia in the making, revealing a city built on corruption and a soil rich with ancient Martian secrets. As he races against time to keep his antagonizers at bay—such as the histrionic Kanagawa family of movie moguls, who built an empire out of the prison-to-primetime special pipeline, or Mayor Pilot Pereyra, the world’s greatest (and perhaps only) nonbinary supervillain and politician— Detective Steel must also outrun his own traumas, which seem to haunt him no matter how far away he travels from his childhood home in the decrepit ruins of Oldtown. But even more troubling, perhaps, than the monsters in the ground and in his head, is Juno Steel’s sudden infatuation with the cunning and mysterious Peter Nureyev― if that is his real name. Equal parts friend, foe and lover, Nureyev blurs the line between evil and good more than ever before. It’s a trend that continues throughout the series as Detective Steel tries to save the world riding on his shoulders, only for the body count to double and the conspiracies to continue. Other anthological storylines within the series include the Second Citadel, which chronicles the trials and tribulations of three monster-fighting knights; The Coyote of the Painted Plains, a Sapphic take on a traditional Western; and a series of horror shorts such as “Shaken,” which I cannot speak for as, admittedly, I have been too scared to listen to them in full. (Horror isn’t my style, but that’s okay; at The Penumbra, there’s something for everyone.) Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "The Resistance Defined 2017 And Is Showing Us The Way Forward",
    "text": "It is January 2, 2018 and I am filled with gratitude ― for all of you who have worked so hard and put yourselves on the line for what we all want. I am grateful to the Dreamers, the immigrants and the workers, to the womxn who marched and the black and brown activists across the country who stood up in the most painful of circumstances. I’m grateful for the teachers who teach out of pure love and the educators in our homes, workplaces and communities. I’m grateful to our young people who refuse to be told they are too idealistic and are constantly challenging us to evolve. I’m grateful to those who love who they want to love and demand that love be recognized, and I’m grateful to those who challenge gender identity and stretch all of us in the best of ways. I’m grateful to the business leaders who know that there is more to running a business than profit for shareholders and growth for growth’s sake, and to the innovators and creators who constantly find bits of light from dark corners waiting to be illuminated. I’m grateful to our judges and our courts who have been a ballast of sorts this past year. I’m grateful to the human rights and economic justice warriors in countries around the world who understand that ours is a global struggle for peace and justice, not an us-versus-them isolationist’s mission. I’m grateful to those who have resisted and those who have loved, to those who have cried and then gotten back on their feet because they knew there was no other choice. I’m grateful to the grandparents, the elders and the wise ones ― and to those who take care of them. I’m grateful for our First Nations people who continue to be deeply generous despite hundreds of years of trauma foisted upon them, and who still challenge us to make the connections between earth and livelihood, inspiring movements for life. I’m grateful for the oceans, rivers, streams, mountains and forests that envelop us with love, beauty and serenity, generously giving us the resources we need and showering us with new energy to breathe. I am grateful for my family, friends and all those who send constant love and support ― you are my energy and my hope. You teach me, love me even when I’m wrong, and let me ride the challenges and come out whole. I’m grateful for music, art and creativity; for books and literature; for travel and deeper understanding of the world. I’m grateful to the unsung heroes and heroines that we don’t even know about, people who are saving the world one small piece at a time. I’m grateful that human beings have the capacity for rebirth and resilience, for compassion and for vision. “We have to call people in just as we call them out, give them a place to stand in the circle of hope.\"” I want for 2018 to be filled with justice, peace and love. There is so much mean-spiritedness and hate in the world, and it is easy to get wrapped up in our anger ― at the world, at injustice and at those who hate. Anger has its place. In organizing, it is gold to tap into anger. But anger alone can never take us where we need to go if it is not at the same time transformed into determination for a different way. We have to bring forth the passion for what we truly believe in ― justice, peace and love ― and follow that course. We have to be firm and resolute about who we are and stay big-hearted and generous, even in the worst of situations. We have to call people in just as we call them out, give them a place to stand in the circle of hope. We have to recognize pain for what it is ― it is not the purview of any one group, everyone feels it and it is real. The hierarchy of oppression helps no-one and keeps us divided, but seeing our struggles as connected and giving voice to each other keeps us united. We have to remember that disagreeing with people is fine; it is dehumanizing people that is not and when that happens, we have to be ready to speak up. Compromise for compromise sake is never good, unless it is grounded in principles. Principled compromise is always good, and for that we must know what the core value is and work to get there together. We are best when we allow ourselves to touch our own and each other’s hearts in the work we do, whatever it may be. We can never be afraid to stand up for what is right, no matter what others may say. And sometimes if that means taking a lonely road, if what we are standing for is true, then perhaps moonlight or sunshine will light our way and make it less lonely. Perhaps birds will join us on that path, and slowly, others will too. Standing up for things when everyone else already is doing so is not really courageous. Real courage comes when we stand for things that aren’t popular yet, and make them so. Real courage is saying things that others may not want to hear ― perhaps that we ourselves don’t want to hear ― but doing it in a way that people CAN hear. In Emily Dickinson’s words, “Tell the truth but tell it slant.” We are best when we remember that human beings can change ― all of us! ― and that there are few people who are only good or only bad. Give us the wisdom and compassion to allow for nuance, holding two seemingly contradictory truths at once. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Log in to hide these messages. We have work to do this year. To put forward that vision of what we know is right: healthcare for all, education for all, good-paying jobs that give us all dignity of self, environmental justice, workers rights, immigration reform, criminal justice reform, civil rights, democracy reform, equal treatment for all regardless of any identification, living wages and retirement security. Really, what this is all about is investing in us, regular folks, people who wake up every day and go about their work ― whether in their homes, or offices, or forests or small towns, steel mills or coal mines, rural or urban. It’s about leveling the playing field and giving people the respect they deserve to know that they have a fair shot, that they’ll be able to put food on the table, have a roof over their heads, send their kids to get a good education and retire with some security. That they won’t be one health care crisis away from bankruptcy, and that they will know that if their car breaks down, they can fix it instead of losing their job because they couldn’t get to work. It’s about respecting who we each are and what we bring. It’s about confronting racism and sexism and the refusals to recognize everyone’s value that stops the playing fields from being level. It’s about recognizing the reality of the black mothers and fathers who worry that their sons and daughters may not come home. It’s about every member of the trans community being able to live freely without fear of prejudice and violence. It’s about finding real economic solutions for white rural families who feel forgotten and left behind. It’s about dignity and respect and love ― even when someone is different from what we know. That’s some of what we’re fighting for, that’s our proposition agenda that we need to put front and center even as we launch our resistance. So, this year, I wish for all of us that deep sense of knowing at this consequential time in our history that we are doing everything we can to protect our democracy, to make it real for people here and around the world, to stand for peace and shun war, to place our trust and faith in the many and not the few, and to love as much as we possibly can. To resistance, to opposition and to proposition...to believing that another world IS possible and we are the ones to make it so. Happy New Year!

    "title": "The Top 10 Workout Songs For January 2018",
    "text": "Photo by Emma Simpson With a new year upon us, there’s an opportunity to take stock of what’s going on in workout music right now. To that end, we’ll be taking a first glance at 2018 to see what’s changed and what’s the same. Along the way, we’ll recap the month’s biggest tunes—to illustrate these trends at work and top of your playlist at once. In keeping with developments over the last few years, this year’s inaugural picks err on the slow side—with more than half the list clocking in below 110 beats per minute (BPM). As with most musical developments, this shift is cyclical. But, for the time being, hitmakers and listeners alike continue to favor slower tracks—even in a workout. Beyond that, club culture also remains a key influence in gym tracks—with dance remixes from Kelly Clarkson, Kesha, and Maroon 5 each making the cut this month. Lastly, the biggest change from this time last year is the presence of two hits with Spanish titles—“Mi Gente” and “Echame La Culpa”—owing largely to the breakout success of summer smash “Despacito.” In short, the top of the year foreshadows a year of slower tracks, club beats, and Spanish lyrics. Which of those trends will endure is anyone’s guess. In a month, we’ll check back. And, in the interim, here’s the full list—according to the votes logged on workout music site Run Hundred: Kelly Clarkson - “Love So Soft (Ryan Riback Remix)” - 126 BPM Taylor Swift - “Call It What You Want” - 82 BPM Kesha - “Praying (Frank Walker Remix)” - 81 BPM J Balvin, Willy Williams & Beyonce - “Mi Gente” - 105 BPM Nick Jonas - “Watch Me” - 126 BPM Maroon 5 & SZA - “What Lovers Do (A-Trak Remix)” - 110 BPM Dua Lipa - “New Rules” - 117 BPM Beck - “Up All Night” - 110 BPM Luis Fonsi & Demi Lovato - “Echame La Culpa” - 96 BPM Selena Gomez & Marshmello - “Wolves” - 125 BPM Check out this month’s top 10 workout songs on Run Hundred.

    "title": "These LGBTQ People Are Proving There’s A Silver Lining in This Cloudy Political Climate",
    "text": "RaiseAChild family, Richard & Jason Avila-Winburn and son. In this first Huff Post Queer Voices “Let Love Define Family®” series installment of the new year, RaiseAChild Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Rich Valenza, shares the promise he is discovering among a growing community fueled by altruistic intentions. Challenged by nearly 12 months of constant twitter and alternative facts, it is understandable if some of us have reacted by unplugging or growing a bit desensitized. However, somewhere between the optimists and pessimists, RaiseAChild has discovered a new group of people who won’t settle for quiet resistance or hibernation. Recently, I had the honor to meet a large number of these outstanding folks who spoke of very similar motivations. “In a time when we are overwhelmed by a world that feels completely abnormal and out of control,” said the more vocal half of a lesbian couple attending the mid-November RaiseAChild Info Event in San Diego, CA. “My wife and I’ve decided there is good we can accomplish. We can help children in foster care. Maybe it is just one kid. Maybe it will be more. But, especially now, we cannot sit back when there is an opportunity for us to contribute some good in this world.” The sentiment was repeated at an early-December RaiseAChild event in Pasadena, CA. Record attendance at this December 2, 2017 RaiseAChild Info Event in Pasadena, CA. “Since I was a kid, I’ve dreamed of being a dad,” admitted a gay man who arrived at the event on his own. “I’ve kept this dream on the back burner thinking that I first needed to be partnered. But now, in my late 40’s and in this political climate, I feel certain that this is the right time for me to work with RaiseAChild to welcome a foster child and build my family.” The Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA School of Law, published a study over a decade ago estimating that two million gay, lesbian and bisexual people were interested in adopting. Their study went on to say that 50% of gay men and 41% of lesbians want to be parents. I believe these numbers must be increasing. Since the 2015 Supreme Court ruling making same-sex marriage a nationwide right, I’m hearing more conversations in which LGBTQ people are just beginning to imagine the possibility of parenthood for themselves. Last year, the number of inquiries RaiseAChild received tripled compared to any previous year in our history. Equally significant was the 140% rise in attendance to our 2017 schedule of RaiseAChild Info Events across Southern California. Our nation’s opioid epidemic is having devastating effects on families and children. Since founding RaiseAChild, I have dreamed of encouraging LGBTQ people to rise up to show the strength and compassion within our community by being the answer to our nation’s growing crisis in the foster system. Now, six years later, with an estimated count of 425,000 in our nation’s child welfare system, and a growing number of LGBTQ people showing interest in building families, I am seeing the clearest signs yet that this dream could be attainable.

    "title": "Thinking Clearly About Sexual Harassment",
    "text": "A torrent of sexual harassment revelations has launched a long-overdue discussion of a perennial social plague afflicting countless women, girls, and boys. (Adult men are occasionally victimized as well). We have many courageous women and the #MeToo movement to thank for bringing this issue out of the shadows and into the open where it is being discussed among friends, by policymakers, at workplaces, and in our families and other social milieu. The quality of this long-deferred public debate will be depends on at least three things: (1) how accurately we identify the causes of sexual harassment; (2) how carefully we distinguish among the distinct behaviors now lumped under this portmanteau phrase; and (3) how wisely we design measures to assess, punish, and prevent those behaviors. Causes. Sexual harassment has several causes. The first is lust, sheer animal attractions between men and women. Lust is inevitable (for psycho-biochemical reasons), pleasurable (if indulged in mutually desired and gratifying ways), and necessary (to perpetuate our species). But our grotesquely sexualized popular culture dangerously stokes and magnifies this lust. Second, a pervasive power imbalance converts this lust into opportunities for exploitative, almost onanistic self-gratification by aggressive, narcissistic men against more vulnerable women. Third, harassment can reflect genuine misunderstandings, mixed signals, interpersonal clumsiness, and loss of ordinary self-control due to excessive drinking, substance abuse, and other factors. These causes cannot be eliminated but can be ameliorated ― as crime, poverty, and teenage pregnancy have been. Drawing distinctions. Much public discussion of sexual harassment suggests that it is all of a piece and deserves undifferentiated condemnation and punishment. But it isn’t this simple. Many women affirm what should be obvious: the term is being applied to a variety of behaviors and situations whose moral offense and harmful effects are quite different. Yet New York Times columnist Brett Stephens and actor Matt Damon have been pilloried for making the same point. The law already does some of this line-drawing. Centuries of legislative and judicial decisions have elaborated important defining concepts like force, battery, consent, autonomy, and reasonable fear for one’s bodily or psychic integrity. Sexual assault, so defined, is both a crime subject to penal sanctions, and a tort subject to monetary sanctions. These laws can deter and punish harassment but much of it is neither criminal nor tortious and so goes unremedied. More line-drawing is essential. Kathleen Kelley Reardon, a management professor and blogger, recently offered guidance, describing a “spectrum of sexual misconduct at work” ranging from the inoffensive to the “egregious.” She deems “common off the cuff compliments on such things as hair style and dress” to be non-offensive. But this category should also include sarcasm, digs, and words that hurt people’s feelings. In our free-wheeling society, in which we interact with people whom we know only superficially, our exchanges need breathing space and spontaneity. We should endeavor not to offend, of course, but in the course of lively exchanges, our comments and intentions can easily be misunderstood and resented. The offended person should candidly tell the speaker that she objects, and why. Although this might deepen the resentment, an exchange that exhumes the real individuals buried beneath the superficial chit-chat might instead yield more rewarding interactions. Context matters. Reardon next lists “awkward/mildly offensive” comments exemplified by “comments on gender differences.” But here too, she condemns too broadly. While legal and social equality for women and sexual minorities advances, many gender differences persist, deeply rooted in biology and culture. These differences enrich our lives and our experiences of one another. We should not be discouraged from discussing them, even if some comments are unwelcome to those convinced that differences are “merely” constructs of a deeply unequal society. Jokes about gender differences may be crude or unfunny but even annoying jokes can contain some insight about our relationships – for example, that men and women often do see things differently. If one is offended, one should inform the speaker that it’s not funny or even walk out. More offensive, according to Reardon, are acts like “holding a woman’s arm while talking,” “uninvited hugs,” “patronizing/dismissive/exclusionary behavior toward women,” and “implying or stating that women are distracted by family.” Even here, reasonable people may disagree. The meaning of such acts largely depends, again, on their context, which is often ambiguous. How is one to know whether a friendly hug of a woman whom one has met before is “invited” or not? Inquiring would destroy the gesture’s warmth and spontaneity. Remaining aloof is safer but such common interactions are simply too variable to be regulated unless they are genuinely fearful or oppressive, which they seldom are. Does Reardon’s norm against “exclusionary behavior” condemn social gatherings in which the men and women commonly talk among their gender peers, presumably out of choice? And why is it offensive to suggest that a woman is distracted by her family when research clearly shows that she does in fact end up spending much more time than her husband in managing their children? Again, Reardon’s admirable wish to avoid demeaning or sidetracking women gives too little weight to context. Thus we should view such a comment by a job interviewer (offensive and possibly illegal) differently than one by a neighbor or garrulous massage therapist. Even more serious offenses, for Reardon, are comments that “devalue” women – denigrating them as a group or making demeaning reference to their physical attributes. Such comments may be crude, thoughtless, and insulting, but the remedy for the offended should be to refute and censure the comment rather than trying to silence the commenter by formally sanctioning his unwanted speech. A worrisome analogy occurs on too many campuses where opponents of controversial ideas try to censor them by insisting that they are pained by being exposed to them. Our line-drawing, then, should discourage offensiveness while not encouraging hyper-sensitivity and undue umbrage. Some of Reardon’s examples of “evident sexual misconduct” ― grabbing, rude patting, and unwelcome holding or kissing of a woman; describing her as a “slut” or “frigid;” and accusing her of using her gender to advance her career ― are not merely objectionable; they could well constitute a tortious assault, battery, or defamation. But her catalog of misconduct goes further. It condemns looking a woman up and down “in a sexually suggestive manner.” Depending on what that phrase means, it might condemn admiring glances that – if they go no farther ― do no real harm. She would also punish a man who ignores a woman’s expressed disinterest in a relationship and continues to “hassle” her. Depending on what “hassle” means in a specific context, this may either protect the woman or condemn a kind of male persistence that has yielded many happy relationships. Reardon’s more “egregious sexual misconduct” examples are already criminal, tortious, or both – and rightly so. But the real challenge concerns whether and how we should regulate aggressive but non-violent conduct and less egregious behavior that still causes fear and offense. Here, line-drawing is much more challenging. People interact in infinitely varied ways and assess signals and meanings very differently. Again, context and intent matter. Most social norms are opaque and informally enforced. Safety and security are at stake, but so are other values. In this realm, then, adopting hard-and-fast rules is less desirable than clarifying social expectations about how we should behave in various situations, how we should communicate our desires, and how individuals and institutions should respond when those norms are allegedly violated. Procedures. Consider how educational institutions have handled sexual harassment claims. We see that even benign, well-resourced schools are caught in a cultural crossfire. Their efforts to handle these disputes with campus-specific procedures and standards founder on the high stakes. Accusers demand protection and justice. The accused, facing the prospect of expulsion and criminal prosecution, demand rigorous procedural safeguards. Onlookers - other students, alumni, civil rights officials, ideologues of left and right, and the media ― have their own fish to fry and are ready to pounce on these disputes however they are resolved. No one seems satisfied by the schools’ makeshift arrangements. Law enforcement agencies, for all their limitations, are far better equipped to handle these difficult disputes. Schools, workplaces, and other institutions should not adjudicate sexual harassment claims but should instead limit their role to determining whether the accuser has alleged facts that, if true, could constitute legally actionable harassment. If so, the institution should advise the accuser to consider taking her case to the police and obtaining a lawyer. It should release as little identifying information as possible until the matter is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Judicial rulings, official pressures, and public demands have already strengthened institutions’ existing incentives to prevent harassment, but more prevention efforts can surely be undertaken. Importantly, they can punish the heavy drinking and drug use that fuel much harassment and can denounce the hook-up culture. Law enforcement agencies should look to the best practices of other such agencies, which include allocating more resources to informal counseling of fearful accusers and improving fact-finding processes. Harms to the career, dignitary, and security interests of harassment victims are hard to quantify or even identify in individual cases. Remedies for victims seem arbitrary. Most likely receive nothing, not even an apology. Accusers may suffer informal blacklisting. Yet some others get payoffs that seem far higher than the actual harm they could have suffered, as when Bill O’Reilly paid Lis Wiehl $32 million. We should clarify what we mean by non-criminal sexual harassment, which procedures are fair and effective, and then ensure that both harassers and victims get what they deserve.

    "title": "This Body Of Mine: A Lifetime Of Complicated Body Image",
    "text": "Closed Off I passed the full-length mirror about a dozen times that morning. I was rearranging furniture, attempting to maximize on the non-existent space in my bedroom, wondering at each five-minute mark why I even bother to try. I finally stopped to take a swig from my trusty reusable water bottle, and found myself legitimately wide-eyed to catch my own reflection in the mirror on the adjacent wall. You can probably tell that I may not have a great relationship with reflective surfaces, and you are right, I don’t. Call it what you will: a latent case of low self-esteem, or a deeply-rooted history of feeling like my body was not in my own control. Heck, it is most likely a combination of the two. Despite this, I found myself move closer to it, filling the space as I got closer, and swallowing a dozen cringes a second. I cringe because, despite my years of studying psychology, gender studies, and slowly implementing new strategies to better appreciate my own existence, I am still haunted by my long history of disempowerment about my appearance. From random men ogling my newly ‘developing’ body as a preteen, to constantly fielding judgements, scoffs, and ridicule about my weight and ‘broad-ness’, I learned over time that my body, my whole existence for that matter, was not in my control. Everyone else seemed to have an authoritative role over it, except for me. For too many years, I didn’t like myself. I viewed my body as a heavy armor that I was forced to carry around with me: punishment for some unknown wrong deed from a past life that I would have to pay for throughout this current one. From my toes to the ends of my hair, I could list hundreds of faults I’ve found since the fifth-grade, when I unfortunately became aware of how a body can affect the way that people in the world navigate your existence. From my status as the resident “fatty” to my early-onset of puberty in particular places, I became quickly hyper-sensitive about what this body would mean for my life. I stood there in the mirror for what felt like a full hour, but was probably only ten minutes. I couldn’t really tell the difference, because my mind found itself wandering more than usual to events as early as my pre-teen years to recent run-ins with what I have grown to call the “Body Police”. 12-Years Old “What a bumpah big, eeh!” He leered at me, as I willed my legs to move at the speed of light to get home after running an errand in my community. He was a grown man, and that made my eleven-year old skin crawl to the highest intensity, the tears clouding my eyes. I spent at least the next four years of my pre-teen/early-adolescent life perfecting what I now call the ‘Arrow Walk’ - walk as straight as I possibly could, without swinging of young hips or slightly-protruding derrière. Needless to say, it required a lot of energy and willpower, and despite teasing from my own family members about my weird new gait, it was the only protection that I felt I could give myself against being “seen”. I can’t say that it worked, as I still encountered countless leering eyes and cat-calls that spelled nothing but danger to me as a young Jamaican girl with full hips, butt, and breasts that made themselves known quite early on. 18 Years Old I saw them as soon as I rounded the corner. I haven’t been back to my island home in about two years, and after just finishing my first year of university, I was ecstatic to be back, and even more excited to spend time with my loved ones who were waiting for me outside of the Arrivals hall at the airport. I went straight in for a hug, and was met with, “Bwoy, what a way you still fat. You couldn’t lose some of the weight while you were away? All you seem to do is eat, eat, eat!” I kept a strained smile on my face, as my waist was grabbed, squeezed, and jiggled, in full view of the rest of patrons also awaiting arriving passengers, my face growing warmer by the second. I gave a small chuckle, and shrugged it off. I learned to pretend to not be bothered by such comments at an early age. It was really only pretend. This body of mine is commented on because it was being seen, and I shrank myself just a tad bit more, hoping that if I made myself small enough in my mind, the unsolicited opinions would stop coming. ________ This fear of being seen has changed shape many times over the past decade, but still comes down to one premise: my body is a source of unwanted attention that, for as long as I can recall, made me feel uncomfortable, unsafe, and without control of my own. Even while in a long-term relationship throughout college, I felt that my not-so-svelte physique was a burden on my partner; a constant source of dispute. This particular experience led me to disordered eating habits, and a continued discomfort with being seen eating, or even expressing the most natural state of hunger.

Yeah, it’s no big surprise that couples have some budget regrets. But Zola’s Wedding Planning Survey found that one-third of recently married folks actually wish they spent more money on this one thing: a videographer. Yep, 35 percent of couples admit that if they could do one thing over again, they’d go back and hire someone to film their wedding day. But if you heed the wisdom of the crowd, make sure you pick a choice videographer — 25 percent of people who did hire videographers still wish they spent more money on the service. That’s something your rarely hear. So there you have it: A picture’s worth a thousand words, but a smartly edited video is worth a much bigger slice of your wedding budget.

    "text": "The Golden Globes sure missed a golden opportunity when they failed to nominate actress Tiffany Haddish this year — because the woman can give one hell of an acceptance speech. On Wednesday night the stand-up comic won Best Supporting Actress at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards for her breakout role in “Girls Trip.” The honor prompted the 38-year-old to deliver almost 18 minutes of pure hilarity (which included a lot of unabashed flirting with host, Michael B. Jordan) captured by BuzzFeed film critic Alison Willmore, who posted the video to Facebook. “First, I want to thank God, because without God, my mama and daddy wouldn’t have put their two uglies together and they wouldn’t have made me,” she told the audience, martini in hand. “That was all God right there. He put two crazy people together to make one awesome crazy person.” Later in her speech, she thanked the critics, and offered them a little advice. “I’m learning a lot about you guys. The only critics I ever known before this was Siskel and Ebert, and then when they passed, I was like, ‘Oh well.’ I ain’t going to lie to you: All my stuff comes from TV. Who’s the new movie critic TV show, is there one? Get it together, y’all.” Haddish also got emotional and thanked every person who has said anything about her, positive or negative. “I appreciate you. I’m glad you see me. Because it’s been so many years nobody saw me,” she said. “You know when you’re a little kid going through the system, you wonder, ‘Does anyone even know I’m alive?’ And to be able to be this example to youth. There are so many people like me that you guys have no clue about.

    "text": "There’s one accessory nearly everyone will be wearing this Sunday night at the Golden Globes. Nominees and presenters will be among those wearing a small black and white pin that reads “Time’s Up” as part of the recent initiative to fight sexual harassment and inequality. According to The Hollywood Reporter, actress and co-founder of the Time’s Up initiative Reese Witherspoon tapped costume designer and stylist Arianne Phillips to create the pin for the awards show. Phillips told The Hollywood Reporter that the idea for the pins happened at an initial brainstorm meeting about the Time’s Up initiative in December with actresses, producers and others in the industry. “Reese asked me to come to the actors’ group, and told me they were going to be wearing black and would I consider creating a pin for the nominees and male presenters,” Phillips told The Hollywood Reporter. “We were up against the holidays, but I said I could do it.” A post shared by Booth (@boothmoore) on Jan 4, 2018 at 2:34pm PST Phillips, along with other Hollywood stylists including Los Angeles jewelry designer Michael Schmidt, designed the Time’s Up logo and created 500 pins in just two weeks. “I met so many great women, and it was such an honor to be called to action,” Phillips added. The Time’s Up initiative was announced on New Year’s Day and consists of more than 300 women in television, film and theater. The project, inspired by the recent #MeToo movement, hopes to combat sexual misconduct in all workplaces by creating a legal defense fund to help less-privileged women come forward with their stories. Witherspoon will walk the red carpet on Sunday with fellow Time’s Up actress Eva Longoria in support of the movement, E! News reported Thursday.

Franken, who was first elected to the Senate in 2008, submitted his letter of resignation to Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton (D) on Tuesday. The former “Saturday Night Live” star said it was “a privilege and an honor” to serve as a senator for Minnesota. “I am grateful to Minnesotans for giving me a chance to serve our state and our nation, and I am proud to have worked on their behalf,” Franken wrote. After Franken announced his decision to resign in December, Dayton said he planned to appoint Smith to fill the seat. Michelle Fischbach, a Republican who currently serves as president of the Minnesota Senate, is slated to replace Smith as lieutenant governor, as dictated by the state’s constitution. “Tina Smith is a person of the highest integrity and ability,” Dayton said in a statement. “There is no one I trust more to assume the responsibilities of this important office. I know that she will be a superb senator, representing the best interests of our state and our citizens.” Along with Smith, Democrat Doug Jones was sworn in Wednesday as Alabama’s new U.S. senator. Jones, 63, won a special election in December against Republican Roy Moore, who was battered by allegations he preyed upon teenage girls decades ago. Republican Jeff Sessions vacated the seat in early 2017 to become President Donald Trump’s attorney general. The Senate’s partisan breakdown now stands at 51 Republicans, 47 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. Smith, 59, has indicated she will seek to hold onto her seat in a November special election. Franken’s term would have expired in January 2021, and the special election will allow Minnesota voters to choose a permanent replacement for the remainder of the term. “Though I never anticipated this moment, I am resolved to do everything I can to move Minnesota forward,” Smith said in a statement in December. “I will be a fierce advocate in the United States Senate for economic opportunity and fairness for all Minnesotans.” With Smith’s swearing-in, Minnesota joins New Hampshire, Washington and California as the only U.S. states represented by two female senators. The state’s other senator, Democrat Amy Klobuchar, has said she plans to run for re-election this year. If Smith emerges as the Democratic nominee in November’s special election, her Republican opponent could be Rep. Michele Bachmann, who has said she is considering a Senate run. Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty also has been mentioned as a possible GOP candidate. In Alabama, Jones’ seat will be up for election in 2020.

    "title": "ESPN Thinks This Could Be The End For Bill Belichick And The Patriots",
    "text": "In an ironic twist, Tom Brady’s zealous longevity regimen ― and the acolyte who sells it ― could be what ultimately does him in. That’s if you believe a riveting new account from ESPN, which pulls the curtain back on a New England Patriots organization said to be quietly grappling with infighting and power struggles between its most visible, and most valuable, members. Here’s the short version: Tom Brady is deeply involved with Alex Guerrero, a personal health trainer known for his unconventional (and outright questionable) advice. A New York Times profile in 2015 referred to Guerrero as Brady’s “spiritual guide, counselor, pal, nutrition adviser, trainer, massage therapist and family member.” Boston Magazine has a slightly different take, portraying him as a modern-day snake oil salesman who’d had repeated troubles with regulators until he found the ultimate sucker in Tom Brady, who’s now his business partner. That relationship has eroded the power of head coach Bill Belichick, so much so that earlier this year Patriots owner Robert Kraft ordered Belichick to trade away Jimmy Garapollo, the franchise’s quarterback of the future, in a bid to pacify Brady. It’s also caused a schism in the locker room, with players forced to choose between appeasing Brady by seeking treatment at Guerrero’s “TB12 Sports Therapy Center,” or sticking with team doctors ― a de facto endorsement of Belichick. Now the Patriots are left with a 40-year-old, increasingly temperamental quarterback and no clear plan for succession at the position. Meanwhile, Belichick, who’d groomed Garapollo and thought highly enough of him to have (potentially) soon installed him as the team starter, is more isolated and frustrated than ever. ESPN speculates that could be enough to convince Belichick to seek greener pastures elsewhere, especially as the Patriots’ offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator will likely leave the team during the offseason this year and become head coaches for other teams. The Patriots denied the reports in a statement Friday, dismissing them as “theories that are unsubstantiated, highly exaggerated or flat out inaccurate.” Joint statement from Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, Head Coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady: pic.twitter.com/i555gWZIi6 But let’s get back to Guerrero for a minute, the man whose clinic one Patriots staffer told ESPN felt “like a cult.” The trainer and close associate of Brady’s used to refer to himself as “Dr. Guerrero” ― until the Federal Trade Commission came after him in 2004 for a supplement he peddled on a late-night infomercial, claiming it cured 96 percent of a group of 200 terminally ill cancer patients. And could do the same for AIDS, Parkinson’s, Multiple Sclerosis, arthritis and more! Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

The feds shut down his supplement operation, noting there was no evidence they worked, and that his degree ― a masters from a school for traditional Chinese medicine that’s since shuttered ― doesn’t grant him the title of “doctor.” By 2011, Guerrero had nevertheless become a key player behind the scenes at the Patriots, where he came up with numerous other supplements of dubious merit. One, called NeuroSafe, was marketed to football players as a “seatbelt for your brain” that would help protect from “sports-related brain injury.” (The FTC investigated NeuroSafe but decided not to penalize Guerrero so long as he refunded everyone who’d bought the supplement.) Backed up by Brady, Guerrero apparently gained more and more access inside the organization until Belichick cut him out of meetings in 2014, ESPN reports, ultimately banning him from the building entirely by 2016.

    "title": "This Image Shows The Tragedy Of Mass Consumption – But Change Is Possible",
    "text": "I made this photograph on Midway Island a little over eight years ago. Since then not much has changed for the birds, but they taught me something that has shifted me internally forever. On this tiny atoll an astonishing tragedy is taking place: tens of thousands of baby albatrosses lie dead on the ground, their stomachs filled with plastic. Their parents mistake floating trash for food as they forage over the vast polluted Pacific Ocean. Carrying shards of plastic back to the island inside their bellies, the adult birds unknowingly feed lethal quantities of it to their chicks. Midway’s remoteness makes this phenomenon particularly iconic: The island lies near the center of the Pacific, surrounded by 60 million square miles of open sea in every direction. It is the furthest you can get from a continent anywhere on Earth. For me, kneeling over these scenes is like looking into a macabre mirror. Midway reflects back to us one appallingly emblematic consequence of the collective trance of our culture of mass consumption. Bloated with emptiness and dying of excess, we humans, like the albatross, find ourselves losing the ability to discern what is nourishing from what is toxic – to our bodies and our spirits, our politics and our culture. In my eight trips to Midway I lost count of how many birds I witnessed choking on cigarette lighters, toothbrushes, bottle caps, and other plastic junk. I held the softness of their still-warm feathered bodies in my arms as feelings of sadness, rage, and shame washed over me in waves. And in that experience I received a transformational message: the true nature of grief revealed itself. I had always thought of grief as a bad feeling, like pain, not to be embraced but to be minimized and gotten over. Grief seemed to be part of the darkness, a bad drug to be avoided. I had held it off for my whole life, fearing it like a slippery slope that could lead to depression and anxiety, and overwhelm. The albatross showed me that grief is not the same as sadness or despair; grief is the same as love. It is a felt experience of love, for something we are losing or have lost. We feel grief for the suffering of other beings because we love them. In grief the bottom drops out and we fall, not into an abyss of hopelessness, but into a clear blue sea, the infinite ocean of love that we each contain. Grief is a portal to the deepest part of ourselves, where our wisdom and compassion reside. Grief and love can be seen as inseparable twins. When we hold grief at a distance, our love becomes inaccessible; and when we embrace grief, we reconnect with the essential aspect of our being that has gone missing lately. I believe that if we could summon the courage to grieve together, on a collective scale, for all that is being lost in our world, then our love would return and, along with it, our generosity, joy, and peace. And if we were to step through that door together, there is no knowing how many of the world’s problems we could solve, and fast. In this way the message of these birds is not only one of horror and tragedy, but also of beauty and renewal. The legendary albatross guides us to take a moment and grieve together, not as an exercise in shame or pain or punishment, but because in this act of surrender a doorway opens that leads home. Artist/photographer Chris Jordan is director, editor, and writer of ALBATROSS, a film made from footage he and his team filmed on Midway Island over several years. ALBATROSS will be released as a public artwork this spring. More info: www.albatrossthefilm.com Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "50 Tons Of Trash Expected After Times Square New Year's Eve Bash",
    "text": "New Year’s Eve in Times Square is always one heck of a party in New York City — but it also requires a cleanup effort of enormous proportions. Almost 1 million revelers, braving freezing temperatures, packed into Times Square on Sunday to ring in 2018. At midnight, the crowd squealed with delight as the glittery crystal ball dropped and confetti — about 3,000 pounds of it — rained down. Partygoers later gushed about the “beautiful” experience as they made their way out of midtown Manhattan. But the clearing crowds revealed something not so beautiful: the night’s staggering detritus, including streamers and party hats, cigarette butts, food containers and other trash littering the ground. The city’s Department of Sanitation told AM New York last week that they expected to clear more than 50 tons of trash at Times Square post-New Year’s Eve ― about the same amount generated at last year’s bash. The department said a total of 294 sanitation workers would be on duty to clean up in the aftermath of the party, armed with 30 mechanical brooms, 58 backpack blowers, 44 collection trucks and 58 old-fashioned hand brooms. Shortly after the ball drops in Times Square, 294 NYC Dept. of Sanitation employees will start working to clean tons of confetti and other New Year's debris left behind. In just a few hours, the Crossroads of the World will be clean!We wish everyone a happy and healthy 2018! pic.twitter.com/Tqwa2wLnuH According to Paul Visconti, who oversees cleaning operations for the sanitation department, the cleanup effort would likely take about 12 to 16 hours to complete. “It’s something short of a miracle what we get accomplished,” he told AM New York. “It’s rewarding to see 50 tons of debris disappear,” Visconti added. “It’s not easy, but we make it look easy.” What gets left behind after the #BallDrop? Shout out to the sanitation teams who help keep #TimesSquare clean! pic.twitter.com/lFArRMahdR Want to know what it takes to clean up Times Square after the ball drops? Take a look! https://t.co/tlCnSMvtWv Social media users took to Twitter late Sunday and early Monday to express their gratitude and awe for the sanitation workers tasked with cleaning up the huge mess at Times Square. One user called the workers “the real MVPs” of the night. GOD BLESS the people that have to clean up Times Square when the show's over. You the real MVPs!! 👏👏👏 Shout out to all the clean up crew members down in Times Square cleaning up that confetti mess. Every year while watching the ball drop on TV, I always end up feeling bad for those who have to clean up all that confetti in Times Square. pic.twitter.com/M9M7mgBOMB Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Trump Administration Should Freeze Rather Than Inflame Korean Tensions",
    "text": "War appears to be a greater possibility in the Korean peninsula today than at any recent time. President Donald Trump insists he will not allow North Korea to acquire the capability to target the U.S. homeland. Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un refuses to abandon a project he apparently believes to be necessary to guarantee his regime’s survival. The problem of intention is exacerbated by the threat of mistake and misjudgment. Two impulsive blustery leaders of uncertain temperament are facing off. With threats flying, military forces moving, and WMDs testing, much could go wrong. Yet President Trump appears to be doubling down on his strategy of maximum military pressure. He continues to threaten war and send U.S. carrier groups and bombers to Northeast Asia to demonstrate Washington’s resolve. American and South Korean forces recently conducted military maneuvers. The allies insisted that “Vigilant Act 18” was merely a standard, annual exercise. But it came at an unusually sensitive time. The administration apparently presumes that Pyongyang is not aware of American military power. But it is. The U.S. armed services are the strongest argument for the North to develop nuclear weapons and ICBMs. At the end of the Korean War there was little left in North Korea to bomb. When I first visited the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea 25 years ago officials commented that they had to completely rebuild Pyongyang. America’s capacity to destroy is much greater today. Then, at least, China came to the DPRK’s rescue. But today the North could not count on similar aid. Beijing might act to preempt an American advance to the Yalu. Not, however, intervene to preserve the Kim dynasty, especially if the latter bore at least some responsibility for starting the war. Russia would be even less inclined to act. Nor does Pyongyang only fear conflict arising from the peninsula itself. Since the end of the Cold War the U.S. has routinely targeted regimes it dislikes: Panama, Somalia, Haiti, Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq (twice), Syria, and Libya. The latter is particularly striking: Moammar Ghadaffy made a deal with the U.S. and Europe to abandon his nuclear and missile programs, only to be ousted when the allies found it to be convenient. For North Korea the assurances of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who doesn’t even speak for this president, let alone a future one, are of little value. So the DPRK is aware that America has substantial military power and is willing to use it. The chief danger now may be that Pyongyang will believe the Trump administration is preparing to act when it is not. When I again visited North Korea in June, officials were particularly concerned about Washington’s intentions. Other presidents have affirmed their willingness to take military action. President Trump has made the threat repeatedly. He has ramped up the rhetoric, talking of delivering “fire and fury,” and repeatedly sent U.S. military forces, which he once referred to as the “armada,” to threaten the North. His officials, as well as militaristic members of Congress, such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, have spoken of the almost inevitability of war unless the DPRK surrenders to Washington’s demands. It is difficult to know what Pyongyang — or America’s allies, for that matter — make of the administration’s plans. But to the extent to which North Korean officials take the president’s rhetoric and actions seriously, they are likely to perceive a heightened threat of war. And that is likely to make the DPRK trigger-happy. While U.S. officials are talking about a preventive war, which differs from preemption in the lack of any imminent threat, the North is likely to consider the need for actual preemption. North Korea’s problem is that the U.S. and South Korea possess vastly superior conventional capabilities. And allowing America to take the initiative, and especially to build up beforehand, would be suicidal. Of Saddam Hussein’s many mistakes, perhaps the greatest was to stand idle as the United States deployed its forces in preparation for war. He had no good options, but allowing Washington to prepare for war at its leisure guaranteed his destruction. The DPRK faces the same problem. It has a quantitative edge, but its equipment is aged and the allies would rule the skies. Allow America to attack first, and it will quickly erode the North’s conventional capabilities. The ensuing conflict would still be costly, but ensure a more rapid defeat of the North Korean forces. So Pyongyang may believe it must use it or lose it. Wait for America to mobilize, reinforce its ground forces, and conduct massive bombing operations? Or strike, to the extent it is able to—we don’t know the exact capabilities of the DPRK’s nuclear arsenal—first. That is, if the Kim regime believed Washington was preparing for war, one could imagine missile strikes on Pusan, Okinawa, Guam, and other American bases in the region, to impede any military build-up. Also likely would be a concentrated artillery and missile attack on Seoul, perhaps followed by rolling the tanks in an attempt to seize the Republic of Korea’s capital, which could be used to negotiate the Kim dynasty’s survival. The latter step might be backed by the threat to hit Tokyo. Exactly how a conflict would play out is impossible to predict. But most assessments and wargames predict massive destruction and casualties. The pessimistic counts are in the millions. After having spent 64 years attempting to prevent a Second Korean War, it would be madness for Washington to trigger another, potentially more catastrophic conflict, even inadvertently. While squaring the circle between the stated objectives of the U.S. and North Korean governments won’t be easy, the most important immediate objective should be to halt the seeming slide toward war. Accelerating missile and nuclear tests by the North and threats by Washington have ramped up tensions, and made mistake or misjudgment more likely. The Trump administration continues to insist that it won’t talk until the North agrees to denuclearize, that is, yield on the very issue to be negotiated. Pyongyang seems to believe that it faces a dangerous transition period, during which Washington might strike on the theory that the war would be “over there,” in Sen. Graham’s approving words. If so, the DPRK understandably wants to acquire a full deterrent as quickly as possible. The more the Trump administration flexes its military muscles to demonstrate its seriousness, the more the North might believe that the moment has come. In which case it might believe it must act preemptively. No doubt, annual exercises improve U.S.-South Korean military cooperation. But the Republic of Korea’s continuing reliance on America is outdated. The ROK possesses upwards of 45 times the GDP, twice the population, and a vast technological edge over the North. Seoul relies on the U.S. for conventional support only because America allows it to do so. If more troops are needed, the ROK should provide them. South Korea’s dependence should be declining, especially as Washington faces ever greater budgetary challenges. (The most important cost is increasing force structure, not basing troops, to back the security guarantee.) Pyongyang once proposed a freeze-for-freeze, that is, suspending military exercises in return for freezing missile and nuclear testing. Beijing is pushing the same measure. The objection that the North is doing what it is supposed to while America and the ROK are giving up what they are free to do is true but irrelevant. Does the U.S. want to exacerbate or defuse the crisis? Does Washington want to increase or decrease the chance of war? Halting the threatening spiral upward would create some breathing room. Such a step also would enhance the likelihood of continuing Chinese cooperation regarding the DPRK. China long has insisted that the U.S., not the PRC, bears the blame for the North’s nuclear program. Absent Washington’s “hostile policy,” Beijing believes, Pyongyang would not be so determined to arm itself in such a way. Whether true or not, a serious U.S. attempt to defuse the crisis would increase the Trump administration’s leverage with China. Offer to suspend the exercises, long criticized by the North, and develop a comprehensive benefit package for Pyongyang, long sought by Beijing. Then press for unequivocal Chinese backing. Add negotiations over the DPRK’s future—how to protect Chinese interests in the event of a North Korean collapse or Korean reunification—and press for Beijing to back an American negotiating initiative with the threat of an energy embargo. The effort still might fail. The North might decide to go it alone no matter what. Kim Jong-un might decide to let his people starve before yielding his nuclear ambitions. But better to make the best effort possible. And especially to reduce the likelihood of conflict, intentional or accidental. War on the Korean peninsula is too awful to contemplate. Although deterrence and containment may be a second best when dealing with the DPRK, the U.S. followed the same policy in confronting Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union and Mao Zedong’s China. The likely price of a preventive war, without persuasive evidence that Kim and his colleagues are suicidal, would be far too high.

    "title": "Trump Administration's Shift On Marijuana Could Imperil Banking Arrangements",
    "text": "The owner of a medical marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles prepares his monthly tax payment. Marijuana businesses may become even more dependent on cash thanks to recent action from Attorney General Jeff Sessions. By Sophie Quinton By rolling back an Obama-era memo that shielded legal marijuana users, growers and distributors from federal prosecution, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions may compel many banks and credit unions to stop working with marijuana businesses. That’s because the memo Sessions rescinded, drafted by former Deputy Attorney General James Cole, is the foundation of Treasury Department guidance that created legal space for banks and credit unions to offer accounts to marijuana dispensaries, grow operations, distributors and manufacturers. Without access to the banking system, the rapidly growing marijuana industry — valued at $6.7 billion in 2016 — would have to rely on cash. That would make cannabis businesses, owners and employees vulnerable to theft and complicate state efforts to collect taxes on drug sales. Taking away the banking guidance could have a bigger impact on the state-sanctioned cannabis industry than giving federal prosecutors more leeway to bring legal action against it, said Andrew Freedman, a consultant who previously served as Colorado’s “pot czar.” While prosecutions depend on a number of factors, from prosecutors’ desire to go after cannabis businesses to the volume of cases courts can handle, many — if not all — of the 390 banks and credit unions that currently provide accounts to marijuana businesses would drop those accounts if the Treasury bureau in charge of safeguarding the financial system, called the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or FinCEN, changed its directives, say banking and cannabis industry insiders. “The FinCEN guidance was the one place they went to mitigate risk,” Freedman said of financial institutions. Banking has always been a challenge for the cannabis industry in states that allow sale and possession of the drug. Marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, and federal law requires banks to steer clear of participating in illegal activity. Still, thanks to the Obama-era guidance, a growing number of financial institutions have started to serve the industry. Rachel Pross, chief risk officer for Maps credit union in Oregon, where recreational marijuana sales are legal, says her institution has a plan in place to drop their marijuana-related accounts if the federal government pulls both the Justice and Treasury guidance. “If we didn’t have that guidance and framework to follow, we could in theory be prosecuted for federal money laundering,” she said. Maps is one of the few financial institutions in Oregon that have been openly serving marijuana businesses. Without it, businesses may have no other option but to rely on cash. “In the worst-case scenario, if we faced federal prosecution for continuing to serve these businesses, we’re talking like $30 million being put back into the streets of the Willamette Valley,” Pross said. Pross said she expected the Justice and Treasury department guidance to be changed at the same time, because the 2014 Treasury guidance tells banks and credit unions to monitor marijuana-related accounts for any activity listed as an enforcement priority in the Justice Department memo. But Sessions’ marijuana enforcement memorandum made no mention of the Treasury guidance, and the Treasury department has yet to announce any changes to its policy. “FinCEN works closely with law enforcement and the financial sector to combat illicit finance and provide relevant information that allows law enforcement to pursue their priorities. We will continue to work with DOJ and other stakeholders on this issue,” Steve Hudak, chief of public affairs for the Treasury bureau, said in a statement. Lawyers who advise banks are now scrambling to clarify the rules. “The Sessions rescission technically states that it is business as normal, and hence it is possible for FinCEN not to rescind its guidance, but rather, to clarify it by deleting the references to the Cole Memorandum,” Joseph Lynyak, a banking regulation expert and partner at the law firm Dorsey & Whitney, said in an email. That would allow Treasury to maintain some version of the guidance that permits marijuana accounts. However, now that the Justice Department has given federal officials more leeway to go after the marijuana industry, banks and credit unions that are following the Treasury guidance and filing regular reports on their marijuana-related accounts run a higher risk of prosecution, he said. That’s a risk some banks and credit unions may not be willing to take — regardless of the fate of the Treasury guidance. Hilary Bricken, cannabis business attorney and head of the Los Angeles office of the firm Harris Bricken, said financial institutions currently working with marijuana businesses may keep doing so for now, but banks and credit unions that were thinking about entering that line of business may steer clear. “I am positive that it will chill participation for those who are thinking about it,” she said. The financial institutions that serve the industry have always known that the Obama-era guidance was fragile and they might have to eject marijuana clients in a hurry. Sessions, a longtime foe of marijuana legalization, became attorney general last February and hinted in December that change was coming. “From day one when we started this business, we had an exit strategy. We’ve always kept an eye on the Cole memo,” said Shane Saunders, chief experience officer at Maps. Saunders said the credit union will survive if it has to drop its marijuana accounts. He’s more worried about how the surrounding community will handle an influx of cash. “That’s really our greatest concern,” he said.

    "title": "Trump Threatens Aid To Palestinians After U.S. Says It Will Withhold Millions From Pakistan",
    "text": "President Donald Trump appeared to threaten millions of dollars in U.S. aid to the Palestinians in a series of tweets Tuesday after a decision to also withhold funds from Pakistan earlier in the day. “It’s not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing,” the president wrote Tuesday afternoon. “We pay the Palestinians HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.” It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others. As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue... Trump continued to say that the Palestinians no longer wanted to negotiate a peace treaty with Israel and referenced his December announcement that the U.S. would recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ― one of the most controversial foreign policy decisions of his first year in office. ...peace treaty with Israel. We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more. But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them? The U.S. had budgeted $251 million in aid for the Palestinian-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2018, according to government data. On Dec. 5, Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and directed the State Department to move the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv. With the move, the president fulfilled a campaign pledge popular among some evangelical Christians and right-leaning Jewish groups. He touted the change as a new approach after decades of failed peace efforts, saying it was meant to signal “the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. In the short-term, however, rather than resetting the negotiations, the decision sparked widespread anger among Palestinians and deeply disappointed some of the U.S.’ most loyal international partners. Jerusalem is home to Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy sites. Israel has long proclaimed the city its “undivided” capital, while Palestinians had hoped its eastern neighborhoods would one day become the capital of an independent Palestinian state. Trump’s decision to recognize the city in its entirety as Israeli set off weeks of protests in the West Bank and Gaza, some of them violent. As international leaders warned that the U.S. severely complicated the peace process, Palestinian leaders posited that the U.S. had lost its role as an honest broker in negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. “Jerusalem is and always will be the capital of Palestine,” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told Muslim leaders just days after the move. “The United States has chosen to lose its qualification as a mediator .... We will no longer accept that it has a role in the political process from now.” Trump’s threat to cut off aid to the Palestinians over their anger surrounding his Jerusalem decision was previewed by the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, earlier Tuesday. Haley explained that Trump was considering cutting funding to the United Nations’ Relief Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). “The President has basically said he doesn’t want to give any additional funding, or stop funding, until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table,” Haley had told reporters. The U.S. is UNRWA’s largest donor, followed by the European Union and Saudi Arabia, although the agency is chronically underfunded. UNRWA is one of the main organization providing the Palestinian territories with long-term support in education, infrastructure and primary health care. Gaza and the West Bank suffer from flagging economies and high unemployment rates, partially due to what the United Nations has called an “imposed Palestinian economic dependence on Israel.” A significant drop in foreign aid, violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza and bureaucratic red tape in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority have also contributed to an economic slowdown, the World Bank said last year. Trump’s outburst Tuesday echoes his other complaints concerning the amount of funding that the U.S. provides other nations and international organizations. In the past, the U.S. president has threatened to cut aid to countries that disagree with his policies and railed against allies for not contributing enough money to multilateral organizations like NATO.

Such disapproval played out at the U.N. on Tuesday after Haley said America would withhold $255 million in aid from Pakistan, saying the country had “played a double game for years” and failed to support the American effort to fight terrorism. “They work with us at times, and they also harbor the terrorists that attack our troops in Afghanistan,” Haley told reporters at the U.N. on Tuesday. “That game is not acceptable to this administration. We expect far more cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.” Nick Robins-Early contributed reporting to this story.

    "title": "Trump Takes Credit For Airline Safety, Despite Slim Record",
    "text": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday sought to take credit for 2017 being the safest year on record for commercial aviation around the world, saying he had been “very strict” on the industry. Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record! But his actual record suggests this is an overstatement. In fairness, the Trump administration did announce new security measures in June for flights entering the United States from abroad. Not all of those measures have been made public, but the new rules mean in part that U.S.-bound passengers are now asked a round of basic security questions, with enhanced screenings for a selected group of passengers on each flight. On the other hand, 2017 was just as safe for U.S. aviation as 2016 and 2015, so there’s no statistical change to suggest the new security measures had a major impact. (The figure in Trump’s tweet refers to aviation safety worldwide, not just in the U.S.) In fact, there hasn’t been a fatal commercial passenger airplane crash on an American airline since February 2009, when a Colgan Air Dash 8 propeller plane crashed on approach to Buffalo, New York. Forty-nine passengers on the plane were killed, along with one person on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed that crash to pilot error, and the following year, President Barack Obama signed a major piece of legislation that raised the bar for commercial flight training, among other safety-related improvements. That doesn’t mean there have been no aviation-related deaths in the U.S. since then. In 2013, an Asiana Airlines flight crashed in San Francisco, killing three teenagers. A few weeks later, a commercial freight crash in Birmingham, Alabama, killed the captain and first officer. But the last major reform of aviation safety in the U.S. nevertheless dates to the Obama administration, while Trump’s signature aviation policy thus far has been his proposal to privatize the nation’s air traffic control system, part of the Federal Aviation Administration. In a White House ceremony in June, Trump cited the agency’s outdated infrastructure and argued such a change was long overdue. “We live in a modern age, yet our air traffic control system is stuck painfully in the past,” he said. Trump’s proposal would have created a not-for-profit corporation funded by user fees, to be governed by a board consisting of representatives from the industry and government. Proponents argued this was the best way to invest the billions of dollars required to overhaul the system. Opponents, like the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which represents general aviation pilots, warned of “unintended consequences and risks.” Then, a little over two weeks later, the Senate killed the proposal, at least for the time being. And as the Washington Examiner reported Tuesday, Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Congress’ main proponent of air traffic control privatization, plans to retire at the end of his term, which would deal another blow to Trump’s signature aviation initiative. Meanwhile, Trump still hasn’t nominated anyone to run the FAA, despite his insistence that he’s been paying close attention to aviation. The last day of Administrator Michael Huerta’s five-year term is Saturday. Huerta, an Obama appointee, will be succeeded on an acting basis by his deputy, Daniel Elwell, who was appointed by Trump. But Trump has not yet nominated Huerta’s permanent successor. The White House declined to comment on when an announcement might be made, but offered a statement that echoed Trump’s tweet. “President Trump has raised the bar for our nation’s aviation safety and security,” Raj Shah, principal deputy White House press secretary, said. “Last year, the President announced his initiative to modernize Air Traffic Control and under his leadership, the Department of Homeland Security released enhanced security measures to ensure safer commercial air travel. The President is pleased there were no commercial airline deaths in 2017, and hopes this remains consistent in 2018 and beyond.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "The White House Loves To Rewrite Resumes Of Ex-Trump Aides Who Cause Trouble For Him",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Wednesday released a head-scratching statement in response to explosive comments by his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, detailed in a forthcoming book. “Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my presidency,” Trump said. He belittled his one-time close ally as “a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the (Republican) nomination by defeating seventeen candidates,” adding that Bannon “had very little to do with our historic victory.” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders similarly diminished Bannon in comments to reporters on Wednesday, saying it was “clear” he “didn’t have a lot of influence” on the president or “the decision-making process” during his time in the administration. In fact, Bannon became a key figure in Trump’s political braintrust when he joined the presidential campaign in August 2016, helping refine and focus the “America First” agenda that helped propel the businessman to his win. And until Bannon left the White House last August, he was the chief keeper of that message inside the administration. But the effort to downgrade Bannon’s role in aiding Trump is a familiar refrain. The president and White House officials have deployed a similar approach to distance himself from former aides charged in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia. In October, Sanders argued that the indictments had “nothing to do with the president” or “the activities of the campaign.” Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who was among those indicted, “was hired to manage the delegate process” in the battle for the GOP nomination “and was dismissed not long after that,” Sanders said. Earlier last year, when Manafort first became a reported target in the Russia investigation, Sanders’ predecessor, Sean Spicer, claimed that the former campaign chairman “played a very limited role” in Trump’s White House race. Spicer similarly discounted Michael Flynn, who briefly served as Trump’s national security adviser, describing him as just a campaign “volunteer.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

As part of Mueller’s probe, Flynn pleaded guilty to a felony count of lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government during Trump’s presidential transition.

    "title": "Explosive Trump Book To Release Early After President's Lawyer Tried To Stop It",
    "text": "President Donald Trump’s attempt to shut down a controversial book about his presidential campaign appeared to have backfired Thursday when the publisher announced the book will be released days early. Michael Wolff tweeted Thursday that his book, Fire and Fury, will be released on Friday, Jan. 5, in response to legal actions by Trump’s lawyer. It was originally scheduled for release on Jan. 9. The explosive book includes former White House strategist Steve Bannon revealing new details of a campaign meeting with Russian operatives, as first reported by The Guardian. Here we go. You can buy it (and read it) tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. President. According to excerpts of the book, Bannon suggested the president was aware of Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner’s Trump Tower meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, despite the president’s claim he had no knowledge of it. “The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor — with no lawyers,” Bannon told Wolff. “Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.” “The chance that Don Jr. did not walk these jumos up to his father’s office on the 26th floor is zero,” Bannon said, according to the book. The president issued a denial of Bannon’s claims, saying the former strategist “lost his mind” after being fired from the administration. Trump’s lawyers issued cease-and-desist letters to Wolff and publisher Henry Holt & Co., seeking to stop the book’s distribution. In response, the publisher is releasing the book early, calling the work “an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse.” New statement from @HenryHolt responding to Trump's cease and desist letter: \"We see 'Fire and Fury' as an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse, and are proceeding with the publication of the book.\" 🔥 Trump’s lawyer also sent a cease-and-desist letter to Bannon, saying he broke the terms of a “confidentiality and non-disparagement agreement” he signed when he joined the campaign.

    "title": "Trump Says U.S. 'Not Going To Look Foolish As Long As I'm Here'",
    "text": "President Donald Trump took a break from a Camp David strategy session with top Republicans on Saturday to make some unscheduled comments to reporters. Asked if he would comply if special counsel Robert Mueller requested to speak with him as part of the investigation into whether Russia interfered with the 2016 election, Trump repeated his assertion that “there’s been no collusion” and said that “there’s been no crime.” “It’s making our country look foolish,” the president said about the investigation, “and it’s not going to look foolish as long as I’m here.” Trump touched on a wide range of topics as he took questions at Camp David. Catch the highlights below. On a report that Trump asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions not to recuse himself in the Russia investigation: “Everything I’ve done is 100 percent proper.” Trump said a New York Times report detailing his attempts to exert influence over the early stages of the Russia probe was “way off.” According to the report, the president enlisted White House counsel Don McGahn to help prevent Sessions from recusing himself from the investigation. The attorney general eventually did so anyway, prompting the appointment of Mueller. “Everything I’ve done is 100 percent proper,” Trump said Saturday. “That’s what I do, is I do things proper.” On Fire and Fury, a new White House tell-all by Michael Wolff: “[Wolff] said he interviewed me for three hours in the White House. It didn’t exist, OK? It is in his imagination.” Earlier on Saturday, Trump had hit back at critics casting doubt on whether he has the mental fitness to be president. The topic has come up this week in response to claims made Wolff’s book. The president tweeted that his “two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart,” before boasting about his TV career and election victory. “I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius...and a very stable genius at that!” he wrote. When reporters asked why he decided to tweet about his mental state, Trump replied, “Only because I went to the best colleges, or college.” He then rehashed the accomplishments he had outlined on social media earlier in the day. “I had a situation where I was a very excellent student, came out, made billions and billions of dollars, became one of the top businesspeople, went to television and for 10 years was a tremendous success, as you probably have heard, ran for president one time and won, and then I hear this guy that doesn’t know me at all — by the way, he said he interviewed me for three hours in the White House,” Trump said, referring to Wolff. “It didn’t exist, OK? It’s in his imagination.” “I did a quick interview with him a long time ago, having to do with an article,” Trump clarified, “but I don’t know this man.” Wolff states in an author’s note that he conducted interviews with the president, his senior staff members and their associates over a period of 18 months. However, he faces some questions over the book’s accuracy ― which the president said he was “heartened” to hear. On whether he would speak directly with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un: “Absolutely, I would do that. No problem with that at all.” “I always believe in talking,” Trump said when asked whether he would take a call with the North Korean leader. He credited his “tough stance” on the isolated nation ― which has included trading public insults with Kim Jong Un ― with North and South Korea’s agreement to open a line of communication ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. “Look, right now they’re talking Olympics,” Trump said. “It’s a start. It’s a big start. If I weren’t involved, they wouldn’t be talking about Olympics right now. They’d be doing no talking, or it’d be much more serious. He knows I’m not messing around. I’m not messing around. Not even a little bit, not even 1 percent. He understands that. At the same time, if we can come up with a very peaceful and very good solution ― we’re working it with [Secretary of State] Rex [Tillerson], we’re working on it with a lot of people. If something can come out of those talks, that would be a great thing for all of humanity.” President Trump on if he would be open to talking on the phone with Kim Jong Un: \"I always believe in talking. Our stance, you know what it is. We're very firm. But I would be -- absolutely, I would do that. No problem with that, at all.\" https://t.co/Wh1BDY3wJ1 pic.twitter.com/PiCL4LVL9y On Dreamers: “The wall’s going to happen or we’re not going to have DACA.” Late Friday, Trump sent senators a long list of demands on immigration that could prevent Democrats from negotiating a deal to help so-called Dreamers, or young undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children. Dreamers were protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program until Trump rescinded it. “We all want DACA to happen, but we also want great security for our country. So important. We want to stop the drugs from flowing in. Very important,” the president said Saturday. A border wall is chief among his demands, which also include restrictions on visa sponsorship, additional border security and policies that would make it easier to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. “We want to get rid of chain migration ― very important ― and we want to get rid of the lottery system,” Trump said, blaming the lottery system for a November terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight. The suspect in the attack, an Uzbek immigrant, had come to the U.S. through a State Department program known as the Diversity Visa Lottery.

Bannon had “breached the Agreement by, among other things, communicating with author Michael Wolff about Mr. Trump, his family members, and the Company [the campaign], disclosing Confidential Information to Mr. Wolff, and making disparaging statements and in some cases outright defamatory statements to Mr. Wolff about Mr. Trump, his family members.” Harder confirmed to HuffPost on Wednesday evening that the letter had been sent to Bannon. In a statement provided to ABC, Harder said Bannon’s comments for the book “give rise to numerous legal claims including defamation by libel and slander.” He said legal action was imminent. Bannon’s explosive claims were first reported by The Guardian on Wednesday after the outlet obtained a review copy of Michael Wolff’s book “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” set to be released Tuesday. In interviews with Wolff, Bannon suggested that Trump was aware of a meeting his son Donald Trump Jr. had with Russian operatives at Trump Tower in June 2016 and that the then-candidate met with the delegation himself. Bannon also described the meeting as “treasonous” and “bad shit.” “Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately,” Bannon told Wolff, according to The Guardian. Trump unleashed a furious denial of Bannon’s claims on Wednesday, saying his former adviser had “lost his mind” and alleging the former campaign chief had “very little to do with our historic victory.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Trump's Demands To Help Dreamers Could Doom Deal, Top Dem Says",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump sent senators a lengthy set of demands on Friday that could tank a deal to help Dreamers ― young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children ― and might risk a government funding agreement in the process. The document is essentially an immigration restrictionist wish list. It calls for a border wall, more immigration enforcement agents, punishment for so-called “sanctuary cities,” restrictions on citizens and legal residents sponsoring family members’ visas, and policies to make it easier to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. No dollar amounts were included in the list of demands, but The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Friday that Trump is seeking nearly $18 billion to pay for a border wall. Democrats and immigrant rights activists have said they won’t accept the White House’s demands in a deal to grant legal status to Dreamers, hundreds of thousands of whom are at risk of losing deportation protections because Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA program. The list could be enough to trigger a Democratic revolt on a government funding bill that needs to pass later this month, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), whose office shared the White House’s list with reporters, said in a statement. “President Trump has said he may need a good government shutdown to get his wall,” Durbin said. “With this demand, he seems to be heading in that direction. ... It’s outrageous that the White House would undercut months of bipartisan efforts by again trying to put its entire wish-list of hardline anti-immigrant bills—plus an additional $18 billion in wall funding—on the backs of these young people.” Trump ended DACA in September and said Congress should act to give more permanent protections to recipients of the two-year work permits and deportation relief. DACA recipients will begin to lose permits in greater numbers in March, although activists estimate they’re already losing them at a rate of about 122 per day. In the months since Trump ended the program, the White House has put out long lists of immigration priorities, and Trump has made broad pronouncements in public comments and tweets, largely focused around building a wall, ending the diversity visa lottery and eliminating so-called “chain migration,” immigration restrictionists’ preferred term for family reunification visas. The list of demands was initially created in October, with Stephen Miller, a Trump policy adviser, listed as the author of the document, according to the properties on the PDF file. But senators didn’t get a copy until Friday. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the document. Democrats have said they are willing to give Trump some of what he wants on border security, such as more infrastructure, technology and funds, in exchange for legal status for Dreamers. But they, and Dreamers themselves, have argued any deal must be proportional — not everything Republicans want in exchange for legal status for one subset of the undocumented population. During comprehensive immigration reform efforts in 2013, for example, Democrats agreed to an overhaul of the legal immigration system, border security measures and enforcement as part of a package that would have also granted a path to legal status and eventual citizenship for much of the undocumented immigrant population. Democrats, activists and even some Republicans have warned that piling on more immigration issues has the potential to sink a deal — it happened during past reform efforts and could again now. The document the White House sent to senators on Friday could indicate the administration either thinks it can get Democrats to settle because of their desire to help Dreamers, or that it doesn’t really want a deal at all. “I am not a bargaining chip for Stephen Miller’s vendetta against brown and black people. Offering up my safety in exchange for the suffering of immigrant families is sick and we won’t stand for it.” The demands include ending the diversity visa lottery and limiting refugee intake, as well as allowing citizens and legal permanent residents to sponsor only minor children and spouses for green cards ― shutting out the ability to bring over adult children or siblings. Trump has disparaged both the diversity visa lottery and “chain migration” as dangerous by citing two terror incidents allegedly perpetrated by people who entered through those programs, although there is no evidence there is a greater risk of terror by immigrants with those visas. The White House also asked for funds to hire 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and to give local police more authority to assist with deportation efforts. Another priority is to more easily penalize “sanctuary cities,” the loose term for jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with immigration enforcement, often because they view it as bad for community policing or because of constitutional concerns. The list also includes changing policies for people seeking asylum and for unaccompanied children apprehended at the border, restricting relief and making it easier to quickly deport them. It would also mandate E-Verify, a system that allows employers to check immigration status of would-be hires, something immigrant advocates and some business interests oppose because there currently is no pathway for many undocumented people in the U.S. to get status and some industries say they can’t find enough willing legal workers. The White House is hosting a bipartisan group for immigration discussions next week, and separate discussions between a group of Senate Republicans and Democrats continue. It’s not yet clear whether Democrats will insist that a Dreamer deal be part of a government funding package — Durbin and other members of the party voted against a short-term bill in December because of the issue and likely would again, but other Democrats might vote with Republicans for fear of being blamed for a shutdown.

    "title": "Trump, GOP Congratulate Selves For Immigration Meeting 4 Months Into DACA Crisis",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a group of Senate Republicans congratulated themselves Thursday for meeting to discuss a problem Trump created four months ago when he put hundreds of thousands of undocumented young people at risk of deportation. “What we did today, which I think was truly a breakthrough, is we saw the president assume leadership on this issue,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told reporters after the meeting, adding that Trump “already has” shown leadership on delivering a message on immigration to the public. Tillis and other attendees insisted the White House gathering signaled progress toward a compromise on young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and now fear removal because Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. But they came out of the meeting with few details about what Trump wants, beyond what he’s already tweeted. And the meeting came two months after bipartisan negotiations began in the Senate — negotiations Trump has mostly stayed out of. Any deal on DACA will require Democratic support, in part because some of the Republicans involved in Thursday’s meeting have opposed proposals that give legal status to undocumented immigrants. The Republican senators who attended the meeting were John Cornyn (R-Texas), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Tillis — of them, only Graham is still heavily involved in talks with Democrats on Dreamers. No Democrats were invited to Thursday’s meeting. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who is involved in bipartisan negotiations, didn’t attend Thursday’s meeting at the White House for that very reason. “I have no interest in attending any more Republican-only meetings on DACA,” Flake told reporters. “It’s counterproductive. This has to be a bipartisan bill.” Trump will hold a bipartisan meeting on immigration next week, the White House announced on Thursday. But so far, the administration hasn’t been involved much in bipartisan talks on a DACA deal. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly met with a bipartisan group of senators to discuss the issue before Christmas, promising a “punch list” of specific demands that still hasn’t come. “I have no interest in attending any more Republican-only meetings on DACA. It’s counterproductive.” The clock is ticking. When Trump ended DACA, he allowed some recipients to renew their two-year work permits and deportation protections, but not those who were set to lose them after March 5. That means that DACA recipients will begin to lose protections by the hundreds each day in March unless Congress acts. But the March “deadline” often cited by Republicans is a false one ― DACA has already been rescinded, meaning no new applicants can apply, and people who did not renew their permits within a set period are already losing protections. Advocacy groups estimate an average of 122 people have lost DACA protections each day since Trump ended the program. Flake has rejected the notion that Congress has until March to do something. He co-sponsored the Dream Act, a bill that would give young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children the ability to gain legal status. Graham, who attended the meeting on Thursday, is also a sponsor of the Dream Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told Flake last month that he would hold a vote on an immigration bill if a deal was reached by the end of January. Not much has changed in the interim. The key requirements for a deal Trump laid out at Thursday’s meeting were all ones he’s mentioned before: a border wall, ending the family reunification visas he calls “chain migration,” eliminating the diversity visa lottery and more enforcement of immigration laws. Republicans still haven’t reached a consensus on what to do about most of Trump’s demands. Some have adopted Trump’s calls for a wall, others say border security should involve other measures, some agree with limiting legal immigration, others do not. But the more immigration measures the GOP tries to pile into a deal — particularly polarizing ones like cutting legal immigration or dramatic increases in enforcement — the harder it will be to get a bipartisan bill passed. Democrats have repeatedly said what they want from the bill: protections for Dreamers — ideally, the Dream Act — in exchange for increased border security measures. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) reiterated to reporters on Thursday that those are their goals, but didn’t explicitly rule out measures the president wants, such as limiting family reunification. Democrats have called for DACA protections to be part of must-pass spending bills, but ultimately, many still voted for a short-term government funding bill in December that left Dreamers out. They could do the same thing when funding comes up again this month. Both Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have said they want immigration dealt with separately. Pence and Republican senators praised Trump in front of journalists for his role in the negotiating process. When reporters were brought into the room, Lankford told Trump, “You gave us a deadline and setting that for March the 1st, and that’s a tremendous gift to be able to get that done.” Lankford has also thanked Trump for the “gift” of ending DACA and urging Congress to pass a bill. Pence said Trump had “opened the door to an agreement on DACA, and today, as part of an ongoing discussion with these Republican leaders but also with Democrats on Capitol Hill, to accomplish that, and I look forward to being a part of it.” Trump said that he believes a bipartisan approach is possible. “I can tell you the Republicans want to see it work out very well,” he said. “If we have support from the Democrats, I think DACA is going to be terrific.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Trump Says 'It's Back To Work,' Then Visits Golf Club For 7 Straight Days",
    "text": "Following Donald Trump’s Christmas morning tweet announcing that he’d soon be “back to work in order to Make America Great Again,” the president reportedly spent the next seven days visiting his golf club. Starting on Dec. 26, Trump’s motorcade was spotted arriving at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, at 9 a.m. on six consecutive mornings, per pool reports. On Jan. 1, the seventh day since his tweet, Trump arrived at the club at around 8:50 a.m., BuzzFeed News reported, just minutes after he tweeted about having “much work” to do. Trump added that he was returning to Washington D.C. later in the day. Will be leaving Florida for Washington (D.C.) today at 4:00 P.M. Much work to be done, but it will be a great New Year! The White House told pool reporters that Trump was with professional golfer Fred Funk and his son Taylor Funk at the golf club on New Year’s Day. Officials, however, would not “specifically say” whether the group was golfing or not. On Friday, Trump invited about 60 members of the U.S. Coast Guard to play golf at his club as a token of thanks for their service. The president played a round of golf before the Coast Guard personnel arrived, The Palm Beach Post reported. The White House has been reticent about providing details regarding Trump’s golfing habits. On several occasions in the past week, staffers have refused to confirm whether or not the president was actually golfing at the club, even when he was seen standing on the greens. Last Wednesday, CNN reporters in Palm Beach said a white box truck parked right in front of their cameras and blocked their view of Trump hitting the links. The Secret Service refuted the suggestion that the truck was intentionally placed to prevent the media from seeing Trump. CNN’s Dan Merica, however, noted the significance of the vehicle’s placement. ″The president and the White House have tried to obscure the fact that President Trump golfs on a regular basis,” Merica said. “This is a man who ran for president, who criticized President Barack Obama regularly for playing golf during his presidency, but that criticism hasn’t continued into the Trump presidency.” According to NBC News, Trump has visited one of his golf clubs at least 91 times since taking office a year ago. Yet when he was on the campaign trail, Trump said he wouldn’t be spending time on the greens as president. “I’m going to be working for you,” Trump said at an August 2016 rally. “I’m not going to have time to go play golf.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Trump As Tantrum-Prone Toddler? It’s Not Really News To The GOP.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Republicans might reasonably have a number of reactions to a new book’s portrayal of President Donald Trump as a delusional, puerile ignoramus ― betrayal at the participation of colleagues, fear that their agenda is further imperiled. But one emotion they cannot honestly express: surprise. Journalist Michael Wolff’s book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, describes the president as a blustering, attention-challenged chief executive with little interest in most of his duties and deteriorating cognitive skills. A former deputy White House chief of staff, Katie Walsh, is quoted as saying her job was “like trying to figure out what a child wants.” That blistering assessment is not much different from the way Republican leaders were describing him in private conversations from the time Trump sewed up the GOP nomination in late spring of 2016. One top Republican National Committee official described to HuffPost how then-party chairman Reince Priebus would have to preface any criticism of Trump with several statements of praise. Otherwise Trump would lash out and not heed the advice, the official said on condition of anonymity to describe their nominee candidly. When it was pointed out that was a common tactic for parents dealing with unruly preschoolers, the official smiled and shrugged. A GOP fundraiser, recalling a late summer 2016 gathering of donors where he met Trump for the first time, said he watched in amazement as Trump was so flattered by the attention that he insisted on being photographed and engaging in lengthy self-congratulatory conversations with every person in attendance. It threw off the schedule for the rest of the day. “OK, so our guy is insane,” he said, also on the condition of anonymity. All of those mental and personality traits now generating such chaos have been in full view for years, according to Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant in Florida who has been a vocal Trump critic since he entered the presidential race. “Of course, he’s overmatched since day one on the job,” Wilson said. “You would not put this person in charge of a Waffle House, let alone the White House.” Back in the summer of 2016, there was little thought even among GOP officials that Trump would actually become president. Rather, the goal was to temper his outbursts and unscripted statements so as to improve the chances that Republican members of Congress in Democratic-leaning states would retain their seats. “I thought the fight would be over keeping the Senate,” said Grover Norquist, head of the anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform who was then and remains today close to Republican leaders in Congress and the White House. Norquist said he was as surprised as anyone when Trump wound up winning the election. Over his first year in the White House, Trump’s lack of knowledge about policy or even basic governance has been well documented, as has his continued unwillingness to accept criticism. One Republican close to the White House, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Trump still needs to be mollified with praise before being given bad news or unwelcome advice. “That’s how he is,” the person said. But Norquist said that his dealings with the White House in the recent push for tax cuts showed a president fully engaged. “On taxes, he’s focused and he gets it,” Norquist said.

    "title": "Trump Infrastructure Plan Will Likely Mean Higher Tolls And Fewer Jobs",
    "text": "Want that pothole on your street fixed? What about the rusty bridge you cross every day on the way to work? Want the subway to run on time? Then we need to talk infrastructure. Specifically, we need to talk about how we pay for it. Word is Trump is weeks away from pushing his so-called “$1 trillion” infrastructure plan to rebuild America, so it’s crucial to get some facts straight before the dog and pony show begins. First, it very likely won’t actually be $1 trillion. The administration says they’ll offer up $200 billion in federal funding to, as they put it, “leverage” the rest from other sources. What they really mean is cities, counties, and states will have to make up the $800 billion difference. This will make a dire situation even worse, as decades of tax cuts have drained public budgets. One telling example: more than half of all the country’s schools are in desperate need of repairs or modernization, yet 31 states spend less on school construction now than they did before the Great Recession. In fact, when all is said and done, there could be a net loss in federal infrastructure spending. Trump’s proposed budget cuts tens of billions of dollars from existing infrastructure programs, and the new GOP tax cut increases the cost to finance infrastructure for states and local governments. That means less new infrastructure and fewer jobs. Essentially, Trump is telling most Americans to do more with even less. Second, the plan will all but force states and local governments to privatize or even sell off infrastructure. Tax cuts have slowly opened the door to Wall Street, construction giants, and global water companies, who see enormous potential for profits. Some states and local governments have turned to expensive private financing, a.k.a., “public-private partnerships,” and learned the hard way. Private financing often means higher tolls, parking rates, or water fees, lower labor standards, and less public control over decision-making once a project is up and running. Either way, private financing does nothing to solve our infrastructure problems. It’s not financing that we lack. What we need more of is sustainable, dedicated funding to pay for what we need and pay back what we borrow. Direct federal funding is crucial to helping communities decide to take the plunge into building a new public road, bridge, or transit line. Third, nearly all decisions about infrastructure—what gets built, how to build it—are already made at the state and local level. The Trump administration will likely argue that the plan gives states and local governments more control and “flexibility.” But that’s already true. The federal government can use tax breaks, loans and loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies, and cash grants, but in the end they are just a bank—a bank that would be much more stingy if Trump gets his way.

    "title": "Trump Attacks Justice Department As 'Deep State,' Calls For Jailing Top Clinton Aide",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Tuesday renewed his attack on his “deep state” Justice Department, and said a top aide to 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton should be jailed. Trump, returning to Washington after spending the holidays at his Florida resort, posted an early-morning tweet lashing out at former Clinton aide Huma Abedin, apparently in response to Abedin emails released by the State Department on Friday. Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others The emails, disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the conservative group Judicial Watch, were uncovered during the 2016 presidential campaign, according to Politico, part of the FBI’s probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. Abedin reportedly forwarded State Department emails, including some that contained passwords, to a personal account. Trump and his right-wing allies continue to raise the issue. Trump also said in his tweet that the Justice Department must act on “Comey and others,” a reference to former FBI Director James Comey, who was leading the investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election until Trump fired him in May. Trump, in tweets and interviews, has repeatedly sought to undermine his Justice Department and FBI as the Russia probe has intensified. He has criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions numerous times for recusing himself from supervising the Russia investigation, and claims to have the right to direct government investigations himself. Last week, Trump asserted in a New York Times interview that he had the “absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Trump Lawsuit Over White House Book 'Nonstarter,' Legal Experts Say",
    "text": "Any lawsuits by President Donald Trump against former chief strategist Steve Bannon or the author and publisher of a book depicting a chaotic White House and Trump as out of his depth would almost certainly fail and could lead to more damaging disclosures, legal experts said. Trump threatened legal action against Bannon over “libelous” remarks quoted by writer Michael Wolff in the book “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” after excerpts were published by media outlets on Wednesday. Charles Harder, a lawyer for the president, told Reuters that he would take “legal action” to block the book’s release. He sent cease-and-desist letters to Bannon, Wolff and publisher Henry Holt & Co. Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus law professor at Harvard Law School, said a libel lawsuit by Trump would be a “terrible mistake” and “a nonstarter” that “no reasonable lawyer would recommend.” Dershowitz, who has often publicly defended the legality of the president’s actions over the past year, said it is very difficult for public figures to prevail in libel suits. Trump would need to show Wolff and publisher Holt knew statements by Bannon and others were false or they acted with reckless disregard for whether or not they were true. In the book, Bannon was quoted describing as “treasonous” and “unpatriotic” a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting Donald Trump Jr. and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner held with a group of Russians who had promised damaging information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Bannon has not responded to requests for comment. Trump Jr. and Kushner have not commented on the quotes. Elsewhere in the book, Wolff in his own voice describes Trump as “no more than semi-literate” in terms of his reading habits and being known among his social circle for having a “wide-ranging ignorance.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders described the book as “some trash” filled with “mistake after mistake.” The publisher defended the book. “We see ‘Fire and Fury’ as an extraordinary contribution to our national discourse, and are proceeding with the publication of the book,” Holt said in a statement. Holt on Thursday moved up the book’s release to Jan. 5 from the original publication date of Jan. 9. Some lawyers said Bannon, Wolff and the publisher could all argue that many of the comments in the book were opinions, which are protected by the First Amendment and cannot be the basis of a libel action. Andrew Wright, a former associate counsel in the Obama White House and professor at Savannah Law School, said that would include Bannon’s “treasonous” and “unpatriotic” quotes. “I don’t think Bannon would have a hard time establishing that he meant it as an opinion that it was disloyal and improper rather than as a statement of law,” said Wright. In one letter to Bannon and another to both Wolff and Steve Rubin, President & Publisher, Henry Holt and Company, Harder also said Bannon violated non-disclosure and non-disparagement provisions of his employment agreement with the Trump 2016 election campaign by speaking with Wolff. He said Wolff and Holt could face claims of interfering with or inducing breach of that contract. But legal experts said the employment agreement would not have applied to Bannon after he joined the White House staff. Because of transparency and free speech concerns, the government has far less power to limit non-classified speech by employees than private companies, said Bradley Moss, a Washington lawyer specializing in national security law. Apart from facing long odds, a Trump libel lawsuit would also force the president to participate in an intrusive disclosure process. Dershowitz said that defense lawyers would be able to subject Trump to “broad and far-ranging” depositions about “almost anything” and compel him to answer. Moss said defense lawyers would also be entitled to interview White House officials and collect potentially damaging documents from them. “It would be one more distraction, one more thing people in the administration need to hire lawyers for.” Trump has a history of threatening lawsuits in his real estate business career and during his election campaign, though he has not always followed through. In the campaign, he threatened to sue the New York Times over its reporting that he made unwanted advances on two women.

    "title": "Republicans Laugh Off Trump’s Nuclear Taunting Of North Korea",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump’s tweet taunting North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un over the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal raised alarms on Wednesday about the prospect of the nation stumbling into catastrophic war with a young, unpredictable ruler whose actions and decision-making are not fully understood by America’s intelligence community. The tweet, in which Trump boasted that U.S. nuclear capabilities are “much bigger” and “more powerful” than North Korea’s, even startled some officials at the White House. “Every war in history was an accident. You just don’t know what’s going to send (Trump) over the edge,” one administration insider told Axios. But Republican senators appeared unfazed, dodging questions about Trump’s Twitter taunts ― a strategy they have perfected to an art form during the president’s first year in office. “I’m going to vote,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said tersely, before walking into an elevator at the Capitol. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a frequent critic of the president, laughed off the query about Trump’s tweet and said he was withholding comment. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said it was simply “Trump being Trump.” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) chuckled when asked if he was concerned about the prospect of an accidental nuclear war. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a libertarian-leaning critic of military engagements abroad, seemed to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. “I think it’s always been something that’s been unspoken and sometimes spoken about quietly that there is a great deterrence in having a vast nuclear arsenal,” Paul told HuffPost. “And so I think the fact that countries know that, that there is a deterrent effect to having a vast nuclear arsenal. It hasn’t been done by tweet before. But it’s definitely been done and known and spoken of in diplomatic channels for decades.” At least a few GOP senators were more pointed in their reactions. Asked whether he thought it was appropriate for the president to be taunting an unstable man with nuclear weapons, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said he believed “we should speak softly and carry a big stick.” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said he didn’t think Trump’s tweet “helps.” Trump has repeatedly engaged in verbal skirmishes with North Korean officials in recent months. At the United Nations General Assembly in September, he threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, and called its leader “Rocket Man.”  The pariah state’s ministry fired back, calling Trump a “mentally deranged dotard.” The latest spat between the two men, however, appeared to escalate matters. Trump was responding to Kim who, in a New Year’s address to his nation, said, “The entire United States is within range of our nuclear weapons, and a nuclear button is always on my desk.” Trump in his tweet noted that he also has a “nuclear button,” adding that “and my button works.” “President Trump’s foreign policy by tweet is doing serious damage to the country.” Democrats excoriated Trump, calling his tweet dangerous and unbecoming of a president. “President Trump’s foreign policy by tweet is doing serious damage to the country,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. Schumer urged his Republican colleagues to speak out or else be complicit in “the degradation of the presidency.” Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the tweet “embarrassing and counterproductive.” Former Vice President Joe Biden, who was in Washington Wednesday for the swearing-in of Alabama’s newest senator, Democrat Doug Jones, chided Trump for being “cavalier,” and said his tweet showed “poor judgment.” According to Politico, diplomats who have met with Trump have used words such as “catastrophic,” “terrifying,” “incompetent” and “dangerous” to describe him. Former U.N. chiefs Kofi Annan and Ban Ki-moon also have warned about the increased chance of an accidental nuclear war. “One miscalculation, one mistake and we are all victims,” Annan said in a December interview, cautioning that “it may not be a deliberate decision to start a nuclear war.” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Wednesday discounted the concerns about Trump’s verbal attacks on North Korea. “I think the president and the people of this country should be concerned about the mental fitness of the leader of North Korea,” Sanders said at the daily White House press briefing. While saying that she didn’t think “it’s taunting to stand up for the people of this country,” she also disputed that Trump was goading North Korea by boasting about the U.S. having a larger nuclear arsenal and a button with which to launch the weapons.

    "title": "Trump Tweets Support For Iranians While Banning Them From The U.S.",
    "text": "President Donald Trump once again praised Iran’s anti-government protesters on Tuesday ― and the irony was not lost on many, given his administration’s repeated attempts to block Iranians from coming to the U.S. “The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime,” Trump tweeted early Tuesday morning. “The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!” The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their “pockets.” The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching! Trump and his administration have repeatedly praised demonstrators since protests broke out against the Iranian government last week. But several people ― including Samantha Power, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations ― have called out Trump for being hypocritical. Although he claims to support everyday Iranians’ rights, his administration has spent the last year fighting in court to enforce a policy banning them from coming to the U.S. We stand with the Iranian people so much that we won’t let them come here. https://t.co/fzbv8idiiJ Really cool that Trump suddenly cares about Iranians after spending the entire first year of his presidency trying to ban them all from the country. The hypocrisy of the Trump Admin towards the Iranian people is stunning. If you stand with the people under oppression LIFT THE TRAVEL BAN. Many innocent 😇 Iranians want to leave but visa denials are at the highest rate due to the #travelban. #IranianProtests #تظاهرات https://t.co/QkRbaJGD5y \"If an Iranian dissident wanted to come to the U.S. right now, he would not be allowed in under Trump’s ridiculous travel ban solely because of his nationality.\" https://t.co/krAnXWcZe7 Thousands of people across Iran have poured into the streets over the last week to protest the government and religious leadership. More than 20 people have died as law enforcement has cracked down on protesters speaking out against corruption and calling out economic and social issues in the conservative, religious country. In one of his first tweets of the new year, the president declared his support for “the great Iranian people” and said they were “hungry for food & for freedom.” Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!

    "text": "The United States was about 48 hours into the new year and, for a sweet, brief moment, it seemed like the political news cycle would be uncoupled from the presidential Twitter feed. But, alas, just two days into 2018, President Donald Trump, itching for controversy following a relatively quiet holiday break, sent off a barrage of missives with far-reaching international and domestic implications. Here’s a round-up of president’s Twitter feed from the first Tuesday of the year. 363 days to go. Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others Trump renewed his attacks against former 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, calling for one of her top aides, Huma Abedin, to be jailed. His message ― which also included a hit at what he called the “deep state Justice Department” ― apparently referenced emails sent by Abedin that were released by the State Department on Friday. Trump has continued to attack Clinton and her team more than a year after he was elected president. Read more here. North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! Trump taunted Kim Jong Un on Tuesday, just a day after the North Korean leader warned the U.S. that Kim had a nuclear button “always on [his] desk” and that the entire United States was “within range of our nuclear weapons.” Earlier in the day, the president once again demeaned Kim as a “rocket man” and later tweeted that his own nuclear button was “a much bigger & more powerful one than his.” “And my Button works!” Trump finished.

As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue... The White House also appeared to threaten hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid to the Palestinians on Tuesday, just hours after America said it would withhold similar funds from Pakistan. Trump lambasted the Palestinians for not giving the U.S. “appreciation or respect,” and accused their leaders of abandoning the peace process with Israel. Tension has risen throughout the Middle East in recent weeks following Trump’s decision to relocate the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Read more here. I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock. Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media. Stay tuned! The president continued his almost daily attacks on the media on Tuesday with a vague joke that he would establish something called “THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR.” “Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media,” he wrote. Earlier Tuesday, Trump lobbed an attack against his favored punching bag, the “Failing” New York Times, and its new publisher. “Get impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent “sources,” and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!” Read more here.

Trump moved to take credit for the record early Tuesday, linking the lack of fatalities to his efforts to be “very strict on commercial aviation.” But, as HuffPost’s Ethan Klapper notes, such boasts appear to be overstated. 2017 was just as safe for U.S. aviation as both 2015 and 2016, and the numbers reported this week account for commercial flights worldwide.

    "title": "Silver Lining In Trump’s Airline Claim: Maybe His Thoughts On Iran Can Be Ignored, Too",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― President Donald Trump on Tuesday took credit for a worldwide lack of commercial airline crashes last year. In the process, he may have offered inadvertent comfort to a foreign policy world nervously watching his pronouncements on global hot spots. What does it matter, after all, what provocative statement Trump writes about Iran or North Korea if he also, within minutes, makes an outlandish and easily disproven claim with zero basis in reality? “The sad truth is that other world leaders have long learned to treat President Trump’s statements with a grain ― or even a mountain ― of salt,” said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and a spokesman for the National Security Council under President Barack Obama. “This statement will only further undercut this credibility on the global stage.” Richard Nephew, a former State Department Iran expert and now a professor at Columbia University, said Trump has repeatedly undercut his intended messages with his numerous falsehoods. “Candidly, I think that he’s given that signal many, many other times than just this morning,” Nephew said. And as has happened repeatedly over Trump’s first 11 months in office, his White House staff was left to clean up his false claims and try to head off any lasting damage. On Tuesday, that task fell to deputy press secretary Raj Shah, who said in a statement that Trump had “raised the bar” for aviation safety. Shah cited legislation, supported by Trump, to privatize the air traffic control system. That legislation has stalled, in part because it had been pushed by the sponsoring lawmaker’s lobbyist girlfriend. “The president is pleased there were no commercial airline deaths in 2017, and hopes this remains consistent in 2018 and beyond,” Shah said. Trump’s morning statement followed numerous reports about the absence of fatal airline accidents anywhere in the world last year. “Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record!” Trump wrote at 9:13 a.m. But neither Trump nor anyone in the U.S. government has any control over airline flights that do not start or end in the United States. And Trump’s influence over domestic aviation in 2017 is dubious at best ― it’s not even clear whether he’s really interested in it. The Federal Aviation Administration is still being run by Obama appointees. And in any case, there has not been a fatal accident in the United States by a U.S. passenger carrier since February 2009, the first full month of Obama’s presidency. One White House official acknowledged privately that Trump’s unsupported claims make it harder to emphasize his remarks about foreign or domestic policy initiatives that someone has actually put thought into. The result is the now-familiar escape hatch: “The president’s tweet speaks for itself.” The airline tweet was not the only one where Trump wandered from his White House’s ostensible agenda. At 7:48 a.m., Trump used the conspiracy theorist term “deep state” to describe the Justice Department ― which is run by his own appointee, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ― because of its failure to prosecute his political opponents and critics. And at 9:39, Trump sent the first of what would be a pair of tweets attacking The New York Times. However, those remarks ― while unorthodox by the standards of previous White House occupants ― were matters of opinion. The airline safety claim, on the other hand, was so easily disprovable that it raised questions about Trump’s understanding of reality. And that, in turn, is likely to affect how Trump’s foreign policy statements are seen internationally, critics say. As part of Tuesday morning’s string of tweets, Trump weighed in on the protests in Iran ― blaming Obama for supporting the regime there ― and on North Korea, insulting leader Kim Jong Un and speculating about proposed talks between that country and South Korea. Trump’s own chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, said in November that he doesn’t pay any attention to Trump’s tweets, and suggested others do the same. Leaders of other countries, however, have not all internalized that message. On Monday, shortly after Trump accused Pakistan of accepting “33 billion dollars” in U.S. aid but repaying it with “lies & deceit,” Pakistan responded with an emergency security council meeting and a hastily scheduled consultation with the U.S. ambassador in Islamabad.

D.C. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sided with the commissioner, Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap, on Dec. 22. She ordered the panel to give Dunlap documents, including a draft of the commission’s controversial request for state voter data and communication relating to the planning of the panel’s Sept. 12 meeting in New Hampshire. But President Donald Trump suddenly dissolved the commission on Wednesday, and Justice Department lawyers said Friday in a letter that they would ask Kollar-Kotelly to reconsider her order because the panel no longer exists. Because the commission is no longer considering issuing final recommendations, the lawyers wrote, Dunlap faces no harm if he is excluded from the communications. The DOJ lawyers said that Dunlap’s right to information was on the same level as that of the general public because he was no longer a commissioner. “As you know, of course, the Commission has been terminated as of January 3, 2018, and your client is, therefore, no longer a Commission member,” they wrote to Dunlap’s lawyers. “The Commission’s activities ceased without it ever issuing any report or recommendation, and therefore there is no prospect of future injury, much less future irreparable injury.” Dunlap said after the commission was disbanded that he was more determined than ever to get the information he believed he was entitled to. “Perhaps the only surprising aspect of the Department of Justice response is their rich blend of arrogance and contempt for the rule of law,” Dunlap said in a statement Saturday. “It is unthinkable, unconscionable, and un-American that the administration would engage in actions that demonstrate such a flagrant disregard for a court ruling and the rule of law.” “I think my access—and the access to the information by the rest of the now-former members of the commission—is more critical than ever,” he added. “The government cannot cloak major undertakings in changes to public policy in total secrecy without any public scrutiny or accountability.” The Justice Department attorneys also indicated in their letter that the voter data collected by the commission “is not being transferred or utilized.” That comment is at odds with the White House, which has said the Department of Homeland Security would take up the panel’s “preliminary findings.” Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the commission’s vice chair, told Politico that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, a part of DHS, would run state voter roll information against federal databases of noncitizens in hopes of identifying people who were on the rolls illegally. Experts say that’s not a reliable way to detect fraud. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Trump’s New Plan To Uncover Voter Fraud Is Just As Alarming As His Old Plan",
    "text": "Even as Democrats and voting rights groups praised the sudden demise of President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission on Wednesday, voting rights experts were raising alarms about the news that the Department of Homeland Security would step into the breach. The White House said Wednesday that dissolving the commission didn’t mean the administration was ending its focus on voter fraud. Homeland Security will take up the baton. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the vice chair of the now-defunct panel, told Politico that the department can take information collected by the commission and run it against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement database of non-citizens to identify people illegally on state voter rolls. Voting rights groups had viewed the commission as nothing more than an attempt to gin up evidence to back Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election. On Thursday, election lawyers, civil rights groups and other experts saw serious flaws in the Homeland Security plan, too. They noted that voter fraud does not fall with Homeland Security’s expertise and that efforts to cross-match voting rolls with Homeland Security data in the past have resulted in high numbers of people being incorrectly identified as non-citizens. Plus, the department has the power to deport people. In 2012, Florida looked to the Department of Homeland Security’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database to help clean up its voter rolls. At the time, the departments of Homeland Security and Justice both warned that the system wasn’t a reliable way to identify who is and who is not a citizen. “The use of the immigration databases are inaccurate, discriminatory and inappropriate for voter list maintenance. We know that it results in inaccurate purging of eligible voters,” said Katherine Culliton-González, a lawyer at think tank Demos who represented plaintiffs challenging Florida’s method of striking people from the rolls. Furthermore, Culliton-González noted that ICE has “jurisdiction to deport people if there are allegations brought about someone who is not a citizen voting. That’s very, very intimidating and that’s why I’m so concerned about these false allegations.” Meanwhile, the data collected by Trump’s commission is unlikely to produce reliable information about voting fraud either because it’s not comprehensive. As of October, only 20 states had sent the commission their data and that information wasn’t standardized. The lack of precision raises the risk of false positives, especially if officials are inclined to find fraud. “What likely would come from an analysis is a pretty dramatic overestimate of non-citizen voting in the U.S.,” said Michael McDonald, a law professor at the University of Florida. “You could easily be rounding up people who are not citizens of the U.S. who didn’t even register to vote and didn’t vote. ... These are people here legally, under our immigration programs, maybe on their way to citizenship, but just because of a bad match they are rounded up and deported.” Citizens and legal voters could also be erroneously identified as non-citizens and illegal voters, McDonald noted. Kobach, who did not return multiple requests for comment from HuffPost, told Breitbart News that he will work closely with the White House and Homeland Security to continue the hunt for voter fraud. Among the documents he plans to turn over to the department are a Heritage Foundation database of voter fraud and a study by a conservative nonprofit co-founded by Steve Bannon that claimed to show thousands of examples of double voting. However, Homeland Security spokesman Tyler Houlton told HuffPost on Thursday that Kobach was not advising the department. He declined to explain what particular issues the department would be probing. “At the President’s direction, the Department continues to work in support of state governments who are responsible for administering elections, with efforts focused on securing elections against those who seek to undermine the election system or its integrity,” Houlton said in a statement. Kobach told Politico that it made sense for Homeland Security to take over the probe because the department recently designated elections as “critical infrastructure.” But Culliton-González said that move gave Homeland Security jurisdiction over things like cybersecurity and voting machines, not individual voter fraud. James Norton, who worked as deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs at Homeland Security from 2003 to 2007, said he was surprised a voter fraud inquiry would wind up there. The Justice Department, which in fact found little evidence of voter fraud during a five-year investigation over a decade ago, would be better equipped, he said. “It’s outside the scope of the mission” of Homeland Security, Norton told HuffPost. “You’re never going to find the answer if [the investigation is] under-staffed and under-resourced.” Asked why the White House had chosen Homeland Security and not Justice to take up the voter fraud investigation at Thursday’s media briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had nothing to offer beyond “That was the agency that was best determined by the administration.” It may not be all that easy for the Department of Homeland Security to get busy hunting for voter fraud. While the now-defunct commission had broad latitude to collect information on Americans, federal law requires Homeland Security to go through certain processes to do so. If the commission were to simply hand over the voter roll data, that would likely invite further lawsuits. The White House said one of the reasons it was disbanding the panel was that a slew of lawsuits was impeding its efforts. State election officials who entrusted the commission to protect the privacy of their voter information should be concerned about it ending up with another government agency, according to David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer and now head of the Center for Election Innovation and Research.

When you have data that was meant for voting purposes [being] repurposed for a law enforcement purpose by another agency, that would raise concerns,” he said. Becker added that Homeland Security’s new mandate to focus on individual voter fraud could distract from its recent progress in coordinating with local election officials to combat the greater threat of hacking. U.S. intelligence officials agree that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election, and 21 states had their electoral systems targeted by hackers last year. “If they get dragged by the White House away from the real problem to this wild goose chase,” Becker said, “it could have a really negative impact on how well that cooperation goes and that cooperation is essential.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Trump Pushes Voter ID Laws, Lambastes Democrats After Disbanding Voter Fraud Panel",
    "text": "President Donald Trump on Thursday pushed stronger voter identification laws, the day after disbanding his commission on voter fraud. On Twitter, Trump reiterated frustration with certain states for not handing over information to the commission he formed to investigate his unfounded claims of voter fraud, and blamed the “rigged system” on Democrats. Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged, must go to Voter I.D. As Americans, you need identification, sometimes in a very strong and accurate form, for almost everything you do.....except when it comes to the most important thing, VOTING for the people that run your country. Push hard for Voter Identification! The White House suddenly announced Trump’s commission would be disbanded on Wednesday, though Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the panel’s vice chair, said last week that it would meet in January. “Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry,” the White House said in a statement. “Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action.” Trump created the commission in May, after repeated complaints that voter fraud tainted the 2016 election and caused him to lose the popular vote to Hillary Clinton. He failed to produce any evidence to back his claim. Kobach sent all 50 states a letter requesting voters’ personal information, including birth dates, felony conviction records, military status, voting histories and the last four digits of Social Security numbers. Much of this information couldn’t legally be disclosed, and more than 20 states to refused to comply. Even Kobach admitted that his state legally wasn’t able to turn over some of the requested data. “In Kansas, the Social Security number is not publicly available,” he said in June. “Every state receives the same letter, but we’re not asking for it if it’s not publicly available.” Even if the panel had continued apace, there’s little evidence that voter fraud is widespread, or that voter identification laws control fraudulent activity in the first place.

    "title": "Trump Suddenly Ends Voter Fraud Panel",
    "text": "President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he was ending a panel convened in May to investigate voter fraud. The White House’s announcement came as a surprise. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the panel’s vice chair, said last week that it would meet in January. “Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry,” the White House said in a statement. “Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action.” Tyler Houlton, a DHS spokesman, said the agency would continue to work with states on election security and integrity, but said Kobach was not providing advice to the agency. “At the President’s direction, the Department continues to work in support of state governments who are responsible for administering elections, with efforts focused on securing elections against those who seek to undermine the election system or its integrity. Mr. Kobach is not advising the Department on this matter,” he said in a statement. Alan King, a Democrat on the commission, told HuffPost he was surprised to learn from a reporter that the commission had dissolved Wednesday evening. “As someone who has handled 43 elections and who knows election officials across the United States, this is good news,” he said. “I don’t believe there is a conspiracy of voter fraud throughout this nation and never have believed that there was. I was willing to serve on this commission and have an open mind, but I never believed that this commission would be able to produce evidence or testimony to support the claim of a widespread conspiracy of voter fraud in the United States.” Asked what he hoped the commission’s legacy would be, King said, “For future issues that a presidential commission might be impaneled, that more advanced forethought would be put into the decision to study an issue before spending taxpayer money.” The panel had been closely watched and criticized by voting rights advocates, who said it was an effort to substantiate Trump’s claims that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election. Even though several studies and investigations have shown voter fraud is not a widespread issue, critics said the panel would try to stir up uncertainty about fraud in hopes of passing more restrictive voting laws. From the start, the panel faced controversy. Several states refused to comply with a June request from Kobach for voter data from all 50 states. The request sparked widespread privacy concerns, and even Republican election officials said they could not turn over all the information the commission was asking for. As of October, about 20 states had turned over voter information to the commission. White House officials indicated that the panel planned to use the voter data it collected against federal databases to try to identify people illegally on the voting rolls. In one lawsuit, the Brennan Center for Justice sued to get records of commission communications with other federal agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security, which administers a database of non-citizens and the Department of Justice. The request for those records is still pending. It’s unclear now if those records will become public. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday that the panel was never intended to uncover fraud. The commission never had anything to do with election integrity. It was instead a front to suppress the vote, perpetrate dangerous and baseless claims, and was ridiculed from one end of the country to the other. The commission met twice publicly, once in July and once in September, but it was never clear what exactly it was working on. The commission had failed to find, or present any evidence, to substantiate Trump’s claim that 3 million to 5 million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election. Democrats on the commission began to raise questions about what exactly the scope of the commission’s activities would be and expressed open frustration about not receiving any information about the commission’s activities between meetings or when meetings would be scheduled. It was sued by Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, a Democratic commissioner on the panel, who said he was being excluded from communication and planning that kept him from fully participating as a commissioner. A federal judge ruled in December the commission had to turn over documents to Dunlap. American Oversight, the watchdog group that represented Dunlap in his suit, said it would continue to fight for the panel’s communications. “It’s no coincidence that the president dissolved the commission once it became clear it wouldn’t be permitted to operate in the shadows. Secretary Dunlap deserves our gratitude for stepping into the breach to take on adversaries of democracy. We intend to continue to fight for his right to access to the commission’s secret communications. President Trump can dissolve the commission, but the law doesn’t allow him or the commission to slink away from view and avoid accountability,” Austin Evers, the group’s executive director said in a statement. Two other suits against the commission were recently dismissed, but there were a handful still pending. Lawyers for the Department of Justice, which is defending the commission, filed notices Wednesday in the pending cases, noting that the panel had been dissolved and that the lawyers needed to confer on how to proceed. “If they think we’re not entitled to the information that I requested because they dissolved the commission, I think they’re wrong,” Dunlap told HuffPost in an interview. “I do intend to pursue it with probably greater vigor than before.” While Dunlap said he wasn’t entirely surprised by Trump’s decision to end the commission after the judge ruled in his favor in December, he said those celebrating should be wary of his decision to designate voter fraud issues to the Department of Homeland Security. The agency, he said, has wide latitude in what it can do to exert control over elections, particularly given that the agency now classifies elections as “critical infrastructure.” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the groups that sued the commission, said in a statement: “The President’s Election Integrity Commission was a vehicle launched for the sole purpose of laying the groundwork to promote voter suppression policies on a national scale. This unprecedented effort demonstrated this administration’s clear hostility to voting rights. We mounted successful litigation against the administration that exposed its failure to abide by federal transparency requirements and vowed to keep fighting until the Commission was terminated.” Kobach, who did not return an interview request Wednesday, blamed the lawsuits for the dissolution of the commission. He told The Kansas City Star he would work with DHS as it began to investigate voter fraud. “This is a tactical shift by the president who remains very committed to finding the scope of voter fraud,” he told the newspaper. “In a perfect world, the commission would’ve moved swiftly and there wouldn’t be any lawsuits.” In an interview with The Associated Press, he also blamed Democrats for stalling the commission’s work. “The Democrats, both on and off the commission, made very clear that they were not interested in determining the scope and extent of voter fraud and, indeed, they were trying to stop the commission in its tracks,” Kobach said. “The Democrats lost their opportunity, lost their seat at the table, by stonewalling.” Dunlap, however, responded, “All I was asking to do was participate. I doubt Secretary Kobach can eliminate public scrutiny of his work by hiding it even deeper.” King echoed Dunlap’s concerns, saying Kobach had become “delusional.” “These people have absolutely no concept of how elections are organized, implemented and conducted. Their ideology has blinded them to truth. They want to suppress the vote so strongly that they have become delusional,” King said. “They are so addicted to the concept of power and the quest for power that they have abandoned all that is fair, right and decent.” J. Christian Adams and Hans von Spakovsky, two conservative members of the commission who were Kobach allies, accused Democrats and other groups of obstructing the panel’s work. “Unfortunately, there are plenty of well-funded groups, activist academics and individuals who are not credible who sought to undermine and sabotage the Commission’s work. They may delight today in the dissolution of the Commission, but before long they’ll realize that advocates of election integrity have more stamina, support and perseverance than they realize,” Adams, who told HuffPost in December he was confident the panel would meet again, said in a statement. The White House also began to distance itself from the commission’s work on Wednesday. A White House official told Politico the panel had been an idea of Steve Bannon’s and “not a good one.” CNN quoted a White House official as describing the panel as a “shitshow” and said there was concern the commission’s request for voter information may have been illegal. The sudden dissolution of the panel is a victory for voting rights advocates, who relentlessly attacked the panel and the officials on it who had a history of exaggerating voter fraud. “President Trump created his sham voting commission to substantiate a lie he told about voter fraud in the 2016 election,” Jason Kander, founder of Let America Vote, said in a statement. “When he couldn’t come up with any fake evidence ... he had no choice but to disband his un-American commission. President Trump won’t stop lying about voter fraud, or end his assault on voting rights, but today is a good day for democracy. Good riddance.” “This commission was a sham from the start and everyone recognized it. We have real problems when it comes to elections: low voter turnout, unnecessary barriers to participation, outdated and insecure machines, and possible foreign interference,” said Dale Ho, director of the Voting Rights Project at the ACLU, another group that sued the commission. “But rather than address these real threats to election integrity, the commission engaged in a wild-goose chase for voter fraud, demonizing the very American voters whom we should all be helping to participate — with the not-so-secret goal of making voting harder with unnecessary barriers.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Maybe Trump Should Stick To Tweeting About Holidays This Year",
    "text": "President Donald Trump spent a lot of 2017 tweeting ― and news outlets spent a lot of time covering his tweets. All the president’s tweets, of course, are not equal ― nor is the public’s reaction to them. Since last February, the online polling firm YouGov has been asking respondents to rate many of Trump’s tweets on a five-point scale, ranging from “terrible” to “great.” The results suggest that Trump wins the most plaudits when fulfilling the presidency’s more benign roles, such as commemorating historical events, urging caution amid disasters, and celebrating holidays. Personal attacks, on the other hand, tend to go down badly with Democrats and independents, while in many cases getting only tepid support from Republicans. Today we remember the courage and bravery of our troops that stormed the beaches of Normandy 73 years ago. #DDay #Heroes pic.twitter.com/PtGQj3J2cS I encourage EVERYONE in the path of #HurricaneIrma to heed the advice and orders of local & state officials! https://t.co/AQmawTpZs0 Today, we gathered in the East Room to pay tribute to the HEROES whose courageous actions under fire saved so many lives in Alexandria, VA. pic.twitter.com/it52TkLsye Other well-received tweets involved similarly uncontroversial topics: marking Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Armed Forces Day and Independence Day, or thanking first responders to the California wildfires and the Las Vegas shooting and volunteers pitching in after Hurricane Harvey. I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.He's not smart enough to run for president! I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came.. ...to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no! The public was also largely unimpressed by Trump’s insinuation that he’d taped conversations he had with James Comey before firing him as FBI director, or by his attacks on Arnold Schwarzenegger, LaVar Ball, and retiring Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) I encourage EVERYONE in the path of #HurricaneIrma to heed the advice and orders of local & state officials! https://t.co/AQmawTpZs0 Trump also saw some of his most positive job-approval numbers last year for his handling of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News. Democrats overwhelmingly trust the news media over the president and have serious concerns about the administration’s relationship with Russia, so it’s unsurprising that three-quarters of Democrats rated this tweet as “terrible.” Thank you to the BRAVE servicemen & women who have served, and continue to serve the United States- our true HEROES! #ArmedForcesDay https://t.co/5Kkh0PYs5A Other tweets thanking the military, police officers, and first responders also scored well with the GOP. I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.He's not smart enough to run for president! The attack on Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team who broached the prospect of a future run for the White House, was the only tweet all year to net Trump a negative score among members of his own party. Today, we gathered in the East Room to pay tribute to the HEROES whose courageous actions under fire saved so many lives in Alexandria, VA. pic.twitter.com/it52TkLsye I know Mark Cuban well. He backed me big-time but I wasn't interested in taking all of his calls.He's not smart enough to run for president! Most Americans, it’s worth noting, don’t follow Trump on Twitter. A survey last year found that although much of the public had heard “a lot” about Trump’s tweets, barely more than a tenth said they generally saw his comments directly on Twitter, rather than learning about them in the news. YouGov’s TweetIndex shows a representative sample of U.S. adults the tweets sent in the past 24 hours by President Trump. Respondents are asked to rate the tweets on a scale “Great”, “Good”, “OK”, “Bad” and “Terrible” (scored from +2 to -2). The reported score published by YouGov is the average rating multiplied by 100.

Here’s why such an offer could drive “a wedge into South Korea’s seven-decade alliance with the United States.” And according to a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States is “closer to a nuclear war with North Korea” than ever.

    "title": "People On Twitter Prepare For Trump's Second Year With #TrumpMovieSequels",
    "text": "With multiple staff shake-ups, many unsettling tweets, and even a few indictments of former aides, President Donald Trump’s first year in office was pretty rough. As the second year gets underway, Americans are understandably curious and likely a bit concerned about what another year of Trump will mean for the country. For HuffPost Comedy’s weekly hashtag game, we decided to look at his second year as somewhat of a sequel. Unfortunately, if movie sequel history is any indication, Trump’s second year will feature a lot of poorly thought out decisions, cost more money than it’s worth, and be altogether worse than the first.

    "title": "Messages Are Projected On Twitter HQ After Trump's North Korea Tweets",
    "text": "A group of activists began broadcasting messages on Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters Tuesday evening, calling on the site to ban President Donald Trump just hours after he threatened North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the size of his “nuclear button.” The group, Resistance SF, continued to display those messages Wednesday, with some reading “Be a hero: Ban Trump,” “Endangers the world” and “Trump’s dog whistle” with an arrow pointing to the company’s logo. Another reading “Trump or @jack must go” appeared to call for the resignation of the company’s CEO, Jack Dorsey. “Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square, has enabled @realDonaldTrump from his first dog whistles in the birther movement to his latest nuclear pissing contest,” the group wrote on a Facebook event for the action on Wednesday. “Twitter is endangering the world and breaking its own terms of service to do it. Trump or Jack must go.” The group also launched a campaign using the hashtag #JackIsComplicit. HuffPost has reached out to Twitter for comment. Twitter on Wednesday responded to an outcry over Trump’s North Korea tweet, in which the president taunted Kim and said the United States had a “Nuclear Button” that was “much bigger & more powerful” than Kim’s. The company told The Hill that Trump’s tweet did not violate its terms of service because it was not a “specific threat.” Twitter’s policy bans “specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people.” The company also defended a similar Trump tweet in September in which the president first called Kim “Little Rocket Man,” with Twitter saying it considered ”‘newsworthiness’ and whether a Tweet is of public interest” before taking it down. Dorsey himself has said that all Twitter users are held to the same rules, but he told Wired last year that it was “important” to “maintain open channels to our leaders, whether we like what they’re saying or not.” The group organizing this week’s protest didn’t appear to appreciate that explanation. “Twitter had the audacity to say Trump’s escalation with North Korea didn’t violate their policies because it [wants] a threat,” the group wrote Wednesday evening. “If you don’t think teetering toward World War III is a threat then you’re probably named Jack Dorsey.” As BuzzFeed’s Alex Kantrowitz noted, the night’s messages also included projections reading “History is watching” and “A tweet starts WWIII?” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Twitter Says Blocking Accounts Of World Leaders Would 'Hamper Necessary Discussion'",
    "text": "Twitter appeared to clear up any confusion over whether it might block the account of President Donald Trump, publishing a blog post on Friday that said removing content from world leaders would “hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.” “Twitter is here to serve and help advance the global, public conversation,” the company said. “Elected world leaders play a critical role in that conversation because of their outsized impact on our society. Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate.” The post did not mention Trump by name. Activists began flashing messages on the side of Twitter’s headquarters in San Francisco this week, demanding the company ban Trump’s account after he compared the size of his “Nuclear Button” to that of North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un. The messages included: “Be a hero: Ban Trump,” “Endangers the World,” and “Trump or @jack must go” — referring to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer! North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! Critics have called on the company to ban Trump ― or at least to remove some of his tweets, particularly those in which he appears to threaten nuclear action. They typically cite a Twitter rule that states users “may not make specific threats of violence or wish for the serious physical harm, death, or disease of an individual or group of people.” Twitter did take action this week against loyal Trump supporter David Clarke, the bombastic former Milwaukee County sheriff. The company locked Clarke’s account after he posted a series a threatening tweets, including one in reference to the media that said: “Punch them in the nose & MAKE THEM TASTE THEIR OWN BLOOD.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "These Are The 12 Victims, Including 2 U.S. Families, Of The Costa Rica Plane Crash",
    "text": "Families and friends are mourning the loss of 12 people killed in a plane crash on New Year’s Eve in Costa Rica. Among the dead are 10 Americans ― two families and their tour guide ― and two Costa Ricans who piloted the Nature Air flight. Investigators are still working to determine what caused the small Cessna plane to crash into a mountain, killing everyone aboard, shortly after takeoff Sunday in the Guanacaste region of northwest Costa Rica. Early theories included mechanical malfunction, human error and a patch of strong wind, a Costa Rican aviation official told The New York Times. Here’s what we know so far about the victims: Bruce Steinberg, 50, and Irene Steinberg, 51, had been on vacation in Costa Rica with their three sons: Zachary, 19; William, 18; and Matthew, 13. All five family members died in the crash. The family lived in Scarsdale, New York, an affluent town in Westchester County. Bruce was an executive at Bridgewater Associates, an investment management firm based in Westport, Connecticut. Irene volunteered with several nonprofit organizations. Matthew was in eighth grade at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, a private school in the Bronx. William and Zachary were students at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University, respectively. “They were an incredibly tight-knit family who just loved to explore, loved to live life,” Paul Rubin, a family friend, told the Times. “They traveled extensively, but also gave their time extensively.” Like the Steinbergs, Mitchell Weiss, 52, and his wife, Leslie, 50, had been enjoying a family vacation with their children ― daughter Hannah, 19, and son Ari, 16 ― at the time they were killed in the crash. The Weiss family lived in Belleair, Florida, roughly 25 miles west of Tampa. Both Mitchell and Leslie were licensed physicians at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater. Mitchell was the head of the hospital’s interventional radiology department and Leslie was a pediatrician. “Their lives and medical skills have touched so many in and around our community, and we are forever grateful to them,” Kris Hoce, president of Morton Plant Hospital, said in a statement. Hannah was a student at List College, an undergraduate program at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, which partners with Columbia University to allow students to earn two bachelor’s degrees simultaneously, according to the Times. Ari was a sophomore at Shorecrest Preparatory in St. Petersburg and loved singing and acting. “He was such a good person,” Chloe Schnitt, a classmate of Ari’s, told the Tampa Bay Times. “Everybody loved him.” The family was active in their Jewish community. Both Hannah and Ari were youth leaders in the New York-based United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. Leslie was a board member of Congregation B’nai Israel in St. Petersburg. “This family was so bright and kind and will be missed by so many,” Congregation B’nai Israel posted on Facebook. Geissler, 33, was a tour guide for Backroads travel company, where she had worked since May, according to her LinkedIn profile. She had been leading a tour for the Steinberg and Weiss families in Costa Rica that included “seeing an active volcano, 400-foot waterfall, and many beautiful beaches,” her family said in a statement. “She was very excited to be working with families, and was eager to enjoy the sunshine, warm weather, and ocean waves,” the Geissler family wrote in the statement. Geissler received an undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Wisconsin-Stout and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. During her undergraduate years, Geissler was a star of the UW-Stout women’s basketball team. Mark Knoll, a former assistant coach for the team, called Geissler “very special” and “kind” in a Facebook post. Nature Air confirmed the identities of the two pilots killed in the crash as Juan Manuel Retana and Emma Ramos, according to Reuters. Former Costa Rica President Laura Chinchilla tweeted that Retana was her cousin. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Texas Couple Claims A Kiss Got Them Booted From Uber Driver's Car",
    "text": "A gay Texas couple say an Uber driver left them by the side of the road after they shared a quick kiss inside the car. Randall Magill, 28, and Jose Chavez, 26, said they were on their way home from a holiday party at a friend’s house in Houston at the time of the incident last week. The men, who got engaged in December, told Click 2 Houston that they were seated in two seats divided by an aisle in the driver’s minivan when they leaned in for a quick kiss. “I wasn’t doing anything that I wouldn’t have done in public. I’m not going to embarrass myself or my fiancé by any means,” Magill told the television station. At that point, the driver ― who has not been identified in media reports ― asked the men to stop kissing, Chavez said. “He said, ‘I can’t take you no more.’ He was like, ‘I’m going to have to drop you guys off,’ and we said, ‘That’s fine,’” Chavez said. “I was upset. I’ve never been told not to kiss or anything.” Although the driver claimed that he’d previously asked a heterosexual couple to stop kissing in his car, too, Chavez and Magill believe they were targeted because they are gay. The men called another Uber driver to take them home after being booted from the car, but they’re not likely to use the service again. “I’ve never heard of anyone being asked to stop kissing anywhere,” especially when it’s just a “peck on the lips,” Magill said. “I was super disappointed.” An Uber spokeswoman told HuffPost that the company, which has a clear nondiscrimination policy, was investigating the incident. “This is very concerning to us and we take these types of reports seriously,” the spokeswoman said. The company, she added, will take “appropriate action” once the investigation is completed. In 2016, the company fired an Australian driver who was caught on tape using homophobic and threatening language toward a same-sex couple.

    "title": "UK Train Company Answers Sexism Complaint With Even More Sexism",
    "text": "A train company in the United Kingdom has apologized “unreservedly” after it responded to a complaint about sexism ― with a sexist comment. Emily Lucinda Cole used Twitter to call out an unidentified male Virgin Trains manager, who she said told her “go ahead honey” when she threatened to complain about being moved into a busy car on a packed Edinburgh to London journey. The term was “hideously patronising” in “contexts such as these,” Cole posted on Tuesday morning. When virgin trains mess up and the older male train manager in the resulting conversation dismisses you with that hideously patronising word women shudder at in contexts such as these: \"honey\" @virgin_trainsEC. The person running the company’s verified Twitter account replied by asking Cole if she would prefer to be called “pet” or “love” the next time it happened: Cole said she was “stunned.” It was “wonderful” to see the company taking complaints “of rude and misogynistic behaviour seriously,” she added sarcastically. Wonderful to see that @virgin_trainsEC take complaints of rude and misogynistic behaviour seriously. Stunned. @EverydaySexism @VirginTrains pic.twitter.com/q26EdDoegR The company’s response was “patronising and belittling,” Cole later told Metro.co.uk. “And would they tweet that to a guy? Nope.” HuffPost couldn’t immediately reach Cole for further comment. Virgin Trains later apologized “unreservedly” for the tweet, and deleted the post “to avoid causing more offence.” We apologise unreservedly for this tweet and for the offence caused. To avoid causing more offence we have deleted the original post. ^SH A Virgin Trains spokesman replied to HuffPost’s questions by repeating the two-sentence statement. Cole’s posts about her experience did not go unnoticed by other people on Twitter, who also expressed outrage: @VirginTrains incredibly rude and snarky response to a perfectly reasonable complaint. This is not an appropriate or acceptable response @Virgin_TrainsEC https://t.co/a9t7bYZlU3 This is not okay. Awful. Well done Emily for publicising. Things like this may seem trivial to some but it’s the everyday sexism which allows things like the gender pay gap, etc to continue. There’s quirky social media customer service and then there’s condescending #everydaysexism customer service… @Virgin_TrainsEC pic.twitter.com/5Tht26nMtm This is utterly disgraceful, and a disgusting way to treat 50% of your customer base.

    "title": "Shunned And Homeless LGBTQ Ukrainians Are Finding Shelter In Kiev",
    "text": "KIEV (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Staring at the Berlin Wall mural of Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev kissing East German leader Erich Honecker on the mouth, Yevhenii Kalashnyk knew it was time to come out as gay. The 20-year-old Ukrainian kissed a friend in front of the graffiti painting in September and posted the photo on Instagram. The decision changed his life. “I was emotionally full,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. He said he had only kissed another man for the first time a few months earlier and had arrived in the German capital about 60-days into his first trip to western Europe where he hoped to find some peace of mind after a difficult period. For while gay sex has been legal in Ukraine since 1991, it remains socially taboo with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people facing stigma, discrimination and sometimes violent attacks, rights groups say. Ukrainian authorities have increased their support for gay rights since a pro-Western government took power following the Maidan protests in 2014 and in 2015 passed a law banning workplace discrimination against the LGBT community. But critics say homophobic attitudes remain widespread. The country scored 19 out of 100 points in a 2016 survey by EU-funded Rainbow Europe ranking LGBT people’s rights in Europe. Shortly after posting the kiss photo, Kalashnyk received a call from his mother. “She asked: ‘Are you gay?‘. I said ‘yes’ ... Then she started saying very bad things,” he said, adding that his father also threatened him. Too afraid to go home to Nikopol, Kalashnyk headed to Kiev when he returned to Ukraine about a month later where he found accommodation with Insight, a local gay rights group. The organization runs Ukraine’s first and only LGBT shelter - a four-room flat, with bunk beds, a kitchen and communal area, in an old apartment block outside Kiev’s city center. Up to eight guests at a time can receive food, clothing, medicines, a travel card, as well as legal and psychological help, and can stay up to three months, extendable on an ad hoc basis, Insight says. “It’s a great opportunity for people to adapt and start a new life. You don’t have to worry about finding work without knowing where to sleep,” said Pavel, a 48-year-old resident from Donetsk, who declined to give his real name. The facility was launched in June 2014 to help LGBT people fleeing the conflict in the country’s east but has since opened its doors to those from other regions. More than 10,000 people have been killed and 1.6 million forced from their homes since pro-Russian separatists in the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk rebelled against Kiev’s pro-western government in 2014. Members of the LGBT community were also affected by the violence with many losing their jobs, having their houses damaged or suffered homophobic attacks amid the upheaval, said Olga Olshanskaya, the Insight shelter coordinator. She said transgender people were particularly vulnerable to abuse as they had to show ID documents that did not reflect their appearance or sex at checkpoints in conflict-hit areas. “No one wants to leave their home, but (for many) coming to Kiev was the only hope,” said Olshanskaya in a room adorned by rainbow flags at Insight’s headquarters in central Kiev. Oksana, a 35-year-old transgender woman from Donetsk, said a militiaman manning a checkpoint pointed a gun at her head because of her looks weeks before she left for Kiev in 2014. She had started undergoing hormone treatment two years earlier after another weapon - a hunting rifle she held against her head - misfired in a failed suicide attempt. Until then she had kept her sexuality quiet, fearing the wrath of her family. “I was born with all the right organs, two legs, two feet but ... not in the right body,” she said. “To live life as some else is very difficult.” Oksana, who preferred not to use her full name, spent just over a month at the Insight shelter in Kiev, long enough to find work at a law firm, and has since founded an advocacy group for transgender rights called T-ema. But life in Kiev can also be difficult. Kalashnyk said he sometimes suffers verbal abuse and always carries pepper spray to fight off potential assailants. In 2015 several dozen protesters attacked a gay pride march, throwing flares and clashing with police. In June this year, the same event went ahead largely without incident under heavy security following threats from ultra-nationalist groups supporting what they say are traditional Ukrainian values. Pavel, who works in the pharmaceutical sector, decided against attending the rally in case colleagues recognized him. “It could have been the end of my career,” he said. Some supporters of LGBT rights see progress in Ukraine as symptomatic of the country’s closer integration with the European Union and rejecting its ties with neighboring Russia. But change is happening too slowly for Kalashnyk. “I don’t see how I can realize myself here. I don’t see my future in Ukraine,” he said.

    "title": "Un-Ban Words And Challenge Bad Behavior In 2018",
    "text": "George Orwell published his dystopian novel “1984” in 1949. He feared a future when a dictatorial government could redefine war as peace and freedom as slavery. With the Trump Administration, lies are “alternative facts”. A scene from the 1956 film version of “1984.” At American colleges, enraged conservative students, supported by right-wing allies and funders, bring provocative speakers to campus to incite conflict, and then scream that their freedom of speech is suppressed by the politically correct left. I support the right of the Right to speak, even when their speech is incendiary or just plain ridiculous, but not their right to intimidate and harass people they would rather not have on “their” campus or in “their” country. The line between speech and intimidation is a difficult line to draw, but I think it is legitimate to draw it. Chanting “Trump, Trump, Trump,” “Build the Wall,” or “Lock them Up,” is reminiscent of chants at Nazi rallies in Hitler’s Germany. It is not intended as an act of free speech, but to shut speech down. The real problem in the United States is not the silencing of the “political right.” The airwaves are flooded with their “alternative facts” and hate-filled venom on Clear Channel radio and Fox News cable television. The real problem is efforts by the Trump administration and his rightwing fanatics to censor and silence open discussion and the use of evidence and reason in the United States. In December, policy analysts at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the United States’ leading public health institute, were presented with the list of seven banned words they were not to use in their budget requests. The CDC’s unholy word list includes (1) diversity, (2) fetus, (3) transgender, (4) vulnerable, (5) entitlement, (6) science-based, and (7) evidence-based. How scientists and medical professionals could write reports that are not “science-based” remains unclear. It later turned out that this was not an official agency ban imposed by the Trump administration, but a more or less self-imposed attempt by CDC employees who feared a right-wing Congress would refuse to fund projects too closely identified with such “controversial” ideas. They have a right to be afraid. Other Trump agencies have distributed word ban list. In February, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) instructed staff to avoid using the term (8) climate change and to substitute weather extremes instead. (9) The phrase “reduce greenhouse gases” was also blacklisted. USDA staff was told to use “build soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency.” Last March, the Department of Energy (DOE) banned staff from referring to climate change or the (10) Paris Agreement in written memos, briefings or other written communications. The impact of the Trump assault on science is most clear at the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), where over 700 employees, including 200 scientists and 96 environmental protection specialists, have been pushed out, quit, or retired since Trump took office. Morale at the agency dropped even lower when employees and the public recently learned that Republican Party operatives were trying to gain access to internal emails to root out EPA officials who oppose the Trump anti-science agenda. Self-censorship may actually be more dangerous than an official word ban. Science and democracy both require an open exchange of ideas. When scientists and citizens are afraid to speak out, both human advancement and freedom shrivel. The best response is to use the words over and over again.

    "title": "Air Travelers Stuck In Long Lines After U.S. Customs Computers Go Down",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Immigration desk computers at various airports went down for about two hours on Monday, causing long lines for travelers entering the United States after year-end holidays, according to Customs and Border Protection and posts on social media. The processing system outage began at about 7:30 p.m. EST and was resolved about 9:30 EST, the customs agency said in a statement. All airports were back on line after wait times for travelers that were longer than usual, it said. “At this time, there is no indication the service disruption was malicious in nature,” the agency said. It gave no explanation for the disruption and said travelers were processed using alternative procedures. Travelers entering the United States from overseas posted photos on social media of long lines at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. “No one has been getting past JFK Airport immigration for the last hour. Line is a few 100 deep. Seems like their system did completely go down. Happy New Year!” said Jessica Yang, a program manager at Microsoft, in a Twitter post. Other airports, including Denver International Airport, also said they were affected. A similar computer outage occurred a year ago. “Operations returning to normal as @CustomsBorder computer issue resolved. Issue affected other US airports.

    "title": "Trump Talks About War With North Korea. Here's How Horrific That Would Really Be.",
    "text": "President Trump has hinted at the possibility of military action against North Korea, but any U.S. strike is likely to rapidly escalate into an all-out war. A full-scale conflict with North Korea would cause mass casualties, even in the best-case scenario. A U.S.-North Korean war could lead to millions of deaths, a refugee crisis and long-term instability. President Donald Trump’s taunt this week that his “Nuclear Button” was bigger and more powerful than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s once again raised the specter of armed conflict between the U.S. and Kim’s regime. Trump has been engaged in an intense and at times juvenile battle of insults and threats with Kim since he took office. In that same time, Pyongyang has rapidly expanded its nuclear and missile capabilities. Amid the constantly escalating rhetoric between Trump and North Korea, it’s easy to lose sight of what exactly is being threatened and just how devastating war with the country would be. It’s a conflict that would undoubtedly kill thousands, if not millions, of people and likely bring about the first use of nuclear weapons in combat since World War II. Analysts have looked at a number of possible scenarios for how a war between the U.S. and North Korea would play out. Most likely, hostilities would start small, but quickly become difficult to rein in. For example, North Korea could retaliate after the U.S. shoots down a missile test or because of some kind of misunderstanding around a perceived American military move. Experts say that if the U.S. were to launch an initial strike ― say, targeting a North Korean missile site ― Pyongyang could easily interpret it as the start of something larger. “More likely a limited strike would not stay limited and would quickly escalate. Everything I’ve read about North Korean military doctrine and way of thinking indicates they would fight back fiercely and would regard even a so-called limited strike as the first salvo of the invasion that they’ve been predicting for years,” said Mark Fitzpatrick, head of the International Institute for Strategic Studies Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Policy Programme. North Korean defectors, including a former diplomat, have echoed that assessment, warning that if the U.S. were to conduct any sort of limited strike, Pyongyang would likely respond harshly to deter a full-on invasion from the U.S. and its allies. Among North Korea’s immediate targets would be U.S. bases in South Korea and Japan, experts say, which Pyongyang would likely attempt to destroy using nuclear weapons as a show of force to deter further invasion. The problem with the North Korean strategy, experts say, is that rather than cause the U.S. and its allies to back off from a conflict, the use of nuclear weapons by Pyongyang would motivate the U.S. and its allies to launch an intense, full-scale attempt to destroy North Korea’s military and decapitate its leadership. It’s unlikely that the U.S. would succeed in completely obliterating Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal or its conventional weapons before North Korea could target South Korea with its artillery and devastate major metropolises like Seoul and Tokyo. North Korea could also potentially launch intercontinental ballistic missiles against the U.S. mainland, either in an immediate strike or after threatening cities like New York and Washington with a strike to prevent further American military action. Analysts’ current assessments of North Korea’s missile and nuclear capability is that the country could reach most of the mainland United States with its intercontinental ballistic missiles and potentially be able to target major American cities. Although there is debate among missile experts over how accurately North Korea could deliver a nuclear warhead to the U.S. and whether such a weapon would survive re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, the North Korean military has shown itself to be increasingly proficient at conducting successful tests and is continually advancing its missile technology. It’s possible that Pyongyang could already hit cities like New York, Washington and Los Angeles with nuclear weapons. It would take about 30 to 40 minutes from launch for North Korean missiles to reach their targets in the U.S. in the case of a nuclear attack. The missiles would leave cities in rubble and kill thousands in the initial blasts ― but as in the cases of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the deadly effects would not stop there. “It’s so horrible that people don’t really ever want to deal with what it would really look like. We pretend that there’s a flash and everyone’s dead, but that’s not what happens,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear policy expert at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. “There would be survivors for days trying to make their way out of the rubble and back home, dying of radiation poisoning,” he said. To try and defend against missile attacks, the U.S. has spent decades investing billions into developing and testing missile defense systems that could knock missiles out of the sky before they reach populated areas. But missile defense is an extremely difficult endeavor that experts liken to hitting a bullet with a bullet, and tests so far have proven it’s not guaranteed to work. “People think it ought to work, because it exists and we spent tens of billions of dollars on it, but it hasn’t been shown to be reliable or to work in real-world conditions,” said Laura Grego, a senior scientist at the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “I would not count on it being a good defense, that’s not the way you should think about it,” she added. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency has around a 56 percent success rate in its tests since 1999, which means that if North Korea were to launch multiple missiles, the chances of at least a few warheads making it to their targets is extremely high. This data goes against Trump’s statements on missile defense in October, when he claimed that the U.S. can shoot down missiles “97 percent of the time” ― prompting missile experts to worry about Washington’s overconfidence in the defense systems. “I’m worried about missile defense’s role, since an misapprehension or overestimation of its capabilities can be dangerous,” Grego said. Although much of the focus in a hypothetical conflict with North Korea concerns the role of missile strikes, the country also has over a million troops at the ready to fight on the ground. “Their military is the fourth-largest in the world and is supported by a paramilitary that is 4 to 5 million strong. There’s no doubt that North Korea would put up a fierce fight in the event of a war,” said Fitzpatrick. Although experts say that the U.S. has the overwhelming military power to win a conflict with North Korea, they note a likelihood of continuous guerrilla warfare in the aftermath and the need for a massive occupation force to prevent the nation’s collapse into anarchy. A population of more than 25 million people would need food and aid, while also transitioning from a totalitarian political system that has closed it off from the world for decades. China is also concerned that the fall of Pyongyang would create a massive number of refugees crossing the border. Military forces and arms could also join the exodus and present a major crisis for the government. If North Korea’s regime fell, there would also be an urgent proliferation crisis and a race to prevent its extensive conventional, chemical and nuclear weapons stocks from falling into the wrong hands. Altogether, containing the fallout would be a military and political endeavor rarely seen in history, likely costing trillions of dollars and killing untold numbers of people. As tensions between the U.S. and North Korea continue to escalate, Trump’s inflammatory statements and Washington’s talk of a military option against North Korea have brought increased uncertainty and concern about the risk of war. But there’s also a broader shift in the U.S. relationship with North Korea as American policy adapts to the growing and unpleasant reality that Kim’s regime has the power to target the U.S. “This moment is so fraught because the North Koreans are doing something very unusual. The North Koreans are transitioning from being like any other country which is vulnerable to American military coercion into a mutual deterrence relationship,” Lewis said. “We really only have one historical data point, and that’s the Soviet Union in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where we transitioned into a mutual deterrence relationship ― we didn’t like it and we had the Cuban missile crisis. The North Koreans are now making that same transition and we’re having a crisis about it.” Can Anyone Prevent Trump From Launching A Nuclear Strike?

    "title": "2 Vice Employees Accused Of Sexual Harassment Placed On Leave",
    "text": "Two high-ranking staff members at Vice Media have been placed on leave after sexual misconduct allegations against them emerged, according to a Tuesday morning staff memo obtained by HuffPost. The two men placed on leave are President Andrew Creighton and Chief Digital Officer Mike Germano, who were both named in New York Times reporter Emily Steel’s bombshell report last month exploring Vice Media’s alleged toxic workplace culture for women. She also broke news of the memo on Tuesday. Vice Media announced in a memo to staff this morning that Andrew Creighton, the company's president, and Mike Germano, its chief digital officer, are both on leave after sexual harassment allegations were publicly reported against them. Story to come. According to the memo from Sarah Broderick, Vice Media’s chief operating officer and chief financial officer, Creighton suggested he take leave while a special committee of Vice’s board reviews the allegations made against him in the Times story. In 2016, the story said, Creighton paid $135,000 to a former employee who claimed she was fired after refusing “an intimate relationship” with him. While an independent law firm at the time found the claim to lack merit and the company paid the settlement “to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation,” Broderick wrote in Tuesday’s memo, the committee will carry out the second review as a “further step” and make a recommendation on his employment by Jan. 11. The claims against Germano, who also serves as the CEO of Vice digital agency Carrot, will be investigated by Vice’s human resources department alongside an external investigator, according to the memo. One former Carrot employee told the Times that in 2012, Germano told her at the company holiday party that he hadn’t wanted to hire her because he wanted to have sex with her. Another former employee said Germano pulled her onto his lap during a work event at a bar in 2014. After reporting the incident to HR, she felt the incident caused her to fall “out of favor” at the company and left. In anticipation of the Times report, about which rumors circulated weeks before it was published, several Vice employees told HuffPost’s Ashley Feinberg in November that they were disappointed in the company’s lack of response to other toxic workplace allegations published in a damning Daily Beast report days earlier. Several also said they were cautiously hopeful that promises to address the problems at the company ― such as establishing an all-female advisory board that includes Gloria Steinem, former Michelle Obama chief of staff Tina Tchen and other high-profile names ― will be carried out effectively.

    "title": "Name-Drawing In Virginia Election To Proceed, After Court Rejects Democrat's Lawsuit",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Adding another wrinkle in the dramatic race that could decide control of the Virginia House of Delegates, a Virginia court on Wednesday rejected a legal challenge in the contested District 94 seat. The move paves the way for the race to be decided by a name-drawing on Thursday morning. Last week, Democrat Shelly Simonds filed a motion arguing that the three-judge panel should not have considered a previously uncounted ballot in favor of her Republican opponent, David Yancey. A recount completed in December determined that Simonds had won by just one vote. But Yancey, the incumbent, later sued, and the court ruled in his favor, bringing the race to a tie. Simonds alleged that Yancey’s disputed ballot should not have been counted, and Democrats argued that it was a “desperate effort to change the outcome and steal the election” from Simonds. The judges on Wednesday defended their decision to consider the ballot. “The right of a citizen to cast a free vote has been secured to us by the blood of patriots shed from Lexington and Concord to Selma, Alabama,” they wrote in their ruling. “The manifest injustice against which we must always guard is the chance that a single vote may not be counted. It matters not the importance of the disposition of a ballot in a given election; it matters the dignity of the citizen, the integrity of the electoral process, and the destiny of our constitutional republic.” Virginia law indicates that state officials are supposed to break an electoral tie “by lot.” The Board of Elections originally scheduled a meeting to conduct a random name-drawing on Dec. 27 but postponed it because Simonds’ campaign filed the lawsuit just hours before the name-drawing. “Drawing names is an action of last resort,” board Chairman James Alcorn said in a statement. “Any substantive concerns regarding the election or recount should be resolved before a random drawing is conducted.” Some of the court’s judges were out of town for the holidays, making it unlikely they would have considered Simonds’ motion before this week. If Simonds were to win the seat, Republicans would lose their majority in the House of Delegates for the first time in 17 years. However, the matter may not be resolved when the legislature convenes on Jan. 10, as Virginia state law notes that the loser of Thursday’s name-drawing can request another recount. In a statement on Wednesday’s ruling, Simonds asked Yancey “to enter into a mutual agreement that the loser of tomorrow’s drawing will not request a second recount, contest the election in the House of Delegates, or pursue any other action challenging the result.” “I am disappointed by the court’s ruling, with which I disagree,” Simonds said. “However, I recognize that the people of the 94th District deserve to have representation on Jan. 10, and a second costly recount is not in their interest. I respectfully ask Delegate Yancey to enter into a mutual agreement that the loser of tomorrow’s drawing will not request a second recount, contest the election in the House of Delegates, or pursue any other action challenging the result. I have no interest in delaying this process, and I hope Delegate Yancey and House Republicans agree.” Simonds tweeted later Wednesday that Yancey had declined her offer. I will continue to fight. Yancey has declined my offer to make the draw tomorrow final, so I guess the only sure thing is that this won't be settled tomorrow. I'm sorry that my district may not have representation Jan 10 because of this. In a press call Wednesday evening, Simonds declined to say whether she would definitely ask for a recount if she lost the name-drawing. But since Yancey had declined her offer to make the drawing final, she said all legal options were on the table. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Republican Wins Drawing Settling Tied Virginia House Of Delegates Race",
    "text": "Republican David Yancey on Thursday won a tied election for a Virginia House of Delegates seat when state officials picked his name out of a bowl. The name drawing settles the disputed election for the 94th District seat, at least for now, and allows Republicans to maintain control of the Virginia House of Delegates. Simonds, however, refused to concede, saying “all options are still on the table,” according to NBC reporter Vaughn Hillyard. Yancey was initially declared the winner of the November election, but after a recount, Democrat Shelly Simonds was deemed the victor by one vote. When a court reviewed the recount, lawyers for Yancey found a single ballot they believed should have been counted for the Republican, and the court agreed to accept it. That meant the race was officially a tie, which Virginia state law requires to be determined “by lot” ― through such random processes as picking a name out of a hat, drawing straws or flipping a coin. Lawyers for Simonds unsucessfully sought to get a local court to prevent the drawing, and said Simonds should be the election winner because the court that declared the race a tie failed to follow proper recount procedures. The day before the drawing, Simonds asked Yancey to agree to accept its results, but he declined. It’s unclear whether the drawing will be contested.

    "text": "Tucker Carlson is taking his role as the new Bill O’Reilly on Fox News seriously. This guy, who was born in San Francisco then went to an elite private school in Rhode Island, has decided he is the voice of rural white America. His Fox News show serves a daily dish of reverse racism claims, blame on Obama or Hillary, disparaging comments about immigrants and typical nonsense stories found on Breitbart. Tucker Carlson’s recent topics include: With every segment, Carlson gives his typical blank stare into the camera signaling he might not actually believe all of this nonsense but the paycheck from Fox News is worth it. So I’m not surprised this guy will say anything to make a buck. After all, he was the editor of the hot garbage that was the Daily Caller. But his latest guest had my blood pressure boiling, my eyes rolling so hard they popped out of my head and rolled down the hallway and my voice hoarse from screaming at the computer alarming people in the coffee shop. With a banner headline reading “Major Websites Attack White People,” the two whitest people in the United States discussed racial relations. Tucker’s guest, Chadwick Moore, claimed that black people are looking for racism in everything and that’s why we find it. It’s not that racism actually exists; it’s that we seek it out so we can be victims of it. It’s the victim-blaming mentality on steroids and mayonnaise. Chadwick told the story of a discussion he had with a young, upper middle class black woman who claimed she had been discriminated against and he asked “what if you lived for one day as a white woman and people were just as rude to you?” Chadwick’s claim was so ridiculous Tucker actually paused before he went back to his clueless blank stare. Let’s overlook the irony that two white guys named Tucker and Chadwick are claiming black people are obsessed with victimhood while they run a banner claiming white people are victims. And pretend that Chadwick knows one black woman who would actually have a discussion with him. I will go with his premise that I, a black woman, walk a mile in a white woman’s shoes. For starters: I’m sure white women have to deal with misogyny and sexism like all women but so far I’m enjoying walking in a white woman’s shoes even Ivanka’s stolen designs. Look, black people would love to live in a United States that didn’t see our color first but that is not reality for black people especially black women. It never has been in this country and with the rise of the alt-right I doubt it ever will be. Frankly, if I did as Chadwick claimed and walked a mile in a white woman’s shoes; Chadwick would call the cops and claim I stole them.

    "title": "Washington Political Nerds Line Up At Midnight For Michael Wolff's Explosive Trump Book",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Dozens upon dozens of political obsessives lined up inside a bookstore in the nation’s capital just before midnight on Friday to be among the first to own a copy of an explosive new book about the Trump administration that President Donald Trump didn’t want them to read. Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House was released ahead of schedule, following a Trump attorney’s cease-and-desist letter attempting to block dissemination. But the D.C. bookstore Kramerbooks & Afterwords ― which, to borrow an overused phrase, is located just blocks from the White House ― is open until 1 a.m. That meant it could begin selling copies of the book when the clock struck midnight. “It might not be available in a couple of hours,” joked Liz, who works for the National Park Service and didn’t want to give her last name. Liz, decked out in full winter gear to combat the frigid temperature outside, learned she could grab a copy of the book at midnight the way most people here did: Twitter. She tried to convince her husband to join her. He wasn’t into the idea. But Liz “thought it would be fun,” she said. “A nice protest.” Wolff, a controversial author who has chronicled the lifestyles of the rich and famous in New York City, obtained extraordinary access to Trump’s White House, and walked away with blockbuster stories that have figured prominently in political news for the past couple of days. “For the past, what, 24-48 hours, this is all people are talking about,” said 25-year-old Phillip Carlisle, sipping an Allagash White beer as he stood in line waiting for his copy. “It seems like a mess.” Wolff’s track record for accuracy has been disputed, and there have already been a few factual issues identified in the book. Liz guessed maybe 90 percent was accurate. Carlisle speculated maybe 70 percent. But the fact that it’s plausible that such craziness happened should be concerning, he said. “I think that the fact that we’re not sure how much of it is true and we won’t immediately be sure how much of it is true or false should be very disturbing,” Carlisle said. He pointed to a parody tweet from @pixelatedboat that purported to be an excerpt from Wolff’s book. The fake excerpt included a quote from a (non-existent) White House insider claiming that Trump watched “the gorilla channel for 17 hours straight,” often kneeling four inches from the screen and and speaking to the gorillas. “I think he thinks the gorillas can hear him,” the fake “insider” said in the made-up quote. Wow, this extract from Wolff’s book is a shocking insight into Trump’s mind: pic.twitter.com/1ZecclggSa “People believe it!” Carlyle said of the fake excerpt. “Because it’s so believable.” Ryan Greeney, 38, who works for the U.S. Army, drove in from Springfield, Virginia, to buy the book. “I realized I live in one of the few places that has this as an option,” Greeney said. “So why not, I’ll see what’s going on.” Greeney said he thinks the “overwhelming gist” of the book is “generally true,” even if some some details here and there got lost in translation. “In a dispute over truth, I’m probably going to believe the author,” Greeney said. Kramerbooks sold out of the book shortly after midnight. Jane Vallinas, 28, was one of the unlucky who arrived too late. She said she’d been “glued to the Internet” for the past few days reading about the book, and was hoping to check it out. “My parents are really big Republicans and this has been a really weird time, and I’m hoping this pushes some people over the edge, to reality,“ Vallinas said. “I was planning on staying up all night.” She’s still pumped about getting her own physical copy of the “juicy” book, and said she planned to wake up early on Friday to hunt for a copy at another store.

    "title": "Washington State To Offer Non-Binary Option On Birth Certificates",
    "text": "Washington state residents will soon be allowed to identify as “male,” “female” or “X” on their birth certificates. On Thursday, the state’s Department of Health announced the groundbreaking move, which will take effect on Jan. 27. According to the department’s website, “X” is defined as “a gender that is not exclusively male or female, including, but not limited to, intersex, agender, amalgagender, androgynous, bigender, demigender, female-to-male, genderfluid, genderqueer, male-to-female, neutrois, non-binary, pangender, third sex, transgender, transsexual, Two Spirit, and unspecified.” The policy will allow residents to make changes to existing documents, but does not apply to newly issued ones (in other words, birth certificates for newborns). Adults wishing to change the identity listed on their birth certificate will no longer need written documentation from a doctor to do so. However, minors will require parental consent and medical documentation. GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis was among those to praise the state’s move. Ellis pointed to a 2017 survey finding that 20 percent of millennials (defined as people between the ages of 18 and 34) identified themselves as LGBTQ. Meanwhile, the poll also found that younger people were more likely to identify outside of traditional gender binaries than people from older generations. Given those statistics and America’s current political climate, Ellis said, “It is vital that states catch up and acknowledge the reality of the non-binary community.” “With LGBTQ people and especially trans and non-binary Americans under attack daily by the Trump Administration, as evidenced by [President Donald] Trump’s efforts to block trans Americans from serving in the military and rescinding of Title IX protections for trans students, designation ‘X’ is a powerful and reaffirming sign that our identities cannot and will not be erased,” Ellis told CNN. Washington will follow Oregon, which became the first state to offer a non-binary option on birth certificates on Jan. 1. California will follow suit in September when its law, Senate Bill 179, takes effect. That bill passed in October.

    "title": "We Must Thwart The Rising Oligarchy In The United States",
    "text": "Not far from the state of Texas, a fraudulent election was very recently held and stolen. The Honduran electoral commission recently certified that Juan Orlando Hernandez became President after widespread reports of irregularity and fraud. It was the culmination of a trend decades in the making in Honduras, one final and dramatic blow to democratic governance that came on the heels of decades of worsening inequality, increasing concentration of corporate power, and creeping authoritarianism. The Organization of American States is right; we need a new election in Honduras. But more than that, in the United States have to acknowledge that we are seeing our future when looking at the political climate in Honduras, if we don’t recognize the early warning signs and do something about it. Honduras has become a deeply unequal society. According to an analysis by CEPR, more than 63 percent of Hondurans are either unemployed, underemployed, or working for less than the minimum wage. But that didn’t just happen overnight; it came after decades of rubber-stamping legislation by the Honduran government giving away windfall profits to massive corporations at the expense of most working people. It was a systematic takeover of government by the wealthy, and an intentional effort to make life harder for the poor in order to secure more for the rich. Labor unions were dismantled, and corporations wrote the laws. The tax fight this week showed us that the United States is clearly on that same course. A single family ― the Walton family ― owns as much wealth as the bottom 40 percent of Americans combined. Wealthy elites write our laws, own our newsrooms, and seek to use their influence to secure even more in profits. That economic reality is deeply tied to why a right-wing politician was able to override the will of the people in Honduras. Only when such a vast gap in power and influence exists between most people and the uber-wealthy in any society, can the one percent ram through legislation that deeply harms the lives of most people in that society. Over the past few months, it has become clear just how many Americans deeply oppose the tax bill passed by Congress this week. Still, because of the sheer economic and political power that’s wielded by the wealthiest one percent in our society, legislation that harms the overwhelming majority of people in the United States was passed. That should frighten us all, because the fundamentally undemocratic exercise of power by the wealthiest to override the will of the majority is exactly what just happened in Honduras.

Log in to hide these messages. Representative government rests on the premise that government serves the people. When that stops being true, and when the powerful can override what most people want, the potential for undemocratic abuse is absolutely immense. In Honduras, at least 22 demonstrators have been killed, mostly by state security forces, since the election. Police and military kill their own neighbors without consequence. That’s because undemocratic oligarchy has become the norm, and has convinced those in power in Honduras to believe they are rulers, instead of servants. In Congress, we are speaking up loudly and clearly against U.S. support for the Honduran regime, as we have since the coup, because the futures of our two nations are deeply tied. In March, I helped lead the reintroduction of the Berta Cáceres Human Rights in Honduras Act, H.R. 1299, sponsored by Rep. Hank Johnson, which demands an immediate suspension of all U.S. security aid to Honduras and requires the U.S. to vote no on loans from multilateral development banks for the police or military of Honduras. But we’ve also got to recognize the creep of oligarchy against democracy here at home, and fight against it by outlining a bold, forward-looking vision for our future that includes everyone.

    "title": "What Can Go Wrong For Democrats In 2018? Quite A Lot",
    "text": "First published in The Boston Globe. Doubtless Donald Trump should fear November 2018. Historically, incumbents flounder in off-year elections. His approval rating is abysmal; a majority of Americans question his fitness to serve; his base of support seems fixed. Democrats detest him; independents distrust him. His sole legislative accomplishment — so-called tax reform — is widely viewed as favoring corporations and the wealthy. For Democrats, what can go wrong? Quite a lot. Because the real question is: What can go right for Trump? Start with the Democrats’ structural problem. In the House, gerrymandering and demographic sorting protect the GOP. By expert consensus, only 35 to 40 of 435 House seats are competitive. As of now, Republicans hold 239; the Democrats 193. To capture the House, the Democrats need 218 — a gain of 25. The Senate is even harder. Each state gets two seats, regardless of population — because of demographic sorting, more states are red than blue. Republicans now hold a 51-49 majority. Of the 34 seats being contested in 2018, the Democrats are defending 26 — including two independents. The GOP is defending a mere eight: only three — Nevada, Oregon, and Tennessee — seem vulnerable. But three Democratic seats — North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana — are shaky. If these are the seats in play, Democrats must run the table to win control. Granted, Trump’s current weaknesses could undermine the GOP’s impressive electoral fortifications. But public opinion is seldom static. The general distaste for Trump persists despite a decline in unemployment and a rising stock market — in which many Americans now have a stake. By November, more voters may be inclined — reasonably or not — to give Trump credit. Almost inevitably, his tax law will become somewhat more popular. In the next few months, many Americans will get a modest bump in take-home pay: the law’s more regressive effects, and its potential to explode the deficit, won’t become politically salient until later. If the overall economy stays relatively benign, as many economists expect, Trump will tout his tax measure as an indispensable component of prosperity. Thus the Democrats’ most universal talking point, economic equity, may lose resonance. Much the same is true of the GOP attack on Obamacare — the worst consequences will be most widely felt after 2018. Other key components of the political zeitgeist — polarization and a general distrust of both parties — could also benefit Trump. If he floats a more bipartisan agenda — infrastructure being the most obvious — Democrats must decide whether to cooperate or, for ideological and political reasons, oppose. The Republican version of infrastructure spending may be short on federal dollars, and long on tax credits, frustrating Democratic hopes for a substantial upfront investment. Moreover, the party’s base voters are bitterly opposed to cooperation with Trump. Thus the chances of bipartisan agreement appear dim. In the case of no compromise, Trump could benefit by complaining that Democrats frustrated his efforts to rebuild America. With respect to more volatile issues, such as restoring DACA or the Child Health Insurance Program, Republicans will seek to take these off the table — or blame Democrats should their efforts fail. Here Republicans may founder, strapped to a leader many Americans find exhausting. But many voters find fatigue more numbing than infuriating. If their lives seem good enough, familiarity may breed passivity. True, Democrats have the passion; in typical off-year elections, turnout rules. But by exclusively focusing on Trump, they risk personifying hysteria untethered to a positive vision. A party so disconnected from power has no persuasive national spokesperson or program, and impotent preelection threats of impeachment could drive Trump’s loyalists to the polls. Trump may have to outdo himself to reanimate mass horror. Nuclear peril could suffice, or a catastrophic land war on the Korean Peninsula. The Mueller investigation could expose Trump as a knowing pawn of Russia or, more immediately, a president so desperate to avoid exposure that he provokes a constitutional crisis. If one credits the considerable evidence that Trump colluded with Russia, obstructed justice — or both — that seems likely.

Democrats need to offer average Americans a positive vision for their lives, choosing strong issue-driven candidates who can win close contests while building for the future by reaching more voters across the country.

    "title": "What John Lott Gets Right",
    "text": "If there is one name which creates anger and hostility within the gun violence prevention (GVP) community, it’s not Wayne LaPierre, head of the National Rifle Association, it’s John Lott. His book, More Guns, Less Crime, has become the Magna Carta for the pro-gun movement and his argument that armed citizens deter violent crime is immediately cited in any public debate involving the regulation of guns. So before I go any further, I’m going to let you in on a little secret. It’s not that I necessarily agree with anything John Lott says. But what the GVP community does not acknowledge is that the data Lott uses to make his argument is not only essential for understanding gun violence; it also should serve as the primary source for crafting effective laws and regulations to keep guns out of the “wrong” hands. One quick example. The GVP research community insists that it’s not more legally-owned guns which reduces gun violence; it’s more legal constraints on gun ownership. Again and again, well-meaning GVP researchers look at gun-violence rates, compare these rates with gun regulation, and find a positive connection between both. My state, Massachusetts, is rated as one of the most regulated states; it also ranks near the bottom of all 50 states when it comes to injuries from guns. The largest city nearest me, Springfield, has an annual gun violence rate at least three times the national average; the adjacent town, Longmeadow, hasn’t been the location of any kind of gun violence for God knows how many years. What does state-level data on gun violence tell you about the differences between Springfield and Longmeadow? Nothing. And since the data doesn’t illustrate the difference in violence between those two jurisdictions, how could any law be effective which applies equally to both? Lott’s argument about legal, armed resistance to crime may be based on all kinds of statistical models which can be shown to be inadequate or worse, but at least he has done what no GVP scholar has yet attempted to do, namely, to use locally-based data which can sometimes illustrate the difference between gun violence in communities within the same state. Last year Lott published data which gives murder numbers for every county in the United States. What did the data show? That even at the county level, the extreme locality of gun violence begins to disappear the moment you examine the problem beyond the particular neighborhood or street corner where the violence occurred. The lack of geographic specificity found in GVP research is equally evident in explanations about racial differences found in the population injured by guns. Brookings says that “gun violence varies dramatically by gender and race,” the data showing that death rates for black men are twice as high as the death rates for whites. Where did Brookings get their data? From an article published by a group of public health gun researchers which says exactly the same thing.

How can anyone take seriously a comparison of similar behavior between two racial groups who experience such dramatic differences in socio-economic status as whites versus blacks? When you compare gun-violence rates in communities with different racial demographics but the same or similar socio-economic trends, gun-violence rates based on racial categories begin to disappear. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where a majority of the residents are black, last year the per-100,000 homicide rate hit an all-time high at 21.5. In Acadia Parish, which is mostly white, the homicide rate every year runs around 25. Finally and most important, whenever Lott is criticized by a GVP researcher, he responds at length on his website and either reproduces or references the criticism from the other side. I have yet to see a single critique about Lott’s work which extends him the courtesy of a response. If the GVP community really wants to find some kind of “middle ground,” it will only happen if both sides contribute their thoughts in the same space.

    "title": "What Should You Say To Kids When Their Fave YouTube Stars Cross The Line?",
    "text": "Prompt kids to think more deeply about the ethics of outrageous YouTube stunts. By Caroline Knorr, Common Sense Media “Terrible.” That’s what we said when YouTube gamer PewDiePie was found to have racist and anti-Semitic videos. “Tragic.” That was the reaction when a Minnesota woman fatally shot her husband in a YouTube stunt gone wrong. “Shameful.” That was the combined response to YouTube vlogger Logan Paul’s broadcast of a dead body hanging in Japan’s so-called suicide forest. But what’s clearly offensive to parents is a big gray area for kids ― especially when it’s one of their beloved YouTube celebs. The site’s anything-goes attitude, stars who feel like personal friends, and ― frankly ― parents’ disapproval only strengthen kids’ connection to their favorite personalities. Still, it’s important to discuss the outrageous behavior they’re seeing and hearing about. Why? Because, next to you, YouTube is one of the most powerful influences in their lives. While there’s plenty of good stuff happening on YouTube, it’s not surprising that its stars push the boundaries of good taste. For one, they’re mostly young, unfiltered, and bound to make some very public mistakes. Also, the more extreme the antic, the more page views they get, which can translate into millions of dollars. Here’s the way these things usually go: A YouTuber does or says something totally shocking; half of the internet erupts into outrage; and the other half rushes to the YouTuber’s defense. The offending video is taken down ― but not before people flock to the channel to see what the controversy is all about. To complete the cycle, the YouTuber issues an apology video. Along the way, the YouTuber increases his or her notoriety, racks up tons of views, and miraculously strengthens their fan base. Google may give them a slap on the wrist, but it also gets a percentage of the hosts’ ad revenue ― which is bolstered by the page views ― making it seem as though no stunt is too extreme to film for public consumption. Even after his offensive videos were discovered and Disney dropped him from a planned deal, PewDiePie is still one of the highest-paid internet stars. It’s a process lots of parents recognize as sensationalistic and exploitive. But kids feel protective of YouTube and its stars. YouTube is their go-to for news, pop culture, and trends. The hosts introduce them to cool, trendy new stuff, from video games to makeup and fashion. YouTubers bolster this connection by collecting followers on all social media, including Snapchat, Twitter, and Instagram, sharing intimate secrets, and even making personal appearances. Parents tend not to watch it as much, and kids feel like they “own” the platform. So when you throw shade on YouTube, kids can take it personally, and it can feel like a criticism of them. Here are some ways to open a discussion about YouTube so your kids won’t shut down: Talk about the way YouTube works. YouTubers earn money based on their number of page views and subscribers. The more page views, the more money. Often, this “attention economy” means saying or doing outrageous things for attention ― even negative attention. Ask: Do you think YouTubers have to go to extremes to attract views? Is Google responsible for helping YouTubers make money off crazy pranks? Do you think it’s OK to watch people get hurt or do risky things? Should advertisers pull their support when YouTubers cross the line? “While there’s plenty of good stuff happening on YouTube, it’s not surprising that its stars push the boundaries of good taste.” Talk about YouTubers’ influence. YouTubers influence kids more than traditional celebritiesbecause of the close relationship they forge with their fans. Brands such as Pepsi, Doritos, and Taco Bell love partnering with YouTubers because it makes them look cool and increases awareness even when the YouTubers behave inappropriately. Ask: Would you be more likely to want a product that’s endorsed by a YouTuber? Would you boycott a product endorsed by a YouTuber who released offensive videos?

Log in to hide these messages. Talk about safety. YouTubers ― including the guy who cemented his head into a microwave ― have shown that they are willing to do almost anything in the competition for page views. It’s important for kids to see the aftermath of such stupid pranks, like the press conference by the emergency team who had to forgo helping people with legitimate medical issues to rescue that doofus. Say: Don’t ever do anything illegal or dangerous! And make sure your friends don’t either. Talk about sticking to YouTube’s good stuff. From Minecraft tutorials to cooking shows, there are lots of good shows on YouTube, as well as positive role models. Help younger kids make playlists of channels you’ve pre-approved and encourage them to get your permission before searching around on YouTube, which can bring up stuff that’s not appropriate. Ask: What subjects are you interested in? I wonder if they have a YouTube channel for that. Also, ask kids to tell you about their favorite YouTubers who don’t do icky or risky stuff. Talk about where you draw the line. Lecturing about how offensive some YouTubers are will probably fall on deaf ears. (Kids may even doubledown on their support for the offender so they don’t look bad for liking someone who messed up.) Instead, simply state where you stand on such content. You want your kids to get the message that you trust them to make good decisions on their own. Say: I won’t watch shows where people risk their safety or make light of something really serious, like suicide or violence.

    "title": "White House Lawyer Misled Trump To Prevent James Comey's Dismissal: Report",
    "text": "A White House lawyer intentionally misled President Donald Trump last year to try to stop him from firing then-FBI Director James Comey, according to a New York Times report on Trump’s attempts to control the Justice Department’s Russia investigation. The Times learned of the deception after reviewing documents and interviewing White House officials and others with knowledge of the incidents. EXCLUSIVE: Mueller's Investigation reveals details of how Trump had WH counsel lobby Sessions not to recuse; how a WH lawyer tried to mislead the president about whether he could fire Comey; Preibus notes corroborate some of Comey's claims. https://t.co/OxhitbBfg2 Worried about Trump’s apparent determination to fire Comey, White House Deputy Counsel Uttam Dhillon sent a junior lawyer to look into any laws that would prohibit Trump from ousting the FBI director last spring, the Times reported on Thursday. Dhillon, who was concerned that Comey’s ouster could spark an investigation into whether Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, had previously told the president he would need cause to fire Comey. But even after the lawyer’s research revealed that the U.S. president has the legal authority to dismiss the FBI director without stating a reason ― as was confirmed by a 2014 Congressional Research Service report ― Dhillon withheld that conclusion from Trump. Dhillon “was convinced that if Mr. Comey was fired, the Trump presidency could be imperiled, because it would force the Justice Department to open an investigation into whether Mr. Trump was trying to derail the Russia investigation,” the Times reported. Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, told the Times that Dhillon’s withholding of that information was “extraordinary.” “This shows that the president’s lawyers don’t trust giving him all the facts because they fear he will make a decision that is not best suited for him,” Vladeck told the newspaper. Trump ended up firing Comey in May, even though he was leading the investigation into whether the Trump campaign had colluded with Russia during the presidential election. In his dismissal letter, Trump told Comey, “you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.” While presidents have the authority to dismiss FBI directors ― who serve 10-year terms and often overlap administrations ― it is rare for one to do so. Comey is only the second FBI director to be formally terminated by a president. The only other FBI director to be fired was William S. Sessions, who was ousted by President Bill Clinton in 1993 after an internal ethics report alleged Sessions engaged in ethical abuses while serving in office. Dhillon, the White House deputy counsel, had served as the chief oversight counsel for the House Financial Services Committee since 2014 when Trump appointed him to the White House legal team a year ago. Dhillon had also worked as the associate deputy attorney general in the Justice Department from 2003 to 2006. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "text": "It appears that a conversation between Whoopi Goldberg and Tiffany Haddish is as blunt and hilarious as you’d imagine. Haddish spoke to The New York Times on Tuesday about her big year, sparked by her breakout performance in the summer comedy “Girls Trip.” The conversation eventually turned to the subject of Haddish’s history-making hosting gig on “Saturday Night Live” in November. The actress, who had auditioned three times to be a player on the iconic sketch show, became the first black female comic to host — a fact Haddish herself could not believe. She told the Times that she did a little Googling and discovered that Goldberg had appeared on “SNL” before. Haddish decided to contact the comedian for a little advice. “I said, ‘Have you ever done “SNL”?’ Haddish recalled asking Goldberg. “She said, ‘Only a sketch.’ I said, ‘You never hosted?’ And she said, ‘You the first, bitch, you better do a good job.’” Thankfully, Haddish aced the challenge right out the gate.

    "title": "Why Free College Tuition Is Spreading From Cities To States",
    "text": "Students at the University of Michigan. Kalamazoo Promise, which has sparked a free tuition trend, covers four years of tuition at any public college or university in Michigan or at 15 private colleges in the state. By Marsha Mercer To churn out more workers with marketable skills, an increasing number of states are offering residents free tuition to community colleges and technical schools. The move also is a reaction to fast-rising tuition costs — increases that stem, in part, from states reducing their financial support of public colleges and universities. Morley Winograd, president of the Campaign for Free College Tuition, a Seattle-based nonprofit, described the movement as “the fastest-growing policy idea in the country” — one with bipartisan support. “Everybody’s got cheap dirt — but do you have skilled workers?” Winograd said. “That’s the question states face as they recruit new industry.” But the free tuition push hasn’t produced an economic bonanza for any of the pioneering cities—at least not yet — and some states have struggled to come up with the money to keep their end of the bargain. The free tuition trend began in 2005 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, which launched a privately funded effort to combat its economic decline. The movement has quickly spread: Today roughly 200 localities offer young residents free tuition to local community colleges and technical schools. In the past two years, 12 states have enacted legislation to join them. The state rush to offer free tuition began with Tennessee in 2015, but other states quickly followed. Arkansas, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island have started programs, and Nevada plans to launch one this year. California and Montana last year enacted legislation to create programs but have yet to appropriate funds. Delaware and Louisiana also offer somewhat more restrictive free college scholarships with additional requirements, such as a minimum college aptitude test score or a clean record. Free tuition plans typically promise students a free ride if they meet certain requirements, such as maintaining a certain GPA. Most plans only pay for tuition, so students must cover fees, books and other costs. Most of the programs are “last dollar,” which means a student must obtain and use federal aid, such as Pell Grants or other scholarships, before the program kicks in to cover the rest. Some states, such as Arkansas and Kentucky, limit their programs to students in selected fields. Arkansas only awards grants to students focusing on science, technology, engineering, math and other subjects employers most value. This year, Work Ready Kentucky is limiting aid to students studying health care, transportation and logistics, advanced manufacturing, construction, and business services and information technology. “Clearly we’re seeing a lot of momentum right now,” said Dustin Weeden, senior policy analyst with the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, an advocacy group based in Boulder, Colorado. ‘Drive to 55’ Tennessee’s stated goal is to make sure that 55 percent of Tennesseans have a college degree or certificate by 2025. The state started by offering free tuition for two years of community college or technical school to every recent high school graduate in the state. The state in 2016 revised the program to allow a greater number of older adults to attend any of the 27 Tennessee Colleges of Applied Technology for free, starting in this coming fall. The state pays for the programs through an endowment started with $300 million in excess lottery revenue. The program operates on interest from the endowment. Tuition at four-year public colleges has risen 35 percent since the 2008 school year, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington. In Tennessee, per-student state funding at public colleges and universities declined 18 percent from 2008 to 2016, and the average annual tuition at public colleges and universities rose by more than $3,000 during that period. Since Tennessee launched its free tuition program, applications and enrollment at the state’s community colleges have soared. More than 33,000 Tennesseans have attended college free. Higher education is now a part of Tennessee’s sales pitch to potential employers, said Mike Krause, executive director of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission. “I can absolutely tell you it figures in our conversations,” he said. Although he could not point to a specific employer won by free college, Krause said: “There’s a buzz now about education that wasn’t there before.” Mixed Results But in Kalamazoo, a dozen years of free tuition have yielded mixed results. Kalamazoo Promise, which is funded by anonymous donors, covers four years of tuition at any public college or university in Michigan or at 15 private colleges in the state. Students who attend Kalamazoo schools every year from kindergarten through 12th grade receive all tuition and fees paid; those who attend grades nine through 12 receive 65 percent of their costs paid. Tim Ready, a sociology professor and director of the Walker Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnic Relations at Western Michigan University, said the first nine years of free tuition, which cost donors $54 million, was “marginally beneficial but not a slam dunk” for Kalamazoo’s economy. “We had the Great Recession, which makes it hard to determine what the effect of Kalamazoo Promise on the economy has been,” Ready said. Other factors, such as a new university medical school, have played a role in the slowly recovering economy, he said. Ready believes that free tuition is “necessary but not sufficient” to create economic impact. Between 2005 and 2014, the city’s public school enrollment grew by almost 25 percent (though the number of low-income kids receiving free lunches also increased). Kalamazoo now has more college graduates, and the erosion in its population has stopped. “Kalamazoo Promise probably did help mitigate the decline in the central city area,” Ready said. But he cautioned that the progress “is not reaching everybody. There’s a lot of income inequality here.” In Oregon, which also offers each participating student $1,000 for books and other expenses, the challenge has been finding money to keep the program going. Oregon Promise, established by the Legislature in 2015, scrambled after its first year, 2016-17, when lawmakers, while increasing funding, appropriated less than needed to continue the program in its original form. Demand had risen more than expected. The Legislature increased funding from $10 million in the start-up year to $40 million in the next two-year budget, but that was still $8 million short. To compensate, the state set stricter income eligibility limits for new students (current students were grandfathered in). “That word — promise — is what makes the program really galvanizing,” said Ben Cannon, executive director of the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission. “States should be very careful about making promises they may not be able to keep,” he said. “When the program has to compete every year or every other year with other worthy needs in the state budget, legislators can find other priorities more compelling.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

We were in the middle of a San Francisco f*** fest that started on a nude beach and ended up with coffee and more flipping in his apartment near the Castro. The year was 1981, and within a year the memory of our evening terrorized me like knives falling from the ceiling. By 1985 Todd was dead; by 1988, the year I took my first HIV test, half of my friends and lovers had died. I’d moved to New York, and had been inexplicably spared. I started using condoms religiously after my last night with Todd (even in serious, committed relationships), a practice I continued until two years ago. When I first started PrEP it was half-experiment, half-dream. It seemed too good to be true, as I’m sure most of my peers would agree, and I didn’t know if, despite tremendous evidence of success, I’d ever be comfortable with a condom-less sex life. Anyone who lived through the plague understands the haunting feeling of even suspecting the latex broke. We’d never have unsafe sex again. We’d never feel the pleasure of skin inside of skin. It was one more sacrifice in a world of getting less than we deserved. I’m not complaining, because we were the lucky ones. “Undetectable” is yet another miraculous achievement on the road to a more fulfilling, stress-reduced sex life, for everyone involved. We’ve come to a point in gay sex where “Positive” means “Discussion,” and little else. PrEP is doing the same for condoms. “Bare or Safe” is now “Raw or Wrapped.” I no longer use condoms and I have no regrets. Evidence now suggests that, if you take PrEP daily, as I always do, the risks of HIV infection is roughly the same, or lower, than condoms, and I’ve rediscovered a world of pleasure denied to me for more than 30 years. I’m lucky to have high testosterone levels, but even in my twenties the rubber was often a boner kill, and there have been so many times partners and I settled for oral sex or jerking off. The last time I put a condom on, in the fall, at his rightful insistence, the mood vanished faster than Trump’s brain at a science fair. I made the decision to go completely condom-less soon after, and the rewards are great. Sexual gratification has heightened exponentially — the best it’s ever been — and any partner I’m with has to be comfortable with my choice. I would never encourage an unsure lover to “Trust me: I’m on PrEP.” I’m aware that PrEP doesn’t prevent other STDs, and that’s something I’m willing to accept. (For the record, the only STD I’ve ever contracted was from oral sex with no swallowing, a practice that most of the ardent safe-sexers didn’t give up during the worst of the AIDS years.) My PrEP use means I’m required to test for HIV every three months, a great way to know that I’m always up to date on my status. It also reminds me that I need to be careful about STD contraction, and that the best way to achieve this is to practice restraint. Your sex life is your business: As for me, I don’t PNP, I avoid ‘Pump N Dumps’ because I find them unfulfilling and a bit depressing, and I may be on Truvada but if you think I’m a whore that’s your issue, not mine. Since I’m the Top 90 percent of the time, I haven’t had a man finish inside of me since Todd back in 1981. I’m still uncomfortable with the notion of being a PrEP Bottom, but when I meet the right man, the one who makes me feel comfortable, I’m sure I’ll be fine. There will always be men from my generation — and a few from the next — who don’t believe in a condom-less sex life, and probably never will. I understand and I respect their choice. If they judge me for mine, we’re probably not a good fit. Slut-shaming only works if you’re susceptible to worrying about what others think of you. The gay men I grew up with sacrificed so much — rights, families, lives — that returning to fantastic sex is one more deserved stop on the road to equality. Sure, it’s possible I could contract HIV. It’s also possible an air conditioner could fall on my head. It’s time to let go of irrational fear and enjoy, once again, the joys I truly learned at 17.

    "title": "Why I Accused Israel Of Cultural Genocide",
    "text": "Between Christmas and New Year’s Day, I became embroiled in what The Jerusalem Post termed a “Twitter war” which they claimed “raised eyebrows on both sides of the Atlantic.” What started the heated exchange was my response to a tweet by celebrity chef Rachael Ray in which she called “Israeli”—“meze, stuffed grape leaves, hummus, beet dip, eggplant and sun-dried tomato dip, walnut and red pepper dip, and tabouli.” I hadn’t intended a war, but my blood boiled when I saw Ray’s tweet and so I tweeted a response—“Damn it! This is cultural genocide. It’s not Israeli food. It’s Arab (Lebanese, Palestinian, Syrian, Jordanian, etc). First, the Israelis take the land and ethnically cleanse it of Arabs. Now they take their food and culture and claim it’s theirs too! Shame.” (I should note that this wasn’t the first time that Ray became embroiled in a situation that involved a negation of Palestinian/Arab culture. Back in 2008, she appeared in a TV ad for Dunkin’ Donuts sporting what appeared to be a keffiyeh. After a barrage of attacks by right-wing Islamophobes who said the scarf was a symbol of “murderous Palestinian jihad”, Dunkin’ Donuts cancelled the ad. Because that entire affair evolved so rapidly and the company reacted so quickly, we were unable to offer a rejoinder. The recent flap, however, “cut to the quick.” I had to reply. And so I did. The responses to my tweet were immediate involving attacks by prominent American and Israeli columnists and the head of an American Jewish organization. Most criticisms were downright silly, some were threatening (demanding that I be expelled from the Democratic Party), while others were just crude insults (“ludicrous”,“anti-Semitic bigot”). All of them missed the point. The silly ones either wanted to reduce the entire brouhaha to “who invented hummus” or confused cultural exchange and sharing with outright appropriation. No, I noted, making pizza or spaghetti in the U.S. is not cultural genocide, unless the U.S. were to occupy Italy and then claim these foods as “American.” And, I responded to the foolish tweet by New York Times columnist, Bret Stephens, that if I used Instant Messaging or Waze (both of which were invented in Israel) I would not be engaging in cultural appropriation, unless I used them, then claimed these tools as my own, and started referring to them as Lebanese inventions. Of course, I recognize that a significant number of Israelis come from Arab countries and I realize that they brought their cuisine with them from Yemen, Iraq, Morocco, Egypt, etc. But that doesn’t make Yemeni, Iraqi, Moroccan, or Egyptian dishes “Israeli”, any more than pizza, tacos, sushi and fried rice can be called “American” simply because Italians, Mexicans, Japanese, and Chinese brought them to the US. And no, my argument is not anti-Semitic, nor does it imply a rejection of the existence of Israel. In fact, what prompted my reaction was Israel’s denial of a Palestinian people, appropriation of their land and now of their culture. With the creation of the State of Israel, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled and denied the right to return to their homes and properties. The new state then confiscated their businesses and lands and demolished 385 Palestinian villages. As Yousef Munayyer noted, it was Israel that sought to systematically erase Palestinian history—“Place names, street names, historical markers were changed. Forests have literally been planted above the ruins of our villages, obfuscating the very remnants of our history and the grave of our ancestors.” So this “Twitter war” was never about the denial of Israel’s existence. It was about Israel’s denial of Palestinian existence—a process that continues today within Israel and, in an increasingly aggressive way, in the occupied West Bank. For example, Bethlehem’s Jabal Abul Ghneim, a once green hill to the north of the town, has been confiscated by Israel and walled off from Bethlehem’s residents. It is now the site of the illegally built Jewish-only colony of Har Homa (that houses almost 20,000 Israeli settlers), and has been incorporated into what Israel refers to “Greater Jerusalem”. It was, therefore, not “who invented hummus” that caused me to react. Rather, it was Israel’s appropriation of Palestinian land, eradication of their presence, and now the effort to be the sole claimants of their culture that prompted my response to Ray’s “Israeli food” tweet. This was cultural appropriation by conquest. I have long connected this Palestinian reality to my experience growing up in Central New York State. Once the home of the tribes of the Iroquois Nation, traces of their history and culture were always with us. Some towns bore Indian names. Families would vacation at the fashionable Mohawk resort. As children, we would dress up as “Indians” at Halloween. And as Boy Scouts we learned “Indian dances” and competed to achieve the status of the “Order of the Arrow”. All the while, the remnants of that once powerful people were locked in poverty on a nearby reservation. Their children were taught to deny their heritage and customs and learned the lesson that when they asserted their rights, they were reviled with epithets like “damn Redskins”. Another personal experience comes to mind: Four decades ago, my children went to a Halloween party at the elementary school they were attending in suburban Washington. I remember how upset they were that other children were dressed as “Arabs”, some carrying oil cans or toy guns. A few weeks later, the school hosted an “ethnic festival” and asked the children to dress in their ethnic attire and to bring food representing their heritage. Because of their Halloween experience and the taunting they sometimes endured, my children said they would go to the event, but were hesitant to dress up or bring anything that would associate them as being of Arab descent. At the event we noted a table set up with a card saying that it was “Israeli” featuring hummus, baba ghanouj, and tabouli. Behind the table was a young girl in a lovely embroidered dress—the pattern of which was unique to Ramallah. And so what troubled me then, and still troubles me, are the parallels with the Native American experience. Their land had been taken, their history and rights were denied, and now their culture was claimed by the very people who dispossessed them. This according to Article 8 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is termed “genocide”. If Israelis and Palestinians are to coexist in peace—and I pray they will—it must be based on respect. That means that efforts to eliminate the Palestinian reality must end, their rights must be recognized and restored, and respect must be shown to all of the cultures that now mix in the Holy Land—Israeli Jewish (from lands East and West) and Palestinian Arab.

    "title": "Why I Regret Plucking My Unibrow To Get Modeling Jobs",
    "text": "For some, a lipstick is just a lipstick. But for others, it’s a source of strength, creativity and expression. In our series Power Faces, we’ll explore the relationship between strong women and the makeup they choose to wear — or not. Our eighth subject, Scarlett Costello, is a model and student living in New York City. I love my eyebrows now, but to be honest, I don’t really think of them. I was born with a unibrow, so these are just my eyebrows, you know what I mean? But I did start waxing them at a really young age, probably in sixth or seventh grade. My mom is a hairdresser, so I grew up in a salon basically my whole life. I’d be there with her after school, and the waxing woman, who’s my mom’s friend, would wax my eyebrow because I was embarrassed of it. Then in high school I just became a lot more confident, and became attracted to things that no one else had. Like with clothing, I liked to dress like no one else would — I just like the individuality of it. I did end up feeling, like, why didn’t I just embrace it? The real answer is that for a long time I had to pluck it for modeling. I signed with Ford Models at a young age, so it was better for modeling jobs. But it’s also been going well since I started making my brows kind of my “thing.” Bushy brows have definitely become more of a trend, too, but I’m not going to lie, some days I do want that perfect “Instagram” brow, just for a certain look. But that’s the fun thing with makeup — you can fake anything. Life Imitates Art I’m a painter, so makeup for me is another way of creative expression. When brands started expanding with more bold colors and textures and things like that, I was attracted to the idea of bringing those artistic aspects to my own face. I feel most like myself with makeup when I have everything in front of me and can just go crazy with the colors, no time limit, just explore. Other times, I’ll just straight-up do art on my face — something different, definitely not an everyday look. The thing I notice about my own work and my face is that I feel like my art crosses over. I really understand how a face works, and I feel like I can draw eyes and eyebrows and lips really well because I do draw that on myself. I go to art school, so I’ve learned a lot about color theory and certain shadowing and techniques so there’s overlap there. I love coordinating my makeup to my outfit, too; it’s part of my style. Blank Canvas I don’t wear makeup every day. I always give my skin a break if I feel like it’s starting to get irritated, and a lot of times I go to school early in the morning so I don’t have time to do makeup. It’s a good going-out thing for me. I can’t go a day without the Anastasia Beverly Hills brow gel, though — the clear one. I’ve gone through, like, seven tubes of it. I’m a really big fan of the Glossier concealer, but I use it all over my face, more like a foundation. My go-to look is just kind of a “no makeup” makeup look. I’ll do the concealer, bronzer, put the same bronzer in the crease, my clear brow gel, and maybe lip gloss, or just lip balm. When I go home to California, where I grew up, I wear a lot less makeup, especially because I’m usually there in the summer. But in New York, I feel like you can be anyone. You can do anything crazy and there are always events or things to go to. I’ve had a lot more fun doing makeup in New York. Pro Tips I love working with makeup artists on shoots. I’ve been on sets for a long time so I’ve grown up with that, and I’ve learned about so many different little tips and tricks and products. Every makeup artist is different, and everyone sees your face a different way. I think every human sees their face differently than other people do, so what I think works best on me isn’t necessarily what other people think works best on me. The other day, a makeup artist prepped my face by just massaging coconut oil into my skin for a really dewy look, and then she was using a Tata Harper serum that she buffed into my skin with a brush. Literally the day after, I went and bought a little foundation brush to buff the Boscia face oil I use every night into my skin at home. I love picking up tricks like that — I’d never seen someone do it before, and I was like, “Oh my god, I have to do this now.” Face Time Putting on makeup is definitely a ritual for me. I always sit on the floor in front of my big mirror and just play with things. Sometimes I’ll turn on a show or something, but usually I play music. I’ve been listening to so much Abba lately, it’s insane. The 10 minutes right before I go to bed at night is another ritual for me. That’s the skin-care routine, and that’s a whole different deal. It’s very thorough, and I’ll put on music and light a candle. My roommate, who’s my best friend, is also obsessed with skin care, so we’ll do our routines together. It’s really cute; I love it. I feel so empowered by makeup. It helps me overcome a lot of insecurities, like when I go through those periods and my confidence is low. It can really pull you out of a certain mood when you’re feeling down. It’s not even about wearing makeup to make me feel more beautiful. It’s just the act, just kind of sitting down and caring for your own face and being tender with yourself, then being proud of the outcome.

    "title": "Why Jeff Sessions Hates Stoners (Or Secretly Loves Them)",
    "text": "So Attorney General Jeff Sessions (a.k.a. the most powerful prosecutor in the US) sent a memo Thursday to all federal prosecutors telling them to ignore the Cole Memo. The Cole Memo was created under Obama’s administration and is what has protected states that are marijuana-legal from federal prosecution, since possession, distribution, growing, and usage is still illegal under federal law. Marijuana is categorized as a Schedule I drug. The criteria to be a Schedule 1 drug is that it has no medical benefits and basically only causes harm. Heroin, LSD, and ecstasy are all Schedule 1 drugs. Jeff Sessions’s memo will allow federal prosecutors in states that already legalized marijuana to now prosecute marijuana users, sellers, growers and possibly prescribers as they would prosecute a heroin dealer or user. Currently, eight states and Washington DC legalized recreational marijuana and 28 states have legalized medical marijuana. So what is this little evil elf’s deal? Sessions has been anti-marijuana for his entire career and has consistently voted to increase penalties for drug offenses. He’s of the school of thought that harsher punishments reduce crime. We know that this is not the case, and anyone who can look at the war on drugs from a macro, socioeconomic perspective recognizes this. Sessions also believes that marijuana is a gateway drug. When Sessions was appointed, I was sick to my stomach knowing that in his worm-chewed, dementia-slop-brain, he believes in this anachronistic, anti-research, god-fearing “logic”. Or… maybe he just chooses to believe it because it lines up nicely with the ideals of his campaign contributors. So the thing that is scarier to me than the actual Sessions memo is that his highest campaign contributors are the Koch Brothers and military defense contractors. What on earth does that have to do with reinstating antiquated marijuana laws, you ask? Well, Sessions is a supporter of private prisons and expanding the militarization of police officers. In case you forgot, last February Sessions overturned the DOJ’s position under Obama of no longer contracting with private prisons. This is some real shit, y’all. Oh, and you know the type of inmate private prisons house? Federal inmates. PRIVATE PRISONS WILL DIRECTLY PROFIT FROM THE SESSIONS MEMO. (And the privatization of county prisons is becoming more and more common). The fact that this is this so transparent and yet there’s no public outrage may be the bigger issue than this article, but man oh man, are we looking at a potentially really dark, really scary Hellworld future (And this is coming from someone who has tried to stay positive about our current state of affairs). Listen, I’m feeling a little lazy and I don’t feel like spending a few hours totaling all the contributions I can find that Koch Industries have given to Sessions, but in 2016 alone they gave him $40,000. How are the Koch brothers tied into enforcing anti-marijuana federal law? Not only do the Koch’s give money to politicians, but they also fund ALEC and sit on the board. ALEC is a group of corporations that get together, write bills that will directly profit them and hand these bills to their minions in congress to do their bidding. The Koch brothers have written and approved bills for congress (and passed by congress) to privatize prisons, to put more people in prison. Because private prisons can only profit if they’re full of inmates. It’s not surprising that Trump also went back on his word about the Cole memo. When Trump campaigned, he said he wouldn’t enforce the federal law, however he apparently changed his mind. Press Secretary Huckabee said recently that Trump is completely for enforcing the federal law. Luckily, many senators already have spoken up against Session’s memo, and they have a strong case. Plus, public opinion is pro-marijuana. Currently, a whopping 64 percent of American’s approve recreational marijuana. There are undoubtedly more pros than cons when it comes to legalized marijuana. The point of this article isn’t to list the benefits of legalized marijuana, but just real quick- my favorite point of legalization- it keeps people out of jail. Yes, yes, yes, we need to figure out how to combat the institutionalized racism that keeps people in jail for marijuana offenses, but that’s a different article. How can we fight back? Stay woke. Look up who your federal attorney is. Write to their office, call their office, tell your friends and neighbors that this issue is bigger than just some stoners being paranoid that they feds are outside when they’re smoking a j.

    "title": "Winter Storm Hitting East Coast Could Shatter All-Time Cold Temperature Records",
    "text": "A powerful winter storm continued bearing down on the eastern United States on Wednesday evening, bringing frigid temperatures, snow and ice to parts of the country that rarely see such weather. “Bitter cold and dangerous wind chills” as far south as the Florida panhandle and as far north as Maine are expected to persist into the weekend, the National Weather Service said Wednesday evening. There is a probability that the “bomb cyclone” will bring at least four more inches of snow to parts of the region by Friday night, the agency warned. Cold temperatures earlier this week have already left several people dead, with The Associated Press reporting at least a dozen deaths and Reuters reporting eight deaths. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Wednesday evening that schools would be closed Thursday. But some National Weather Service outposts in southern states said precipitation had subsided. Snowfall has ended at @iflyCHS, where a storm total snowfall of 5.3 inches was recorded - the third highest daily snowfall amount on record. 1.2 inches of snowfall was observed at @fly_SAV, the 7th highest daily value on record. #scwx #gawx “The snow, sleet, and freezing rain are over, but the next few days will stay very cold!” the National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Florida, said Wednesday evening. This was the first time the city had seen measurable snow, though totals ranged from trace amounts to half an inch. The Weather Channel said temperatures in the Florida capital were lower than those in Anchorage, Alaska. A portion of Interstate 10 in northern Florida shut down due to the extreme conditions, also causing both the Charleston International Airport and the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport to close down. Parts of Niagara Falls had also frozen over by Wednesday. All day Thursday meteorologists are going to be glued to the new GOES-East satellite watching a truly amazing extratopical \"bomb\" cyclone off New England coast. It will be massive -- fill up entire Western Atlantic off U.S. East Coast.

The Washington Post notes the storm will “in many ways resemble a winter hurricane” and said the event could be one of the region’s most intense in decades. It’s legitimately snowing (and accumulating) in north Tallahassee. pic.twitter.com/iKlUZDNsOm Forecasters also warned Wednesday evening that 1 to 3 inches of snow could fall from southern New England up to the Cape Cod Canal through Thursday evening. The worst blizzard conditions are expected in eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The entire state of Maine is susceptible to blizzard conditions, The Weather Channel noted, as are parts of southern New Hampshire and eastern Long Island. Winds in some areas are expected to blow between 30 mph and 50 mph, and will be especially strong over the ocean, where they’ll approach hurricane force. Arctic air mass will remain entrenched over the eastern two thirds of the country through the end of the week. Very cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills expected. Mashable’s Andrew Freedman noted that the storm could pull bitterly cold air down from the North Pole to parts of the Eastern Seaboard. Temperatures could drop low enough to shatter some records, Freedman wrote: “The cold weather that will result is going to be more frigid than anything that residents of the Midwest and East Coast have experienced so far during what has been an unusually intense and long-lasting cold snap. Instead of breaking daily temperature records, as dozens of cities have been, all-time cold temperature records will be threatened on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.” The weather should warm up by early next week, but the ongoing frigid temperatures could make the start of 2018 one of the coldest on record.

    "title": "Brutal Winter Storm Leaves East Coast Blanketed In Snow As Airports Slowly Reopen",
    "text": "A vortex of ice and howling wind left up to a foot of snow over parts of the Northeast on Thursday as the first major winter storm of 2018 barreled up the coast. Authorities throughout the region declared states of emergencies and canceled thousands of flights meant to ferry post-holiday travelers home. Almost no part of the Eastern Seaboard was spared from frigid temperatures that plunged well below freezing, and snow fell from New England all the way down to Georgia and the Carolinas. The National Weather Service in Boston said the worst of the storm had passed by Thursday evening, but left wind advisories in place through early Friday and the city canceled school for the second day in a row. Thousands of flights were canceled across the country on Thursday, and airlines pre-emptively canceled hundreds more on Friday. Despite the blanket of snow, New York City’s LaGuardia Airport had reopened late Thursday, and John F. Kennedy Airport was expected to resume flights early Friday. Transportation officials in Boston were also digging out the city’s train network and had restored service to several lines by Thursday evening. But the storm did not leave the region unscathed. At least three deaths were attributed to the weather in North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said Thursday afternoon. At least 17 deaths around the country have been blamed on cold temperatures in recent days, The Associated Press reported. In Boston, the storm dropped more than 13 inches of snow over parts of the city, left more than 24,000 people without power amid blizzard conditions and caused a massive tidal surge that threatened decades-old records. Massachusetts authorities reported multiple rescues of drivers trapped by waves of slushy water, and urged travelers to stay off the roads. “This is the first time I’ve ever seen the water come this high in the downtown area,” Joseph Finn, commissioner of the Boston Fire Department, told The New York Times. “The tough part of this is it’s going to repeat itself at 12:30 tonight,” during the next high tide, he said. #Breaking coastal flooding in #Boston ongoing - Atlantic Ave is surrounded. @nbcboston @NECN pic.twitter.com/RbQAglJcr7 Video and photos taken near Boston Harbor showed rivers of icy slush running down the streets. In other photos reportedly taken in the Cape Cod town of Barnstable, floodwaters could be seen surrounding a home and washing over a road. Similar sights were reported on streets between Boston and Plymouth. Rising water left many drivers trapped and needing to be rescued from their cars, authorities said.

The Boston Fire Department also shared photos on Twitter showing firefighters rescuing a man from a partially submerged car beneath an overpass.

In New York City, the National Weather Service warned of blizzard conditions throughout the day. The storm left around a foot of snow in parts of Queens and the Bronx, impairing travel. Residents of Manhattan and Brooklyn saw at least 9 inches of snow by 5:30 p.m. local time, and officials said snow gusts would continue throughout the night. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a winter weather emergency Thursday afternoon amid what he described as blizzard-like conditions in parts of the city, particularly in Queens. “These are tough conditions to move around in, so if you don’t need to be on the road ... you shouldn’t,” de Blasio tweeted. “Everyone needs to take this weather very seriously.” He warned at a news conference that frigid temperatures could continue for “days to come” after the snow stopped. Outside temperatures on Friday morning and Saturday night are expected to feel like minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, de Blasio added. According to WCNC, a station in Charlotte, North Carolina, roughly 5,000 homes and businesses were without power ― mostly in Currituck, Dare, Harnett, Pamlico, Rockingham and Wake counties ― as of around noon on Thursday. In Virginia, where a state of emergency was also declared, state troopers have responded to more than 200 traffic crashes since Wednesday night, Richmond station WTVR reported. No fatalities were reported. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and other officials up and down the coast urged drivers to stay off the roads. More than 90,000 people in Virginia and North Carolina lost power temporarily on Thursday, but officials said 90 percent of those customers would have power North Carolina’s highway patrol also said it has responded to more than 900 crashes. Officials issued warnings of black ice through the weekend, and urged citizens to check on friends and family and keep pets indoors. The powerful winter storm, dubbed “Grayson” by the Weather Channel, has been described by weather forecasters as a “bomb cyclone,” as it resulted from a rapid and rare plunge in barometric pressure. Satellite images of the storm showed that a dusting of snow had settled in regions that don’t often see such extreme weather. Although not an animated loop, here is another great shot from our new GOES east satellite. The storm has cleared the southeast states and you can easily see the snowfall it has left through Georgia and the Carolinas. pic.twitter.com/dCzjEWIGvD Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

In Tallahassee, where one local homeless shelter has been scrambling to accommodate people, temperatures were expected to dip into the 20s on Thursday night. Parts of central Florida experienced similar temperatures Thursday morning, the weather service reported.

    "text": "A woman who accidentally received the wrong lottery ticket from a cashier and decided to buy it anyway made the right move. Oksana Zaharov, 46, from Edgewater, New Jersey, was shopping in Manhattan when she asked a clerk for a $1 New York Lottery scratch-off ticket. Instead, the man unwittingly handed her a $10 Set For Life ticket. Zaharov noticed the mistake. “When the clerk handed me the wrong ticket I felt bad, so I decided to just go ahead and buy it,” the mother of two told the lottery in a press release. “I actually used the ticket as a bookmark for a couple weeks before I decided to scratch it.” Now she can buy a whole lot of bookmarks. Zaharov won $5 million to be distributed over 20 years, plus annual net sums of $172,068 after that for the rest of her life. Her stroke of luck went viral on Tuesday as news outlets learned of it. “I never win anything,” she told the lottery. “I was sure the ticket was fake. It wasn’t until I brought it into the office that I knew it was for real.” Zaharov hopes to take her family on a Bahamas vacation and plans to fund her children’s college education. HuffPost reached out to her ― and we swear it wasn’t for a loan but rather to see if she wants to comment on her win.

    "text": "A woman aboard a Spirit Airlines flight from Las Vegas to Detroit on Wednesday said a male passenger sexually assaulted her while she slept. Prabhu Ramamoorthy, a 34-year-old Indian citizen approved to live in the U.S. on a travel visa, was arrested at Detroit Metropolitan Airport and later charged with aggravated sexual abuse, The Detroit News reported. The 22-year-old woman said she was sleeping in the window seat and awoke to find her pants and shirt unbuttoned, according to the complaint obtained by the Detroit Free Press. She also said that Ramamoorthy was shoving his “fingers in her (genitals) and vigorously moving them.” She said he did not stop until she was fully awake. Federal prosecutors said that Ramamoorthy did this while he sat between the victim and his wife. The woman, who “appeared visibly upset and was crying,” immediately reported the incident to the flight attendants, who offered her a different seat, per The Washington Post. Ramamoorthy was arrested once the plane landed. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "The #MeToo Movement Looks Different For Women Of Color. Here Are 10 Stories.",
    "text": "The #MeToo movement and the ensuing combination of public penitence and denial from powerful men accused of harassment and assault has created an atmosphere of accountability and change. It’s made women be heard. Yet not all women feel included. Many women of color have been vocal about the fact that #MeToo hasn’t represented their stories, even though the movement was founded by activist Tarana Burke, who is black. HuffPost spoke with a number of women about how harassment and assault perpetrated against people of color can often involve fetishization, objectification based on race or ethnicity, and a host of other issues white women might not face, even as the victims are less likely to be believed. The lack of representation in the movement could be tied to larger structural obstacles related to speaking out as a person of color, said the women HuffPost interviewed. Yet women of color face harassment and assault at higher rates than white women. The women we spoke with mention being treated differently by men inside and outside of their own ethnicity or race, as well being influenced and affected by norms within their own cultures. They described fielding sexual innuendo and advances at work while dealing with cultural expectations to be compliant and quiet, or demure and sexy. Several women described feeling a lack of agency over their own bodies rooted in longstanding history. One told HuffPost that she stopped following a cultural tradition to avoid harassment. Besides sharing their perspectives, the 10 women below proposed ways to change workplaces, relationships and culture to be more inclusive. Read their stories below, as told to Jessica Prois and Carolina Moreno. Stories have been edited for length and clarity. Some sources have chosen to include only their first name and preferred not to submit a photo. “I've been called a 'China doll' ... What expedited my rise is I don’t want to deal with this bullshit.” I do business development, which is interesting for an Asian woman, and women in general. It’s a lot of men who know how to bro out and golf, so they get to the top. These are the senior decisions-makers. As an Asian woman in a more assertive role, it’s different. Growing up I was taught you shouldn’t speak out. White and male-centric, the industry is full of over-sexualizing women, Asian women even more so. I’ve been called “China doll.” I’ve heard a lot of politically incorrect slip-ups about my race and the stereotypical affinities and traditions tied to it. Another story is years ago, I was at a conference at dinner and met an executive from a large TV network. I thought, “Holy shit, this is the jackpot.” I also found his story inspirational. We exchanged cards and decided to meet for drinks. At first, we were talking about my company and my passion. Then he gave some of his backstory and said that his wife is Asian. And then he said he and his wife are in an open relationship. Then he invited me back to his hotel room. I didn’t go. But he was just very persistent and continued to text me. Part of me as a business developer wanted to continue this conversation. At the same time, I didn’t want him to think I was interested. I handed his contact and potential deal over to a male colleague. He never followed up. It’s interesting, because you’re emotionally vulnerable but you don’t talk about it. It can be an Asian thing to brush things under the rug ― to not necessarily make a stink about something. There can also be more of an expectation for Asians to act ladylike and timid and not have an opinion. What expedited my rise is I don’t want to deal with this bullshit. “When there’s a young black girl missing from the hood, that doesn’t make The Huffington Post. Report it — not just blonde girls. That will send a larger message and help address part of a larger problem.” It becomes more complicated with both acknowledging assault and reporting it for black women. There are so many variables at play. We have this mindset like we have to protect our black men. They suffer themselves from unchecked power in the hands of police. But we prioritize that like we don’t suffer the same abuse, and our pain is not prioritized. When victim and offender are black, it can be a lot more complicated. And then if it’s a white man who is the offender and who has obvious power, who is going to hear us? There is often lack of belief for black women, so there is a lack of reporting. Look at when Lupita Nyong’o, who has so much privilege and is wealthy and beautiful and famous, wrote about Harvey Weinstein — she is [one of the few] women Harvey questioned. People don’t believe us. Society dismisses black women on so many levels. People minimize our pain and don’t hear our pain. Growing up with older guys from the hood, they grab your butt or physically assault you in some way. I didn’t talk about it. I didn’t see it being addressed. I saw it happen to a lot of young girls. But it would sound like I’m trying to play oppression Olympics. When I try to say that for young black girls, it’s hard to come forward, it can be met with, “Do you think it’s easy for young black guys from the hood?” I get that, and that’s not what I’m saying. Even when you think about President Obama’s My Brother’s Keeper program for black males, it’s needed. But there needs to be something for girls from the hood. It all kind of ties in together when you talk about sexual assault. We need to hear more black stories. We can be more inclusive by making space for stories that usually get ignored. When there’s a young black girl missing from the hood, that doesn’t make The Huffington Post. Report it — not just blonde girls. That will send a larger message and help address part of a larger problem. I have faith that the conversation is moving in the right direction into 2018. The fact we are having this conversation gives me faith. “When I’ve gone on dates or am just hanging with people I don’t know too well, I usually hear something like “Oh, so you’re Latina, huh? So does that mean that…” and you know some whack-ass shit is going to come out of his mouth.” The first thing that pops into my head is how sexualized we, Latinas, are from such a young age. Growing up in a Peruvian household, and during my visits to Peru every year, I was always told to cover up if a man was coming to the house. It was something like “put a bra on, hide your body” because you are a young lady and if you put it out there then you are putting yourself up for harassment. It won’t be his fault anymore, it will be yours. That’s what they were saying, without saying it. I was told that at 10 or 11 years old. Thankfully, in my career, I haven’t ever been harassed or sexualized. But I have been as just a woman doing any old thing. When I’ve gone on dates or am just hanging with people I don’t know too well, I usually hear something like “Oh, so you’re Latina, huh? So does that mean that…” and you know some whack-ass shit is going to come out of his mouth after that, some sexual stereotype. Basically, they’re trying to ask if I’m some freak in the bed, as if Latinas are these sexual bombshells walking around just waiting to have someone ravish us. Like we’re waiting for a white man to come and save us. It happens all the time to me. Last year I was dating a white man, just casually; we were starting to get to know each other and we were making out, and he says to me: “Can you say something in Spanish?” And I was like, “This is the end of this date. This is not OK.” And he was like, “What happened?” I told him: “We were having a great time until you made me feel like a fetish right now. So I’m totally turned off.” That’s happened to me twice. I think one reason people sexualize Latinas so much is because of how we’re portrayed in the media. I recently took a road trip to middle America and noticed that some people have never even met a Latina before. Their first impression of how we are and act or who we are is through the media. We’re usually portrayed as crazy hot heads or hypersexualized women in red dresses. And when people see something over and over again, they start to think it’s real. I also think that we have hypersexualized standards of beauty within the Latino community. We do it to each other. People are just starting to be open-minded about different types of beauty, not just the olive-skinned Latina with long black hair and the tiny waist, wide hips, round booty and luscious breasts. “It’s an unfortunate thing to say there's a fetishization of Asian-American women among white hetero men ... So employers and everyone need to recognize: How are you disadvantaged by being an underrepresented voice?” It’s an unfortunate thing to say there is a fetishization of Asian-American women among white hetero men. Well, there is an Asian fetishization overall. When I think about the tech industry or advertising industry when I was in it, there really was a lot of noticeable behavior that I felt like was toxic. I see a lot of folks, especially Asian-American women, who are entering into marketing or PR with a mindset of wanting to be in a leadership function, and so much of the industry is about client relationships and wooing and being this approachable easy-to-work-with personality. There isn’t enough dialogue in the workplace for Asian women. For first-generation children born to immigrant parents, so much success is tied to education and our occupations we choose, and there is just a lot of pressure to succeed. We might choose industries related to the pressure we are receiving from our parents. These are the same industries that are occupied by the dominance of cis male individuals. So it doesn’t surprise me at all that there is friction there. So employers and everyone need to recognize: How are you disadvantaged by being an underrepresented voice? How are you also at a disadvantage being a woman of color? How are you at a disadvantage based on pre-existing stereotypes or nuances that your employer hasn’t been brought up to speed on? Ultimately, these are industries by white, cis, hetero men. Much of the success is related to proximity and relationship to this identity. For me, being an Asian, queer, trans, non-binary individual, so much of my existence is in resistance to that identity. I’ve only found my salvation through starting my own business. I speak on behalf of so many people who have started their own things. It’s because some of these places aren’t changing fast enough. A lot of people don’t know they are suffering or that they are being fetishized. Sometimes it doesn’t happen until it happens. But it’s always on on her to deflect it. That’s a lot of trauma that goes unrecognized. “We’re conditioned to think power never cycles to us ... That's why other movements or concepts like Black Girl Magic are important.” Being black and also from Africa, I would get a lot of “I want to get a little piece of chocolate” or “dark chocolate” references ― which is not flattering, because you’re being objectified. These terms stem from a white man in power being curious and never having been with a black woman — and there is an undertone of subordination. Being a woman in the workplace has its challenges. Then being a black woman doubles those challenges. And then when you’re thick or curvy, your curves felt like a curse. When black men see you, that’s the first thing they see. You’re objectified, you’re thick, you’re curvy, you have that phat ass, with a p-h. They think that’s a compliment. You don’t think you’re being seen in any other way. So white-on-black and black-on-black harassment all have different undertones, but it’s all harassment. Working in media, I was often the token. You just smile it off and laugh it off. It’s a tough industry to work in. There was a director when I first started out as a producer who harassed my coworker and me. He touched us inappropriatelyand often harassed us. Can you imagine if #MeToo had happened when we were working there? But you still just see more white women speaking about it. I don’t think black women are equally as empowered yet. I don’t think black women are running around saying “Me too,” even though the movement was started by a black woman. There is this different whole cultural issue that affects us. I just don’t know if black women have felt heard in such a long time. We lack the empowerment to come forward from a deeper place — it’s more than being a woman and more than shame. It’s not being raised to know there is power in speaking up. We’re conditioned to think power never cycles to us. Man, white man, different man, white woman, Hispanic women — at the bottom of barrel is black women. That’s why other movements or concepts like Black Girl Magic are important — it has allowed me and my friends to have something we could use as a source of pride, so it wasn’t like we had to rise to Oprah levels. I can be dancing or raising three or four kids and it’s Black Girl Magic. It’s something to latch on to that acknowledges our power, because it’s never been acknowledged — and everyone should acknowledge it. “The people that have come to the forefront of the \"Me Too\" movement have been cis white women in Hollywood. It kind of ignores the fact that the people who are assaulted and harassed the most are women of color, and we have no recourse.” As Dominican women, we’re hypersexed. The sex tourism industry on the island is huge, and it means that when we go to other countries, as soon as we say we are Dominican, we are assumed to be sex workers. I’m absolutely for sex workers’ rights, by the way ― but it just so happens that when you’re typecast that way, people feel they can be more violent towards you or are entitled toward your body. That it’s just what you deserve. It’s also because of historical factors, the Dominican Republic is where some of the early slave ships arrived in the Americas; it was the place of some of the early indigenous massacres. Colonists thought, “You’re wearing a little bit less than the women where we’re from, so you deserve to be sexually assaulted.” And that’s applied to both native and African women. That’s how we ended up mixed; it wasn’t some beautiful white and native love stuff. It was not “Pocahontas.” It was mass rape toward native women and toward the African enslaved women that they brought to Latin America and everywhere. Non-black Latin Americans hypersex Afro-Latinas as well. They just assume that I’m for sale or something: “I offer you this much to be my mistress.” Certain bodies are just not as protected as others, and that’s a historical thing dating back to slavery. Right now, the people that have come to the forefront of the “Me Too” movement have been cis white women in Hollywood. It kind of ignores the fact that the people who are assaulted and harassed the most are women of color, and we have no recourse. Even Tarana Burke, who started the movement, she did end up one of the people of the year for Time magazine, but they didn’t even put her on the cover. They put other white women on there. In general, I think we are seen as hypersexed and not assaultable because we are here to be assaulted, kind of. I’ve had people take way too many liberties with me, groping or whatever, and other people be shocked, and I’m like, “Really? Because it happens to be everyday.” It’s the reason I don’t go to clubs or bars anymore, because people come up to me and just grope me when I’m walking by. Or men just come up to me with no precedent for intimacy, getting really touchy-feely for no reason. There’s an assumption that I’m here for that because I am who I am. There’s also a difference in how I’m treated compared to lighter-skinned Latinas and other darker-skinned black women, too. There’s levels to it all. “My nickname was 'Hello Kitty' on set ... There are unions, but they’re even whitewashed, too. There’s no HR. It’s just friends hiring friends. So it’s about changing that structure.” My nickname was “Hello Kitty” on set. I mean, when I was younger, I truly liked Hello Kitty. Guess not anymore. When I worked on another set, someone said, “I want her to play with my chopsticks.” It doesn’t even make sense. I’m always a little fearful about what is being said. I guess the issue is that humans want to connect, and they don’t know how sometimes. And that’s how culture has shaped us as Asian women — as stereotypes. The crew who called me Hello Kitty wanted to connect with me in some way, but only know how to see me through one way — the way culture and media depict me. That’s why representation is important. Speaking up gets you in trouble. There are unions, but they’re even whitewashed, too. There’s no HR. It’s just friends hiring friends. So it’s about changing that structure to begin with. “I’ve learned quite early that our bodies are typically only sought after for pleasure, not love. So when a man reacts a particular way, he’s reinforcing what I already know — that my black body is a mere sexual object to him.” There has been the occasional “You Black bitch!” when turning down an advance. In cases like that, I’ve always brushed it off and kept it moving; not because it doesn’t bother me, but because as a black woman, I’ve learned quite early that our bodies are typically only sought after for pleasure, not love. So when a man reacts a particular way, he’s reinforcing what I already know — that my black body is a mere sexual object to him. This is not ahistorical either; Sarah Baartman, the Jezebel stereotype during slavery, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (a slave narrative) are all examples of how historically, black women were deprived of their sexual agency and their bodies used purely for the pleasure of the white men who owned them. Even now, Beyoncé is an overwhelmingly talented woman and yet, some folks can only see her for her body — remember the “Does she have a leg gap?” craze? It’s unfortunate that any of us have these experiences, but I am grateful that women aren’t hesitant to let the world know that it does and what they can do to prevent more of it from happening. “I used to wear bindi to work every day ― a ritual I soon abandoned for fear of being treated differently ... Part of the problem is that I don’t often see female Asian champions or role models.” Earlier on in my career, I used to wear bindi to work every day ― a ritual I soon abandoned for fear of being treated differently and awkward looks and questions I would get from my colleagues. It was an uncomfortable feeling being the only Indian women in meetings full of white men — and the fact that you stood out culturally made it very hard to speak up. Race is definitely a factor in addition to sexism. Because of cultural differences, you are often left out of conversations, as you cannot connect or relate to what is being discussed. I have not seen this much when I was an individual contributor, but as I moved to management role, I had to really work hard to learn and talk the talk so I could be a fit. Part of the problem is that I don’t often see female Asian champions or role models. Of the 1,500 employees in my organization, I have seen only one female Asian who made it to an executive level that I can connect with, which means you are pretty much on your own. Another reason is women do not speak up for fear of being perceived as too aggressive. And with English sometimes being a second language, it is hard to break the barrier. Having endured bias in my career, both in the work environment and outside, I have embarked on journey to help build a more diverse workforce by leveraging technology to be more inclusive. “It’s as if it’s just the culture and it’s just accepted. And there is a real sense of fear you feel, especially as a little girl, walking in the street.” This movement is really important, and I’ve wondered how people in our communities, the Hispanic community and black community, are going to raise our consciousness. Because sexual harassment and assault is so prevalent, it’s so intertwined in our culture, that it’s not even a thing. It’s like almost imperceptible at this point. As far back as I can remember, especially growing up in Washington Heights, you walk down the street and guys are talking crap like, “Hey, Mami.” It’s as if it’s just the culture and it’s just accepted. And there is a real sense of fear you feel, especially as a little girl, walking in the street. I remember one of the first times I was catcalled, I was in the sixth grade, I was 11 years old and was wearing a baseball cap, big 99-cent hoop earrings, and I remember it was like complete chaos ― me walking down the street. Older men were catcalling me and I was like, what is going on here? I’m 32 years old today, but I look like I’m 12. So imagine when I was 11, I was clearly a little girl. I used to work in the music industry; that’s where I got my start in public relations. There was definitely a boldness from men toward someone who was younger and more impressionable. I felt an aggressive flirtation and sexualization in the industry, more overtly from white men. From people who are respected in the industry. But it wasn’t alarming to me at the time because I was already desensitized, given my upbringing in a Hispanic community, because we experience catcalling and that type of sexualization everyday.",

    "title": "Yara Shahidi Compares Iran Protests With Black Lives Matter: We're All Interconnected",
    "text": "Comparing the ongoing anti-government protests in Iran to demonstrations in the U.S. like Black Lives Matter, actress and activist Yara Shahidi is urging Americans to consider just how interconnected the situation in Iran is to the U.S. experience. Appearing on “The View” on Wednesday, the 17-year-old “Black-ish” star, who is half African-American and half Iranian-American, said she hoped people would see the Iran protests from an empathetic and “humane perspective.” The U.S., she said, has a tendency of taking an isolationist approach when it comes to some global issues. But Shahidi said Americans may find they have more in common with the Iranian protesters than they may expect. “These movements [are] really connected to our own movements in the past, whether it’s the Black Lives Matter rallies that have been happening or the [2017] Women’s March,” she said. “So I think for me, it’s about showing support for the protesters and making sure people are safe, and understanding that this is part of our larger global community.” “It’s so much more than the Iranian nuclear deal, it’s so much more than these Trump tweets in favor for or against the government,” Shahidi continued. “It’s really about the people that are being affected. They’re in a very similar situation [to us]. They were sold an economic plan that didn’t benefit them — similar to the [U.S.] tax plan that’s happening now. We have to look at that interconnectivity.” Shahidi, who has family members living in the city of Mashhad where the protests began on Dec. 28, has previously expressed her support for Iran’s protesters, tweeting this message of love last week: Hoping all protesters, Iranians, and my fellow Mashhadies stay safe ❤️#IranianProtests Tens of thousands of Iranians are estimated to have taken to the streets in at least a dozen cities and towns since the protests began in Mashhad a week ago. Hundreds of protesters have since been arrested and at least 21 people have been killed in the unrest. The protests were triggered by discontent over rising food prices, Iran’s high rate of unemployment and the country’s stagnant economy, which has remained weak despite the historic nuclear deal in 2015, which lifted crippling economic sanctions in return for a scaling back of Iran’s controversial nuclear program. As the protests have escalated, some demonstrators have called for government reform and the ouster of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Reacting to the unrest in Iran, President Donald Trump has tweeted his support for the protesters on the ground, saying Iran is “failing at every level” and that it is “TIME FOR CHANGE.” Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE! Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who was re-elected last year, expressed disdain for Trump’s comments, calling him an “enemy of the Iranian nation.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "An Intersection Of Race, Masculinity, And Mental Health",
    "text": "Defying The \"Hard\" Masculinity Stereotype On a cloudy fall day, not unlike this one, my friend Roman* sat across from me in the living room of his small apartment, his face swollen with anger, despondence, and anger. He oscillated between exploding with a dozen different emotions at once, and seemingly feeling nothing. He called me after my many failed attempts at getting through to him for the past two weeks. We are both usually very busy with our professional aspirations, but when he didn’t respond to my usual texts checking up on him, I became uneasy. Roman and I have been friends for almost ten years. We met during a teenage summer, a friend of a friend who ended up becoming one of my best friends in just a couple of years. Like me, he is the eldest child for his single mother, shouldering responsibilities that began way before he was able to manage them. I have witnessed his evolution from fun-loving teenager to enterprising young man, always striving to be in a better position than he was born into. Yet, even with all of his tangible achievements in college and his steady career progression, his sense of self was noticeably fractured. He spoke with me intermittently about his struggles, constantly feeling unsure about how to get to the root of what he feels. Sometimes, he says that he feels nothing at all, numb to any positive or negative emotion. Today, he repeatedly punched himself multiple times. So hard that his confused facial expressions are amplified by the large black and blue bruises on his cheeks. His lips are bloodied and bruised from banging his face against his bedroom wall, and his knuckles full of scrapes and cuts. What started as a simple conversation with his recent ex-girlfriend, triggered his downward spiral into self-injury. From speaking with him, I gather that he was embarrassed, sad, heartbroken, lovelorn, and disappointed at the current status of his lovelife. Instead of actually being able to become aware, acknowledge, and just feel these emotions, he found himself in a fit of rage and aggression, shrouding his “weak” feelings with the only emotions that he is fully comfortable expressing. He was always considered to be the “man of the house,” and with the heaping responsibilities, he felt that he was always expected to put on a sturdy and strong face. Any intense emotions that his uncles taught him were not “manly,” were buried automatically under the cover of a sarcastic laugh or a shrug. He cannot recall crying after he was reprimanded by his mother for being upset about a mean-spirited classmate. He was told to stop “acting like a girl” and “man up.” The idea that boys and men do not cry nor do they acknowledge emotions that are considered weak, is as much rooted in patriarchy as misogyny is. Boys who are not encouraged to acknowledge nor evaluate their emotions, most often become men who are unsure of how to connect with their feelings, and are less self-aware. Boys who are ridiculed for showing emotions that do not show some signs of dominance, as anger, rage, and annoyance do, are placed on a path to become men who implode, explode, or a combination of the two. To be ridiculed for acknowledging or feeling through emotions is a starting point for an unstable mental and emotional well-being. In African-American and Caribbean communities, mental health has significant struggles in being a topic worth non-judgmentally delving into. The gap is even wider when factoring in an intersection of race, gender, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. According to the OMH, the suicide rate for African-American men in 2013, was four times the rate for African-American women. With widespread misinformation about mental wellness in the Black and Caribbean communities, there is a significant gap in acknowledgement of mental health issues, and treatment-seeking behaviors.

He revealed via a social media post that he has taken the initiative to check himself into a rehabilitation center, spurred by anxiety, depression, and suicidal urges. He admitted to having a “...raging violent storm inside my heart at all times.” Admitting that he constantly feels sadness, anxiety, and distrust is a snapshot of the struggles that many Black men face, unsure of how to process their feelings. His transparency has sparked a period of discussion and support for Black men and their mental health, even resulting in the creation of a hashtag to keep the discussion in one place. There are high hopes for the conversation and transparency by other Black men about their mental health will continue and create some change in the attitudes. You may also have a Roman* or a Kid Cudi in your life, a young Black man who is not sure how to process his emotions or work through his mental health issues. Keep an eye out for them, as well as for any simple recommendations that you can make to help them find the peace that they may be missing.

    "title": "Young, Gay And Living On The Street: LGBT Youth Face Increased Odds Of Homelessness",
    "text": "Homeless LGBT students say they often feel isolated and alone, and have a hard time finding a supportive network of peers. By Carolyn Jones Throughout high school and college, Alicia slept in cars, tents, friends’ couches, benches, on the bus, on the train and in group homes. Almost anywhere but a shelter. “My experience with shelters is that you’d go when it was raining. You’d go to San Francisco, wait in line and sleep on the floor, if you slept at all,” the serious, soft-spoken Oakland woman, who’s now 22, said last week. “It’s scary enough to be a young person there. But if you’re queer you just feel a lot more vulnerable. You definitely avoid them.” Alicia is still homeless but lives at a youth shelter in Oakland. She asked that her real name not be used to protect her identity. As the cost of housing continues to soar in California and elsewhere, an increasing number of young people have become homeless, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. Among those homeless, one group has it especially tough: Young people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. “There’s a myth of San Francisco as the ‘gay mecca,’” said Jodi Schwartz, executive director of Lyric, a nonprofit community center in San Francisco that serves LGBT youth. “It can be. But just for some.” The reality, she said, is that many LGBT young people end up on the street or in unstable housing. Many are there because they've been rejected by their parents, peers or society in general due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. One measure of how many are affected comes from Lyric. Of the 600 mostly LGBT young people enrolled in Lyric’s programs in San Francisco, 56 percent are homeless or have unstable housing situations and all are low-income. Across California and the nation, thousands of LGBT young people can be found on the street, in shelters or couch surfing with friends or relatives, said Schwartz and other experts. LGBT young people ages 13 to 25 are 120 percent more likely to become homeless than their straight peers, according to a national survey of 26,000 young people released in November by Chapin Hall, a University of Chicago research and policy center. And of the nation’s 1.6 million youth 18 and younger who were homeless at some point last year, 40 percent were LGBT, even though they represent only 7 percent of that youth population overall, according to True Colors Fund, a New York nonprofit that advocates on behalf of homeless LGBT youth. In California, the number of homeless children in K-12 schools overall has jumped 20 percent from 2014-15 to 2016-17, according to data collected by the California Department of Education. Based on questionnaires filed by their families, more than 200,000 young people were living on the streets, in motels, in cars, in shelters or crowded into apartments with other families due to financial hardship. While state data does not identify whether any of these students are LGBT, youth homeless experts said gay students are disproportionately represented. What drives LGBT youth to homelessness “is complicated, nuanced and difficult to classify,” said Barbara Duffield, executive director of SchoolHouse Connection, a youth homelessness policy nonprofit in Washington, D.C. Sometimes LGBT youth are abandoned by their families, or they run away from home because they feel unwelcome or abused after telling their parents they’re gay. And sometimes their sexual identity makes them feel disconnected, which can lead to other contributing factors for homelessness, such as drug abuse, depression, family conflict or chronic absence from school. According to a 2012 study by the True Colors Fund, Palette Fund and Williams Institute at UCLA, 46 percent of LGBT youth who were homeless or at risk of becoming homeless left home because of family rejection due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. Forty-three percent were forced out by their parents because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Thirty-two percent left because of physical, emotional or sexual abuse at home, and 17 percent aged out of the foster system. Neglect, substance abuse, mental illness and lack of affordable housing were among the other reasons LGBT young people became homeless. Nationwide, 25 percent of LGBT teens are thrown out of their homes at some point after coming out to their parents, according to a 2015 True Colors Fund survey of 138 agencies that provide services to LGBT homeless young people. Although that’s less common in urban, gay-friendly areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles, it still happens, Schwartz said. But, she added, it’s not sexual or gender identity alone that leads young people to live on the street or in shelters. It’s a kaleidoscope of factors, she said. “Every young person has a unique set of experiences and realities,” she said. “The more a young person has going on — if they’re poor, homeless, disconnected, feel oppressed because of their race or if they’re LGBT — you’re going to see increased barriers.” Alicia was in the foster care system starting at age 6 months, when Child Protective Services took her from her mother due to neglect. She was in and out of foster care and group homes in the East Bay Area most of her childhood, running away periodically to avoid abusive living situations. When she was about 12 years old she felt she might not be heterosexual, but kept it to herself. “I had to be very calculated about everything, especially about how I presented myself. I wanted to present myself as super tough and not a burden on anyone,” she said. “I didn’t want to give people another reason not to like me. I felt like I could never really be myself…I had to keep my guard up constantly. I felt pretty alone.” After graduating from an alternative high school, Alicia was awarded a scholarship to study at Mills College in Oakland. At the private women’s school, Alicia said she found a \"supportive queer community” and thrived academically, with double majors in history and urban education. But she kept her homelessness a secret. She couch-surfed, slept in cars and occasionally slept in a tent in nearby Emeryville. Because she never felt safe sleeping outdoors at night, she’d work graveyard shifts at stores and restaurants and sleep on park benches, buses or trains during the day — a much safer option, she said, considering that young homeless people, especially girls, are sometimes sexually assaulted or coerced into trading sex for food or money. Homeless people who are LGBT are especially vulnerable because they’re more likely to be victimized and engage in unsafe sex and have a harder time finding a supporting network of peers, according to the True Colors Fund. Alicia studied in the college library and computer laboratory, showered at the school gym and generally took life one day at a time. But by last year, the street life began to wear on her health, both physically and emotionally. When a close friend died, she decided she needed a permanent solution. Living on the street would eventually kill her, she said. She called Covenant House, a youth shelter in Oakland, and after three months on the waiting list was offered a bed. Covenant House is part of a national nonprofit system of youth shelters with several shelters in the Bay Area and Los Angeles. At the Oakland facility, residents can stay up to two years and receive medical and mental health services, job training, help finding permanent housing, links to education, help with financial planning and other services intended to get young people off the streets permanently. Ninety-four percent of Covenant House residents find stable housing and employment once they leave, said Noel Russell, Covenant House development officer. “It works,” she said. “But we just need more beds. We have 100 people on our waiting list and there’s thousands of young people in the Bay Area sleeping on the street every night. … No child chooses that. No child deserves that.” The first thing Covenant House offers new arrivals is sleep and regular meals — two things homeless young people are not in the habit of enjoying. Alicia said she was so accustomed to not sleeping or eating she could barely do either for the first few weeks she was there. But after a while she settled in, and staff suggested that because she enjoyed studying, she should apply to graduate school. She did and was admitted to the UC Berkeley School of Social Welfare, where she is working toward a master’s degree in social work. Her goal: to become a social worker so she can help other homeless young people. While she’s proud she survived and feels confident she’ll eventually find a well-paying job and permanent housing, she feels she missed out on a childhood and suffered unnecessarily for years. She can’t ride a bike, she never learned basic things like how to floss and she often can’t relate to her classmates. When they talk about their favorite Christmas rituals, for example, she remains silent. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "This Is Your Body On Dry January",
    "text": "In recent years, Dry January has become increasingly popular, with more and more people accepting the challenge to go booze-free for the entire month. It’s turned into something of a movement, with millions of participants worldwide every year. (There’s even an app to help people stay on track.) “Many people flock to dry January as part of this ‘new year, new me’ mentality,” Leigh Winters, a neuroscientist and holistic wellness expert, told HuffPost in an email. “I presume that some people are coming off a drinking bender — feeling like they enjoyed a little too much wine or beer over the holiday season. And for those who don’t abuse alcohol, it seems like an obtainable and easy New Year’s resolution that can put you on the path to better health.” Making it through Dry January is a significant accomplishment for many, but how does a month of no alcohol actually affect your body? We talked to several health experts and past participants to find out. Take a look at some of the potential benefits below: Alcohol dehydrates not only your body, but also your skin, said Debra Jaliman, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. If you’re an excessive drinker, you can develop a zinc deficiency, which can cause a histamine reaction that leads to facial redness and flushing, or rosacea, Jaliman said. Research shows that alcohol consumption is linked to a higher risk of rosacea in women. During Dry January, you may start to notice your skin looks and feels better ― but once you start drinking again, Jaliman said, alcohol will start to have a dehydrating effect within weeks. If and when you do start to drink again, Jaliman suggests drinking clear liquor like vodka. “It won’t trigger rosacea,” she said. It’s not surprising that alcoholic beverages contain empty calories. But Shauna Faulisi, founder of a Los Angeles-based wellness coaching service, explained that when you drink, the first thing your body metabolizes is the alcohol itself. “This means that all fat-burning will temporarily be put on hold,” she said, adding that consuming alcohol with a sugar-heavy mixer (think margaritas or a rum and Coke) adds even more unnecessary calories and has a negative effect on blood sugar. “When we have excess insulin in our blood, it can lead to a host of issues, including weight gain.” Research suggests that people who binge on alcohol at least once a month are more likely to be overweight. And anecdotally speaking, many who’ve participated in the January challenge say they noticed a drop in pounds. Just beware of the sugar crash: Faulisi notes that anyone participating in Dry January may experience cravings for sweets. She suggested filling that void with fats like extra virgin olive oil, coconut oil and avocado, as well as “above-ground” veggies like broccoli, asparagus and cauliflower, to help keep blood sugar levels in check. No more nightcaps. “Cutting back or eliminating alcohol can dramatically improve your sleep,” said Marc Milstein, a brain health researcher whose work focuses on the science of sleep. Milstein explained that alcohol destroys a brain stimulant called glutamate that helps keep you awake. However, when the brain notices this stimulant has been destroyed by alcohol, it starts making more. “This usually happens in the middle of the night,” he said, “and that making of the glutamate stimulant then wakes you up and ruins your night’s sleep.” Sacha Cohen, founder of a Washington, D.C.-based public relations company, plans to participate in Dry January for the fourth year this month. The 48-year-old said the biggest benefit she’s experienced is weight loss, but she’s also noticed she has significantly more energy. “In the mornings, I’m more apt to jump out of bed than slowly get up,” she said. “My focus is better. I just feel more upbeat.” Adriane Abraham, a certified personal trainer and CEO of a Florida fitness studio, considers alcohol consumption akin to not taking care of your car. “Your body is your vehicle,” she explained. “Drinking is empty calories [and like] running your vehicle on a spare tire. You’re going to be slower in general. You’re not going to function like that well-oiled machine. Taking 30 days off of drinking is going to show a person that hasn’t done this how well they’re going to feel.” Sometimes, after a stressful day, it just seems natural to grab a beer or a glass of wine to take the edge off. But research shows that alcohol can actually exacerbate anxiety in some cases. In the short term, alcohol’s depressant effect can make you feel better. Long-term, however, heavy drinking can lead to a host of medical and psychological problems, according to the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. So giving up alcohol for a month ― or longer, in some cases ― may have some positive effects on your mental health. There are clearly benefits to going alcohol-free, even if just for a short period. Lori Cheek, founder and CEO of the dating app Cheekd, has made Dry January an annual tradition, and loves it so much that she also goes dry for two weeks in August. “I do it every year and have so many stories,” Cheek, 45, said in an email. “I’ve become a pro at it and by the end of January I’ve lost about 10-12 pounds, have saved so much money, feel so alive, and my apartment [is] always spotless. Instead of heading to happy hour after work, I take myself to the movies and I work out twice as much. I’ve gotten other people on board to do it with me, so it makes it even easier when you’re doing it with friends.” However, Adam Splaver, a cardiologist in Hollywood, Florida, advises heavy drinkers and those who may have a dependency issue to talk with their doctors about their options. (For people in this group, the side effects of not drinking can include shakes, hallucinations, palpitations and high blood pressure, Splaver explained.) And if you feel like you have a substance use issue, you may also want to consider reaching out to resources like the NIAAA. Ultimately, for social drinkers, giving up alcohol for the month can do wonders for your overall health. “I encourage people to try Dry January if they’ve become social drinkers who are mindless about how much they actually consume,” Winters, the neuroscientist, said. “If you sit down and think to yourself, ‘how much and how often have I drank in the past month?’ and you’re unhappy or shocked by the true answer, going cold turkey is just one way to begin making more mindful and informed drinking decisions in the future.” Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

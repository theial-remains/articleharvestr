    "title": "27 Religious Groups Sue To Protect Immigrants From ICE Raids At Churches",
    "text": "More than two dozen churches, temples and other religious organizations are challenging President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration policy — and specifically, his decision to allow immigration enforcement agents to make arrests at places of worship. Twenty-seven organizations representing Jewish and Christian faiths say their congregations have experienced a decrease in worship attendance due to fear of Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the weeks since Trump reversed longstanding guidelines preventing ICE from making detainments in “sensitive locations,” according to a lawsuit obtained by HuffPost. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, alleges the Department of Homeland Security’s authorization to make detainments at places of worship violates the First Amendment, as well as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which curtails the federal government’s ability to restrict religious practices. “Every human being, regardless of birthplace, is a child of God worthy of dignity, care, and love,” the lawsuit reads. “Welcoming the stranger, or immigrant, is thus a central precept of their faith practices.” In a press release shared with HuffPost, Kelsi Corkran, who is representing the various religious organizations, says his clients united to challenge Trump’s policy because their teachings “offer irrefutable unanimity on their religious obligation to embrace and serve the refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants in their midst without regard to documentation or legal status.” “As Jewish leaders, we are mindful of our history as an immigrant people,” Central Conference of American Rabbis executive Hara Person said in a statement about the lawsuit. “Jews in the United States came as immigrants and so we have always supported and welcomed immigrants,” Person wrote. “The most often repeated command in the Torah is to care for the stranger because we were strangers in the land of Egypt — in this way our scripture and history compels us to work with and help immigrants and refugees.” “Welcoming the stranger is not a political act — it’s a sacred obligation,” said the Episcopal Church’s Julia Ayala Harris in a statement. “When immigrants walk through our church doors, they’re not entering as outsiders; they are stepping into the heart of our faith, where their dignity and stories are embraced as reflections of God’s love.” The lawsuit also alleges fears surrounding immigration enforcement have led to a decline of attendance in many of the social services that these religious institutions offer undocumented congregants, including food pantries and clothing giveaways, English classes, legal assistance and job training.

The faith leaders are asking the court to issue a permanent injunction prohibiting immigration enforcement activities at houses of worship or during religious ceremonies, unless agents have a judicial warrant or are operating under “exigent circumstances.” DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin addressed the lawsuit in an email to HuffPost, saying she expects immigration enforcement at sensitive locations “to be extremely rare.” She added that officers need a secondary supervisor approval before any action can be taken in locations such as churches and schools. “We are protecting our schools, places of worship, and Americans who attend,” McLaughlin wrote, “by preventing criminal aliens and gang members from exploiting these locations and taking safe haven there because these criminals knew law enforcement couldn’t go inside under the previous Administration.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "5 Foods To Avoid If You Want To Improve Your Focus And Concentration",
    "text": "ADHD aside, sometimes concentrating long enough to finish a work or school task feels impossible. You sit down at your computer with the best of intentions only to end up toggling between 10 different tabs because your focus is anywhere except on the task at hand. Anxiety, depression, not getting enough sleep and boredom can all cause trouble concentrating. But diet can also play a role. When it comes to this connection, registered dietitian Yaa Boakye told HuffPost, “It’s important to remember that individuals have different reactions to food and could be dealing with underlying health conditions.” With that disclaimer in place, there are some foods and drinks that scientific research shows can really mess with your concentration. Here, doctors and dietitians reveal the biggest culprits. If you have a big muffin or slice of toasted white bread for breakfast, you aren’t exactly starting the day with brain food. Neurologist Dr. Arif Dalvi shared that simple carbs — like the aforementioned examples — can lead to a blood sugar spike, which in turn can cause trouble concentrating. Boakye agreed, explaining that when blood sugar is too high or too low, it can cause trouble concentrating, and simple carbs can jump-start this unfortunate roller coaster. Boakye explained that while glucose — a type of carbohydrate — provides energy to brain cells, when glucose is absorbed in the bloodstream quickly (which is what happens when you eat foods like pastries and white bread) it creates a blood sugar imbalance. Scientific research shows that a side effect of this imbalance is … yep, trouble concentrating. Here’s the good news: Boakye says you can still enjoy pastries and bread without worrying if they’re going to get in the way of your productivity as long as you pair them with a healthy fat and protein source. “Healthy fats and proteins mitigate the extreme effects simple carbohydrates can have on blood sugar,” she said. So pair your pastry or toast with some avocado and smoked salmon and you’ll be good to go. Blood sugar levels aren’t the only thing that can cause trouble concentrating. Dalvi shared that salty foods can, too. That means if you have instant soup, french fries, potato chips, or a sandwich with cold cuts for lunch, you might struggle to power through the afternoon. Foods high in salt “can trigger an electrolyte imbalance,” he explained. When this happens, it causes inflammation in the brain, which can interfere with short-term memory and concentration. To avoid this from happening, stick to consuming less than 3,400 milligrams of sodium a day and remember it can creep up in surprising places, like salad dressings, condiments and processed cheese. Some people reach for a can of soda for a jolt of energy, but the doctors and dietitians we spoke to all said this is one drink that’s bound to backfire in the concentration department. That is because it impacts the brain similarly to eating pastries, white bread and other simple carbs. “Sugar-sweetened beverages like soda and juice can cause rapid increases in blood sugar, followed by a decline in blood sugar. So while these drinks initially flood the brain with glucose, which theoretically would aid in concentration, the subsequent sugar crash negates this brief benefit and actually makes it harder for us to maintain focused concentration,” said registered dietitian Claire Rifkin. If you want what you’re sipping on to work for you and not against you in the brainpower department, Dalvi says not to overlook regular old H2O. Fun fact: Water accounts for 75% of brain mass. “When you’re dehydrated, you’re disrupting the electrolyte balance in the body as a whole, including within brain neurons, so not staying well-hydrated can certainly affect your concentration,” Dalvi said. Even being just 2% dehydrated can negatively impact brain function. To keep your concentration up, aim to drink between 11.5 and 15.5 cups a day, depending on your gender and activity levels. Coffee is another drink many people turn to — even depend on — for brainpower, but Dalvi and Boakye both say that too much can make concentrating worse. “There’s certainly a U-shaped curve with coffee. If you drink a little bit, it can make you more alert, but if you keep drinking more and more of it, the benefits fade,” Dalvi said, noting this is because too much caffeine can make someone feel jittery or anxious. Boakye said it’s important to remember that caffeine affects people differently. For some people, even a small amount of coffee can cause them to become jittery, which can then cause them to have trouble concentrating. If you’re eating anything that’s causing you to experience gastrointestinal issues, all the doctors and dietitians interviewed said that is bound to mess with your concentration. After all, dealing with diarrhea is pretty distracting. Dr. Kevin Cooke, an internal medicine doctor at Aviv Clinics, told HuffPost that one common culprit is dairy. “When someone with a dairy intolerance consumes dairy products, it can trigger an inflammatory response in the body. This inflammation may affect cognitive functions, leading to symptoms commonly associated with brain fog such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness and confusion,” he said. If you experience gastrointestinal issues frequently and have a hunch that it’s food related but aren’t sure what the cause is, Dalvi recommends keeping a food diary, logging what you eat and how you feel afterward, including mentally. When it comes to diet and brainpower, Rifkin and Boakye emphasize that maintaining a balanced diet is key. This, both explained, will help prevent the blood sugar ups and downs that can come with just eating simple carbs and also ensure the brain is getting enough nutrients to function. Dalvi added to this, saying that brain cells need energy to function just like the rest of the body does. When you don’t get the nutrients you need, you’re bound to have trouble concentrating. So if you’re hungry, eat! Just make sure it isn’t something loaded with sugar or salt, or something that will give you tummy troubles. That way, your food really does serve as brain fuel and not something that will slow you down.

    "title": "A313 Is France’s High-Strength Retinol That You Can Get OTC — And It's 20% Off",
    "text": "The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Time and time again, dermatologists have told us how essential retinoids (like retinol) are to a well-rounded skin care routine, specifically one that’s geared toward premature skin aging prevention. This is because, according to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Rebecca Marcus, retinol increases cell turnover, thus helping to stimulate collagen production. When it comes to this powerful “active” ingredient, there’s an ongoing debate about prescription-only compositions. Marcus explained that they’re already in an active form that can be utilized by the skin, making their effect stronger and faster than OTC products. The other side of the argument insists that stronger doesn’t always mean better. Retinol, particularly prescription-strength, has a notorious reputation for causing irritation, especially for more mature skin, which Marcus said is more delicate. OTC retinol, on the other hand, can be less sensitizing and better tolerated, though potentially less effective. But, the Pharma Development A313 retinol cream from France, which features a distinctive texture and three different types of effective retinol, may be able to provide a happy medium between the two. Today, the larger 50-gram size of this cream is on sale at 20% off although we suspect it won’t be marked down for very long. ″[A313] contains minimal ingredients in its vehicle, which is helpful for those who are sensitive to fragrances or other ingredients that are commonly found in OTC retinol products,” Marcus said. And while she acknowledged the fact that the actives in A313 are not the same potency as the retinoid acid present in prescription-strength formulas like Tretinoin, “the three types of retinol in A313 are effective over-the-counter-strength retinol ingredients.” In fact, some users who had been using prescription-strength Tretinoin then made the switch to this alternative, say they prefer A313 and have maintained the same results that they had with the prescription-strength formula. Its distinctive occlusive texture is closer to a balm, which according to reviewers, can be more hydrating compared to other pricier formulations that you might find on the OTC market. The brand claims that the 2% retinol concentration can help unclog pores, minimize fine lines, reduce hyperpigmentation and even out skin texture. Reviewers agree that this lower strength hasn’t impacted A313’s efficacy and suggested adhering to a gradual and minimal application process in order to avoid redness or skin flaking, similar to the “tolerance building” period required for prescription retinoids. This period typically involves just applying a pea-sized amount one or two times a week for a few months before increasing to a more frequent application. (It’s always a good idea to check with your dermatologist to know if retinol is a good option for you.) “This works great!! Just give it a month. A few things you should know about this before trying and quitting using it. You have to use this on a completely dry face. It can sting otherwise. I wash, moisturize, then get ready for bed and about 5 min later put it on. I will be honest, it’s sticky like Vaseline and the smell is slightly off putting. Start slow. At first use it once a week for a few weeks, then two for a few more, then work your way up to more. No more than once every 2/3 days. I have decently sensitive skin and doing it that way caused no pain or tingles. I noticed a small change after one use, but after a few months I feel I’m aging backwards. I’m 47 and have been starting to notice old face skin things, but this has made me look and feel like I’m aging backwards. My skin has turned soooo soft and it’s only been 2 months! It’s expensive now but it lasts for months, so really it’s only about $10/month to make such a difference. We spend that much on a coffee or a cocktail and they do nothing for us! I’m not one who freaks out or does much for anti aging but decided to try this. It’s effective and way cheaper than Botox or surgery. Not that i would ever consider those. Just eat good for you foods, get outside, exercise a bit, smile some, and use this cream! You’ll be young “forever”!” — Amazon Customer  “This stuff is Ahhh-mazing but has went up a lil over $25 since purchasing last time May of 2024 when it was only $18.99. That’s crazy!!! And ridiculous!!! But I have been using this about 2 or 3 ties a wk since then. I combine it with the Amazon basics moisturizer that looks like the dupe for Neutrogena that way it’s not so harsh & doesn’t feel like complete Vaseline on my face. But It has helped so much. I make sure my face is completely dry before putting the mixture on to avoid redness & itching. It has definitely been like a magic potion because it has helped alot with my fine lines, few wrinkles I have, & even zits. I’m 43 & definitely do not look it. And sometimes I jus use it as a spot treatment for zits & it makes them better by like the next day. And my skin isn’t greasy the next day & so smooth, soft feeling. This stuff is jus Ahhh-mazing!!!! If u haven’t tried it you definitely should. It’s great but unfortunately is $44 now instead of only $18.99. And yes, the $18.99 was the original the same as this not any of the fake ones out there. It was by Pharma development jus like this with French writing on it jus like this. But definitely try this! 👌👌👌👌⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐😊”— Bfe Bound  “I have only used this a couple times, but already noticing a difference. There is definitely a learning curve in your face will itch when using it. A little bit of this product goes a long way. I am already noticing a difference in my wrinkles. Just be very careful not to overdo it and do not do this every night when you are starting off. Also do not do this during the day nighttime only.” — Sarah Fetrow  “I ordered else where and it was like lotion not the real stuff. So I decided to try here and it’s the actual stuff. It is like ointment so a little goes a LONG way. Just like any retinol product there is a retinization period so I do have minor itching. If you understand skin care you’ll know this is normal and should go away in a few weeks. It has a minimal smell but my face feels so soft and slowly gaining “youth”. I use it AFTER my regena light session.” — Angelique Armijo By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "New York Jets Reportedly Tell Aaron Rodgers They Are 'Moving On From Him'",
    "text": "Aaron Rodgers is still contemplating whether to continue his playing career. If he does, it appears it won’t be with the New York Jets. The team has told the 41-year-old quarterback it is “moving on from him,” Fox Sports reported Sunday. Rodgers said toward the end of the Jets’ 5-12 season he was undecided on his playing future, saying he wanted to take “a break mentally to kind of refresh and put my feet in the sand, and see where I’m at after that.” But there was uncertainty as to whether the Jets would even want to move forward with the four-time MVP as the team’s quarterback. The Jets recently hired general manager Darren Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn, and owner Woody Johnson said at their introductory news conference on Jan. 27 the new regime would have the final say in that decision. Glenn said he already had texted Rodgers and there would be discussions with him — as well as other players on the roster — in the near future. The new Jets coach also told reporters “this thing is not about Aaron Rodgers,” saying it’s a big-picture approach with the focus on the entire team. And apparently, the Jets will move forward without Rodgers. Fox Sports first reported that Rodgers met with the Jets in New Jersey and was told of the team’s plans. The Jets currently also have veteran Tyrod Taylor and youngster Jordan Travis, who spent his entire rookie season on the non-football injury list, on the roster. But New York has the No. 7 overall pick in the draft in April and could pursue a quarterback. Rodgers, the fifth player in NFL history to throw 500 touchdown passes in the regular season, has one year of non-guaranteed money left on his contract with the Jets. He would count $23.5 million against the salary cap. If Rodgers is cut or retires, the Jets could absorb a $49 million dead money charge next season unless they designate him a post-June 1 cut and can spread out that charge over two years. After spending his first 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, Rodgers was traded to the Jets in April 2023. His first season in New York was cut short just four snaps into his debut because of a torn left Achilles tendon. He worked his way back and was able to play this season — and start every game — but the results on the field were inconsistent. While his 28 touchdown passes and 3,897 yards passing both rank third for a single season in franchise history, Rodgers was not the dynamic playmaker he once was.

    "title": "CNN Host Abby Phillip Does Darndest To Inform Lawmaker That GOP Lied, And It's Kinda Funny",
    "text": "CNN host Abby Phillip went full throttle Monday to inform a Republican House member that a GOP claim she was regurgitating was false. In an exchange that bordered on the comical, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) appeared to support Elon Musk’s controversial infiltration of government agencies as the administration tries to cut spending. But she veered into the debunked Trump White House allegation that $50 million had been earmarked for condoms in Gaza. “You have these bureaucrats sitting at these agencies,” the lawmaker said in a video shared by Mediaite. “They come before Congress. We have hearings. We try to get to the bottom of where this money is going. Fifty million for condoms in Gaza, for example.” Phillip immediately tried to shut down the falsehood, but Malliotakis wouldn’t have it. “But these are real things,” the House member said. “These are actual line items,” she insisted amid crosstalk. Said Phillip: “Congresswoman, we know that there was not $50 million spent on condoms in Gaza.” Malliotakis appeared incredulous that “the White House put that out there as a false statement” and asked where the money went. “Congresswoman, I’m gonna blame the president who upped the dollar amount to $100 million. It is false,” Phillip said. “It was $50 million as far as I know,” the congresswoman shot back. “It is false,” an exasperated Phillip said. “The answer is zero. ... So you cannot use that as an example.” Several outlets have investigated the claim and found no evidence of such a budget item ― and the White House hasn’t offered evidence either.

    "title": "The Amount Of Time Kids Spend On Smartphones During The School Day May Shock You",
    "text": "Behind the door of every middle and high school bathroom in the U.S., you will find the same thing: a kid with their phone out, using their thumbs to scroll or type messages. Teens feel the same FOMO pull that we do to take out a cellphone and check to make sure that they haven’t missed something, and, just like us, they’ll tap open their screens at pretty much any opportunity: passing time in the hall, a trip to the restroom, a moment in class when the teacher is looking the other way and, almost certainly, whenever they see another kid using their phone. The yearning to scroll is contagious and can spread through a hallway, cafeteria or classroom in minutes. Educators, parents and even teens themselves agree that this constant source of distraction isn’t great for learning. Increasingly, they’re also concerned that staring at a phone during non-academic times, like lunch, is cutting into time that teens need to spend socializing and building relationships with peers. A new study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that adolescents spent an average of 1.5 hours of their 6.5-hour school day on their phone. This represents 27% of the 5.59 hours teens spent on their phones each day overall. Researchers “recruited a diverse national sample of adolescents, without any knowledge of the cellphone policies their schools had in place,” Lauren Hale, a professor at Stony Brook Medicine and one of the study’s authors, told HuffPost. Instead of students reporting their own screen time, researchers used a “passive sensing system,” Hale said. “We could see exactly which apps they were using, for how long and at what time of day. We used this data to home in on smartphone use during the school day,” she added. Fourteen days’ worth of data were included in the study. Over half of the teens spent at least 66 minutes of each school day using their phones, and a quarter of teens were on their phones for two or more hours while at school. The apps that teens used most during the school day were messaging, Instagram, video streaming, audio and email — suggesting that they’re using their phones to socialize virtually while in a building filled with other teens. Though the study did not attempt to measure the effect of teens’ phone use at school, Hale said that as an educator and a parent herself, she’s concerned about the implications, both academic and social. “School time is a time for learning, listening, reading, writing and real-world interaction. It’s a time to interact with peers throughout the day, which includes talking, joking, eating, sharing together,” Hale said. “I’m concerned that if you spend too much time looking down at your device, you are missing out on these beneficial aspects,” she added. Even when the disruptive calls and texts are coming from loving parents, they come at a price. The incessant possibility of contact can steal opportunities for teens to practice independence. Dr. Michael Rich, a pediatrician and director of the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital, said one concern is that by “having Mom or Dad in your pocket all day, asking how you are doing, whether they need to intervene with teachers or other students, the child never gets to figure out for themselves how to function as an effective, healthy and empathetic citizen.” At the same time, Rich said, phones — like the bulky desktop computers that preceded them — are tools that teens need to learn to use, and we all know that kids learn best by doing. “The fundamentals of using a smartphone can and should be taught in school,” Rich said. “Teach kids to use these tools effectively for what they do well and to turn them off when they are not the best tool for the job.” It’s worth noting that although phones are a problem at school, most teen phone use occurs outside of school hours. Parents share the responsibility for their children’s at-home use. “Asking schools to restrict use when it is not restricted any other time in a child’s life is not effective,“ Shari Camhi, superintendent of Baldwin Union Free School District, told HuffPost. “Schools have not given students smartphones. In many cases, the youngest of children are in possession of expensive and unrestricted smartphones,” Camhi said. The Baldwin, New York, superintendent, says that the circle of responsibility extends beyond parents. Noting that some of the apps teens access most are social media, Camhi said, “it’s essential to establish stricter regulations when it comes to such channels. Technology companies must be held accountable to the products they market to young people.” Most parents are unwilling to take phones away from their children altogether. They don’t want their kids spending school time scrolling, but they don’t want their kids to be too far from their phones either. “Most parents that I talk to unequivocally support a bell-to-bell ban on smartphones in schools,” Hale said. What a “ban” looks like, however, can vary tremendously from one school to the next. Some kids are allowed to keep their phones in their pockets, backpacks or lockers for the day. Some are expected to “park” their phones in a wall organizer or box in the classroom. Others are given a special locking pouch (Yondr is one company that makes these) that will open only in specific locations or by using a device. All of these scenarios have their pros and cons. Kids leaving class to text in the bathroom is one issue. Another is not having access to a phone in case of an emergency — which, in spite of its small likelihood, raises the specter of a school shooting situation to most kids, parents and educators. Rich said he’s found that the majority of parents “want their children to have smartphones so that they can reach each other during the day.” Some officials are leaving the logistics of cellphone bans up to individual schools. In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul’s proposed legislation for “distraction-free schools” calls for “no unsanctioned use of smartphones and other internet-enabled personal devices on school grounds in K-12 schools for the entire school day, including classroom time and other settings like lunch and study hall periods” — giving schools discretion to decide for themselves what “unsanctioned” means, as well as how they are going to store students’ phones. The bill earmarks $13.5 million to help schools purchase “storage solutions.” Across the country, schools are trying out a variety of strategies. Folks in our HuffPost Parents Facebook community report success with over-the-door pockets organizers and Yondr pouches, as well as having kids hand their phones to administrators at the beginning of the day. One teacher commented that she asks students to use their phones fairly frequently during class, to take photos of their artwork. Others noted how challenging it can be for teachers to enforce a ban on their own. “Unless administrators will fully enforce it, teachers do not have a leg to stand on,” one person commented. Others noted that teachers do not enforce the ban evenly and that in some cases a lack of technology (i.e., laptops) means teachers are asking kids to take out their phones to do work in class. Kaitlin Tiches, librarian at the Digital Wellness Lab, noted the importance of including teachers in these policy decisions as well as listening to their feedback. “Even the best-intentioned and communicated policies can cause tension between teachers and students, and teachers should be supported throughout the process. Some research has found that teachers had a difficult time upholding a cellphone policy even if they had a part in creating it. Therefore, it’s really important to acknowledge that these policies need to be tested with the understanding that they might need to be refined,” Tiches said. Students, too, deserve a voice in these negotiations, she added. “It’s so important to understand the needs of all the people who will be affected by the shift,” she said. “For older students like high-schoolers, being included and really heard during this process could help build community buy-in,” she added. Another reason to involve kids? They’re usually at least several steps ahead of the game. One parent commented, “My daughter said that kids put other things in the pouches, like just the phone case and some rocks for weight so it looks like they locked their phones, but they just keep the actual phone with them throughout the day.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Alexis Ohanian Mercilessly Skewers Right-Wing Commentator Who Called Him A 'Beta' Male",
    "text": "Right-wing commentator Jason Whitlock called Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian a “beta” after Ohanian shared a social media post standing up for his wife, tennis legend Serena Williams. Whitlock’s “beta” dig has become a common MAGA insult — and Ohanian had some choice words in response. The tech entrepreneur took to X, formerly Twitter, earlier this week to address Williams’ surprise cameo in Sunday’s Super Bowl halftime show, in which she did the crip walk during rapper Kendrick Lamar’s groundbreaking performance. Ohanian emphasized the gravity of the moment by pointing out that Williams had been harshly criticized for doing the same dance on the court at Wimbledon in 2012. “Some of y’all have no idea how criticized Serena was for this same dance at Wimbledon 13 years ago and it shows.... This is bigger than the music,” he wrote on Monday. The context of Williams’ recent Super Bowl moment and her journey as a world-famous tennis champion is important. The 23-time Grand Slam singles title holder, who is Black, has been on the receiving end of misogynoir — an ingrained hatred or prejudice specifically directed at Black women — throughout her career. To emphasize his point, Ohanian shared a clip of the Super Bowl performance alongside a screenshot of an article in The Week that featured old remarks Whitlock had made about Williams doing the crip walk — a dance that originated in her hometown in Southern California — at Wimbledon in 2012. “Her dance was the height of disrespect,” Whitlock said at the time, adding that the tennis legend “deserved to be criticized and she should’ve immediately apologized.” Whitlock evidently wasn’t pleased that Ohanian shared his old remarks. He responded by calling the tech entrepreneur and investor a “beta” while also referencing Williams’ rumored past romance with rapper Drake. (In case you haven’t been following the biggest rap beef in music in recent years, Drake is the target of Lamar’s diss track, “Not Like Us,” which played at the halftime show as Williams danced onstage. Not to mention, Drake has publicly made a dig at Ohanian and his relationship with Williams before.) “This is Serena’s husband, a true beta,” Whitlock wrote Tuesday on X in response to Ohanian. “He’s mad at me rather than the wife Crip walking and still thinking about Drake. Simp.” Ohanian then slammed Whitlock with a mic-drop response, telling the BlazeTV host that his life “didn’t turn out the way you imagined.” “You’re the embodiment of peaked in high school, spending decades chasing validation from strangers through Likes and Digital Hugs, only to find that no amount of external approval fills the void,” he wrote back. “I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.” He added: “You’ll find that if you wake up every morning trying to be a little better, a little more curious, you won’t have time for irrational hating — you’ll be too busy winning.” I get it—you’re 57, and life didn’t turn out the way you imagined. That kind of disappointment must be exhausting. You’re the embodiment of peaked in high school, spending decades chasing validation from strangers through Likes and Digital Hugs, only to find that no amount of… While Ohanian may have shut down Whitlock’s criticism, the so-called “beta” jab is nothing new. Many conservatives and MAGA fans have long been propping up various toxic stereotypes about masculinity, calling themselves alpha males and sharing their theories of what “real men” are supposedly like — narratives that were emphasized throughout President Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. Prior to his election, Trump called radio host Howard Stern a “beta male” in a rant on his Truth Social platform in October after Stern endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris. The term “beta male” may have several different interpretations, definitions and certain colloquial implications. While it is widely used as an insult to insinuate that a man is weak, some interpret the “beta male” label to mean that a man is more emotionally intelligent. Licensed therapist Tatiana Rivera Cruz described “beta males” as “men who lack dominance,” in an article published in Verywell Mind. The label also could be rooted in jealousy or flawed ideas about romantic relationships. “Some men criticize other men for several reasons,” Racine R. Henry, a licensed marriage and family therapist and certified clinical trauma professional, told HuffPost. “They either received similar criticisms in the past, they have jealousy towards the ‘beta males’ for being happy in their relationships, and/or they were taught that masculinity is tied to being dominant and aloof in romantic relationships.” “What this says about them and the kind of partners they probably are is that they believe women don’t deserve certain expressions of love,” she added. Henry also pointed to the criticism that Williams has specifically faced for years, including ridicule that her body is too masculine-looking. “She is stronger, faster, more athletic and more talented than many of the men who freely criticize her, so in an attempt to defend themselves or balance the scales, they attack anything about her that they can,” she said. “I also believe these men lack emotional intelligence and can’t appreciate the value of having a loving, supportive partner who they also love openly and publicly.” “To suggest such a thing is absolutely absurd!” Henry said. “When a husband can show interest in and support of his wife’s dreams, aspirations and goals, it not only boosts her confidence and provides a helpful resource, it also shows that the husband is loving the entirety of who his wife is.” Henry noted, however, that publicly supporting your partner can be a bad thing if that person does not like or want that kind of support. Some people “don’t like being the center of attention and want to keep all aspects of their relationship private.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read. While other outlets are retreating behind paywalls and bending the knee to political pressure, HuffPost is proud to be unbought and unfiltered. Will you help us keep it that way?

    "text": "As shopping experts, Presidents’ Day is a big deal. After the holiday rush, it’s the first winter weekend you finally start to see significantly good deals in droves again. Rest assured, we shop slowly to carefully discern if a sale offers the most bang for our buck when we buy anything.

Not every shiny percent sign is really what it seems, after all. So trust us when we say that the below deals are the best Presidents’ Day finds on Amazon this week.

There are two types of people in the world: those who floss religiously and those for whom flossing is like pulling teeth.

Time and time again, dermatologists have told us how essential retinoids (like retinol) are to a well-rounded skin care routine, specifically one that’s geared toward premature skin aging prevention. This is because, as board-certified dermatologist Dr. Rebecca Marcus once told HuffPost, retinol increases cell turnover, thus helping to stimulate collagen production. Retinol, particularly prescription-strength, has a notorious reputation for causing irritation, especially for more mature skin, which Marcus said is more delicate. OTC retinol, on the other hand, can be less sensitizing and better tolerated, though potentially less effective. This Pharma Development A313 retinol cream from France features a distinctive texture and three different types of effective retinol, making it happy medium between regularl OTC and prescription-strength. Today, the larger 50-gram size of this cream is on sale at 20% off although we suspect it won’t be marked down for very long.

But you may not have heard about their under-the-radar Lip Treatment Balm, which also has rave reviews and is specifically formulated for aging lips. Unlike the Lip Sleeping Mask and even the Lip Glowy Balm, Laneige’s other breakout lip product, the Lip Treatment Balm targets fine lines and wrinkles with ingredients like peptides and adenosine.

The light turns off of you want, for night time use so the room is not lit up, or it can be used as a night light. It's also very quiet. I may purchase another for the living room and just keep this one in the bedroom. We live in a dry climate so humidity really helps in the winter!\" — ACH Lancôme is one of the few longstanding luxury brands with skincare (and makeup!) that's actually worth its price tag. This Advanced Genifique serum is no different. The formula is lightweight is loved for its hydrating and pumping capabilities that really make a difference. Usually $60, you can now get it for 20% off on Amazon. And while this is a great deal, we've also got to highlight that Lacnome's Promising review: \"I have only used it for 2 weeks!

I use the brushes when I just want to ha e straight hair, and their also amazing. Very happy!! I bought a cheap little travel bag for it, because it does not come with a container which is odd for so may parts. Air flow is adjustable. My hair dries and styles in half the time it used to take and looks better. — Kate That toothbrush of yours? Yeah, it’s actually disgusting. Dr. Gary Liu, a pediatric dentist at Kind Smiles in California, previously told HuffPost that germs can live between 24 hours and a few weeks on the surface of your old toothbrush. If you’re sick, that also presents a small risk of reinfection if your toothbrush hasn’t had the proper time to breathe and completely dry out between uses. Do you dream of Brooklinen and have some holiday Amazon cards to use up? We have good news. The brand is currently running a 25% off coupon on most of its selections on Amazon. Snag goodies like this four-piece, 100% cotton sateen sheets that come with a fitted sheet, flat sheet and two pillowcases in seven neutral hues in most bed sizes. Just clip the on-page coupon before adding it to cart in order for the savings to show up at checkout.Promising review: \"The texture is really soft and I've had this set for a few months. The color is very vibrant the gray lines haven't faded. My sheets feel cool which is something I was looking for.

I can't complain about anything.\" — Michelle Villasenor There’s nothing better than sipping a cafe-style drink at home...except maybe drinking a cafe-style drink at home that requires minimal prep and cleanup. The super-popular and highly-rated Nespresso Vertuo Plus offers delectable coffee and espresso drinks, all with the push of a button — and today, it’s 30% off. Stephanie Merlin, a certified feline behaviorist and cat well-being educator, previously told HuffPost how important cat trees are to their health. \"Cats are both predator and prey, so having a high vantage point is a natural way to help them feel safe and secure,” Merlin wrote. “This isn’t just about fun and games; it’s deeply rooted in their biology.” Nab this 60-inch, cactus-inspired cat tree while it's on sale for 10% off with a coupon. Just clip the on-page coupon before adding it to your cart and savings should show up at checkout. In skin care, vitamin C is a valuable player. In fact, New York City-based board-certified dermatologist Dr. Bradley Glodny previously told HuffPost that after sunscreen and retinol, it’s the most helpful ingredient in defense against premature skin aging. But serums containing this powerful antioxidant are not always affordable. Some of the most famed preparations, such as iS Clinical’s Super Serum Advance and SkinCeuticals’ C E Ferulic acid serum, can cost upwards of $180. Fortunately for our skin (and our wallets), one of Amazon’s top-selling vitamin C serums is an affordable alternative that reviewers claim is just as effective as higher-end options. TruSkin’s vitamin C serum, is currently on sale for 56% off. Boasting over 97,000 five-star ratings, this option has enough positive buyer testimonials to make a believer out of any skeptic. The nourishing formula promises a reduction in fine lines and sun damage, improvement in the appearance of skin conditions like melasma and an overall increase in skin brightness and radiance. CeraVe is universally beloved by beauty gurus and Chapstick-only wearers alike. The skin care brand’s fragrance-free, high-quality products always boast an impressively competitive price tag. This rings truer today, as the highly-rated, resurfacing retinol serum is currently 15% off. Created with encapsulated retinol, licorice root extract, niacinamide and ceramides 1, 3 and 6-11, it’s a potent product that’s still mild enough to be used daily. These powerful ingredients work overtime to smooth and brighten skin, minimize pores and reduce acne marks without stripping the skin’s natural barrier. (The brand reminds you to use a daily facial sunscreen when using this product, as retinol products can make you sunburn more easily. Also, they have a highly-rated one that plays nicely with the serum that should definitely go in your cart, too.) One of iRobot's most \"bang-for-your-buck\" robot vacuum options, the Roomba Q0120 features a sleek design and the same three-stage cleaning system as other models from the brand. It uses a dual multi-surface brush that effectively loosens debris for better suctioning and an additional edge sweeping brush reaches corners, along walls and other hard-to-reach areas. Plus, you can schedule customized cleaning routines or control the vacuum using voice commands or other smart home platforms. Nab it while it's over 50% off. In the winter months, it can be harder to get outside to get your body moving. If you’ve been looking to add more activity to your daily routine but don’t want to break the bank, we found a highly-rated indoor stationary exercise bike, for under $200. That’s right folks, coming from the brand Merach, this Bluetooth-enabled bike that usually retails for $399.99 is currently on sale for 50% off, making it $199.99 today. A shockingly low price for exercise bikes, especially ones that reviews call, “an investment in my health I won’t ever regret” and have folks saying “Peloton who?” A compact bike, it’s easy to fit in even smaller spaces, only taking up 6.92 square feet. It also has handy mini wheels on the front, so you can easily move it around your home, getting it in the perfect spot to watch TV or keep an eye on your stove. (Also important to note, this option has a 280-pound weight capacity.) In the cold of winter, your skin may be more dry and irritated than ever. And while we can’t change the weather, we did spot a great deal on a French pharmacy staple aimed to give your skin indulgent nourishment as you wash – Bioderma's super soothing shower oil, currently on sale for 20% off. Made with niacinamide and agents to replenish lipids, this rinse-off oil is gentle enough for daily use, with reviewers saying they use it on their kids and babies too. From the brand’s Atoderm line, it’s intended for those with dry and sensitive skin, offering cleansing and restoration without irritation. Many reviewers note that Bioderma doesn’t make your shower slippery, feel sticky or “leave an oily film” (as other oils can), so older reviewers or really, anyone worried about falling in the shower feel safer using it. Users also love the product’s gentle clean scent, that’s not overpowering or irritating. If you spend hours at your computer, reading, gaming, streaming, playing music or generally seated — you should probably check out this ergonomic desk chair we found that's surprisingly VERY adjustable. Ensuring a more personalized fit for your body, this chair can go from 44.9 to 52 inches high, offering you between 17.7-21.6 inches from the seat down. You can slide the headrest up and down and tilt it perfectly for your neck, move the armrests forward and back, swivel them to the side or flip them up to get them out of your way entirely. Heck, you can even safely rock back in it, up to 120 degrees. Another critical standout feature reviewers note is its adaptive lumbar support, which reviewer Cristian Furtado, says is a “game-changer” since “I can adjust it perfectly to fit my back, which has significantly reduced my back pain during long workdays.” Usually listed for $149.99, the chair is 38% off today, dropping the price to under $100. Skip even reading this and just go grab 'em before the coupon disappears. They're comfy to wear so you can still talk or drink water with them in. Still, the Crest Whitestrips are designed to get your smile 20 levels whiter with consistent use in 30-minute intervals. That's plenty of good payoff for something so effortless — and per the thousands of reviews, they're effective. Usually $45.99, they're marked down to $29.99. Another if you know, you know item Apple AirTags are nothing short of a lifestyle for folks who always lose their keys, want to keep an eye on their luggage or just like keeping tabs on their things. Stick one in your dog's collar, your purse that seems to grow legs and walk away or even your glove box, if you hate looking for your car in a crowded parking lot. In short, you can never have too many so when they're on sale for 29% off, grab 'em fast. In addition to being water- and dust-resistant, AirTags have a wildly simple setup, and you can assign each one a name to keep your most valuable belongings sorted. Each tag can use ultrawideband technology to connect with a phone and provide accurate location monitoring, or automatically notify users when the AirTag is detected in Apple's Find My Network app. If you’re looking for a survival tool for home power outages, remote and outdoor living or maybe even your RV, then the gas-free Jackery Explorer 1000 is one reliable powerhouse. This portable generator has also become a HuffPost reader favorite and it’s so powerful that one reviewer says it was able to run a full-size fridge and a few fans overnight. And now’s the perfect time to grab one since it’s marked down 42% off with the existing sale and after redeeming the on-page $40 off coupon — knocking its price from $799 to $459. A king-sized mattress 43% off? You better believe it. This mattress by Neo Sleep is made with memory foam and a layer of cooling gel to provide an ultra-firm yet comfy sleep experience that reviewers really enjoy. It has motion isolation that promises to not disturb your partner when you move around, and it's 12-inches for a thick slab of plushness. Promising review: \"Mattress arrived, unboxed it. Laid it out on the slates to the bed. Checked on it every hour. 3 hours in and it’s a true 12 inch mattress. Soft to the touch, no smell, once laying in bed. It’s definitely a medium firm. Perfect for back problem personnel. Glad I caught it at half price. True king size and when you sit around the edges it holds your weight. Doesn’t squished down. When you jump on me side the movement is very minimal to the other side. It’s definitely a value buy and worth every single penny.\" —FAMILY THINGS Looking for a new workhorse to help boost your productivity? Take a look at this Dell Inspiron 16 Plus, now on sale at 26% off its typical price. It's booted with Windows 11 for the latest Microsoft operating system, plus it's stacked with some decent specs: 1 TB of internal storage, 16 GB of RAM and Intel Core i7-13620H Processor. Nab it at a rare discount today. Promising review: \"I am more than thrilled with this laptop purchase. My previous Dell laptop was almost 10 years old, and I had started to run into issues (especially when doing things on the web). The new laptop boots up in under 15 seconds and the speed (both when I'm online and offline) is fantastic. The extra screen size (my old laptop had a 15-inch display, and this laptop has a 16-inch display with virtually the same footprint). The only thing I noted (which isn't an issue for me but might be for someone else) is that Dell chose to make the lightning bolt port the place where you put the power cord. Since I don't need access to a lightning bolt port on my laptop, it's not a problem.\" — L. Goldfine Avoid swapping hand bacteria with everyone in the house by installing this motion sensor faucet from Gimili, which reviewers say was a breeze to put in themselves. It's on sale for up to 29% off depending on the color you choose. The black one is 20% off exactly while the gold option is 29% off plus an extra $20 off if you clip the on-page coupon. Promising review: \"I’ve had this sink for about 3 months now and I love it. It took some time to get used to using just the sensor to turn it on and off but now that I’m used to it I can’t go back. Really impressed with the quality and sensor for the price. The only time the sensor messes up is if a reflective pot is too close, it can turn it off or on but just hold it down lower. As far as installing kitchen faucets go, it’s pretty easy and the sensor was pretty simple too.\" — Matt \"I purchased this faucet for newly renovated kitchen. The motion sensor is smart. When you have your hands full or simply have dirty hands, this feature works effortlessly. Now my family is asking every faucet in the house to be motion sensor. The installation is easy. The most important thing is quality customer services. They answer all my installation and warranty questions very quickly. I recommend this faucet.\" — Vera Chen Even before the Cosrx Snail 96 Essence reached TikTok-fame status, HuffPost shopping writer Tessa Flores long sworn by its ability to transform her parched and sensitive skin into a complexion that’s supple and glowing — presumably thanks to snail secretion filtrate, an ingredient that does in fact come from snails. People in need of hydrated skin have caught on, causing the slimy-sounding product to sell out left and right. It’s even made special appearances on HuffPost’s own editor’s pick lists and several skin care stories.

    "title": "American Bar Association Says Trump Is Not Following The Rule Of Law",
    "text": "The American Bar Association issued a blistering missive on the chaos President Donald Trump has unleashed in the early days of his second administration, urging the nation’s courts and attorneys to stand as a bulwark for the rule of law. “It has been three weeks since Inauguration Day. Most Americans recognize that newly elected leaders bring change. That is expected,” ABA President William R. Bay began the statement. “But most Americans also expect that changes will take place in accordance with the rule of law and in an orderly manner that respects the lives of affected individuals and the work they have been asked to perform.” Trump has issued dozens of executive orders since Jan. 20 as he seeks to radically restructure the federal government with the help of billionaire adviser Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency. While never mentioning Musk by name, Bay skewered decisions made by DOGE including the dismantling of USAID, an agency created and funded by Congress. “This is chaotic. It may appeal to a few. But it is wrong,” Bay said. He called on the administration to remember basic civics lessons about the three coequal branches of American government and praised one federal judge in particular for pushing back on Trump’s executive order against birthright citizenship. For more than 150 years, the 14th Amendment of the Constitution has guaranteed the right to citizenship for those born on U.S. soil. Amendments cannot be abolished by the president’s will alone. “Just last week, in rejecting citizenship challenges, the U.S. District Judge John Coughenour said that the rule of law is, according to this administration, something to navigate around or simply ignore. ‘Nevertheless,’ he said, ‘in this courtroom and under my watch, the rule of law is a bright beacon which I intend to follow.’ He is correct. The rule of law is a bright beacon for our country,” Bay wrote. The ABA, a nonpartisan legal accreditation group, has served to maintain academic and ethical standards for law schools and those in the legal profession since 1878. More than a dozen lawsuits have been filed in opposition to Trump’s actions over just the last three weeks, amid confusing guidance over the disbursement of federal funds that has thrown federal agencies into turmoil. The federal government employs some 3 million people. Vice President JD Vance went so far as to suggest the lawsuits and subsequent judicial action violated presidential power, seemingly painting the executive branch as an authority above all others. House Speaker Mike Johnson also urged the courts to “take a step back” while the destabilizing changes are carried out. “No American can be proud of a government that carries out change in this way. Neither can these actions be rationalized by discussion of past grievances or appeals to efficiency. Everything can be more efficient, but adherence to the rule of law is paramount. We must be cognizant of the harm being done by these methods,” Bay wrote. He ended by calling on elected representatives “to stand with us and to insist upon adherence to the rule of law and the legal processes and procedures that ensure orderly change.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "text": "Comedian Amy Schumer joined the Knicks City Dancers on the basketball court Saturday night to recreate the dance she performed in her movie, “Trainwreck,” 10 years ago. After the New York Knicks dance team completed its halftime routine, the camera panned to Schumer, who was sitting courtside at Madison Square Garden for the Knicks’ game against the Los Angeles Lakers. After she playfully pretended to be shocked, she got up to perform a choreographed routine with the dancers to “Uptown Girl,” the same song she performed in “Trainwreck.” In the 2015 movie, Schumer performs to a mashup of songs to win over her love interest played by Bill Hader. Both the performance in the movie and the routine Saturday night included a high-intensity kickline. Schumer shared the routine in a post on her Instagram account, with many of her friends praising her in the comments section. Actor Olivia Munn called it “ICONIC,” and comedian Chelsea Handler simply wrote, “YES!” Katie Couric also commented, writing, “So glad I was there to witness this! Go Amy!” The Knicks City Dancers also gave Schumer a shoutout on Instagram, sharing a picture of her with the dance team and referring to her as “rookie of the year” in the post’s caption. Schumer is promoting her new movie, “Kinda Pregnant,” which stars her and Will Forte. The movie is set to release on Netflix on Feb. 5.

    "text": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has a message for Andrew Tate and his brother, Tristan Tate: You’re not welcome here. The pair, who are dual British-U.S. citizens, unexpectedly had their travel restrictions lifted and promptly fled to Florida from Romania, where they have been charged with human trafficking. DeSantis told reporters Thursday that “Florida is not a place where you’re welcome with that type of conduct” and expressed hope that James Uthmeier, the state’s attorney general, will “be able to deal with this.” “I don’t know how it came to this,” DeSantis continued, distancing himself from Andrew Tate, an outspoken Donald Trump supporter and self-described “absolute misogynist.” “We were not involved, we were not notified, I found out through the media that this was something that was happening,” he added. Other politicians were a little more blunt. “Why is the Trump administration importing sex traffickers?” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) wrote on X, formerly called Twitter. Why is the Trump administration importing sex traffickers? https://t.co/FOtX6R0rTD Romania’s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, said it released the siblings after it received a “request to modify the obligation preventing the defendants from leaving Romania,” but did not specify who made the request. Reporting by the Financial Times, however, suggested that the Trump administration likely pressured Romanian authorities to return the brothers’ U.S. passports and allow them to travel. The outlet said Trump’s special envoy, Richard Grenell, met with the Romanian foreign minister at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month, having brought up the Tates’ case in a phone call before the event. Grenell also complained on social media around that time about U.S. Agency for International Development funds being used to “target” conservatives around the world. “Romania is the latest example,” he added, replying to a post that mentioned Tristan Tate. Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon he didn’t know anything about the siblings’ release. Romanian officials arrested the brothers in 2022 on charges of human trafficking and forming an organized crime group to sexually exploit women. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. The two have denied the allegations. Andrew Tate has faced additional legal scrutiny for alleged money laundering and sexual intercourse with a minor.

    "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Thursday called for New York City Mayor Eric Adams to “be removed” from his position if he refuses voluntarily stepping down after the Justice Department’s order for his corruption charges to be dropped prompted the resignations of several federal prosecutors. In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi dated Wednesday, Manhattan U.S. attorney Danielle Sassoon said last month she attended a meeting during which Adams’ legal team “repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo” with Trump administration officials, requesting their client’s indictment be dismissed in exchange for him assisting with federal immigration enforcement. Adams’ legal team has denied Sassoon’s allegations. Ocasio-Cortez described Sassoon’s letter as “explosive.” “As long as Trump wields this leverage over Adams, the city is endangered,” she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “We cannot be governed under coercion.” “If Adams won’t resign, he must be removed,” she continued. This is explosive.Mayor Adams is putting the City of New York and its people at risk in exchange for escaping charges.As long as Trump wields this leverage over Adams, the city is endangered. We cannot be governed under coercion.If Adams won’t resign, he must be removed. https://t.co/TEERloAm2o New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D), the only official with the power to effectively fire Adams, said she hasn’t made her mind up on the issue. “This just happened, I need some time to process this and figure out the right approach,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Thursday evening. Following Sassoon’s resignation, Adams’ case was transferred to the unit overseeing public integrity divisions at the DOJ, prompting the resignations of the two leaders of that team.

    "title": "Hegseth Renames Military Base 'Fort Bragg,' But Not After Confederate General",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has signed an order restoring the name of a storied special operations forces base in North Carolina back to Fort Bragg and said Tuesday that there will be more name changes coming. Speaking to reporters in Germany, Hegseth hinted at a wholesale reversal of the broader Biden administration effort in 2023 to remove names that honored Confederate leaders, including nine Army bases. It sets up a potentially costly, complicated and delicate process that could run afoul of the law. “As the president has said, and I’ve said as well, we’re not done there,” Hegseth said Tuesday when asked about the decision to revert the base name from Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg, but changing the service member it commemorates. “I never called it Fort Liberty because it wasn’t Fort Liberty. It’s Fort Bragg.” Hegseth said the original name is a legacy for troops who lived and served there and that it was a shame to change it. He said he deliberately referred to Bragg and Fort Benning — the Army base in Columbus, Georgia, which is now called Fort Moore — as he entered the Pentagon on his first day. “There are other bases that have been renamed that erodes that very same legacy,” he said. “There’s a reason I said Bragg and Benning when I walked into the Pentagon on day one. But it’s not just Bragg and Benning. There are a lot of other service members that have connections. And we’re going to do our best to restore it.” The North Carolina base was renamed Fort Liberty in 2023. Its original namesake, Gen. Braxton Bragg, was a Confederate general from Warrenton, North Carolina, who was known for owning slaves and losing key Civil War battles, contributing to the Confederacy’s downfall. Hegseth is renaming the base to honor Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, who the Army said was a World War II hero who earned a Silver Star and Purple Heart for exceptional courage during the Battle of the Bulge. The choice of the World War II private first class got around a law prohibiting the military from naming a base after a Confederate leader. It sets up the potential for the Defense Department to do the same for the other eight Army bases that were renamed — searching through massive military records for service members with the same last names who could be cited to revert to the former names. That effort, however, also could be seen as a slap against some of the highly decorated service members whose names are now used for the bases. The former Fort Gordon in Georgia, for example, was renamed Fort Eisenhower to commemorate President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who led allied forces in Europe in World War II. Fort Moore is named after Lt. Gen. Harold Gregory Moore Jr., who earned the Distinguished Service Cross for valor and fought in the Battle of Ia Drang in the Vietnam War. Army officials said they do not have any cost estimates yet for changing the name again to Fort Bragg. On Tuesday, the Army released an initial service verification for Bragg, who was born in Webster, Maine, and served as a toxic gas handler from July 1943 to November 1945. Bragg deployed to England from August 1944 to August 1945 and left the Army in the rank of private first class, Army spokesman Maj. Travis Shaw said. Bragg’s awards include the World War II Victory Medal, the Silver Star Medal, the Purple Heart Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the European African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three bronze stars, a Parachute Badge and a Combat Infantry Badge, Shaw said. In a video posted on X announcing the renaming, Hegseth said, “That’s right. Bragg is back!” In reality, the base had still been widely known as Bragg, the new name having not really taken hold. The renaming will add costs when the Trump administration is trying to find savings through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. The 2022 base renaming commission estimated that renaming Bragg, including all the signage, paint jobs on police and emergency responder vehicles and other items, would cost at least $6.3 million. In 2023, the base said the total costs were going to be around $8 million.

A federal judge in New Hampshire will consider whether a town is infringing on the free speech rights of the bakery owner who’s displaying the mural over his business. “I think the whole town is following this story,” said Sean Young, the owner of Leavitt’s Country Bakery in Conway, a community of more than 10,000 people near the White Mountains that draws skiers, nature lovers and shoppers. Some residents want regulations enforced as they worry about overdevelopment in the tourist town. The mural atop the bakery, which was founded over 45 years ago, is a creation of local high school art students. When it went up in June 2022, the painting attracted a lot of compliments and visitors, including one from a town zoning officer. The zoning board decided that the painting was not so much art as advertising. The board determined it was a sign, and so it could not remain as is because of its size. At about 90 square feet, it’s four times bigger than the local sign code allows. If the painting didn’t show what’s sold inside — baked goods — it wouldn’t be considered a sign and could stay, board members said. Lawyers for the town say that it has shown that “restricting the size of signs serves the significant government interest of preserving the town’s aesthetics, promoting safety, and ensuring equal enforcement,” according to a court document. Young was told to modify or remove the painting. Faced with possible misdemeanor criminal charges and fines after his appeals were rejected, he sued the town in federal court in 2023, saying his freedom of speech rights were violated. “Government officials don’t get to tell people, including entrepreneurs and businesses, what they can and can’t paint,” the Virginia-based Institute for Justice, which is representing Young, said in a news release at the time. “And no one can say with a straight face that Leavitt’s mural would be any safer, healthier or more aesthetically pleasing if it portrayed flowers instead of pastries.” Young is asking for $1 in damages. His lawyers say the town’s definition of a sign is overly broad and that the town hasn’t shown that anything bad will happen if the painting continues to stay up. It hasn’t been removed. Part of Conway’s sign code states that the town “has no intention of restricting individual free speech, but the town does recognize its right to place reasonable restrictions upon commercial speech.” The town has enforced its sign code against other businesses. In 2006, for example, it said an ice cream parlor’s trash cans, which were shaped like ice cream cones, were signs. The business asked for and got permission from the town to use the cans. In another case, a sporting goods store agreed to remove window screens with photos of mountain bikes and skis after the town determined they were signs.

Young’s lawsuit was paused for a few months in 2023 as residents considered revising how the town defines signs, in a way that would have allowed the painting to stay up. But that measure was seen as too broad and complex, and it failed to pass. Last year, voters passed a new ordinance that requires applicants to meet criteria for art on public and commercial property but it has not applied to Young’s case.

    "title": "Trump Expresses Hope Russia's War In Ukraine Is Nearing An Endgame",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said he was hopeful that Russia’s war in Ukraine was nearing an endgame as he met on Monday with French President Emmanuel Macron on the third anniversary of the invasion. Trump, in broad-ranging comments on the state of the conflict, said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine to keep the peace. He also expressed hope that the conflict could end within weeks and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would soon come to the U.S. to sign a deal to give the U.S. access to Ukraine’s critical minerals to help repay some of the $180 billion in American aid that’s been sent to Kyiv since the start of the war. “It looks like we’re getting very close,” Trump told reporters at the start of his bilateral meeting with Macron. He added that Zelenskyy could potentially visit Washington this week or next to sign the deal. Trump and Macron earlier on Monday participated in a virtual meeting with fellow Group of Seven leaders to discuss the war. The talks come at a moment of deep uncertainty about the future of transatlantic relations, with Trump transforming American foreign policy and effectively tuning out European leadership as he looks to quickly end the war in Ukraine. Ukraine is also looking for future security guarantees as part of any agreement. Trump, however, did not say whether the emerging deal would include American security guarantees. “Europe is going to make sure nothing happens,” Trump said. The anniversary — and talks — come at an unnerving moment for much of Europe witnessing a dramatic shift in American foreign policy with Trump’s return to power. Trump also has made demands for territory — Greenland, Canada, Gaza and the Panama Canal — as well as precious rare earth minerals from Ukraine. Just over a month into his second term, the “America First” president has cast an enormous shadow over what veteran U.S. diplomats and former government officials had regarded as America’s calming presence of global stability and continuity. “We have necessity to have guarantees for solid peace,” Macron said at the start of the meeting. “This is very important moment for Europe as well.” Trump said he also believed Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end Russia’s war there. “Yeah, he will accept it,” Trump said. “I have asked him that question. Look, if we do this deal, he’s not looking for more war.” The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Putin has repeatedly railed against Western forces on Russia’s borders and previously said that European or U.S forces in Ukraine would be a major security issue for Moscow. Despite some hiccups, the military, economic and moral power of the United States has dominated the post-World War II era, most notably after the Cold War came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union. All of that, some fear, may be lost if Trump gets his way and the U.S. abandons the principles under which the United Nations and numerous other international bodies were founded. “The only conclusion you can draw is that 80 years of policy in standing up against aggressors has just been blown up without any sort of discussion or reflection,” said Ian Kelly, a U.S. ambassador to Georgia during the Obama and first Trump administration and now a professor at Northwestern University. Visits start on anniversary of war in Ukraine Trump is set to hold a meeting Thursday with another key European leader, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The talks come after Trump shook Europe with repeated criticism of Zelenskyy for failing to negotiate an end to the war and rebuffing a push to sign off on a deal giving the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, which could be used in the American aerospace, medical and tech industries. European leaders also were dismayed by Trump’s decision to dispatch top aides for preliminary talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia without Ukrainian or European officials at the table. Meanwhile, the United States on Monday failed to get the U.N. General Assembly to approve its resolution urging an end to the war without mentioning Moscow’s aggression. The assembly approved a dueling European-backed Ukrainian resolution demanding Russia immediately withdraw from Ukraine. On the minerals deal, Zelenskyy initially bristled, saying it was short on security guarantees for Ukraine. He said Sunday on X that “we are making great progress“ but noted that “we want a good economic deal that will be part of a true security guarantee system for Ukraine.” The friction follows a public spat, with Trump calling Zelenskyy a “dictator” and falsely charging Kyiv with starting the war. Russia, in fact, invaded its smaller and lesser-equipped neighbor in February 2022. Zelenskyy, who said Sunday in response to a question that he would trade his office for peace or to join NATO, then angered Trump by saying the U.S. president was living in a Russian-made “disinformation space.” Confronting Trump might not be the best approach, analysts say. “The response to President Trump doing something to you is not to do something back right away. You tend to get this kind of reaction,” said retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. High-stakes talks between European and US leaders Macron said ahead of the meeting he intended to tell Trump it’s in the joint interest of Americans and Europeans not to show weakness to Putin during U.S.-led negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. He also suggested he’ll make the case that how Trump handles Putin could have enormous ramifications for U.S. dealings with China, the United States’ most significant economic and military competitor. “You can’t be weak in the face of President Putin. It’s not you, it’s not your trademark, it’s not in your interest,” Macron said. “How can you then be credible in the face of China if you’re weak in the face of Putin?’” Yet, Trump has shown a considerable measure of respect for the Russian leader. Trump said this month he’d like to see Russia rejoin what is now the Group of Seven major economies. Russia was suspended from the G8 after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region.

    "title": "Ariana Grande Opens Up About Relationship Rumors: 'It’ll Never Be Unpainful'",
    "text": "Ariana Grande says the rumors she’s endured while living in the public eye never get any less “unpainful.” Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter for a new cover story, the two-time Grammy winner opened up about facing criticism stemming from her rumored relationship with boyfriend and “Wicked” costar Ethan Slater, and how the drama has affected her emotionally. “It’ll never be unpainful,” Grande said of the gossip. “But also, I walk with the awareness that I’m an artist and this is a path that I’ve chosen, and so I just try to protect myself so that I never start to resent the art.” The pop star and Slater have kept their relationship largely under wraps. Grande was previously married to real estate broker Dalton Gomez. The pair finalized their divorce in March 2024. Slater also was married to therapist Lilly Jay, with whom he shares a young child. Slater and Jay settled their divorce in September 2024. Shortly after the news broke that Grande split from Gomez, reports emerged that the singer was dating Slater, which stirred up questions and concerns about the pair’s relationship timeline on social media. It’s unclear when Grande and Slater started dating, but a source close to the couple said it was after both separated from their spouses. “Ariana and Dalton separated in January,” one insider told People. “She and Ethan recently began dating, and he is separated from his wife.” Grande and Slater made their relationship Instagram official in November 2024. The “We can’t be friends” singer broke her silence about the public’s negative reaction to her relationship with Slater in an interview with Vanity Fair last September. “The most disappointing part was to see so many people believe the worst version of it,” she told the publication. “There couldn’t be a less accurate depiction of a human being than the one that the tabloids spread about him.” Grande called out the criticisms and depictions of Slater as someone who left his wife and baby to date her as “bullshit.” “No one on this earth tries harder or spreads themselves thinner to be there for the people that he loves and cares about. There is no one on this earth with a better heart, and that is something that no bullshit tabloid can rewrite in real life,” she added. Watch a clip from Grande’s interview below.

    "title": "As Trump Attacks The LGBTQ Community, Queer People Are Holding Tight To These Spaces",
    "text": "When it became clear that President Donald Trump was going to be president again on election night, Paul Curry, a gay man in Seattle, took refuge in his friends. “It felt like an inevitable gut-punch, or a recurring migraine, but we had each other’s back,” Curry said. “A week later, we saw Issa Man’s ‘Hard Candy’ cabaret show, went to a queer bar, danced and drank, then went to Cuff [nightclub] and danced a bit more scandalously.” “No matter how bleak things get, we have each other to lean on, support, and, most importantly, joke around with,” he said. Curry has also been leaning into Dungeons & Dragons, a game that’s increasingly become a safe haven for those in the LGBTQ+ community. (That’s in part because your character’s gender identity is entirely yours to invent: “You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender,” the game’s Player’s Handbook reads. “Likewise, your character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide.”) “We’re a bunch of gaymers who gather every Sunday from 1-3 p.m.,” Curry, who’s a Dungeon Master, told HuffPost. “The world is spiraling, so it’s nice to escape into a different kind of chaos ― one where the cartoonish villains only last for one arc.” Like so many others in the queer community, Curry has never valued his safe spaces ― the gay bars, his D&D get-togethers ― more. Often caricatured and used pejoratively by right-wing pundits, a “safe space” is any place where marginalized people can come together and feel safe to express themselves, without fear of judgment from the dominant culture. These kinds of affirming communities aren’t just about safety — though that is essential. They’re about being seen in your fullness and not having to water down your personality, said Cindy Ramos, a therapist at the Gender & Sexuality Therapy Center in New York City. “It’s where we can break free from the constant strain of having to perform or conform,” she said. “It’s essential to be able to share pain and challenges, but it’s equally important to experience joy, real, unburdened joy.” “It’s rooted in our history and our DNA as a queer community to find each other, even in the smallest of towns and unlikeliest of circumstances, and help, support, and love each other.” Out of necessity, queer people always found ways to build safe spaces, whether online (Discord servers or subreddits) or in physical spaces, like a queer-friendly “Stitch ’n Bitch” knitting circle, a gay club or a lesbian bar. (Sadly, safe spaces have come under attack in the past: Gay clubs have been the target of violent attacks including the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, in 2016. Lesbian bars in the U.S. are becoming few and far between.) With the Trump administration already taking steps to end multiple policies protecting LGBTQ+ rights, safe spaces are vital to the community’s safety and viability, said Nicole Davis, who works with Ramos at the Gender & Sexuality Therapy Center, where she serves as clinical director. “Breaking isolation, refusing to give into despair, and giving yourself permission to find joy or comfort or meaning is what will carry us through this time,” Davis said. Chelcea Stowers of Detroit said her safe space is drinks with the girls. Stowers is the founder of Lesbian Social Detroit, a group that produces pop-up events around the city. Lately, they’ve partnered with a local hotel to host a biweekly happy hour where women can come, decompress, enjoy a drink and dance, if they’re so inclined. “Having space to connect and have conversations on how we can grow as a community in spite of what’s going on has been huge,” she said. J. Paul Reed of San Francisco has been leaning on his friends at SF Gaymers, a LGBTQ gaming community that hosts low-key hangouts in San Francisco and the East Bay. For his peace of mind, he’s been limiting the amount of media he consumes, so Gaymer events have been where he’s caught up on news he might otherwise miss. “It’s a place where I can seek and offer help to my queer community in the wake of elevated attacks on us and organize when that inevitably becomes necessary,” he said. “It’s also just a place where I can just be around friends, not focused on all of this, but still exist with a shared acknowledgment of that sense of, ‘Ugh, we’re doing this all again? F’ing really?!’” he said. Queer people have a long history of finding each other and creating community when doing so was fraught, Reed said, and it’s been heartening to see younger members of the community recognize that. “A lot of younger folks may not be familiar with that history, having grown up with the internet and apps and ways to engage that aren’t in the physical public square or gayborhood,” he said. “But know that it’s rooted in our history and our DNA as a queer community to find each other, even in the smallest of towns and unlikeliest of circumstances, and help, support, and love each other.” Shane Cherry, the vice president of NYC Gaymers, values having physical spaces he can turn to ― board game and video game events in bars ― when the going gets tough. But he knows that isn’t true for everyone, especially those living in more rural areas. “There are going to be plenty of people who are physically isolated in the city or elsewhere in the country, so a focus on virtual community spaces and simply actively working to build interpersonal connections are both also essential,” he said. In terms of social media, Cherry thinks the safest places at the moment appear to be private communities on platforms like Discord. (NYC Gamers has one, which he said LGBTQ gamers are welcome to join.) Like many, Cherry has moved off of X (the platform formerly known as Twitter and now owned by Elon Musk) and Meta platforms owned by Mark Zuckerberg, who attended Trump’s inauguration with a number of high-profile tech CEOs. “Facebook’s recent policies of nearly eliminating fact checking entirely and specifically allowing users to refer to transgender users as mentally ill show how increasingly hostile it is on social media,” Cherry said. “People who don’t have communities to support them will suffer the most, and nobody should have to feel isolated during such chaotic, oppressive times,” he said. Cherry points to Reddit as one place with LGBTQ-friendly forums that are reasonably safe compared to the alternatives. Jam Verona is the founder Human Flower Productions, a group that hosts “pay-what-you-can” portrait days, collage nights and other workshops for queer and trans people in New York and New Jersey. “I make a lot of open creative spaces for queer folks because to me art is one of the best ways to communicate without having to justify ourselves,” Verona told HuffPost. “It gives hope, it shows queer folks that they have the power and autonomy to create different worlds.” In an ideal world, affirming, affordable events like that would be easy to find, but Verona did offer some advice for those struggling to find something similar. For starters, ask around, and show up at your local queer bar regularly to see who’s hosting events there. “If nothing like that exists where you live, create it. Talk to friends, friends of friends, BIPOC folks, disabled folks. See what your community needs,” Verona said. “Reach out to local libraries, queer-friendly churches, and queer bars to see who would allow you to host a free event.” (Verona has even hosted free events in parks.) Queer people are banding together in professional circles, too. Cat Perez, the co-creator of Famm Connect ― the first social networking app for LGBTQ+ professionals ― said that when Trump took office, community activity on the platform surged by 50% week over week, reinforcing just how much LGBTQ+ professionals needed a space to connect and support one another. Perez and her wife, Marianna Di Regolo, have made lasting IRL bonds on the app, which they co-created. She pointed to a hike they went on recently with another Northern California couple they met on Famm. “What started as a casual outdoor meetup quickly turned into something deeper,” she said. “As we walked, we talked about our careers, but the conversation naturally shifted.” “We started talking about our coming-out journeys, the complicated ties with some of our family members, and the weight of politics, especially when it comes to people in our lives who still support Trump or the Republican Party,” she said. Being cloaked away in nature ― far away from a news cycle dominated by the Trump administration’s flurry of unilateral moves ― made it easier to just talk and concentrate on one another. “There was no need to be quiet or cautious — just space to share, reflect, and be understood,” she said. “We touched on so much that often goes unspoken, the kind of experiences the world doesn’t always recognize.” Volunteering is another great way to find a safe space with like-minded people, said Rick Oculto.

    "title": "Axios Caves To Trump, Will Refer To Gulf Of Mexico As 'Gulf Of America'",
    "text": "Axios will obey President Donald Trump’s order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America,” the publication said in a statement Friday. “Our top priority at Axios is to provide readers with clinical, fact-based reporting,” Axios said in a statement. “Our standard is to use ‘Gulf of America (renamed by U.S. from Gulf of Mexico)’ in our reporting because our audience is mostly U.S.-based compared to other publishers with international audiences.” After taking office last month, Trump signed an executive order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America.” “The Gulf of America ― what a beautiful name,” Trump said during a news conference in early January. “And it’s appropriate. We do most of the work there. It’s ours.” Following the order, the Federal Aviation Administration announced it would be changing the name to “Gulf of America” in all future charts and maps. And tech giants Google and Apple also announced they would change the name. The Associated Press has been barred from White House access after the publication made clear it would not adhere to the name change. “It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,” Julie Pace, the executive editor of AP, said in a statement earlier this week. “Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "I Was Willing To Do Anything To Save My Baby. A Nurse Made A Suggestion That Almost Cost Me My Life.",
    "text": "When my daughter was only 5 weeks old, she stopped breathing in my arms. After a panicked drive to the emergency room, she tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common respiratory virus that peaks in the winter months and which most people recover from after experiencing only mild cold-like symptoms. Almost everyone has been infected by age 2. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 58,000 to 80,000 children under the age of 5 are hospitalized each year due to complications caused by an RSV infection. Infants under 6 months of age are at the greatest risk for complications. We learned my daughter’s breathing problem was RSV-induced apnea. The virus was causing bronchiolitis; the small airways in her lungs were inflamed and her immature brain was “forgetting” to breathe when breathing became difficult. She needed to stay in an isolated pediatric intensive care unit, hooked up to oxygen and closely monitored, until her body worked through the virus. For eight days, I kept watch from a cot next to her crib. She received respiratory therapy twice a day and her apnea set off flashing red alarms around the clock. Twice I was told she might need to be put on a ventilator. With every alarm, I feared she was on the edge of death. During those eight days, breastfeeding her became increasingly difficult. The wires and tubes wrapped around her tiny body paired with her shallow breathing made it almost impossible. The hospital sent lactation consultants to show me how to use a double breast pump. They said that if she wasn’t nursing enough, my milk would dry up. The doctors said she should start on formula, and I should pump every two hours. At that point, I didn’t care what I had to do or what the doctors had to do. I just wanted my baby to survive. Once home, I was convinced I’d never sleep again for fear of more episodes of apnea. We purchased a specialized baby monitor with a pad of highly sensitive sensors slipped under her mattress that would set off an alarm if she stopped breathing. For a week, the alarm went off at least two or three times a night. I drank mug after mug of lactation teas made of fenugreek, milk thistle and fennel. My daughter’s hunger increased, so after every nursing session, I offered her formula. My nipples were cracked and bleeding. At my postpartum checkup, I told a nurse about our harrowing experience with RSV and my dwindling milk supply. Big tears fell on my paper gown as I explained how I felt like an absolute failure. She did not reassure me. “Your breast milk has lifesaving antibodies. If you don’t produce enough now, your brain will stop signaling your body to make milk. You need to stay on top of this,” she said. That was all I needed to hear. I wiped my face and nodded. Yes, I will do anything for my baby to get better. Absolutely anything. The nurse explained that there were medications I could take — medications that were not Food and Drug Administration approved for producing breast milk, but that could be taken “off label” because an unusual side effect was lactation. They were given to treat nausea and vomiting caused by certain drugs prescribed for Parkinson’s disease. She said the reason they weren’t FDA approved was because of a controversy around a small group of elderly people who were given the medication intravenously for Parkinson’s disease and then suffered cardiac arrest. She also said the formula companies didn’t want mothers to know about this medication: “You know how corporations are.” I didn’t ask questions. I wasn’t old, I didn’t have Parkinson’s disease, and I wasn’t at risk for a heart attack. The nurse handed me a prescription for domperidone and told me I couldn’t go to a chain pharmacy to have it filled — I needed a compounding pharmacy where a pharmacist would have access to the raw ingredients. On that day in the exam room, if someone had drawn a map that directed me through a dark and craggy forest and told me to visit a 100-year-old witch who lived in a dilapidated cottage at the end of a 5-mile dirt road who could dip me in a magical potion that would allow rivers of milk to flow from my breasts, I would have done it. I would have walked hundreds of miles blindfolded. I would have slayed a dragon and collected its blood in a vial made from a unicorn horn. If my breast milk was going to save my baby’s life, I would have done whatever it took. On my way out the door, she said, “The doctors don’t really understand how domperidone works, so if you have any questions, just call me.” Finally, I had hope. I was to take 30-milligram capsules three times a day for two weeks, then call the nurse to check in. Every day I ingested 90 mg of domperidone and waited for the rivers of milk to flow. Instead, I was only met with trickles when the breast pump whirred to life. And when I nursed, my baby wailed in hunger because my body was “failing” to nourish her. After a week on the drug, I began experiencing dizzy spells. They left me drenched in panicked sweat, my heart racing. Sometimes I lost my balance, bumping into counters and walls. I blamed it on sleep deprivation. My daughter’s apnea was less frequent, but her feedings were increasing. She was insatiable. And when I wasn’t pumping, I was trying to nurse. I was so focused on keeping my baby alive — my nervous system on high alert — that I ignored everything that was going on in my body. After two weeks, I called the nurse. I told her I hadn’t noticed an increase in milk production. “Are you sure you’re taking it three times a day?” she asked. There was an accusatory tone in her voice. Was I being overly sensitive? Struggling to come down from the high-alert adrenaline rush of witnessing my baby struggle to breathe dozens of times? “Just make sure you stay on it. You can’t stop taking it too quickly,” she warned. I assumed she meant my milk could dry up. I didn’t ask her to elaborate. I didn’t ask questions and I didn’t do Google research. I was too busy keeping my baby alive. For another eight weeks, I swallowed the capsules. And when the prescription ran out, I didn’t call the nurse or the compounding pharmacy. My daughter was now 4 months old. I had been supplementing with formula for over two months and her pediatrician was happy with her weight gain. More and more I fed her formula and less and less she got breast milk. I was ashamed and I felt like a failure, but my baby was alive and thriving. The magic capsules hadn’t worked, but the formula had. Two days after the prescription ran out, I noticed I couldn’t push together the snaps on my daughter’s onesies after I changed her diaper. And over the course of a week, my hands grew increasingly weaker. I felt uncoordinated and I struggled to open a can of soup. It was as if I were wearing thick mittens on my hands all the time. I looked like a toddler when brushing my teeth or tying shoes. I told myself it was all related to the physical changes that take place after nine months of pregnancy, childbirth and the exhaustion of life with a newborn. I developed insomnia. My baby was now sleeping better, but I was not. I’d lie in bed, restless and wide awake because the muscles in my arms and legs would twitch and spasm whenever I was resting. My mind raced in a way I had never experienced before. The whole left side of my body felt weak. I thought I might have had a stroke. Dark thoughts about our plaster ceiling falling, crushing both me and my baby, invaded my thoughts. I believed I was dying. I knew I was dying. My husband convinced me to see a doctor. He drove to the emergency room where my left foot dragged across the linoleum of the exam room. “I think this is neurological,” said the doctor, his voice serious. I was admitted overnight for testing and observation. Over two weeks, I was examined by neurologists and had MRI scans. Doctors hooked electrodes and wires to my thighs and calves for nerve conduction studies, which made my muscles jump and tighten. They collected vials of blood to rule out mysterious viruses and infections. The left side of my body had muscle atrophy. For some reason, my nervous system was misfiring. Doctors said they were ruling out demyelinating conditions like ALS or multiple sclerosis. Maybe it was Lyme disease. Possibly a tumor on the spinal cord. All the tests were inconclusive. Multiple neurologists weighed in. One suggested I was suffering from postpartum depression; another said I probably had a conversion disorder caused by trauma and stress. After doctors determined I wasn’t dying of a neurological disease, one finally asked me if I had recently stopped taking any medication. He was the first to suggest that my symptoms looked a lot like symptoms of withdrawal. It was only then that I mentioned I had been taking a “supplement” to help produce more breast milk but had stopped it a few weeks earlier because it hadn’t worked. “This drug is blacklisted. And you were taking three times the recommended amount. How in the hell did you get it?” the doctor asked. He determined that I had been not only experiencing symptoms of domperidone overdose, but once I abruptly stopped taking it, I was experiencing symptoms of withdrawal. The pressure to breastfeed at all costs nearly cost me my life. Thankfully there was no formula shortage in 2012, so I was able to feed my baby. But I felt guilty about how much formula I was having to give her and shame because my body was “failing” to produce milk. In December of 2023, the FDA released a warning about abruptly stopping the drug. There were no such warnings when it was given to me in 2012. When you normally fill a prescription, it comes with pages and pages of fine-print literature explaining possible side effects. But because domperidone is not FDA approved for the production of breast milk, my prescription came with no paperwork. I was not instructed to taper my dosage, nor was I told to never stop cold turkey. There are dozens of online forums dedicated to the discussion of domperidone. They are filled with success stories and horror stories and questions about dosing and side effects. It does work for some mothers, but for those whom it doesn’t work, they are often told, “take more.” If a regular over-the-counter allergy or pain medicine doesn’t work for you or causes adverse side effects, do you simply take more of it? Without FDA approval on the drug for lactation, there isn’t extensive FDA research about side effects and possible complications for lactating mothers. In 2023, Health Canada launched a yearlong investigation into domperidone and its side effects for use when breastfeeding. But in the U.S, information has been scant. Instead, women have to wing it and guess at dosing. And they aren’t always given proper information about how to taper off the drug. I physically recovered, but it required two months of physical and occupational therapy to fully regain my coordination and strength. The mental and emotional toll took years to work through. I had been afraid my baby would die from RSV. I felt shame over my inability to breastfeed. I felt guilty over the need to feed her formula. And now I was angry at having been pressured to take a drug in order to relieve the fear, shame and guilt. What I needed to hear when breastfeeding wasn’t going well after my daughter’s illness was, “You’ve been through hell. Feed her formula. It’s OK. You’re a good mom.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Blink-182's Mark Hoppus Auctioning Off Prized Banksy Painting",
    "text": "LONDON (AP) — A painting by street artist Banksy with an environmental message and an estimate of up to 5 million pounds ($6.3 million) is going up for auction, with some of the proceeds helping victims of the Los Angeles wildfires. Sotheby’s auction house said Tuesday that “Crude Oil (Vettriano)” is being sold in London next month from the collection of Mark Hoppus, bassist with California skate-punk band Blink-182, who sees Banksy as a kindred spirit. Hoppus said he was drawn to the subversion, humor and intelligence of Banksy’s work and the similarities between “skateboarding, punk rock and art.” “I feel like street art and punk rock have the same core,” Hoppus said. “The left-out and overlooked making their own reality. … Just go make art. It’s the same spirit. And I’ve loved art and especially street art ever since realizing that.” “Crude Oil (Vettriano)” is part of a 2005 series of works in which Banksy put a satirical spin on famous paintings — withering Vincent van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” and smashing the diner window in Edward Hopper’s “Nighthawks.” The artist said his aim was to show that “the real damage done to our environment is not done by graffiti writers and drunken teenagers, but by big business.” The work going under the hammer is based on “The Singing Butler,” a painting by Scottish artist Jack Vettriano showing a couple in evening dress dancing on a beach as servants proffer sheltering umbrellas. Banksy has added a sinking oil liner and two figures lugging a barrel of toxic waste. “We loved this painting since the moment we saw it,” said Hoppus, who bought the artwork with his wife, Skye Everly, in 2011. He said the painting – “unmistakably Banksy, but different” – has hung in the family’s homes in London and Los Angeles. Hoppus said he would use the proceeds of the sale to buy work by upcoming artists. Some will go to the California Fire Foundation, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and Cedars Sinai Hematology Oncology Research. Banksy, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world’s best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, “Laugh now, but one day I’ll be in charge.” Several of his works have sold for multiple millions at auction. The record is almost 18.6 million pounds ($25.4 million at the time) paid at Sotheby’s in October 2021 for “Love is in the Bin” – an image of a girl with a balloon that partially self-destructed during an auction three years earlier thanks to a shredder hidden in the frame.

    "title": "US Consumers Cut Spending In January More Drastically Than At Any Point In The Last Four Years",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumers cut back sharply on spending last month, the most since February 2021, even as inflation declined, though stiff tariffs threatened by the White House could disrupt that progress. Americans cut their spending by 0.2% in January from the previous month, the Commerce Department said Friday, likely in part because of unseasonably cold weather. Yet the retreat may be hinting at more caution by consumers amid rising economic uncertainty. Inflation declined to 2.5% in January compared with a year earlier, down from 2.6% in December, the government said. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices dropped to 2.6%, the lowest since June, from 2.9%. One other bright spot in the report was that incomes jumped 0.9% in January from December, fueled in part by a large annual cost of living adjustment for Social Security beneficiaries. Inflation spiked in 2022 to its highest level in four decades, propelling President Donald Trump to the White House and causing the Federal Reserve to rapidly raise interest rates to tame prices. It has since fallen from a peak of 7.2%. Last month’s decline could reassure Fed officials that inflation is still slowly cooling. The Fed prefers Friday’s measure to the more widely-known consumer price index, which rose for the fourth straight month in January to 3%. Friday’s gauge calculates inflation slightly differently: For example, it puts less weight on the costs of housing and used cars. Even so, the key question preoccupying many American consumers, investors, and business executives is whether Trump’s extensive tariff proposals will push prices higher in the coming months. Trump said Thursday he will double his recently-announced tariffs on Chinese imports to 20%, and will impose 25% import taxes on Canada and Mexico next Tuesday. The three countries are the United States’ top trading partners. Trump is also calling for widespread layoffs of federal workers, which could cause hundreds of thousands of job losses and potentially lift the unemployment rate. “Increased uncertainty surrounding trade, fiscal and regulatory policy is casting a shadow over the outlook,” said Lydia Boussour, a senior economist at accounting and consulting firm EY. Americans also likely cut back on their spending after a healthy winter holiday season that saw a surge in credit card debt in December, economists noted. On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.3% in January from the previous month, matching December’s 0.3% increase. Core prices rose 0.3%, up from 0.2% in December. If sustained, January’s increases would keep inflation running above the Fed’s target. The Fed pays more attention to core prices because they provide a better read of future inflation. A big concern right now is whether tariffs will push up inflation, or slow the economy, or — in a particularly toxic combination — both. A report from the Federal Reserve’s Boston branch this month concluded that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, along with Trump’s initial 10% import taxes on China, could lift core inflation by as much as 0.8 percentage points.

Log in to hide these messages. The last time Trump imposed tariffs in 2018-19, inflation was largely unaffected — but those tariffs were on a much narrower range of goods. And the economy still slowed, prompting the Fed to cut interest rates. Worries about tariffs pushing prices higher have sent consumer confidence plunging, unwinding the modest gains that had occurred after the election. Americans are also expecting inflation to move higher in the coming months. That’s a risky trend because if consumers and businesses expect higher prices, they may act in ways to lift inflation, such as accelerating their purchases and boosting demand.

    "title": "Ron DeSantis Talks Up Wife As Next Florida Governor Over Trump's Pick",
    "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — As Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis approaches the end of his second term in office, he’s talking up one potential heir to succeed him in 2026: his wife, Casey DeSantis. And he’s taking a shot at President Donald Trump ’s pick to be the next governor. Questioned by reporters in Tampa on Monday, DeSantis touted his wife as a staunch conservative who would build on his legacy and argued that the state’s first lady could pull in even more voters than he did. DeSantis won a dominant reelection victory in 2022 with a nearly 20-point margin. “She’s somebody that has, I think, the intestinal fortitude and the dedication to conservative principles,” DeSantis said of his wife. “Anything we’ve accomplished, she’d be able to take to the next level.” The comments came days after the president threw his support behind U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican who has been a prominent surrogate for Trump on the campaign trail and cable news. “We’ve achieved victories in Florida,” DeSantis said Monday. “A guy like Byron, he just hasn’t been a part of any of the victories that we’ve had here over the left over these last years.” DeSantis’ comments create a potential faceoff between the Republican governor and the president who soundly defeated him last year for the Republican presidential nomination. DeSantis, who is term-limited, may run for president again in 2028 and has worked to rebuild his relationship with Trump. The aspirations of the state’s first lady have long been the subject of Tallahassee parlor talk. That chatter has grown louder in recent weeks as tensions have bubbled between the governor and Trump’s allies in the Florida Legislature. “Byron Donalds would be a truly Great and Powerful Governor for Florida and, should he decide to run, will have my Complete and Total Endorsement,” Trump wrote Thursday on social media. “RUN, BYRON, RUN!” In a statement shared by a spokesperson on Tuesday, Donalds said “I am honored to have President Trump’s complete and total endorsement.” He addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference last week after Trump’s post and told the audience to “stay tuned” about his future plans.

    "title": "What We Know So Far About The Deaths Of Gene Hackman And Betsy Arakawa",
    "text": "Investigators on Friday pored over evidence found around the partially mummified bodies of Oscar-winner Gene Hackman and his wife at their New Mexico home as officials awaited the results of autopsies. A maintenance worker reported the deaths of Hackman, 95, and Betsy Arakawa, 65, on Wednesday, according to a Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office search warrant affidavit. Investigators are still working to determine what caused the deaths, though they said they don’t suspect foul play. Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in which he played an array of heroes and villains in films including “The French Connection,” “Hoosiers” and “Superman” from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s. Hackman and his wife apparently had been dead for days or even a couple of weeks when investigators found their bodies while searching the couple’s Santa Fe home on Wednesday, authorities said. Their bodies were decomposing, with mummification in Arakawa’s hands and feet, according to the search warrant affidavit. Hackman’s body showed similar signs, it said. Hackman’s body was found in the home’s entryway and Arakawa’s was found in a bathroom. Dr. Philip Keen, the retired chief medical examiner in Maricopa County, Arizona, said it’s not rare for a body to mummify. The rate of mummification depends on the amount of moisture in the air, along with factors like altitude and body type, Keen said. Santa Fe is in the driest region of the U.S. at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,194 meters). Still, Keen said you can’t draw conclusions about the time of death based on mummification: “It doesn’t tell you much.” The search warrant affidavit said a maintenance worker called 911 after spotting the bodies at the couple’s home. He reported the home’s front door was open when he arrived to do routine work, a detective wrote. In a recording of the 911 call, though, the worker said he could see Arakawa lying on the floor through a window but was unable to get inside. Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza told NBC’s “Today” show that investigators were trying to sort out conflicting stories about the doors. He said several doors were unlocked and a rear door was open, which allowed two dogs that survived to go in and out. He also said he thinks the front door was closed but unlocked. A dead German shepherd was found in a kennel near Arakawa, Mendoza said Thursday. No foul play was suspected, authorities said, though investigators wrote in the warrant that they thought the deaths were “suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.” The New Mexico Gas Co. tested gas lines at the home but didn’t find any signs of problems at the time, according to the warrant. An investigator noted people may not show signs of poisoning if they are exposed to gas leaks or carbon monoxide, but that there weren’t signs of a leak at the home. Autopsy results were still pending Friday. Hackman appeared in a broad range of movie roles dating back to 1961, when he debuted in “Mad Dog Coll.” Through the next four decades, his roles including arch nemesis Lex Luthor in the “Superman” movies and the iconic coach in “Hoosiers” helped put Hackman in the spotlight. He was a five-time Oscar nominee who won best actor in a leading role for “The French Connection” in 1972 and best actor in a supporting role for “Unforgiven” two decades later. He also won praise for his role as a coach finding redemption in the sentimental favorite “Hoosiers.” Hackman demurred from the pomp of celebrity and was considered an actor’s actor who focused on the job and not his image, dodging social circuit appearances beyond some award ceremonies. As a boy, films offered Hackman an escape from a tumultuous home life with an abusive father who left the family when Hackman was 13. Sympathy and admiration for Hackman poured in from Hollywood legends including director Francis Ford Coppola, actor-director Clint Eastwood and actor Bill Murray. Murray worked with Hackman on director Wes Anderson’s 2001 film “The Royal Tenenbaums.” Hackman gave young directors such as Anderson a hard time but brought skill to the set, Murray said. “I watched him once do, like, 25 takes where he did it perfectly with an actor who kept blowing it every single time,” Murray told The Associated Press. “He was a great one. He was a great actor.” Actor Cary Elwes called Hackman a “force of nature.” “Growing up on his movies was an absolute thrill for me,” Elwes said on Instagram. “To observe his remarkable facility and humanity in every role was something to behold.” Everything you ever wanted to learn about acting can be found in any of Hackman’s performances, actor Steve Toussaint posted on Instagram. ″‘The French Connection.’ ‘Crimson Tide,’ ‘The Conversation.’ Gosh! I could go on,” Toussaint wrote. Arakawa was born in Hawaii in December 1959 and grew up in Honolulu. She studied piano and, as an 11-year-old sixth grader, performed in youth concerts in front of thousands of students at the Honolulu International Center Concert Hall, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported in 1971. Arakawa attended the University of Southern California from 1981 through 1983, the university said in an email. While in Los Angeles, she was a cheerleader for the Aztecs, a professional soccer team in the North American Soccer League, and worked as a production assistant on the television game show “Card Sharks,” the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported in 1981. The classically trained pianist met Hackman while working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s. They soon moved in together and relocated to Santa Fe by the end of the decade. Arakawa was vice president of Pandora’s, a home decor and furnishing store in Santa Fe, according to New Mexico business records. Their Pueblo revival home, a style typical in the area, sits on a hill in a gated with views of the Rocky Mountains far from Hollywood. The area is known as a preferred location among artists and a retreat for celebrities. The home was featured in a 1990 article by Architectural Digest. The four-bedroom, 8,700-square-foot (808-square-meter) structure on 6 acres (2.4 hectares) had an estimated market value of a little over $4 million, according to Santa Fe County property tax records. Hackman often was seen around the historic state capital. His hobbies included painting, deep-sea diving and, later in life, writing novels. The couple enjoyed watching DVDs that Arakawa would rent, Hackman told the film magazine Empire in a 2009 interview. In his later years, Hackman was seen far less in public. Papers reported sightings of Hackman in mundane scenarios, such as when The New York Post detailed the former actor pumping gas and getting a chicken sandwich at Wendy’s in 2023. ___ Billeaud reported from Phoenix.

    "title": "Mother Of 6-Year-Old Palestinian American Boy Killed In Alleged Hate Crime Testifies At Trial",
    "text": "JOLIET, Ill. (AP) — A suburban Chicago Muslim mother described to jurors Tuesday how she hid in a locked bathroom and called 911 after her landlord brutally attacked her with a knife and then fatally stabbed her Palestinian American son in another room. Hanan Shaheen was the first witness to testify at the murder and hate crime trial of 73-year-old Joseph Czuba. He is charged with wounding Shaheen and killing her six-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi in October of 2023. Authorities said Czuba targeted the family because of their Islamic faith and as a response to the war between Israel and Hamas that erupted on Oct. 7, 2023 with a Hamas attack on southern Israel. Prosecutors played the emotional 911 call Shaheen made to report the crime that happened just days after the war started. “The landlord is killing me and my baby!” she screamed to the dispatcher multiple times, according to a recording of the call played in court. “He’s killing my baby in another room!” Czuba has pleaded not guilty to three counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder and other charges. He wore a suit and tie to court, his greying hair falling past his shoulders. Later it was tied into a bun. Czuba did not speak as he watched the proceedings. Will County Public Defender Kylie Blatti urged jurors to consider each piece of evidence carefully because key parts were missing. “Go beyond the emotions to carefully examine the evidence,” Blatti said during opening statements. “It is easy to get lost in the horror of those images.” The family had been renting two rooms from Czuba and his wife, who also lived at the home where the murder happened in suburban Plainfield, nearly 40 miles from Chicago. Prosecutor Michael Fitzgerald, a Will County assistant state’s attorney, told jurors they’d hear explicit details about the crime including how Czuba removed a knife from his belt holder and attacked the family. Fitzgerald described each of the 26 stab wounds to the boy’s body. “He could not escape,” Fitzgerald said facing jurors during opening statements. “If it wasn’t enough that this defendant killed that little boy, he left the knife in the little boy’s body.” Shaheen testified at the courthouse in suburban Joliet, about 45 miles from Chicago, that she had not previously had any issues in the two years they had rented from the Czubas. They shared a kitchen and living room with the Czubas in the home. Then after the start of the war, Czuba told her that they had to move out because Muslims were not welcome. She urged him to “Pray for peace.” Later, he confronted Shaheen and attacked her, holding her down, stabbing her and trying to break her teeth. “He told me ’You, as a Muslim, must die,” said Shaheen, who mainly testified in English but had an Arabic translator on standby in her primary language. She occasionally turned to the translator for clarification while testifying. But during cross examination, she sought more direct translation often addressing her translator who sat next to her instead of attorneys. Defense attorney George Lenard asked detailed questions about conversations she had with police at the scene and while she was in the hospital, but Shaheen said she didn’t remember specifics. At times it appeared as though she had trouble understanding what Lenard was getting at. After the attack, Shaheen said was scared and locked herself in the bathroom, noting blood all over her body and the room. She called 911 when she heard her son screaming in another room. Yelling could be heard on the background of the call, which Shaheen said was her son. As the roughly 15-minute recording played in court, Shaheen put her head down, clutching a tissue paper in her hand. Attorneys showed photos of her bloodied face at the hospital. The boy — whose name was initially spelled Wadea Al-Fayoume by authorities — was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Shaheen had more than a dozen stab wounds and it took her weeks to recover. The attack on the family in Plainfield renewed worries of anti-Muslim discrimination in the Chicago area’s large and established Palestinian community. The proceedings also come amid rising hostility against Muslims and Palestinians in the U.S. since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023. Hundreds attended the boy’s janazah, or funeral service, where the boy was remembered as kind and into sports and Legos. In January, Shaheen met with then-President Joe Biden. Separately, the father of the boy, who is divorced from Shaheen and did not live at the home, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit. He attended the court proceedings Tuesday along with an uncle. Shaheen, who has also filed another civil lawsuit, has retained prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump. He said Shaheen would not talk to reporters during the trial, which is expected to last about a week. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Makeup Artists Say This 1 Kind Of Mascara Will Make Your Eyes Pop",
    "text": "So much about makeup technique boils down to color theory; once you harness that understanding, you can make a big impact with limited effort. Case in point, mascara. No longer a product sold solely in black, mascara comes in all sorts of unexpected colors, which, according to makeup artists, you should strongly consider adding to your repertoire. Tomy Rivero, a New York City- and Los Angeles-based celebrity makeup artist tells HuffPost that strategically selecting a colored mascara can make eyes appear brighter, enhance their natural color and bring focus to the upper half of the face. “With colored mascara, you are in control of how bold or subtle you want the focus on the eyes,” he said. “It’s also a great way to be creative and express some individuality if you’re starting to have hooded eyes and eyeshadows are not really visible.” Rivero understands that for someone who always has stuck to the more conventional shades of mascara, venturing out to other colors might seem intimidating. “You don’t have to start with the crazy colors. Navy, burgundy and deep purple can almost go undetected from afar so start there,” Rivero suggested. Additionally, certain mascara shades go well with certain eye colors. For instance, Rivero said teals and navy intensify the tones in green and hazel eyes. “Let the mascara be the star and keep the rest of your face natural,” he said. Find the right mascara shade and formula for you in the list ahead, which includes some of Rivero’s favorite options, as well as some of our own picks. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. Best for: all eye colors It's pretty common knowledge that brown mascara is widely complementary to nearly every eye color. This deep chocolate brown mascara by HuffPost editor-loved brand Saie could be a good color choice if you're afraid to venture too far away from the standard black. It can also be a more natural-looking alternative for those with light-colored eyelashes. This clean-certified formula claims to be great for achieving feathery lashes that are lengthened and lifted, without looking or feeling stiff or clumpy. It uses lash-coating beeswax to create length, lash-nourishing shea butter and a mineral complex that promises to be great for strengthening lashes. Best for: blue, green and hazel eyes If a more subtle look is what you're after, Westman Atelier's clean and vegan mascara formula has got you covered. It's a natural-to-bold buildable mascara that focuses on lash definition and length. A blend of carnauba and candelilla waxes gives the mascara a creamy texture and flake-free finish while plant-derived ester means this soft neutral brown shade looks pigmented, rich and long-lasting. Sephora reviewers claim to love it for it's smooth and non-clumpy texture that doesn't budge. Best for: green and blue eyes New York City-based celebrity makeup artist Tobi Henney said that L'Oréal's Voluminous line of colored mascaras are a great option to experiment with, especially since they're at such a great price point. The Voluminous mascara also happens to be my mascara of choice and I can attest that the formula is a great budget-friendly option that doesn't flake and genuinely adds length and volume to my lashes, without feeling weighed down. I also really love this classic applicator brush because it's packed with tiny bristles that separate my lashes. According to Rivero, purple-hued mascaras such as this berry-violet shade really make blue eyes come to life. Best for: blue and green eyes If the above purple color is a bit too adventurous for your taste, this shade from the Lancôme Hypnôse line is a muted amethyst with burgundy undertones. In addition to creating buildable, plush volume, this wax-free mascara has a serum-infused formula containing eight amino acids, shea butter and a deep conditioning balm to help revitalize and strengthen lashes over time — ingredients that help to justify the more luxurious price point. Best for: hazel and brown eyes According to Henney, deep greens can complement hazel and brown eyes and this emerald shade is a great option. It's the same creamy L'Oréal Voluminous formula that Henney mentioned earlier and that I'm a personal fan of. And though I've never tried this shade out for myself, reviewers insist it's the perfect subtle evergreen hue that's \"not too light and not too dark.\" Best for: all eye colors. Every skin care or makeup product that I've tried from Sephora's in-house Collection line, I've been extremely impressed with. That's why I selected this vibrant and ultra-pigmented cobalt blue shade to feature. The jumbo plush brush is strategically hourglass-shaped to fully coat not only those longer lashes but also those tiny ones along the lash line that are still in the middle of their growth cycle. The vegan formula promises to lengthen, thicken and help lashes keep their curl. According to Rivero, bright cobalt shades like this one \"look great on everyone.\" Best for: all colors, especially green, brown and hazel eyes. As an option that's very close to a true black, this gentle-formula Covergirl mascara is an intense black shade with navy blue undertones, a perfect choice for almost any eye color — and for anyone who wants something different from their everyday mascara without anything too distracting or vibrant. It's enhanced with aloe leaf extract, nourishing maracuja oil and ceramides, which are essential lipids capable of leaving lashes nourished and cared for. Best for: green eyes \"Green eyes look stunning with plum [colors],\" Rivero said. Based on his suggestion, we scoured the internet for this one shade marketed as a true plum color. Benefit Cosmetics has often been associated with some very recognizable mascaras (does Roller Lash and They're Real! ring a bell?) including the BadGal Bang, an intensely volumizing and water-resistant formula that prides itself on its ability to create fullness without the flaking or the smudging. Fans of this mascara also appreciate the long and narrow brush that helps keep application precise. Best for: all eye colors, especially green Rivero noted that teal mascara, while complimentary of all eye colors, pops particularly well on green eyes. Teal mascara is actually tougher to find than you would think, but we found this option by TikTok-famous indie makeup brand Half Magic. It's a tubing mascara, which means the polymers individually envelop lashes to help create dramatic length and definition, while also promising a resilient performance. Best for: hazel eyes \"The Hermès Revitalizing Care mascara in Rouge H is a rich understated burgundy that's stunning on hazel eyes,\" Rivero said of this truly opulent mascara that's composed of 97% natural ingredients and claims to have protective and lengthening properties. According to the brand, the formula containing moringa seed extract, shea and moringa butter makes lashes appear denser and more defined, while the ultra-fine technical wand deposits the perfect amount of product onto lashes. Also according to the luxury maker, Rouge H is Hermès' house heritage color that has hints of cherry brown. If you want a much more affordable alternative this burgundy shade from the L'Oréal Voluminous line is loved by Amazon reviewers.

    "title": "Dermatologists Reveal Why You May Want To Switch To A Foaming Oil Cleanser",
    "text": "Those with dry, sensitive skin know all too well that tight and squeaky feeling that often happens post-cleanse. This is especially the case when using a foaming facial wash most likely containing surfactants that, although effective at thoroughly removing impurities, tend to strip skin of natural oils and good bacteria. Dr. Noah Gratch, a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology in New York City, said that the innovation of foaming oil cleansers — which are washes that start off as an oil then work up into a rich foaming lather — can offer both a deep clean and a dose of moisture. “A foaming oil cleanser can provide a deeper clean than traditional cleansers, while keeping the skin hydrated,” Gratch said. “The oil in these formulations can break down oil-based residues from makeup and help balance the skin’s oil levels.” This is due to the “like dissolves like” theory, a general rule of thumb previously explained to us by a dermatologist. Typically, compounds will dissolve in like compounds. In this case, oil is highly successful at breaking down excess oil, sunscreens, makeup and other debris on the skin. If you’ve already looked into foaming oil cleansers, you may have noticed they’re slightly challenging to find. This is because, according to a previous interview with cosmetic chemist Javon Ford, they can be difficult to formulate. Fortunately, now more than ever, there are a few oil-to-foam cleansers available on the market, which you can shop for yourself down below. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. More than likely, you've seen (or even used for yourself) the original CeraVe's hydrating cleanser, a creamy and non-foaming formulation that's been one of the most dermatologist-recommended facial washes for those with dry and sensitive skin. The brand recently launched this foaming oil version, which like all of CeraVe's products, contains three ceramides that are essential for maintaining a healthy skin barrier. This also contains hyaluronic acid for drawing moisture into the skin and squalane oil, a nourishing ingredient that board-certified dermatologist Dr. Brendan Camp suggested looking for in foaming oil cleansers. The adored French pharmacy brand La Roche-Posay formulates this cleanser that has a luscious oil-to-foam texture, a deeply hydrating shea butter base and prebiotic thermal spring water, a brand-signature inclusion that's rich in antioxidants. It also contains niacinamide, a popular ingredient that's good for everything from brightening dull skin to managing excess oil production. Using a barrier-repairing lipid complex, a plumping blend of seaweed hyaluronate and moisture-locking aloe leaf juice, this hydrating and milky foaming oil cleanser by SkinFix can eliminate impurities without stripping the skin. In fact, this soothing formula claims to visibly reduce redness and blotchiness, increase softness and skin hydration as well as target irregular skin texture. Also by SkinFix is this foaming oil cleanser for the face and body, made specifically for eczema-prone and hyper sensitive skin. It features a prebiotic formula that promises to deliver lasting support to the skin's moisture barrier, along with glycerin, a highly effective humectant that draws moisture into the skin, and colloidal oatmeal, a trusted ingredient for relieving itchiness and redness associated with eczema. Dermalogica's clinical-grade cleanser starts off as a unique gel-oil texture before lathering in a dense foam that melts away pollutants, greasy sunscreen and stubborn makeup. It contains a plant-derived prebiotic that attracts moisture to the skin, sodium cocoyl glutamate, a mild cleansing agent, and sea buckthorn oil, an oil that's rich in the antioxidant vitamin E, which can help ward off environmental stressors that potentially cause premature skin aging. This Korean-formulated cleanser contains three different oils — notably jojoba oil, an anti-inflammatory rich in vitamin E that can also draw moisture into the skin. The rich foam also has alpha hydroxy acids for mild exfoliation and skin refining, as well as fermented extracts that can help moisturize skin. Peach & Lily, the K-beauty brand that helped make \"glass skin\" the one of most coveted skin care trends of the last few years, makes this oil to foam cleanser that has the unique inclusion of micro-bubbles to help deep clean pores. It uses coconut fruit extract to dissolve impurities, calming aloe vera and a variety of flower extracts that claim to offer anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties to the skin. Another Korean oil-to-foam cleanser is this option, which has 4.6 out of 5 stars on Amazon and comes in seven different formulations. Choose from a brightening rose vitamin complex, a calming blue tansy for irritated skin, an imperial caviar formula, which claims to boost collagen production, a cica biome oil foam that contains centella asiatica oil for soothing and reducing redness and several more.

    "title": "The Best Retinol Creams To Turn Back Time On Your Hands",
    "text": "Despite being a lifelong skin care obsessive, I am notorious for indulging in facial products while utterly neglecting the rest of my body. But given that the skin on our entire bodies is also aging, being exposed to the elements and working hard to protect us, it deserves a bit of care as well. And while active skin care ingredients may be more commonly used in facial products, there are a fair amount of body products that also incorporate skin-loiving ingredients to help with all kinds of issues. Hand cream, in particular, is a great way to dabble in skin care-forward body care. And given that few things give away our age quite like our hands, it’s not a bad idea to invest in products that are made to help keep our hands looking and feeling soft, supple and youthful. Harnessing the power of ingredients like retinol and applying it to other parts of the body just might be the secret weapon we’ve all been looking for. In previous reporting, Dr. Y. Claire Chang, a board-certified cosmetic dermatologist at Union Square Laser Dermatology, explained that retinol creams can “help increase epidermal thickening, promote collagen synthesis and decrease collagen breakdown in photo-aged skin.” By adding retinol to a hand cream (which is typically thicker than body moisturizers, due to having a higher oil content), you can enjoy the same benefits as you would with a face cream like the ability to possibly help prevent and soften wrinkles, smooth uneven texture and improve the overall complexion of your paws. Below, we’ve curated a list of highly-rated, reviewer beloved hand creams with retinol. They’re available at a varying range of price points from retailers like Amazon, Nordstrom, Sephora, Target and more. It’s an easy way to add some extra oomph to your everyday hand cream and enjoy the added benefits with minimal effort. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Lock in that anti-aging and hydrating goodness with this ultra-moisturizing overnight cream from Gold Bond. The retinol-peptide complex can help to lift, tighten and moisturize skin without leaving you feeling greasy or with the irritation that can commonly accompany retinol usage. Pop it on your hands (and beyond) and start to see and feel the difference. While not explicitly a hand cream, reviewers noted that it is just the right texture for hands and leaves their hands looking and feeling as good as new. Promising review: \"It's light and smooth, very comfortable and nonirritating. I use it mostly on my hands and neck. It feels light and very comfortable and it has no scent which is great for those who are sensitive to that. For the price and the amount you get for a body lotion that have great ingredients including retinol and vitamins i say its worth the try and see how much improvement it gives to the look of your hands and/or neck. I havent used it on my other parts of my body since im using a diff product with retinol on my face. They also ship it with tape on the opening so it wouldnt spill out which is great.\" — Emie NatureWell uses advanced micro-encapsulated retinol to help improve skin tone, smoothing texture and boosting firmness and elasticity. The pump dispenser delivers the right amount so you don't worry about wasting product, and helps to lengthen the cream's product life. It's incredibly popular on Amazon, boasting 4.5 out of 5 stars and over 12,100 ratings. It's also the most affordable option on this list and the most versatile, as it can be used on hands, face and body. It's just rich enough to use all over without feeling too greasy, though reviewers find it's great for hands and arms.Promising review: \"Nice smell works well on lighting the spot on my hands and a couple of spots on my face.\" — Kathleen K. Goodman \"Reduces crepey skin. For 1 week I only put it on my left arm and after a week you can see the difference. The left arm looks so much better and is so much softer than the right.\" — Debi V. This is the one everyone's talking about. Not only is this night cream for hands formulated with top-notch anti-aging ingredients, but it comes in the cutest reusable vessel I've ever seen. It's a great option for anyone who is serious about repairing and renewing their hands. The cream has a medium-weight density that is soft and slightly waxy, so those who are prone to touching their face or don't like the feeling of freshly lotioned skin might not love it. But if you don't mind it, then your hands will thank you in the long run. It's infused with retinol, colloidal oatmeal and panthenol so you can wake up with youthful, beautiful hands daily. Promising review: \"In love with this product! I've only been using this product for a few weeks and see a difference already. I'm 60 years old and produce food videos so I'm very conscious of the appearance of my 'mature' hands. Theraplush has absolutely enhanced the overall smoothness and texture; so impressed with this lovely cream! I would recommend this product to: Anyone who is aware of the importance of taking extra care of their hands!\" — Sheri The glowing reviews speak for themselves when it comes to this anti-aging hand cream. It deeply conditions not just hands, but nails and cuticles as well, drenching the entire area with vitamins and retinol. It boasts a rich and creamy formula that feels luxurious but won't break the bank, so you can show off youthful-looking skin with minimal effort. Just be aware that it has a nostalgic scent that might not be for everyone!Promising review: \"I like the moisture and lively texture of my hands. Before they looked dry and older because of all the hand sanitizer I have used over the last 3 years. Now they look healthy and feels so soft, and I don’t mind shaking hands if needed.\" — Nene Love it\"I really like this hand lotion. I am 36 and a hairdresser so my hands get a beating daily. I’ve noticed them aging so I wanted something to help slow that. This lotion feels very soft when you put it on. My kids did comment that it smells like a Grandma. And I think it kind of does smell like it too. Not a bad smell just does have a distinctive smell. I do like it!\" — Karen Get all the benefits of a deeply moisturizing, rich hand cream with the added power of encapsulated retinol with this Beauty Pie cream. It can help with common signs of hand aging, targeting dark spots, smoothing and elasticity. Throw it on before bed and wake up to baby-soft hands.Promising review: \"A must for older hands. Wonderful night time hand treatment for aged hands. Helps with age spots and crepey skin. Also very moisturising without being sticky.\" — Mary For a fairly high concentration of retinol, consider this hand serum from Nécessaire. it has 0.25% of retinol alongside peptides, AHAs, amino acids, vitamins and glycerin to hydrate deeply. It's a great option for anyone looking to treat or prevent crepey skin, dark spots, scars and even ragged cuticles. You'll feel like you just stepped out of a nail salon every morning. Promising review: \"Absolute wonder! I bought this based on a dermatologist's recommendation, and it really delivers! After a very short time my hands look and feel so much better! I was starting to notice my hands were looking older, and this has really helped.\" — ROinCo I came upon this Robanda retinol hand cream during my research and was intrigued by the fact that it contains SPF alongside retinol. Along with antioxidants, it helps to infuse the skin with anti-aging ingredients and can improve the look of wrinkles and sun damage while leaving skin healthy, smooth and safe from the sun's harmful UV rays.Promising reviews: \"Love the creme. Daughter asked to try it and as she was going back home to CT, called for the exact name and a picture. She loved it also. Works good on old hands. Of course mine are a lot older than hers.\" — Aging\"I have a stress eczema on my hands. This cream healed my hands in 3(!) days! Now I recommend it to everyone! And use the crème on daily basis.\" — Oyuka If you want something a little less intense than an overnight treatment, try this luxurious hand cream that can be used regularly throughout the day. It's made with retinol and Chilean tree bark extract alongside antioxidants and other hydrating ingredients, so you get all the benefits of a retinol, but it's gentle enough to use regularly. Promising review: \"Best hand cream ever! I've tried every hand cream under the sun and this one is the best by far. My hands were looking very old and wrinkly one winter so I bought this and literally overnight I had hands that looked 20 years younger. The difference was incredible! The thing that impresses me the most is it's effectiveness, but it's also feels very nice to use. It goes on light -- not greasy at all. it's very quickly absorbed but you still feel like your hands are soft so there is no need to keep reapplying all day like with other hand creams. I use it once in the morning and once at night and that's enough. It's pricey but lasts a long time because you don't need to use a lot of it -- 1 tube lasts me all winter.\" — Productjunkie1 Made with retinol, antioxidants and shea butter, this skin-smoothing treatment lotion gives you all the benefits of a retinol cream like encouraging cell renewal, reducing the look of uneven skin and boosting hydration. Just note that it's on the richer side, so make sure that's the texture and finish you prefer. Heads up: It's available at Dermstore but you'll get the best deal on it by nabbing it from the official Paula's Choice website while it's 20% off.Promising review: \"I have only been using it for a week so haven't seen a change in my skin tone but it has already made the texture better. Also, it goes on so smooth, absorbs well and doesn't leave a greasy residue. And it hasn't made my skin get the red and dry early retinol use look. If it does as well with my skin tone, I will definitely purchase it again.\" — Leah If you don't like a greasy feel, check out this lightweight moisturizer that's infused with 0.05% retinol. It works alongside ceramides, shea butter and squalane to drench your hands in nourishing, hydrating ingredients that can help to give hands a more youthful, supple, firm and even appearance. That's a whole lot of skin care benefits for a product under $25! Note: It's on sale at Target for about 18% off for Target Circle members (it's free to join, btw)! Grab it there if you can.Promising review: \"Great lotion! As I am getting older I am looking for more products that can help me in the long run. This [cocokind] retinol cream is really making a difference. I use this every other evening after my shower. I have really noticed a difference in the way my skin feels. It is so soft and supple. I am a fan for life!\" — Anghess By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "'Beyond The Gates' Is The Newest Daytime Soap Opera And It's Already Making Waves",
    "text": "Can you believe it’s been over a quarter of a century since daytime soap operas have seen a new addition? Well, it’s been even longer since the focus has turned to a Black family, which is almost a shock considering the gains made from diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the entertainment industry (although it remains to be seen if such progress continues under the anti-DEI Trump administration). Still, the latest update to CBS’s daytime television lineup is determined to make its mark — and fittingly enough, during Black History Month. Enter “Beyond the Gates”: the first one-hour daytime drama centering a Black family in decades and the first daytime soap to premiere since 1999’s “Passions.” CBS Studios picked up the show last April under its production partnership with the NAACP. The series follows a wealthy Black family, the Duprees, who reside in an affluent gated community in Maryland, just outside of Washington, D.C. The series doesn’t focus on the complex politics happening on Capitol Hill, though, but rather on the complicated dynamics of a prestigious clan that exudes Black excellence, at least on the outside. The real mess happens behind closed doors, as the posh walls of Fairmont Crest conceal scandalous secrets just waiting to seep out. “Beyond the Gates” is true to the daytime soap formula. There’s jaw-dropping drama, over-the-top antics, forbidden romances, intricate plots, vile villains and more. And this only sums up the first week of episodes, which kicked off on Monday at 2 p.m. ET/1 p.m. PT on CBS. (The show is also available to stream live and on demand on Paramount+.) HuffPost’s Erin E. Evans and Njera Perkins chatted about our initial impressions of the soap, its history-making moment, the cast that leads the show and all the drama that ensues between their characters. “Beyond the Gates” may be a daytime soap unlike we’ve ever seen before, but it features a handful of familiar faces that have added to the excitement of this series for months. There’s “As the World Turns” and “Law & Order: SVU” alum Tamara Tunie, who stars as Anita, the matriarch of the esteemed Dupree family, and TV veteran Clifton Davis (“Amen,” “Madam Secretary”), who plays the Dupree family patriarch, Vernon. Karla Mosley, who plays the fiery divorcée Dani, is no stranger to daytime television, as she’s best known for playing Maya Avant on “The Bold and the Beautiful.” Daphne Duplaix, who stars as Dani’s sister, has had a long-running acting career that includes a role on the retired ABC soap “One Life to Live.” Some may also recognize Timon Kyle Durrett, who plays another villain-esque character following his credits on “Queen Sugar,” “Single Ladies” and other shows. The new CBS soap also boasts a cast of fresh faces like Brandon Claybon, Sean Freeman, Marquita Goings, RhonniRose Mantilla, Ambyr Michelle and more. Altogether, this cast makes up the Dupree family and their affiliates, a multigenerational group that reflects the aim of “Beyond the Gates” to reach a wide audience. However, the focus remains on the affluent and drama-filled Black family that viewers have been waiting to see grace their screens ever since the new soap was announced. Personally, I’ve been waiting for a Black-led show to take the reins of the daytime soap opera genre ever since Tyler Perry took over primetime with his iterations (“Sistas,” “The Oval,” etc.), so I’m thrilled that “Beyond the Gates” has claimed that torch. Tunie and Davis’ characters have quiet presences on the show so far, but I look forward to seeing how they turn things up as the plot progresses. The younger actors who are a part of this bunch have been interesting to follow as well. However, Mosley’s diva portrayal is the obvious standout right now and the main driver behind much of the juicy drama that takes place in the first week of episodes. She comes out of the gate swinging in the series premiere and doesn’t hold back in any other scene with her melodramatic outbursts and zingers. (I’m also thinking of that slap scene with Goings’ Hayley). I say all that to say this cast works, and I can’t wait to see what else they do with this material. — Njera I’m so happy to see a mix of familiar faces and newcomers on this show. I still miss the great Tamara Tunie popping up on my screen in episodes of “Law & Order: SVU.” But it’s lovely to see her get some leading lady treatment here. I also recognize Trisha Mann-Grant from “The Family Business” on BET+. I loved to hate Durrett’s character on “Queen Sugar”; he was also a cheater on that show! Kim Coleman is the casting director of the series, and let me tell you — she is one of the hardest working women in Hollywood. I’ve seen her name pop up so many times on shows and films with majority Black casts. “Cross,” “The Upshaws,” “Lovecraft Country,” “P-Valley” and a bunch of Tyler Perry productions — Coleman is booked and always busy. I will say there are SO many characters on this show so it does take a minute to parse out who is who and who is related to who. But that’s how soap operas are! They need a bunch of characters to stir up a bunch of mess; that way, you never know what to expect. But you’re right, Njera, Mosley’s portrayal is the exact kind of character I always think of when I picture a soap opera: dramatic, messy and somewhat predictable in how outlandish they will act in any scenario. — Erin I had never really thought about the fact that networks aren’t really clamoring to make new soap operas until the announcement of “Beyond the Gates,” which is the first new daytime soap opera to debut since “Passions” in 1999. (I was more of a “Sunset Beach” fan myself, which lasted only for two seasons and began in 1997. My mom recorded “All My Children” on her VCR at least until 2000.) “Beyond the Gates” is also the first soap opera to center a Black family since NBC’s “Generations.” I’m glad to see this series enter the daytime TV lineup simply because I looooove a messy show with low stakes that I can just put on in the background. — Erin I’d like to think “Beyond the Gates” is the kind of soap my grandmother would’ve loved to see if she were still alive. Her daily soaps were the highlight of her day, and given that “Beyond the Gates” is set just an hour away from our hometown of Baltimore, she would’ve eaten this concept right up. It feels criminal to say a Black family hasn’t been the center of a daytime soap since before the 21st century, but CBS’s newest addition brings that chapter to a close. And happily so, because it’s beyond time we see a family like the Duprees take up space in a genre that’s been primed for revitalization. There are some other history-making moments I want to point out, too. According to Deadline, “Beyond the Gates” is one of the very first projects that executive producer Sheila Ducksworth pitched when she was named president of CBS’s production partnership with the NAACP in 2020. The show was also created by the only Black writer for “Generations,” Michele Val Jean, who was sought out by Ducksworth specifically to head up this new project. “There are certainly other very talented writers out there, but I didn’t even once consider them. It was always Michele,” Ducksworth told Deadline. I’ve never been particularly intrigued by soaps (probably because 27-year-old me isn’t the target audience for most), but “Beyond the Gates” had me at the first mention of a Black cast and creator/writer. I guess that’s the power of seeing folks who look like me in front of and behind the camera. I’m also a huge fan of juicy mess and melodrama, so needless to say, “Beyond the Gates” is right up my alley. I didn’t know what to expect when I screened the first five episodes, but I’m officially hooked after (what will be) Friday’s cliffhanger. — Njera Since the setting of the series is a suburb of Washington, D.C., it makes perfect sense that the casting team tapped Karen Huger, the grand dame of “The Real Housewives of Potomac,” to make a cameo in the premiere episode. She portrays one of the members of the exclusive Fairmont Crest country club and witnesses the major showdown between Dani and her ex-husband’s soon-to-be wife. Her one line is delivered perfectly. The timing of the episode is also quite interesting, since this week, Huger is set to be sentenced after being convicted for a DUI. — Erin I almost forgot Karen Huger had a cameo on this show until I saw her eavesdropping on Dani and Hayley’s intense showdown at the country club. But I loved the subtle Potomac connection in this suburban Maryland setting. Although Huger only had one line, it was the perfect shady zinger to end the premiere’s mic-drop scene: “Welcome to Fairmont Crest.” I imagine Huger would deliver some version of this on an episode of “The Real Housewives of Potomac” (if she hasn’t already). — Njera Yes. There’s no question here, lol. You never know with a new TV series if it’s going to hook you in from the first episode. Pilots, notoriously, can be pretty rough to watch because you’re trying to understand who the characters are and what they’re going through and — most importantly, perhaps — if you care enough to stay tuned for more episodes. Thankfully, the first episode of “Beyond the Gates” has so much going on that you want to stick around for more. — Erin We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

Log in to hide these messages. Agreed, Erin. One thing you can’t say about “Beyond the Gates” is it lacks a healthy dose of melodrama. The first episode alone is filled with enough twists and turns to intrigue the casual viewer. The fallout of Dani and Bill’s divorce and the latter’s impending nuptials with his eldest daughter’s ex-best friend is more than enough to sink your teeth into. But as far as we can tell, there are dark family secrets, scandals waiting to happen, betrayals, revenge and everything in between still in store — all the makings of a great daytime soap. “Beyond the Gates” gets it right straight out the gate (no pun intended), so be prepared to be on the edge of your seat for tons of episodes to come. — Njera The Bill, Dani and Hayley drama are obviously running the show right now, but I think there’s way more beneath the surface of that story. For one, I need to know when Hayley decided to pursue her ex-best friend’s father while he was still married. Also, Bill’s quid pro quo way of doing business with the Duprees obviously has shady undertones, so I can’t wait to find out what he has over Vernon and Anita that made them convince the family (including Dani) to attend Bill’s wedding with Hayley. Trisha Mann-Grant’s Dana is an unsettling presence who clearly has ulterior motives (based on what happens in the fifth episode), so I’m keeping an eye out for her and her daughter, Eva, too. There are some secondary characters who raise eyebrows, too — like Freeman’s playboy character Andre — but things are just getting started. There’s a lot already happening in the show, but plenty to keep your attention — and keep you tuned in every weekday. — Njera The Bill and Dani drama is the main draw for me right now, but there are some simmering storylines that the writing staff is also leaving breadcrumbs for as well. It seems like there’s something we don’t know about the Dupree matriarch and patriarch and their history. Then, there’s the storyline with Dana and her daughter, Eva, which is very juicy, and to avoid even the hint of a spoiler, I’m just going to say I’m keeping my eyes peeled for how this storyline unfolds. — Erin By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Prices and availability are subject to change. If you have pets or kids, you know that getting their messes out of your carpets is an unenviable task, no matter how much you love them. Regular vacuum cleaners don’t always get the job done on carpets, especially for stubborn pet hair. That’s where a carpet cleaner comes in handy — and you’re in luck, because one of the hottest on the market just went on major sale. The Bissell Little Green Max Pet portable carpet cleaner is on sale at Amazon right now for just $99. That’s a 30% markdown off its usual $139.99 price. This sale won’t last long, and the Little Green cleaners have been known to sell out during big sales before, so there’s no time like the present to join the happy reviewers and get one for yourself. The Little Green Max Pet portable carpet cleaner is, well, little — it’s only a foot wide and weighs 8.2 pounds with a 32-ounce capacity water tank, making it easy to store away when you’re not using it. Still, size doesn’t equal power here: It has a triple action method of spray, scrub, and suction to get out tough messes and odors, from mud and dirt to hair, and can even self-clean its own hose and tool with one touch to save you the extra work afterward. The Little Green also has two-tank technology to keep clean and dirty water separate as you clean, so filling and emptying the tank becomes a breeze. The 15-foot cord allows you to effortlessly clean behind the couch or in those other hard-to-reach spots. Reviewers have used it on their carpets as well as on their car upholstery, and many have been amazed at how much time the Little Green Max Pet saves them because it gets stains out in just one pass.

Don’t miss your chance to grab this beloved cleaning tool at one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it — because this sale won’t last. “Our dog literally puked 8x on our carpet while we were sleeping. It smelled and was so nastyyy. Coincidentally, it was prime day so we bought this and it IS AMAZING. Easy to use, great suction, lightweight, etc. Wasn’t too bad to clean either. We might hit the spots again just to make sure everything is out but I am so pleased with this!! I am sure it works great for kid messes too!” — Prideful  “This machine is honestly way better than I imagined. It is small and light weight but it really does a wonderful job! I used it on my couch and my love seat and it worked great at!! It’s super easy to use and easy to store. It is definitely worth the price for sure! I highly recommend!!!!!!” — Haley G.  “I’ve had cats for many years. Cats puke. I’ve had two of the older models (the one that’s rounded on top) and they are basically impossible to clean and finally the last one started leaking. They worked pretty well though, so I though I’d try this one. Game changer!! Very easy to clean - the plastic is the kind that doesn’t absorb odors and everything just cleans right off. You can even run the nozzle under the faucet to clean it. Great suction and the Bissell Pet Stain and Odor Eliminator shampoo works really well, too. Gets everything out of beige carpet and leaves no perfume behind.” — Camella Miller  “Simple and easy to operate. Everything I needed it to be. Quality is top tier, very good use around the house, portable size fits everywhere I bring them for when things are out of hands in the car. Filling up and cleaning are easy, long length cord, overall great and as expected!” — Prisly Q.  “Have now used four times on difficult throw-up spots on two types of carpet. Even old spots cleaned up with no visible areas left. Most impressed with how well it cleaned a spot left after my dog ate a stick of butter she got table crusing. Never expected to see a clean rug again. I have easily covered cost of unit by eliminating professional carpet cleaners.” — Amazon Customer  “This machine is amazing!! It sucks up all the dirt and grime from the carpets/sofa (as you can see from the picture). It’s also quite easy to use and clean. I followed the instructions and had no issues at all. Also it’s not too big of a machine so I was able to store it in my linen closet. It also comes with 8oz shampoo which smells nice. Overall, I’m so glad I got it.”— Helena  By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Blake Lively Pays Tribute To 'Gossip Girl' Co-Star Michelle Trachtenberg In Sweet Post",
    "text": "Blake Lively on Wednesday shared a lengthy tribute to her “Gossip Girl” co-star Michelle Trachtenberg, who was found dead in her New York City apartment on Wednesday morning. Trachtenberg, also known for her roles in “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Harriet the Spy,” had reportedly undergone a recent liver transplant and may have experienced complications as a result. She was 39. Criminality is “not suspected” in the actor’s death and an investigation “remains ongoing,” police told HuffPost. Lively, who starred as Serena van der Woodsen on the hit teen drama, shared an image of the first day she met Trachtenberg, who played Georgina Sparks in The CW original series and later reprised the role in its recent rendition on Max. “She was electricity. You knew when she entered a room because the vibration changed. Everything she did, she did 200%,” wrote Lively on her Instagram stories alongside the snap from Season 1′s “Desperately Seeking Serena” when Georgina returns to New York City. “She laughed the fullest at someone’s joke, she faced authority head on when she felt something was wrong, she cared deeply about her work, she was proud to be a part of this community and industry, as painful as it could be sometimes.” Lively continued, “She was fiercely loyal to her friends and brave for those she loved, she was big and bold and distinctly herself.” Lively added that her late co-star always had “yummy caramel smelling lipgloss on because she didn’t just want to sparkle on camera,” she wanted to make for a nice experience for those around her down to the “subtle smell of her lipgloss because she cared about the sweet details.” “She was a kind person, through and through,” she wrote. “Time passes. You take for granted that you get the chance to see an old friend. To paraphrase, the real tragedies in life are the ones that blindside you on an idle Tuesday.” She concluded by reminding her followers to hold their loved ones dearly and noted that the world “lost a deeply sensitive and good person” in Trachtenberg. “May her work and her huge heart be remembered by those who were lucky enough to experience her first,” she continued. Other “Gossip Girl” actors honored Trachtenberg on social media including Ed Westwick, who shared a picture of his late costar alongside a prayer emoji on Instagram stories. “It’s been a long time since I’ve seen Michelle but I remember a talented, sharp, funny and warm soul,” wrote Westwick, who portrayed Chuck Bass on the show, in a statement to People magazine. “Thinking of her and the family. So sad.” Chace Crawford, known for his role as Nate Archibald on “Gossip Girl,” declared that Trachtenberg was “one of a kind” in an Instagram post featuring several snaps of the two. “I remember her coming on set for the first time and just absolutely owning it. She was a force of nature and just so so unapologetically funny and magnetic.. remembering those years with a big smile,” he wrote. “Just a terrible loss.

    "title": "‘It Ends With Us’ Star Offers Honest Take On Whether He’s ‘Team Blake Or Team Justin’",
    "text": "“It Ends with Us” actor Brandon Sklenar is speaking out about the legal turmoil that has engulfed co-stars Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively for the first time. Appearing on “CBS Mornings” Monday, Sklenar admitted he felt the ongoing discourse surrounding the 2024 movie, which explores themes of domestic violence and emotional abuse, was “unfortunate.” “I just want people to remember why we made the movie in the first place and what it stands for, and just keeping the focus on that,” he said. “That movie meant so much to me.” “I have someone very, very close to me in my life who’s gone through what [the character of] Lily’s going through for a long time, and I’ve been on the front lines helping her navigate that space,” he added. “Me doing that film gave her the strength to change her life. ... It’s unfortunate that things get taken away from what the ethos of that thing is, and it gets convoluted.” When co-host Gayle King asked Sklenar if he was “Team Blake or Team Justin,” the actor refused to pick sides. “I’m Team ‘It Ends with Us,’” he quipped. Watch a clip from Brandon Sklenar’s “CBS Mornings” interview below. Based on Colleen Hoover’s 2016 bestseller, “It Ends with Us” tells the story of Lily Bloom (played by Lively), a Boston woman who reconnects with a high school boyfriend, Atlas (Sklenar), while still in a turbulent marriage with Ryle (Baldoni, who also directed the film), a doctor prone to violent outbursts. “It Ends with Us” was a critical and commercial hit, raking in a reported $351 million at the box office worldwide. Still, Baldoni and Lively were rumored to be on the outs by the time the film opened in theaters, and in December, Lively filed a lawsuit alleging that the actor-director had sexually harassed her on set and orchestrated a smear campaign to damage her reputation. Baldoni retaliated with a $250 million libel lawsuit against The New York Times over its coverage of Lively’s allegations. After denying any wrongdoing, he also filed a $400 million countersuit against Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, alleging defamation. The dispute is scheduled to go before a judge next year. Sklenar, who currently stars in the Paramount+ series “1923,” came to Lively’s defense after the “Gossip Girl” actor was accused of not taking the film’s dark subject matter seriously in interviews and red carpet appearances. “Vilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strongly in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about,” he wrote on Instagram in August. “It is, in fact, the opposite of the point. What may or may not have happened behind the scenes does not and hopefully should not detract from what our intentions were in making this film.” “Trust me when I tell you, there isn’t a single person involved in the making of this film that was not aware of the responsibility we had in making this,” he added.

    "title": "Brazil’s Former President Bolsonaro Charged Over Alleged Coup That Included A Plan To Poison Lula",
    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil’s prosecutor-general on Tuesday formally charged former President Jair Bolsonaro with attempting a coup to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat, in a plot that included a plan to poison his successor and current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and kill a Supreme Court judge. Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet alleges that Bolsonaro and 33 others participated in a plan to remain in power. The alleged plot, he wrote, included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of the former president. “The members of the criminal organization structured a plan at the presidential palace to attack institutions, aiming to bring down the system of the powers and the democratic order, which received the sinister name of ‘Green and Yellow Dagger,’” Gonet wrote in a 272-page indictment. “The plan was conceived and taken to the knowledge of the president, and he agreed to it.” Bolsonaro is often seen in Brazil’s yellow-and-green national soccer jersey and the colors have become associated with his political movement. Bolsonaro’s defense team said it met the accusations with “dismay and indignation,” adding in a statement that the former “President has never agreed to any movement aimed at deconstructing the democratic rule of law or the institutions that underpin it.” Bolsonaro’s son, Flávio Bolsonaro, who is a senator, said on the social platform X that the indictment was “empty” and there was no evidence of wrongdoing. He accused the Prosecutor-General’s Office of serving “the nefarious interests of Lula.” In November, Brazil’s Federal Police filed a 884-page report with Gonet detailing the scheme. They allege a systematic effort to sow distrust in the electoral system, drafting a decree to provide legal cover for the plot, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan and inciting a riot in the capital. In the indictment, Gonet described the alleged crimes as part of a chain of events articulated with an overarching objective of stopping Bolsonaro from leaving office, “contrary to the result of the popular will at the polls.” The Supreme Court will analyze the charges and, if accepted, Bolsonaro will stand trial. The far-right leader denies wrongdoing. “I have no concerns about the accusations, zero,” Bolsonaro told journalists earlier on Tuesday during a visit to the Senate in Brasilia. “Have you seen the coup decree, by any chance? You haven’t. Neither have I,” he added. As well as participating in a coup d’état, the 34 defendants are accused of participating in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage qualified by violence and serious threat against the state’s assets, and deterioration of listed heritage, according to a statement from the Prosecutor General’s press office. Gonet said the criminal organization he charged “had as leaders the (then) president himself and his running mate, Gen. Braga Netto.” “Both accepted, stimulated, and performed acts that are described in our criminal legislation as attacking the existence and the Independence of (the branches) of power and of the democratic rule,” Gonet wrote in his report. The crimes have varying penalties. If Bolsonaro is convicted of attempting a coup and the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, he could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison, according to the country’s criminal code. The indictments, based on manuscripts, digital files, spreadsheets, and message exchanges, expose a scheme to disrupt democratic order, according to the prosecutor-general’s office. The charges are “historic,” said Luis Henrique Machado, a criminal attorney and professor at the IDP university in Brasilia, adding that he expects the Supreme Court to accept the charges and put Bolsonaro on trial sometime before the end of next year. “The charges show Brazil’s institutions are robust, independent and agile,” Machado said. “They are a role model for other countries where democracy is at risk.” Bolsonaro is barred from running in the 2026 election after judges with the country’s top electoral court ruled that he abused his power and cast unfounded doubts on the country’s electronic voting system. Following Tuesday’s charges, Bolsonaro will “position himself as a victim,” said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro has previously said his legal woes are an attempt to stop him from returning to office. “There are polls saying he would be competitive in the 2026 elections against Lula, one of them published today,” said Melo. “There’s going to be political dust, but it will settle.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Canadian Coffee Shops Protest Trump Threats With This Witty Menu Change",
    "text": "A number of coffee shops in Canada are serving “Canadianos” to their customers in protest of U.S. President Donald Trump’s attacks toward their country. The Canadian-themed name change is a play on the “Americano,” or an espresso shot diluted with hot water, and the tweak has popped up on cafe menus in British Columbia and Ontario. “We aren’t necessarily aiming to be political. But we love the idea of really just supporting Canadian pride,” said Elizabeth Watson, owner of Palisades Cafe in British Columbia, in an interview with The Washington Post. Watson told The Post that the new name came to her after British Columbia-based Kicking Horse Coffee encouraged coffee shops to make the switch in a social media post earlier this month. The company, which wrote that it’s “quietly” been calling the drink “Canadianos” for 16 years, shared a photo of a sign about the newly named menu item and declared that the cafe was “officially making it a thing.” Kicking Horse Coffee’s announcement has since been deleted. However, the company has since shared posts touting its Canadian roots. The “Canadianos” arrive as Trump has continued to hurl his “51st state” as well as his “governor” attacks toward Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On Monday, the U.S. president signaled that his delayed plans to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods will go into effect starting next week. Watson, who said she’d be “happy to stick” with the new name for now, said the tweak has sparked more interest in the drink. Cafe Belém owner William Oliveira told The Post that his Toronto-based shop, which renamed Americanos to “Canadianos” on its menu, wanted to “stand up for being ourselves and reminding other people ... that we’re not to be pushed around and bullied by others.” Todd Simpson, owner of Morning Owl in Ottawa, also renamed the drink to “make light of a serious situation.” “We don’t need any American products right now,” he told CTV News. “It seems like a really good way to say we’re Canadian.” Other Canadian establishments have used their food and drink offerings to protest Trump’s moves, as well. Earlier this month, Montreal’s Fairmount Bagel introduced red-and-white “Canadian bagels,” Montreal-based newspaper The Gazette noted. Rhonda Shlafman, the shop’s co-owner, told The Gazette’s Bill Brownstein that the store “had to take a stand like so many others in the food trade.” “Our bagels, like our country, can’t be taken over by U.S. interests,” she said. “Just ask all the American tourists who’ve been coming here for years, so in love with our bagels. Our bagels are Canada strong, the best anywhere.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Carol Ann McDevitt, owner of the Roaring ’20s B&B in the province of New Brunswick, told The Canadian Press that it would be serving local apple cider to guests at its bed and breakfast instead of glasses of orange juice. “It just seemed very unfair. It was unprovoked, and we should do what we can to support our local communities,” said McDevitt, who pointed to most oranges stemming from Florida and some guests praising the new drink.

    "title": "Canadian Anthem Singer Protests Trump By Changing Lyric At 4 Nations Face-Off Title Game",
    "text": "The anthem singer who performed the Canadian anthem prior to the 4 Nations Face-Off championship game Thursday night changed a lyric in “O Canada” as a response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated remarks about making the country the 51st state. Publicist Adam Gonshor in an email to The Associated Press confirmed Chantal Kreviazuk changed the lyric from “in all of us command” to “that only us command” and confirmed Trump’s 51st state comments were the reason why. During Canada’s 3-2 overtime victory, Kreviazuk told the AP she did it “because I believe in democracy, and a sovereign nation should not have to be defending itself against tyranny and fascism.” “I’m somebody who grew up on music that spoke to the heart and the moment, and it shaped me as a songwriter and really as a human being,” she added. “I don’t think it would be authentic to me to be given a world stage and not express myself and be true to myself.” Kreviazuk, who is from Winnipeg, Manitoba, also wrote the phrase “that only us command” with mascara on her left hand. She posted a picture of that on her Instagram with emojis of a Canadian flag and a flexed muscle. A post shared by Chantal (@chantalkrev) “I just put it on there so if I ever had a moment and I kind of froze, I would be able to look at my hand and see it,” Kreviazuk said. “I’d love to see people sort of get inspired and catch the fire and say their heart more in their art. ... Sometimes you just got to speak the truth in your art and it’s awesome. That’s what it should be about.” The NHL declined comment on the situation. Fans in Boston lightly booed the song, though it was soon drowned out by Kreviazuk’s singing. The crowd in Montreal booed “The Star-Spangled Banner” prior to U.S. tournament games at Bell Centre last week, more vociferously before the team faced Canada. Tensions have risen between the neighbors and longtime allies over the past several weeks as Trump since being inaugurated has suggested multiple times that Canada become the 51st U.S. state, in relation to a trade dispute, and threatened a series of tariffs. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said that will never happen. The subject of Canada becoming the 51st state was brought up Thursday during a news conference with David McGuinty, Canada’s Public Safety Minister. “Sounds like President Trump is worried about the outcome of the hockey game,” McGuinty said. “Canada is a sovereign and independent country. It has been for over 150 years and will remain so. This discussion of 51st state is a non-starter.” Trump called the U.S. team prior to their morning skate Thursday to wish players luck in the game. Players told reporters in Boston it was an honor to hear from him, with defenseman Noah Hanifin saying, “Hopefully we can get the win tonight for our country and for Trump.” ___ Whyno reported from Washington.

    "text": "No one anticipates breaking down on the side of the road, but when it happens, it can be pretty scary — whether you’re a new driver or a seasoned one. The key to staying safe? Being prepared. That means keeping a few key items in your car. Even if you’re the best driver of all time, it’s impossible to control everything that happens on the road. Others’ reckless driving, inclement weather, wild animals and car problems are all scenarios it’s important to be prepared for. Having the 15 items on this list helps with exactly that.

It comes equipped with 40 tire plugs, a quality tire gauge, valve stem tool and 12 valve cap replacements. Just a reminder, never try to plug a puncture that is outside of the tire treads. If your tire is punctured on the sidewall, go and have it patched on the inside.

    "title": "Carrie Coon Clears The Air About Marriage To Tracy Letts After Open Relationship Speculation",
    "text": "Carrie Coon is clarifying remarks about her relationship with husband Tracy Letts after inadvertently setting off a media frenzy. Appearing on Monday’s episode of the “WTF with Marc Maron” podcast, Coon acknowledged she and Letts have had frank discussions about being attracted to other people, despite being married for 12 years. “We’re not jealous people,” the “White Lotus” and “Gilded Age” actor said. “We don’t have any of those hang-ups ... it’s nice to be in a relationship where we can always talk about, like, ‘Well, who are you attracted to on set?’” “Tracy’s the kind of person who sees, like, everybody on the street,” she continued. “He notices every single woman on the street. And he always tells me who he has a crush on. It’s interesting to know what your partner’s into. It’s titillating.” Describing Letts as “a person of appetites,” Coon suggested both she and her husband have less-than-favorable views of monogamous relationships. “Monogamy is something we’ve imposed on ourselves. We were supposed to have babies and die when we were like 30,” she said. “And that’s not the way life is anymore.” Some were quick to interpret Coon’s remarks as an acknowledgment that she and Letts were in an open, nonmonogamous relationship. “Finding out Carrie Coon and Tracy Letts have an open marriage has been a really great way to start my week,” one person wrote on X, formerly called Twitter. “For the record this kind of attitude is how you survive and thrive in a marriage between two theatre people so good for them!!” “But of course! They’re way too cool to be monogamous,” another said. By Tuesday, however, Coon cheekily shut down the rumors. “Settle down, internet! I said ‘open minded’ not ‘open,’” she wrote on X. Letts ― an actor, screenwriter and playwright best known for the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama “August: Osage County” ― and Coon met as co-stars in a 2010 Broadway production of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and married in 2013.

    "title": "CNN Data Reporter Spots Damning Elon Musk Figures: 'He'd Be A Very Unpopular King'",
    "text": "CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten on Wednesday spotted how a “clear majority” of Americans are opposed to Elon Musk’s “key role” in President Donald Trump’s administration as the billionaire wreaks havoc on federal government agencies. “I think, simply put, the American people did not sign up for this,” said Enten of Musk, whose cost-cutting crusade with the nonofficial Department of Government Efficiency has made him a “special government employee” in the eyes of the Trump White House. Enten pointed to a recent Quinnipiac University poll that found 53% of registered voters oppose Musk’s “key role” in the Trump administration. Just 39% of respondents supported the billionaire’s DOGE gig, per the poll. “They don’t want this, the American people don’t want this. No, no, no,” said Enten, who noted that the poll found 36% of independents backing Musk’s role. CNN’s Sara Sidner, in response to Enten’s analysis, asked how Musk’s “popularity” has been impacted by the role and argued that a look at the billionaire’s X platform gives the impression that he’s the “king of kings.” “He may be the king of X or Twitter but he ain’t the king of the United States of America, and if he were the king, he’d be a very unpopular king,” Enten said. The reporter then turned to figures showing Musk’s net favorability rating sitting at +29 percentage points back in 2016 and, prior to fall 2024, the billionaire dropped to -3 percentage points as he started to dabble with politics. This year, Musk’s net favorability rating has fallen to -11 percentage points, according to Enten’s data. Trump, by comparison, is at the “apex” of his popularity with a net favorability rating closer to “net zero” while Musk is at the “trough,” Enten noted.

    "title": "Suspect Detained At Airport Over Meticulously Attached ‘Narco Wig'",
    "text": "BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombian police apprehended a 40-year-old man attempting to smuggle several bags of cocaine concealed beneath a meticulously attached toupee. Police said the suspect was detained at Cartagena’s airport on Monday as he prepared to board a flight to Amsterdam. A scanner revealed the hidden cargo: 220 grams of cocaine packaged in small bags, strategically placed under what authorities described as a “narco wig.” Police estimate the street value of the drugs at approximately 10,000 euros in European markets. A police video released on Monday captured the moment an officer, wearing blue gloves, carefully removed the suspect’s wig with scissors, revealing approximately a dozen packets of cocaine. Further police statements confirmed the suspect’s prior criminal record, which included two previous drug trafficking convictions. “Organized crime groups are exploiting young people, falsely suggesting they can easily bypass our security measures,” said Cartagena Police Commander Gen. Gelver Yesid Peña. “However, this case demonstrates that is not true.” Cocaine production in Colombia has been rising since 2013, according to the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime.

    "title": "Conservative Pundit Slams Trump DOJ For 'Ridiculous' Hypocrisy In Eric Adams Case",
    "text": "Conservative lawyer and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy is calling out President Donald Trump, who spent years decrying the Justice Department as “weaponized” against him under his predecessor — only to intervene in the case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Adams was indicted in September on allegations he accepted bribes and illegal campaign contributions. The mayor has sought to curry favor with Trump in recent months, particularly by working with him on immigration. And on Monday, Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered federal prosecutors to drop the charges against him. McCarthy called out Bove and Attorney General Pam Bondi in the National Review. “Bondi, acting through [Bove], is poised to abandon the case against Adams on explicit political grounds — which are hilariously claimed to be part of the new DOJ’s crusade against politicized prosecutorial decision making,” he wrote Tuesday. The order claims Adams was indicted only after he “criticized the [Biden] Administration’s immigration policies,” suggesting the mayor was targeted for political reasons rather than for alleged crimes, while also maintaining that dismissing the case “in no way calls into question the integrity” of the prosecutors now working on the case. That entire premise is “ridiculous,” McCarthy wrote. McCarthy noted Tuesday that if the prosecutors who have “spent years working on the case” cannot “follow the order in good conscience,” they will have to step down — which is precisely what happened Thursday, when U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon handed in her resignation letter. Sassoon frankly condemned the Justice Department’s move to drop the case after Adams claimed it was partisan: “Rather than be rewarded, Adams’ advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case.” “President Trump decided it was in his interest to do a political favor for Mayor Adams,” McCarthy wrote in a follow-up Review article Thursday. “His subordinates tried to cloak this raw political gesture in legally palatable terms. But the rationale offered was incoherent. Now that it has predictably blown up, they blame the people who wouldn’t play along.” In a letter accepting her resignation, Bove rebuked Sassoon for supposedly losing “sight of the oath that you took,” and warned her that the DOJ will investigate her conduct. The five-count indictment against Adams includes charges of conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery. Like many others looking on, McCarthy has been stunned that the same administration that had decried the “weaponization” of the Justice Department is now, in his view, doing just that.

    "title": "'Criminal President': Ex-White House Ethics Lawyer Shares Blunt Thoughts On Trump, Musk",
    "text": "President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the unelected billionaire who was made a “special government employee” to lead his nonofficial Department of Government Efficiency, are breaking laws “right and left,” says former Obama White House ethic lawyer Norm Eisen. Musk spent a quarter-billion dollars to help reelect Trump and is now dismantling federal agencies and slashing public spending his newfound department deems wasteful. Meanwhile, his companies, Tesla and SpaceX, have reportedly received billions in federal contracts. While the Trump administration tried to assuage concern last week by claiming Musk would “excuse himself” from potential conflicts of interest, Eisen — Obama’s former special counsel for ethics and government reform — says it just doesn’t work that way. “The ethics laws are there to protect against conflicts,” he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, per Mediaite. “So, people who are working for the government are serving the public interest, not their own interest. Elon Musk is slashing staff in agencies that are investigating him.” The world’s richest man has certainly benefited from Trump’s second administration, as various government officials who were leading investigations or lawsuits against his companies have been fired in recent weeks, The New York Times reported Tuesday. “What arrangements have been made?” Eisen said Tuesday before rattling off a litany of pressing concerns: “We haven’t seen his financial disclosures. Supposedly, he’s signed it. How is he dealing with these conflicts? Does he have waivers? Is he recused?” “You have a criminal president, 34 convictions,” he continued. “No wonder he’s happy with Elon Musk. They’re violating the law right and left! And it’s a lie by the president that he always abides by court orders. I was in that courtroom in New York.” Trump stood trial in Manhattan last year on 34 charges of falsifying business documents to cover up an alleged sexual encounter with porn actor Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election — and was found guilty on all counts ahead of the 2024 election. Eisen said Tuesday that Trump “broke the judge’s directive again and again” during the six-week proceedings. He noted that the MAGA chief “was fined” repeatedly for doing so and “didn’t stop until the judge threatened him with jail,” which ultimately never came to pass.

    "title": "'We Are So Effed': Trump's Bonkers FBI Announcement Has Critics Asking WTF?!",
    "text": "President Donald Trump on Sunday left many observers baffled by naming former Secret Service agent and current right-wing podcast host Dan Bongino to be deputy director of the FBI. Trump called him “a man of incredible love and passion for our Country” in a post on his Truth Social website announcing the selection, which comes days after far-right conspiracy theorist Kash Patel was confirmed as FBI director. Bongino, 50, had a career in law enforcement before turning to politics. He lost three races, but ended up as a fixture in right-wing media, and at one point hosted a weekend show on Fox News. He is perhaps currently best known for his podcast, which Edison Media ranked at 18th in weekly listeners for 2024, and for his trolling presence on social media. “My life is all about owning the libs now,” he said in 2018, during the contentious nomination hearings for Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh. His elevation to a leading position within the FBI drew harsh reviews from critics on social media: Kash Patel and Dan Bongino are running the FBI. brb I've got to go screaming like a banshee into the night Every time I think thing can’t get worse, the appointees can’t get worse, Trump says ‘hold my beer.’I am stunned, even by Trump standards, that Dan Bongino, a man even Fox got rid of, is now the new deputy director of the FBI. We are so effed. We’re cooked!Dan Bongino, Kash Patel & Pam Bondi running ‘justice’ is like putting arsonists in charge of the fire department.Bongino’s a racist conspiracy hack, Patel’s a Trump flunky and a conspiracy hack, and Bondi sold out Florida for a check. This isn’t law & order—it’s a MAGA police state. America: I present you with the new deputy director of the FBI, former NRATV superstar, Dan Bongino. Every country in the world… expect Russia, China and North Korea… see the US as an adversary with Trump and MAGA in power.We are a violent idiocracy.Dan Bongino as deputy director of the FBI… we are a global joke. I think the clearest thing you can say about Dan Bongino is that he makes Kash Patel look moderately well qualified. Bongino and Kash Patel are cranks who are likely to abuse their powers as FBI directors. J Edgar Hoover would be proud. Trump’s appointment tonight of podcast ranting fascist Dan Bongino as deputy director of the FBI is near Gaetz-level ugly. BREAKING: Dan Bongino was just selected as Deputy FBI Director.Legitimately the worst possible pick. Feeling awful for the hardworking men and women of that agency. Apart from the many disqualifying features of Patel & Bongino, there is no indication either has any ability to run the FBI. Neither has *any* leadership experience at *any* level of *anything*, much less leadership experience relevant to the largest law enforcement agency in the U.S. Dan Bongino named Deputy Director of the FBI — and that wraps up the rule of law. Donald Trump just named far-right MAGA podcaster Dan Bongino, a notorious conspiracy theorist who promoted the lie that the 2020 election was “stolen,” to serve as Deputy Director of the FBI.We’re so screwed I don’t know, Dan Bongino as FBI Deputy Director is pretty horrible, but it is going to be hilarious when him and Kash Patel eventually start trying to destroy each other.

    "text": "UFC boss Dana White called featherweight Bryce Mitchell “an absolute moron” for complimenting Adolf Hitler but defended the decision not to punish the 30-year-old fighter. (Watch the video below.) “Even though I don’t like what he said and even though what he said makes me sick, free speech is real. We have to protect free speech,” White said Monday on “Piers Morgan Uncensored.” Mitchell, who has a 17-3 professional record, lauded Hitler recently after he said he did “research.” The result was hate and ignorance of the highest order. “I honestly think that Hitler was a good guy based on my own research, not my public education indoctrination,” Mitchell said on the first episode of his “ArkanSanity Podcast.” “I do really think before Hitler got on meth, he was a guy to go fishing with. ... He fought for his country. He wanted to purify it by kicking the greedy Jews out that were destroying his country and turning them all into gays.” The episode, which was released on Jan. 24, has been removed from YouTube but remains on Rumble, the live-streaming video platform popular among right-wing extremists. Mitchell later apologized for being “insensitive” and said he does not “condone any of the evil things Hitler did.” But the fighter’s comments were so extreme that White continued to be asked about them this week. Host Piers Morgan asked White if there were limits to free speech, and White said no. “I think probably the most important free speech to protect is hate speech,” he said. “When a government or a certain person can come out and determine ‘this is hate speech,’ it’s a very slippery slope, and it’s dangerous.” \"What he said makes me sick... but we have to protect free speech.\"Dana White weighs in on his UFC fighter Bryce Mitchell praising Hitler.📺 https://t.co/7U3IpYkSvJ@piersmorgan | @danawhite pic.twitter.com/d8vrcT9mbN White prefaced his remarks with an odd shoutout to Elon Musk as the “superhero of this election.” (Musk also earned scorn recently with a gesture that looked like a “Sieg heil” salute at a Donald Trump inauguration event.)

    "title": "See Darren Criss Play A Swoonworthy Robot In Electrifying New Musical",
    "text": "Theater fans who have yet to snag tickets to Broadway’s “Maybe Happy Ending” can now catch a glimpse of actors Darren Criss and Helen J Shen crooning a wistful duet from the musical. In a music video released Friday, Criss and Shen perform “The Rainy Day We Met,” with music and lyrics by Will Aronson and Hue Park. The song is the first to be unveiled from the musical’s forthcoming cast album, due out March 14 on Ghostlight Records. Directed by Tony Award winner Michael Arden, “Maybe Happy Ending” is a romantic comedy with a science fiction twist. The musical follows a pair of “Helperbot” androids in South Korea. The robots, Oliver (played by Criss) and Claire (Shen), have been discarded by their owners as they near the end of their service lives. Watch the music video for “The Rainy Day We Met” below. A malfunctioning charger soon brings Oliver and Claire together, after which they decide to pass themselves off as human beings and embark on a trek outside of Seoul to locate Oliver’s former owner. Over time, the two begin to contemplate love, loneliness and other emotions that seemingly exist beyond their digital constraints. After earlier stagings in South Korea and Atlanta’s Alliance Theater, “Maybe Happy Ending” opened on Broadway at New York’s Belasco Theater last fall to rapturous praise from critics. At a time when many theatrical productions are still struggling to draw audiences at pre-pandemic levels, the musical is a surprise hit, with both Criss and Shen poised to be contenders at the Tony Awards this spring.

The “Glee” and “American Crime Story” actor said he drew on his college studies of the Italian commedia dell’arte to perfect his character’s mechanical gestures and blank expressions. “I’m playing a non-human so the one thing that I want to do the entire time is cry my eyes out,” he told USA Today in November. “For me, every night, I just need like a good like five minutes to cry it out after because the entire show, I’m just gripping on for dear life not to do the one human thing that you want to do the most.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "text": "WASHINGTON – Deb Haaland, who served as President Joe Biden’s interior secretary for four years, announced Tuesday that she’s running for governor of New Mexico. Haaland, who is also a former Democratic congresswoman from the state, is the first declared candidate in the race to succeed Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who is term-limited out in 2026. “In my life, I’ve learned that nothing comes easy,” Haaland says in a video announcing her bid. “Moving around a lot as a kid in a military family. Raising my child on my own. Achieving 35 years of sobriety. But here in New Mexico, struggle makes you fierce.” “The problems we face now are bigger than ever, and we must be fierce to solve them,” she says. “That’s why I am running for governor of the great state of New Mexico.” Haaland, 64, is a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe in New Mexico. She made history as Biden’s interior secretary, becoming the first Native American to serve in any Cabinet post. If she wins the governor’s race, she would become the country’s first Native American woman to serve as governor. Haaland’s tenure as interior secretary is largely defined by her efforts to boost conservation of public lands and right past wrongs against Native Americans by the U.S. government.

    "text": "A Delta Air Lines passenger jet that departed from Minneapolis crashed at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, landing on the runway upside down and injuring 21 passengers. The airport acknowledged that there had been an “incident” after social media users shared video and images of a Delta flight completely upturned with smoke billowing from it. Delta confirmed that there were no fatalities and that 21 injured passengers were transported to area hospitals. As of Tuesday morning, 19 had been released. The flight was operated by Endeavor Air using a CRJ-900 aircraft. It’s not immediately clear what caused the regional jetliner to overturn. Toronto Pearson Fire Chief Todd Aitken said the runway was dry at the time, and there were “no cross-wind conditions.” However, audio from the control tower had warned of an airflow “bump” as they approached the runway. The Meteorological Service of Canada reported 40 mph gusts and blowing snow at the time. Peter Carlson, one of the passengers onboard, told CBC News the landing felt “forceful.” “Everything just kind of went sideways,” Carlson said. “One minute you’re landing, kind of waiting to see your friends and your people, and the next minute you’re physically upside down.” “The hearts of the entire global Delta family are with those affected by today’s incident at Toronto-Pearson International Airport,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement, adding that the airline is still “working to confirm the details” about what happened. Ornge, an Ontario ambulance service, told ABC News that among the 18 injured, three suffered critical injuries: a child, a man in his 60s and a woman in her 40s. None of the injuries are thought to be life-threatening. Wow! (via Raw Alerts) The flight, DL 4819, was carrying 80 people on board when it crashed, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Elise Golgowski, a traveler waiting to depart from Pearson, shared with HuffPost that the airport announced there had been an incident and had suspended all flights and flight check-ins. Video from Golgowski showed an American Airlines employee at Pearson telling travelers at the check-in counter to “go on Twitter, TikTok ― you’ll see what happened. ... We don’t have any information, but there was an incident that happened. That’s all we know.” The employee told travelers that some passengers may not be able to get on new flights until Wednesday. The accident comes days after President Donald Trump began firing hundreds of FAA personnel hired for radar, landing and navigational aid maintenance. The union representing those employees, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, said in a statement Saturday that it was a “hastily made decision.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Democrats Vow To Fight Trump's 'Illegal' Efforts To Gut Federal Agencies",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — After initially being slow to respond last week, Congressional Democrats on Monday vowed to use what power they have in the minority to fight back against President Donald Trump’s efforts to shrink the federal government without approval from Congress. They have some leverage: Trump needs the Senate to approve his nominees, and Democratic votes will be needed to fund the government once it runs out in March. House Republicans have been unable to agree among themselves for years on legislation to avoid a government shutdown or raise the federal government’s borrowing limit, meaning Democrats will likely have to step in. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) indicated Monday he will demand that government funding legislation “choke off” Trump’s unilateral attacks on federal programs. Jeffries specifically cited last week’s order from the Office of Management and Budget pausing all federal grants. “I have made clear to House Republican leadership that any effort to steal taxpayer money from the American people, end Medicaid as we know it or defund programs important to everyday Americans, as contemplated by the illegal White House Office of Management and Budget order, must be choked off in the upcoming government funding bill, if not sooner,” Jeffries said in a letter to his Democratic colleagues. The Trump administration rescinded the order following bipartisan criticism and widespread confusion over its impacts, including early questions about whether it would apply to Medicaid, which the administration insisted it wouldn’t. It’s not clear what sort of legislative language Democrats would demand — the OMB order last week paused funding that Congress itself had already appropriated. The administration acted with dubious legal authority, and a federal judge blocked the pause after nonprofit groups sued. Democrats could seek to increase funding to any agencies Trump unilaterally cuts, raising the prospects of a government shutdown fight. But that would not prevent the immediate disruption of aid programs that provide essential help to millions of people around the world. In the Senate, Democrats hold sway over the federal budget process as well as approval of Trump’s executive nominees. They can’t block his picks outright since Republicans control 53 seats — more than the simple majority required for confirmation — but they can drag the process out and force the GOP to burn valuable floor time. It’s a tactic Republicans used repeatedly under Joe Biden’s administration. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), for example, is planning to place a hold on all of Trump’s nominees to the State Department until his administration ceases its efforts to eliminate the U.S. Agency for International Development, including typically uncontroversial diplomatic postings. Over the weekend, billionaire Elon Musk announced that the Trump administration is shuttering the agency despite not having the legal authority to do so. USAID is the world’s largest provider of humanitarian aid. It was established by Congress and would require an act of Congress to undo. “I will do maximal delays until this is resolved,” Schatz told The Wall Street Journal. USAID employees were locked out of their computers and their offices on Monday. The agency’s website has also vanished without explanation. Musk, a member of a new Trump advisory board focused on government efficiency, has accused USAID of being a “criminal” enterprise that ought to be eliminated. Democrats called the effort to gut USAID a gift to adversaries like China and Russia, which cheered Musk for seeking to kill the agency. They warned the move would be subject to court action. “Elon Musk may get to be dictator of Tesla and he may try to play dictator here in D.C., but he doesn’t get to shut down the Agency for International Development,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said Monday at a press conference with other Democratic lawmakers in front of the USAID headquarters in downtown Washington.

    "title": "Brushing Your Pet’s Teeth Is Essential, But Hellish. This Vet-Approved Powder Can Make It Easier.",
    "text": "The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. Neglecting dogs’ and cats’ dental health can lead to periodontal disease and even heart and kidney problems via bacteria that enters the bloodstream through the mouth. So it can feel crushing as a pet parent to deal with a fur child who absolutely loathes having their teeth brushed. Luckily, if tooth brushing does cause inordinate stress to your pet, you can try alternative tooth care methods, Dr. Nicole Savageau, a veterinarian with mobile pet service The Vets, explained in previous HuffPost reporting. One option that’s beloved by reviewers is ProDen’s Plaque Off dental powder for cats and dogs. By sprinkling some of the powder on your pet’s normal meals, the product helps prevent the formation of new plaque and softens existing tartar, according to the brand. The power is an easy add to your pet’s daily routine that invests in their continued health and wellbeing. It also “saves me time AND money that would go towards future vet bills for tooth extraction and special prescription diets,” wrote a reviewer. ″[I] can say with confidence that it’s worth every penny,” echoed one person, Jen. “This will definitely be a staple in our house for the rest of [my dog’s] life as long as they make it,” wrote another, Theresa. Recommended to many reviewers by their vets and other pet parents, the powder has been approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council, or VOHC, which is “a committee comprised of veterinary dentists who review and then endorse products that provide effective plaque and tartar control,” explained Dr. Carly Fox, a senior veterinarian at New York City’s Schwarzman Animal Medical Center, in previous HuffPost coverage. The powder’s VOHC-approval is important since “typically, I recommend products that are approved by The Veterinary Oral Health Council” when it comes to pet dental health, said Fox. You can check out VOHC’s website for a list of their approved products, she added. (HuffPost has also included some of their approved products for dogs and cats below.) Folks say their pets seem to like the taste, too, even picky ones — “or they wouldn’t eat it,” laughed one reviewer. “My two dogs love it ... their teeth look so much better now.” (My own picky cat laps up the Plaque Off mixed in with her dinner like it’s a special flavor enhancement.) Combined with the powder’s results — “This is the first time I’ve ever been told [my cats’] teeth were actually GOOD,” one person wrote of a veterinarian visit — reviewers have deemed the product “a triumph” and “the real MVP.” The Plaque Off powder comes with a 330 milligram scoop for your use; the brand recommends you add 0.5-1 scoops daily for pets under 25 pounds, 1-2 scoops daily for pets that are 25-50 pounds and 2-3 scoops daily for pets over 50 pounds. Give the powder time to work, since with daily use, results can take three to eight weeks. Just remember that you should combine your pet’s home oral care with regular checkups with your veterinarian or a boarded veterinary dentist, Fox stressed. Consult with your vet before beginning this powder and watch out for any changes in your pet’s habits after incorporating the product. “Been using this in my dog’s food for years. He’s 8 now and needs a scoop in each meal now but for his age, his breath, teeth and gums are in a lot better shape had we not used” — Miss M “as the owner of a senior chihuahua, I am no stranger to a puppy with stank breath. this little dude’s mouth smells like DEATH most of the time. once I started using this, though? game changer, genuinely made his breath WAY more tolerable. it does need some time and consistent use to start working, but it’s great. he ran out, and going without it the stank definitely started to come back, so I know this wasn’t some kind of placebo or anything. will be repurchasing asap!” — Kittie Choi “I have used this for years. Rescued new dog, took her to the veterinarian. He asked if I brushed her teeth? I told him no, I used plaque off. He was very impressed.” — Amazon Customer “Started giving this to my cat and his next vet check up he got complimented on his teeth twice! They thought I brushed his teeth regularly. He would never let me actually brush his teeth so this stuff does a great job! Is it a little pricey? Yeah. But it is worth it.” — faith \"Water additives are an easy way to passively help prevent plaque formation in our pets,\" Fox previously told HuffPost. \"I recommend starting with a smaller amount added to water and then building up so your pet can get used to the taste.\"This Vetradent water additive is recommended by the VOHC for use by dogs; its formula is designed for cats, as well. It's made to help reduce tartar and promote dental hygiene. Tropiclean's popular water additive for dogs also comes recommended by the VOHC. Formulated to control plaque and tartar buildup while minimizing bad breath and bacteria growth, the additive is also available in versions with targeted digestive support, skin and coat health and more. Fox recommended these VOHC-approved OraVet dental chew treats, which are designed to help clean pets' teeth, prevent plaque and tartar accumulation and minimize bad breath. Read more about Oravet chews from HuffPost writer Lourdes Uribe, whose dog adored them. These VOHC-approved plaque- and tartar-fighting dental treats are an Amazon bestseller with 29,000 5-star ratings. They're available in multiple flavors and pack sizes, and in versions for puppies, small dogs, and medium and large breeds. Greenies' cat dental treats, made to clean teeth and freshen breath, also made VOHC's list and sport thousands of 5-star ratings. These are my cat's favorite treats; she loves their crunch and bounds over to me whenever she hears the bag's crinkling sound — or hears anything she thinks is the bag's crinkle. They come in multiple pack sizes and flavors. If your pet has never had their teeth brushed before, Fox and Savageau recommend initially getting your dog or cat used to having their mouth touched at all. “Start by touching their face and lips regularly,” Fox said. “You can try lifting up their lips and placing your fingers on the muzzle gently.” Then, you can try touching your pet’s teeth with your finger. “Each day, move on to touch more teeth, moving from front to back,” Fox detailed. And don't forget the power of positive reinforcement: “Treats and praise [can help] create a positive association with tooth brushing,” Savageau advised. (This can even include dental treats!)The next step? “Gently massage the gums using your finger or a finger toothbrush,” Fox advised. “Dental disease starts at the gum line, so massaging this area will allow your pet to get used to effective tooth brushing.” Based on this advice, we think the Jasper finger brush is a great option. The bestselling brush, which I use with my own cat, sports soft silicone bristles on all sides to gently clean the mouth while helping remove plaque. The tool uses BPA- and phthalate-free silicone and is designed to fit most finger sizes. It also comes with a case to store the brush. It comes in a 2-pack. Once your pet is comfortable with having their gums massaged, it’s time to introduce a pet toothbrush. “Try and brush their teeth for two minutes every day,” Fox said. “A routine is key, so if you are able to do it at the same time each day, your pet will learn to expect it.” (Don’t worry if your pet has a setback once you introduce a toothbrush, Fox noted. Simply return to massaging their gums, but with the toothbrush this time, until they’re ready to move on.) As you search for oral health tools for your dog or cat, \"it's important to use toothbrushes and toothpastes specifically designed for pets,\" Savageau said.For toothbrushes, look for pet-specific options \"with soft bristles and [that are] an appropriate size for your pet's mouth,\" Savageau said. Fox recommended this Petsmile toothbrush in particular. Made for dogs and cats, the Petsmile brush sports heads on both ends, one for larger pets (with larger mouths) and one for smaller pets with more petite jaws. Both heads' outer bristles are angled at 45 degrees to effectively clean your pet's enamel, while their center bristles tackle bacteria and plaque below the gum lines. For toothpaste, it's crucial to select a pet-safe toothpaste without xylitol, which is toxic to dogs, according to Savageau. \"Brands like C.E.T. Enzymatic Toothpaste are often recommended by veterinarians,\" Savageau wrote. You might also want to opt for flavors like poultry or beef, which pets find more appealing, she added.I use the C.E.T. toothpaste for my own cat. I'm convinced its poultry flavor helps make the tooth brushing process more tolerable for her. The Petsmile toothpaste, also recommended by Fox, is another solid option that's been approved by the VOHC.

    "title": "Detroit Family Gifted A Home After 2 Children Die While Sleeping In Van",
    "text": "A Detroit family was gifted a new home after two of their children died from the cold when the van they were living in ran out of gas. “It took my two kids to die for y’all to help me,” Tateona Williams, the mother of the kids, told WXYZ a few weeks ago. “It just don’t work like that. It hurt losing two kids in one night. I don’t wish this on nobody, and if you can get help, please go get help because I don’t want nobody else to go through what I’m feeling.” Williams received the home Wednesday from the City of Detroit and Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries, an organization that provides food, shelter and services to homeless people. The organization will regularly check in to help Williams “create a long-term housing plan,” the organization told NBC News. In three months, Williams has to transfer the home’s utilities in her name. “DRMM will step in to help if she struggles, but we expect responsibility and accountability to build toward her independence,” the organization said, according to NBC News. On Feb. 10, Williams, who was living in a van parked in a casino parking lot with her four kids, noticed her 9-year-old son wasn’t breathing. Williams called a friend, who took Williams and her son to the hospital. While they were at the hospital, the children’s grandmother called Williams to say that her 2-year-old daughter was also not breathing. Amillah Currie and Darnell Currie Jr. were pronounced dead at the hospital. It is believed they froze to death. “I lost the one who made me a mother,” Williams told WXYZ a few weeks ago. “I lost a 2-year-old. ... My heart is breaking and I have two more kids to live for.” Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said in a Feb. 11 news conference that the deaths have to make the city “rethink everything” they are doing. Duggan said Williams and her family reached out to Detroit’s homeless response team at least three times with the latest on Nov. 25. Duggan said “no resolution was reached” after the family asked for help. He added that the response team never proactively reached back out again either. “We have to make sure that we do everything possible to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” Duggan said.

In his presentation, Duggan introduced a seven-point plan to improve the city’s homelessness response, including giving special attention to finding families in vehicles and requiring site visits for all families with minor children. Homeless families in Detroit waited an average of 133 days in December to be placed in a shelter, according to data from the Coordinated Assessment Model.

    "title": "Doctors Reveal Why Some People Can't Grow Long Hair, And The Answer Is Frustrating",
    "text": "Some people seem to grow long, luscious locks effortlessly. Others, like me, dream of having hair that cascades past their shoulders but can’t seem to grow long hair no matter how fastidious they are about hair care. Others might find that their once-long hair suddenly won’t grow despite not changing anything about their haircare routine. What gives? I’ve been puzzled by my inability to grow long hair since I was in middle school. I’ve tried getting regular trims and going longer between salon appointments. I’ve experimented with oils, serums and shampoos, yet nothing worked. My hair is healthy, thick, and has plenty of bounce and shine. However, I’m still left with hair that has never grown longer than an inch or two past the tips of my shoulders, leaving me forever envious of those with hair cascading down their backs. To get to the bottom of this, I consulted top doctors who specialize in hair growth and restoration. And I found out that I’m not alone. Dr. Ross Kopelman, a hair transplant surgeon at Kopelman Hair Restoration, explains that “it’s a question that frustrates a lot of people, and the answer comes down to how hair grows and what controls that growth.” Although hair appears to sprout out of our heads magically, growth involves a complex, four-stage process. Hair first goes through the anagen phase of active growth, which is the longest and most important phase. Dr. Zafer Cetinkaya, a hair transplant surgeon at EsteNove, explains that hair growth starts in small structures called hair follicles, which are located beneath the skin. At the base of each follicle lies a hair bulb. As the cells in the hair bulb multiply, they are pushed upward through the follicle. As these cells journey through the follicle, they die and harden, forming strands of hair made out of a protein called keratin. When this process ends, the hair enters the catagen phase of transition, during which the hair stops growing and the follicle shrinks. This is followed by the telogen phase of resting, when the hair prepares to fall out. Finally, hair enters the exogen phase where the hair falls out, making way for new hair growth. Cetinkaya explains that our hair is continually cycling through these phases, ensuring that new hair replaces old hair. Fortunately, each strand of hair operates on its own growth cycle, which prevents us from losing all of our hair at once. “Think of it like a staggered relay race, where each hair is at a different stage,” allowing us to maintain a “consistent appearance,” Kopelman said. The anagen phase is what determines how long your hair can grow, Cetinkaya said. “At any given time, 85-90% of the hair on your scalp is in the anagen phase,” he explained. The longer the anagen phase, the longer each strand of hair can grow. The reason some people can grow long hair and others can’t is that the length of the anagen phase varies significantly between individuals, Cetinkaya said. This phase typically lasts between two to seven years, he explained. How long the phase lasts depends on several factors. However, “genetics is the most significant factor, as your DNA dictates the length and growth rate of your hair,” Cetinkaya said. “Your ethnic background also influences hair growth characteristics. For example, people of Asian descent often have a longer anagen phase and faster-growing hair compared to those of African or Caucasian descent,” he explained. During the anagen phase, each strand of hair grows about 0.4 inches per month, he said. Those with anagen phases lasting two years may be able to grow hair that reaches about 9.6 inches before falling out and being replaced with a new strand. In contrast, those with a seven-year anagen phase may be able to grow their hair as long as 33.6 inches. “If your anagen phase is short, your hair will reach its maximum length faster and fall out sooner,” Cetinkaya said. Those with shorter anagen phases won’t be able to grow their hair long, no matter how long they go between haircuts or how well they take care of their hair, he added. Age is another factor that impacts your anagen phase. For many people, the anagen phase shortens as they become older, Cetinkaya said. Those who had long hair when they were younger may find it impossible to grow longer hair as they age. When this change takes place depends on a number of factors, including genetics, health and environmental elements, Kopelman said. However, he explains that typically, men will notice a difference when they are in their 20s, and women may notice their hair does not grow as long when they are in their 40s. Additionally, hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy or menopause, “can extend or shorten the growth phase,” Cetinkaya said. Thyroid function can also influence the anagen phase, Kopelman added. How long your hair can grow is largely a matter of genetics and luck. However, there are some steps those with shorter anagen phases can take if they want longer hair. That’s because “overall health, nutrition and stress levels” also play a role in hair growth, Cetinkaya explained. “Taking care of your scalp health is also crucial,” he said. First, nutrition plays a “huge role” in promoting longer hair, Kopelman said. Cetinkaya recommends “supporting and potentially extending” the anagen phase by “maintaining a balanced diet that includes proteins, vitamins such as B-complex, C, D and E, and minerals like iron, zinc and biotin.” He suggests eating foods like eggs, fish, leafy greens and nuts that are high in key nutrients that promote hair health and extend the anagen phase. Additionally, “Hair grows best when the scalp is clean, hydrated and free of inflammation,” Kopelman said. He explains that avoiding harsh shampoos and avoiding harsh chemicals can help. “Gently massaging the scalp improves blood circulation and nutrient delivery to hair follicles,” Cetinkaya added. Moreover, Cetinkaya says that managing stress is important because “high stress levels can shorten the anagen phase or trigger hair loss.” Practicing yoga or meditation and getting regular exercise can help reduce stress, he said. Not caring for hair properly can create the impression that hair is not growing, Cetinkaya said. “Heat styling, tight hairstyles and chemical treatments can cause breakage, which makes it seem like hair isn’t growing even if it is.” Some may think their hair cannot grow long when, in reality, they are damaging their hair with poor hair hygiene. Stopping these harmful practices may result in longer hair for those with longer anagen phases. Even if you do everything right, seeing progress will take time because hair grows very little each month. Moreover, Kopelman warns his patients that no matter what they do, they probably won’t see a dramatic difference. “The most important thing I tell my patients is to have realistic expectations. Hair has its own natural limits, and there’s no magic trick to growing it past what your genetics allow,” he said.

    "title": "DOGE’s Treasury Access Could Let GOP Off The Debt Limit Hook",
    "text": "The news that workers with Elon Musk’s government efficiency group had obtained access to the Treasury Department’s closely-guarded payments system raised worries the government could stop paying for items the Trump administration dislikes. But it also raised another possibility that has at least one senior Democratic senator anxious: that the White House could be preparing a workaround for raising the debt limit later this year, depriving Democrats of political leverage and putting the U.S.’ creditworthiness on the line. “It certainly sounds to me like there’s a possibility of that going on. But that’s what we’re trying to find [out],” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, told HuffPost. A small group of Republicans have long argued that there is an alternative to simply raising the debt ceiling: In their scenario, the Treasury would simply stop borrowing money to refinance existing debt and pay off the government’s bills, and instead “prioritize” its payments. Things like payments on existing debt would be at the top of the list and other items could be paid in descending order of importance, using daily cash receipts brought in. Most economists say even a credible chance that the U.S. would breach the limit on its federal debt — much less actually doing so — would cause global economic calamity. And Treasury officials in the past have said such an approach is unworkable, not to mention dangerous, because it could tarnish the U.S.’ sterling creditworthiness. Democrats have said prioritization is simply default by another name, because some government obligations would not be paid on time. Prioritization would be “entirely experimental and create unacceptable risk to both domestic and global financial markets,” Alastair Fitzpayne, Treasury assistant secretary for legislative affairs, told lawmakers in 2014. Aside from the wisdom of trying to prioritize payments, Treasury officials have also long said the department’s payment systems are unable to sort payments that finely, making the idea unworkable. Until, possibly, now. Dave Lebryk, a former Treasury official, retired Jan. 31 after reportedly clashing with Department of Government Efficiency personnel who sought access to the payments system, which effectively acts as the disbursing agent for trillions of dollars of government payments. Later, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant granted DOGE workers access, though at what exact level remains unclear. Days earlier, the Trump administration proposed freezing all federal financial aid in the form of grants and loans, but took back the order two days later. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt then said the memo was not in effect but the plans to freeze the spending remained in place, raising eyebrows. The possibility DOGE could use its access to the Treasury payment system to implement the freeze memo was raised after the group froze funding for several international aid programs with the U.S. Agency for International Development. Musk in a social media post said he had spent the weekend “feeding USAID into the wood chipper” and the Associated Press reported DOGE officials had sought access to the system to stop the USAID payments, citing two people familiar with the matter. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a Feb. 2 letter if the reports about access to the payment systems were true, “a small group of insiders would suddenly be in a position to make decisions about whether to hold up payments to individual families or businesses — with absolutely no transparency or accountability.” That granular level of control over payments would be necessary to implement prioritization. “We’re still working through the terms of this, but I feel concerned about the possibility of something like that going on,” Wyden said. The issue could come to a boil sometime in the summer, as the Treasury Department is already taking accounting moves to stay below the debt limit. In a statement Thursday, Warren said she and Trump agree on getting rid of the debt limit. “But right now it’s in place and it’s extraordinarily dangerous for Elon Musk and his flunkies to mess with our payments system while Treasury is taking extraordinary measures to prevent a catastrophic debt default and global economic crisis,” she said. For its part, DOGE has said its personnel have “read-only” access to the payments system. And on Thursday afternoon, the Treasury department agreed to temporarily limit DOGE’s access while a judge hears arguments in a lawsuit alleging the access violates privacy laws. The lack of clarity over exactly what DOGE is able to do has led at least one lawmaker to be cautious about raising the alarm. Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the top-ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said the payments system would need to be changed to make prioritization possible.

    "title": "Donald Trump's Daytona 500 Spectacle Fuels Accusations Of Double Standards",
    "text": "Donald Trump’s spin Sunday on the Daytona International Speedway track in the presidential limousine ― ahead of the Daytona 500 opening event of the NASCAR series ― drew accusations of hypocrisy and double standards on social media. As did Trump’s earlier flyover of the track aboard Air Force One. Critics slammed the stunts and accused him of wasting taxpayers’ money.

    "title": "Trump's Body Language During Baffling Elon Musk Press Conference Spoke Volumes, Experts Say",
    "text": "President Donald Trump hosted quite a unique joint press conference alongside billionaire Elon Musk at the Oval Office on Tuesday, and body language experts think the event revealed quite a lot. Trump began the conference by giving Musk, his most powerful adviser, the floor to speak about efforts to downsize the government via the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an initiative the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is leading. Trump claimed during the conference that DOGE has found “billions and billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse” in government spending — though neither Trump nor Musk offered specifics. The president signed an executive order later that day to continue downsizing the federal workforce and to expand government hiring power for DOGE. The Musk-led initiative has already faced several lawsuits and court orders since it was established last month. But the one-of-a-kind conference spurred a lot of reactions on social media. Trump was seated at the Resolute Desk for the duration of the discussion, while Musk — who was not elected to office by American voters, and who has been criticized for the lack of transparency into DOGE operations — stood nearby with his 4-year-old son. Clips of the preschooler’s typical 4-year-old behavior during the conference, such as picking his nose, made rounds on the internet. MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell said on Tuesday night that Trump’s conference with Musk — the richest man in the world and now a “special government employee” — displayed “the most powerless image of a president of the United States ever created by a camera.” Read on to hear what experts have to say about Trump’s body language during the conference, and what it could mean. Patti Wood, a body language and nonverbal communication expert and author of “SNAP: Making the Most of First Impressions, Body Language, and Charisma,” told HuffPost that she thinks Musk’s standing “shows a certain level of power over Trump, who is sitting.” Wood also pointed out that Musk’s casual attire (he sported a black “Make America Great Again” cap) compared to Trump’s more formal attire also sent a message. “Musk wearing a T-shirt, coat and a cap shows he doesn’t feel a need to dress up or honor Trump by wearing professional clothing,” she said. Karen Donaldson, a communication and body language expert, told HuffPost that she believes Trump and Musk’s different positions showed the “trust and respect” that the president has for the billionaire X owner. It conveyed that Trump has no need to “pronounce his authority or position” over Musk. Denise M. Dudley, a psychologist and author of “Making Relationships Last,” told HuffPost that the standing vs. sitting positions could have been planned with the intention to show Trump in a more dominant position with Musk standing several feet behind him. Dudley thinks the president appeared “bored” while Musk spoke. “He nods his head in agreement at semi-appropriate moments, but he mostly just sits there with his hands folded,” she said, adding that she thinks Trump was in an “unnatural” position having to sit quietly while someone else talked — and without having the “limelight directed toward him.” She added that Trump’s body language showed that he was “fake listening” because his nods were “totally random” and he sported a “vague, fixed” facial expression while Musk was speaking. Donaldson pointed to the brief moments in which Trump gave a slight smile at Musk, saying it possibly conveys somewhat of a “proud papa moment.” Mark Bowden, body language expert and author, said that when Trump smiled and laughed while Musk shared various claims about Social Security fraud, it showed that the president enjoyed Musk’s remarks and that “he knows that these exaggerated examples will resonate most with the public.” Bowden told HuffPost that he thinks the president exhibited a “protective gesture” — looking away, inspecting his hands, covering his knuckles and pursing his lips — when Musk said, “Obviously, we want to make sure that people who deserve Social Security do receive it.” There were “mistimed and miscommunicated regulatory signals between them,” he said, adding that “Regulator signals are gestures that help us understand who should speak when.” “Unfortunately, the optics of this could suggest that Trump fundamentally disagrees with Musk — or at best, is visibly indifferent to Americans receiving the Social Security they deserve,” Bowden said. Wood thinks that Trump and Musk’s different standing/sitting positions put the president in the less powerful position — and Trump, as a result, exhibited stress. “Musk standing behind him, making Trump have to turn around awkwardly to interact, immediately reduces Trump’s power,” she said. “You can see Trump’s stress by the way he holds his own hand.” She said that Trump holding his right hand down in a soft fist while his upper hand clamped over it is a “gesture that indicates he wants at some level to fight Musk (the fist) but is keeping himself from doing it.” Wood also pointed out that throughout the conference, Trump made the effort to nonverbally interact with Musk, and not necessarily the other way around. She said that this stands out because typically, when people are speaking to Trump, they turn to face him, and the president rarely physically turns his “body windows” — which means, for example, his heart, neck, mouth and eyes — towards people he’s interacting with, Wood explained. People on social media criticized Musk for bringing his child to the press conference, with some accusing the billionaire of using his son as a distraction. Even the child’s mother, Canadian pop singer Grimes, criticized Musk for taking their son to the Oval Office press conference, writing on X, formerly Twitter: “He should not be in public like this.” Bowden said that he believes Musk’s son’s presence was clearly used as a “symbol” of Trump’s power. “If you can have the wealthiest person on the planet in a room, standing with their child, still wearing their coats and hat, then clearly, you are the more powerful one,” he said. As for Musk, Bowden thinks the Tesla CEO used his son as a distraction, particularly at one point, when he appeared to deflect a question by jokingly saying that his son, who was then on his shoulders, was sticking his fingers in his ears. A reporter had asked Musk to divulge more information about the fraud his DOGE team has claimed to have seen within the Treasury Department. “In this moment, Musk uses his son as a vehicle to justify his own discomfort,” Bowden said. “He takes off his hat, brushes his hair back, and swings from side to side — all nervous adaptive behaviors.” Wood called the situation bizarre, saying that Musk was trying to contain his preschooler while talking about “making significant, impactful changes” like slashing federal budgets. She thinks Musk was likely advised that having his son there would make him look “warm and fuzzy,” but that instead it made him look “clownish” and “Trump ineffective by association.” She said that Trump made “failed” efforts to interact with the 4-year-old at points in the conference. “Trump’s look of overt anger on his face, tilted shoulder placement that shows displeasure, while he seems to have to sit there and take it,” she said about the president’s overall demeanor. Donaldson doesn’t think Trump seemed “overly bothered or concerned” by the child, and that when the 4-year-old became more vocal at the beginning of the conference, Trump seemed to try to silence him in a “very calm, grandparent-like fashion.” Dudley believes Trump looked irritated during the event when Musk made a joke that “gravitas can be difficult sometimes” after his son began speaking. “No one really laughs,” she said about the reaction to Musk’s joke. “And Trump makes a very weak smile — almost a smirk. I think this moment is important. I think Trump is doing his best to show approval of (and solidarity for) Musk’s decision to include his son in the conference.” “However, I think Trump is annoyed,” she added. “Trump keeps his hands tightly clasped together on his desk and looks down for a while.” “Trump’s body language says that he was not in favor of having a kid attending his important press conference,” she later added. During the conference, a reporter asked Musk whether he would be “policing” himself due to his potential conflicts of interest as head of DOGE, considering his companies have received billions of dollars in federal government contracts over the years. Dudley thinks Trump’s body language showed quite a lot at that moment. “This is one of the few times when Trump looks at the camera, intertwines his fingers, looks at the camera again, frowns, wiggles around a little, and then starts looking back at Musk,” she said. “He keeps his fingers intertwined while frowning.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

She said she initially thought Trump’s behavior revealed a nervousness due to the reporter’s question, but then wondered if Trump was “trying to wake himself up.” “Maybe it’s a bit of both,” she said. “The question probably did make him uncomfortable, and he probably became very interested in how Musk was going to answer it, but I also think this is where Trump lost his focus and wanted to be done with the conference.” With the increasing power given to Musk’s DOGE and ongoing calls for more transparency, it continues to be important to keep up with Trump’s executive actions and any nonverbal cues that might reveal any information about Trump and Musk’s allyship.

    "title": "Scientists Warn Trump's NIH Cuts Will Drop 'Atomic Bomb' On Health Research",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s drastic cuts to National Institutes of Health funding will cripple biomedical research, stifle innovation and eliminate thousands of jobs, including in red states that voted for the president, scientists warned this week. Over the weekend, the NIH announced it is sharply reducing federal funding for overhead costs at universities, hospitals and institutes required to conduct research. Known generally as “indirect costs,” they include things like rent for space, utilities, internet access, payroll, equipment and other intangible benefits, like free research assistants. This differs from “direct” costs of doing the research, such as salary and supplies. Typically, about 30% of an average NIH grant to an institution is earmarked for indirect costs, but some universities get much higher rates, upward of 60%. This varies because the cost of doing research varies from state to state and city to city. The new 15% indirect cost rate — which the NIH claims will save taxpayers $4 billion a year — applies to new and existing grants, an abrupt funding change that has already halted some research projects and thrown people out of work. The move was temporarily halted by a federal judge on Monday in 22 states that argued it is illegal because Congress specifically prohibited NIH from changing its grant formula without its approval. It is still active in most red states that didn’t join the lawsuit to stop it, however. Scientists and researchers who spoke to HuffPost expressed deep alarm about the impact of the funding cuts on medical research, warning it would cripple efforts to cure cancer and other deadly and debilitating illnesses around the world. Most requested anonymity because of fear of intimidation or retribution by the Trump administration. “This attack on the very structure of the academic research enterprise is threatening a system that every other country in the world has tried to reproduce, for no gain on any side that I can see,” a research professor at the University of Chicago told HuffPost. “It seems spiteful and targeted at those of us who just want to contribute to a better society.” “Virtually everyone I know has scrubbed their institutional information from all social media profiles, save maybe LinkedIn. It feels like a dark time is ahead. We’re going to try to weather it, but we’re not optimistic that it’ll pass soon,” added a biomedical researcher at a university in Pennsylvania. One recently retired researcher told HuffPost that a 14-year study examining disability in the senior population to better guide caretakers was axed by the funding cuts. “About 200 people were suddenly thrown out of work,” they said. “Of course, the funding had already been granted for the year, and I can’t imagine what the head manager said to people who turned down other jobs to take this ‘guaranteed’ year of work.” John D. Clements, a retired professor of microbiology at the Tulane University School of Medicine, said he was “astounded at how shortsighted” the administration’s decision is given the outbreak of bird flu in the U.S. and around the world that is wreaking havoc on poultry markets. “We are on the cusp of an avian influenza epidemic with the potential to cause disease and suffering on the scale of the 1918 influenza outbreak,” Clements said. “Now is not the time to cut back on research or, as suggested by [Health and Human Services secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr.], put a moratorium on infectious disease research.” Trump’s allies, like billionaire Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency who’s been empowered by the president to unilaterally slash federal spending, have complained about elite universities with large endowments “siphoning” grants with high rates of indirect costs. They argue that reducing funding for indirect costs will steer money toward research projects themselves, adding that a 15% rate is closer to what private foundations provide for similar work. But experts maintain that while there are smart ways to reduce waste, doing so in this way would stifle world-leading research responsible for developing lifesaving drugs and treatments. “A lot of us believe the rate of indirect costs (a huge reason institutions push us so hard to write these federal grants since private foundation grants usually come with much less if any) should be revamped,” one physician in an email. “But cutting it off, even on ongoing grants, is effectively the same as stopping much of this research cold. Few institutions are able to step in and cover these costs, which were carefully budgeted for years ago.” Sarah Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, warned the Trump administration has dropped an “atomic bomb” on the biomedical research community — including in states that supported his election. “Those endowments will not be sufficient to negate the devastating impact of this NIH cut,” Tishkoff wrote on social media, responding to the advocates of the funding change. “Further, the institutions that are going to be hurt the worst by this policy will be the public universities, particularly those in ‘red’ states, which will have devastating impacts on public education and on the local economies.” Red states with multiple major research universities will lose a tremendous amount of federal funding under the new NIH grant formula, including Texas, Ohio, Tennessee, Missouri, Florida, Indiana, Alabama, Utah, Iowa and South Carolina. One Republican lawmaker has already expressed concerns about the NIH cuts: Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama. The University of Alabama at Birmingham’s health system stands to lose funding and jobs as a result of the Trump administration’s cuts, which Britt nodded to in a careful statement to AL.com over the weekend. “Every cent of hard-earned taxpayer money should be spent efficiently, judiciously and accountably — without exception,” Britt told the outlet, before going on to say that “a smart, targeted approach is needed in order to not hinder lifesaving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) also said Monday that the “poorly conceived” NIH cuts would be “devastating” to health institutions in her state. The chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee said she called RFK Jr. over the weekend, who promised to “reexamine” them if he is confirmed as Trump’s HHS secretary.

    "title": "Trump Agrees To Pause Tariffs On Mexico, Canada For 30 Days",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday agreed to a 30-day pause on his tariff threats against Mexico and Canada as America’s two largest trading partners took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking. The pauses provide a cool-down period after a tumultuous few days that put North America on the cusp of a trade war that could have crushed economic growth, caused prices to soar and ended two of the United States’ most critical partnerships. “Proposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted Monday afternoon on X, saying that his government would name a fentanyl czar, list Mexican cartels as terrorist groups and launch a “Canada- U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering.” I just had a good call with President Trump. Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan — reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly… The White House confirmed the pause to the United States, which followed a similar move with Mexico that allows for a period of negotiations about drug smuggling and illegal immigration. There is a risk that the tariffs could still come into effect, leaving the global economy uncertain about whether a crisis has been averted or if a possible catastrophe could still be coming in the weeks ahead. Trump on Saturday had directed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, with another 10% tariff on Canadian oil, natural gas and electricity. He also ordered an additional 10% tax on imports from China. All of the tariffs were scheduled to start at midnight Tuesday. Canada and Mexico threatened retaliation, raising the prospects of a broader regional trade war. The 10% tariff that Trump ordered on China was still set to go into effect, though Trump planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days. Trump’s signing of tariff orders for the three nations set off alarms among investors, lawmakers, businesses and consumers. The taxes on imports, if sustained, could push up prices and sabotage growth, even as Trump has suggested they are necessary to get other nations to stop illegal immigration, prevent fentanyl smuggling and treat the United States, in his mind, with respect. Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the monthlong pause on increased tariffs against one another after what Trump described on social media as a “very friendly conversation,” and he said he looked forward to the upcoming talks. “I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a ‘deal’ between our two Countries,” the president said on social media. Trump said the talks would be headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Commerce nominee Howard Lutnick and high-level representatives of Mexico. Sheinbaum said she was reinforcing the border with 10,000 members of her country’s National Guard and that the U.S. government would commit “to work to stop the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.” In 2019, when Mexico’s government also avoided tariffs from Trump’s administration, the government announced it would send 15,000 soldiers to its northern border. But the outlook was worrisomely different for Canada for much of Monday, only for an agreement to come together. A senior Canadian official said Canada was not confident it could avoid the looming tariffs as Mexico did. That’s because Canada feels as if the Trump administration is shifting its requests of Canada more than it did for Mexico. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, having not been authorized to speak publicly. Asked Monday afternoon what Canada could offer in talks to prevent tariffs, Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office: “I don’t know.” He mused about trying to make Canada the 51st state. The U.S. president also indicated that more import taxes could be coming against China: “If we can’t make a deal with China, then the tariffs will be very, very substantial.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump would speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next couple of days and that the White House would provide a report on the discussion. Trump has continued to antagonize Canada in recent weeks. He used a Monday social media post to repeat his complaints that Canada has been uncooperative, despite decades of friendship and partnerships that range from World War II to the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. “Canada doesn’t even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business there,” Trump posted. “What’s that all about? Many such things, but it’s also a DRUG WAR, and hundreds of thousands of people have died in the U.S. from drugs pouring through the Borders of Mexico and Canada.” Financial markets, businesses and consumers are trying to prepare for the possibility of the new tariffs. Stock markets sold off slightly, suggesting some hope that the import taxes that could push up inflation and disrupt global trade and growth would be short-lived. But the outlook reflected a deep uncertainty about a Republican president who has talked with adoration about tariffs, even saying the U.S. government made a mistake in 1913 by switching to income taxes as its primary revenue source. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday that it was misleading to characterize the showdown as a trade war despite the planned retaliations and risk of escalation. “Read the executive order where President Trump was absolutely, 100% clear that this is not a trade war,” Hassett said. “This is a drug war.” But even if the orders are focused on illegal drugs, Trump’s own remarks have often been more about his perceived sense that foreign countries are ripping off the United States by running trade surpluses. On Sunday, Trump said that tariffs would be coming soon on countries in the European Union. He has discussed tariffs as both a diplomatic tool on national security issues, a way to raise revenues and a vehicle for renegotiating existing trade pacts. Multiple economists outside the administration have warned that the tariffs would push up prices and hamper growth, with Trump himself saying there would be some short term pain after having campaigned last year on the promise that he could tame inflation. ___ Gillies reported from Toronto, and Sánchez reported from Mexico City.

    "title": "News Organizations Debunk Musk's Lies About Their Funding",
    "text": "Billionaire Elon Musk, the head of Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has set his eyes on a new target: government agencies’ media subscriptions. The staunch ally of President Donald Trump, who is a major government contractor, has latched on to data from USAspending that lists federal spending information to falsely claim that the federal government was directly bankrolling news organizations. Right-wing influencers then began to claim, again falsely, that news organization Politico’s recent payroll glitch was because of the funding freeze at the U.S. Agency for International Development, an organization that oversees billions of dollars in humanitarian aid across the globe. All of this is part of an effort to discredit the mainstream media — the Trump administration’s frequent punching bag. The White House endorsed Musk’s call for cuts. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday told reporters government agencies pay for subscriptions to news agencies like Politico. “I can confirm that the more than 8 million taxpayer dollars that have gone to essentially subsidizing subscriptions to Politico will no longer be happening,” she said. “The DOGE team is working on canceling those payments.” Leavitt: \"I was made aware of the funding from USAID to media outlets, including Politico, who I know has a seat in this room. I can confirm that the more than 8m taxpayer dollars that have gone to essentially subsidizing subscriptions to Politico will no longer be happening. The… pic.twitter.com/fDlnc0sQEs Politico’s leaders debunked the widespread fallacies about their funding in a statement addressed to readers. CEO Goli Sheikholeslami and editor-in-chief John Harris clarified that Politico is a privately owned company. They also noted the difference between its news websites — Politico.com and Politico.eu, which rely on advertising and sponsorships — and its professional subscription service, Politico Pro, which some government agencies pay for. “They subscribe because it makes them better at their jobs — helping them track policy, legislation and regulations in real-time with news, intelligence and a suite of data products,” their statement reads. Sheikholeslami and Harris added that the agencies subscribe “through standard public procurement processes — just like any other tool they buy to work smarter and be more efficient.” “This is not funding. It is a transaction — just as the government buys research, equipment, software and industry reports,” they continued. Musk has also claimed The New York Times is “government-funded media.” The news organization debunked his falsehood, noting that the revenue earned by federal subscriptions is “less than 1/1000th of what The Times takes in annually.” pic.twitter.com/zIGZpeUNkE Earlier this week, Musk also seemed to endorse an X user’s post saying USAID has been financing the BBC. The user falsely equated BBC News, which is funded through a license fee, with BBC Media Action, the BBC’s international charity that is entirely separate and funded by donations. Facts matter.

    "title": "Elon Musk's DOGE Seeking Access To Heavily Guarded Taxpayer Information: Report",
    "text": "Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency is seeking access to IRS systems that hold heavily guarded personal taxpayer data, people familiar with the plans told multiple media outlets. The department, referred to as DOGE, is reportedly pressuring the IRS to give it access to several programs, including the Integrated Data Retrieval System, or IDRS, which allows IRS employees to view specific taxpayer accounts showing Americans’ bank information, tax returns, Social Security numbers, addresses and employment information. CNN, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post all reported on details of the plans. When contacted for comment about the effort from these outlets, White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said, “Waste, fraud, and abuse have been deeply entrenched in our broken system for far too long. It takes direct access to the system to identify and fix it. DOGE will continue to shine a light on the fraud they uncover as the American people deserve to know what their government has been spending their hard earned tax dollars on.” A copy of the memorandum DOGE sent the IRS, obtained by the Post, revealed plans that DOGE software engineer Gavin Kliger is set to work at the IRS for 120 days. A source familiar with the plans told CNN that Kliger is expected to be granted access to the system “imminently.” Kliger, who’s 25, has boosted white supremacists and misogynists online, Reuters reported earlier this month. The IRS employee manual provides strict instructions on how employees may interact with the IDRS, saying the security system is “designed to provide protection for both the taxpayer and the IDRS user employee.” “IDRS users are authorized to access only those accounts required to accomplish their official duties,” the manual says. “IDRS users must not access their own or spouse’s account, the account of a friend, relative or co-worker, or any account in which they have a personal or financial interest. IRS prohibits employees from accessing tax account information to satisfy personal curiosity or for fraudulent purposes.” Employees who violate the protocol may be punished with prison time. This marks the latest attempt by Musk’s DOGE department to gain access to sensitive Treasury Department information. Those efforts have been met with multiple legal challenges and court injunctions. “As the richest man in the world, Elon Musk is not used to being told ‘no,’ but in our country, no one is above the law,” a statement from the Democratic attorneys general suing DOGE said earlier this month.

    "title": "Elon Musk’s DOGE Posts Classified Data On Its New Website",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — Elon Musk’s team at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has posted classified information about the size and staff of a U.S. intelligence agency on its new website, raising bigger concerns about where Musk’s programmers got this information and what they are doing with it. DOGE, which President Donald Trump created to purportedly root out waste in the federal government, launched its website on Wednesday night with a feature allowing users to “trace your tax dollars through the bureaucracy.” People can navigate through all federal agencies and offices for details about their head counts, budgets and average ages of employees. The website states in tiny print at the bottom that its database excludes information from U.S. intelligence agencies. But an easy search shows that DOGE’s database provides details on the National Reconnaissance Office, the federal agency that designs, builds and maintains U.S. intelligence satellites. Not only are NRO’s budgets and head counts classified, but the prospect of Musk’s tech team meddling in sensitive personnel information is setting off alarms for some in the intelligence community. “DOGE just posted secret NOFORN info on their website about [intelligence community] headcount, so currently people are scrambling to check if their info has been accessed,” said one Defense Intelligence Agency employee, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from senior leaders. NOFORN stands for “Not Releasable to Foreign Nationals,” meaning information in this category can’t be shared with any foreign governments, international organizations or foreign nationals without specific authorization. NRO appears to be the only intelligence agency with its data publicly available on DOGE’s website. The U.S. intelligence community is composed of 18 organizations, and HuffPost searched DOGE’s website for details on all of them. None of the others had any data. Musk can’t claim he wasn’t aware that the National Reconnaissance Office is one of the nation’s intelligence agencies. His company, SpaceX, has a $1.8 billion contract with NRO to build hundreds of spy satellites. Two Senate aides who work on intelligence matters confirmed that NRO’s headcount and budget are classified, though they noted there have been debates within the intelligence community as to whether they should be. The reason to keep this information private at all, they said, is because foreign adversaries could use it to extrapolate how much the U.S. is prioritizing certain intelligence activities. Nonetheless, DOGE sharing this information “is absolutely a problem under the current intelligence standards,” said one of the Senate aides. And the real concern is that Musk’s surrogates are bumbling around in classified programs. “These 25-year-old programmers, I don’t think they have enough experience to know what they don’t know,” said this aide. “Really, the question is: Where did they get this information and what are they doing with it?” A spokesperson for the National Reconnaissance Office punted questions about this back to DOGE. “We defer to the Department of Government Efficiency for comment on the release of information posted on DOGE.gov,” said the spokesperson.

Hours after this story published, a White House spokesperson said in a statement that DOGE did not share classified information ― even as NRO’s classified information was still accessible on DOGE’s website. “DOGE did not share classified information, any assertion to the contrary is a lie,” said the spokesperson. “Yesterday the accusation was DOGE was not transparent and today the accusation is DOGE is too transparent. Stop the fearmongering, DOGE’s mission remains to cut waste, fraud, and abuse and are doing so with the proper security clearances and following the law.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Elon Musk’s Risky Attack On Social Security",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — Social Security is the electrified third rail of American politics, and now Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, and his band of 20-something acolytes are reaching for it. The Department of Government Efficiency, Musk’s cost-cutting team, arrived at the Social Security Administration over the weekend. Under pressure, the agency’s acting head resigned, while Musk falsely claimed it fraudulently issues benefits to millions of people who are more than 100 years old. “This might be the biggest fraud in history,” Musk wrote in a follow-up post on Monday. Musk’s observation appears to have stemmed from a misunderstanding of the agency’s records — which do include Social Security numbers for millions of people who are too old to be alive, but don’t show them getting benefits. And Musk ignored that government watchdog agencies have repeatedly probed the Social Security program and have found no such massive fraud. President Donald Trump picked up the baseless allegation on Tuesday, saying he wondered who was getting the money supposedly dished out to Americans more than 150 years old. “If you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of the sudden we have a very powerful Social Security, with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200,” he said. The Social Security Administration’s acting director resigned Sunday in the face of apparent demands for access to sensitive SSA information from Musk’s minions, according to the Washington Post. A similar ouster occurred last week at the Treasury Department over access to IRS files, prompting a lawsuit from taxpayer advocates. Social Security may be a riskier target than the IRS, the Department of Education or the U.S. Agency for International Development, the last of which Musk bragged about feeding into a wood chipper. Threatening changes to Social Security’s popular retirement program, which pays the bills for more than 50 million older Americans each month, famously began former President George W. Bush’s long slide into unpopularity following the 2004 elections. Trump said on the campaign trail that he wouldn’t touch Social Security benefits. That position marked a break with past GOP orthodoxy, and was a key reason working-class voters saw him as comparatively moderate. Martin O’Malley, who ran the Social Security Administration under former president Joe Biden, warned that Musk’s foray into the Social Security Administration’s systems could actually cause people to miss payments. “At this rate, they will break it. And they will break it fast, and there will be an interruption of benefits,” O’Malley told the Washington Post. Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a liberal group that advocates against cuts to benefits, said Musk seemed to be setting the stage for programmatic cuts. “He wants to undermine confidence and convince people that there’s fraud so when benefits are cut, they’re not cutting benefits, they’re cutting fraud and waste,” Altman told HuffPost. Democrats pilloried Musk and Trump on Tuesday over the resignation of the SSA’s acting director. “It should alarm all Americans that Donald Trump is willing to push out anyone who does not show strict obedience to an unelected, unaccountable billionaire,” Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.) said. “This has nothing to do with ‘government efficiency’ and everything to do with ensuring the billionaire class controls the levers of power with no guardrails or accountability.” HuffPost readers: Are you a federal employee with insight into what’s happening at SSA? Email arthur@huffpost.com. The SSA’s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday the White House suspected fraud at the agency and that benefits wouldn’t be affected for people who paid into the system “honestly.” As for the fraud Musk claimed to have identified, the SSA’s inspector general’s office, an independent investigative agency, has issued at least two reports about “numberholders age 100 or older.” The inspector general found in its July 2023 report that the SSA lacks death records for 18 million such people because the individuals died before the government adopted its electronic system for reporting deaths.

Log in to hide these messages. The inspector general urged SSA to fix the data anyway using available information, since the old Social Security numbers could potentially be used by fraudsters. The agency refused, saying it would be a waste of money since no improper payments were going out. “Correcting records for nonbeneficiaries would divert resources from work necessary to administer and manage our programs, which we cannot afford,” Social Security said in its response to the IG report. In other words, the agency said the fix wouldn’t improve government efficiency.

    "title": "Donald Trump Claims To Be Surprised By Elon Musk’s Comments On His 2024 Endorsement",
    "text": "Elon Musk has said Donald Trump’s first assassination attempt prompted him to endorse the president sooner than he originally intended to, adding that he was “planning to do it anyway.” In a joint interview with Trump on Fox News broadcast Tuesday, Musk said the effort to assassinate Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July was a “precipitating event.” “That speeded it up a little bit?” Trump asked about Musk’s endorsement. “I didn’t know that.” “Yeah,” Musk said. “It sped it up, but I was going to do it anyway.” Trump was wounded in the ear after a gunman fired into the crowd attending his campaign rally in the key battleground state on July 13. The shooting killed one attendee. Musk endorsed the video in a post on his platform, X, formerly Twitter, and attached a clip of the attack. “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,” Musk wrote at the time. Trump was unharmed during a second assassination attempt about two months later at his golf club in Florida. Over the course of the campaign, Musk became one of the Trump team’s top donors and surrogates on the trail. In the interview, Musk pushed back against the criticism the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has garnered for wreaking havoc across the federal government with its said effort to identify and cut waste and abuse. Musk said that DOGE is working to ensure that Trump’s executive orders are being followed in its effort to “restore the will of the people,” as many of DOGE’s actions are being challenged in the courts. “If the will of the president is not implemented and the president is representative of the people, that means the will of the people is not being implemented, and that means we don’t live in a democracy, we live in a bureaucracy,” he told Fox News’ Sean Hannity. Both Trump and Musk appeared to dismiss Musk’s potential conflicts of interest as the owner of several companies with federal government contracts. “I haven’t asked the president for anything ever,” Musk said. He also pledged to recuse himself if a potential conflict were to arise. Still, the billionaire has not made his ethics agreement available to the public. The White House has said Musk serves as a Special Government Employee and is also a senior adviser to the president.

    "title": "Elon Musk’s Daughter Reveals ‘Wild’ Way She Found Out That 1 Of Her Half-Siblings Exists",
    "text": "Vivian Wilson is shedding light on Elon Musk’s questionable parenting skills — yet again. Earlier this week, Wilson, Musk’s estranged daughter, decided to share an alarming, albeit slightly vague, post on Threads about her half-siblings. “If I had a nickel for every time that I found out I had a new half-sibling online, I’d have a few nickels- which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened SIX SEPARATE TIMES,” Wilson wrote. She then followed that revelation up with a joke: “‘I don’t know how many siblings I have’ goes really hard on 2 truths and a lie though I will admit.” Musk has 13 children with four different women. Wilson is one of five surviving children Musk had with his first wife, Justine Wilson (their sixth, Nevada, died at 10 weeks old). The Tesla CEO also had three with his former partner Grimes, three with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis. Conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair has also claimed Musk fathered her child. After Wilson posted about only finding out she has new siblings from the internet — rather than her own father — her followers begged her to elaborate, and Wilson was happy to oblige. “I will do a whole storytime about this because like it’s WILD,” Wilson wrote on Meta before posting a link to a TikTok. In the TikTok, Wilson explains how she found out about Musk and Grimes’ third child, a boy named Techno Mechanicus, who also was born in June 2022. With RECEIPTS “Story time: I found out about the existence of my half-brother through reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace,” she began. “This is a real thing that actually happened to me, and if it sounds insane, it is.” She continued, “I’m going to paint you a scene. The year is 2022, and at the time, me and Grimes — or as I know her, C — are not talking. We’re not on bad terms. We’re just not talking, as people do.” Vivian went on to explain that she was on the “RuPaul Drag Race” subreddit when she discovered the news that she has a baby brother. “The specific day of, I didn’t really have anything to do, so I was just scrolling on Reddit, and I’m a huge fan of ‘Drag Race,’ so naturally, I was on the ‘Drag Race’ subreddit. And what do I come across but none other than a tweet from Season 2 and ‘All Stars’ [Season] 2 contestant, Tatianna,” she said. “I found this tweet that was crossposted onto the subreddit, and I had no idea of this at the time, because no one thought to let me know. So at the moment, I’m just in complete shock, and I don’t believe it, so I double-check it on the news, and it turns out it’s actually fucking true, and I’m just the last one to find out about it. This is a real thing that happened to me, girl!” Vivian clarified, “This isn’t to drag on C or anything. It kind of makes sense how this happened because, again, we were not really talking at the time, but I just think it’s funny because... choices.” In the comments of her TikTok, Wilson told her followers to not bully the “Oblivion” singer, Grimes, whose legal name is Claire Elise Boucher. “Y’all, please don’t go send hate to Grimes- she’s been through enough,” Wilson wrote. For what it’s worth, Grimes and Wilson do seem to have a pretty decent relationship. In June 2024, Musk said in an interview that Wilson was “dead” to him because she transitioned. In response to her father’s remarks, Wilson responded by pointing out that she’s essentially always been dead to Musk because he has been an absentee dad her entire life.

    "title": "Governor Weighs Removing NYC Mayor Adams After His Top Deputies Quit Amid Criminal Case Turmoil",
    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday she is weighing removing New York City Mayor Eric Adams from office after four of his top deputies announced their resignations in the latest fallout from the Justice Department’s push to end his corruption case. Hochul, a Democrat, said she will convene a meeting of key leaders Tuesday in Manhattan “for a conversation about the path forward.” She said the departures of First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer and other top officials raise “serious questions about the long-term future” of Adams’ administration. Adams, also a Democrat, has been under increasing scrutiny since the Justice Department’s second-in-command ordered federal prosecutors in Manhattan last week to drop his corruption case to ensure his cooperation in Republican President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown — raising questions about the mayor’s political independence and ability to lead the city. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove wrote that the case had “unduly restricted Mayor Adams’ ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime.” “I recognize the immense responsibility I hold as governor and the constitutional powers granted to this office,” Hochul said in a statement. “In the 235 years of New York State history, these powers have never been utilized to remove a duly-elected mayor; overturning the will of the voters is a serious step that should not be taken lightly. That said, the alleged conduct at City Hall that has been reported over the past two weeks is troubling and cannot be ignored.” The city’s charter lays out a court-like process by which the governor must first serve the mayor with a copy of charges she feels warrant his removal, then provide him with “an opportunity to be heard in his defense.” But there is little precedent or blueprint for how that would work. As Hochul noted in her statement, the removal powers have never once been used against a sitting mayor in New York’s history. Earlier Monday, Adams confirmed the departures of Torres-Springer, Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi, Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Anne Williams-Isom and Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Chauncey Parker. “I am disappointed to see them go, but given the current challenges, I understand their decision and wish them nothing but success in the future,” said Adams, who faces several challengers in June’s Democratic primary. “But let me be crystal clear: New York City will keep moving forward, just as it does every day.” Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom told agency heads and staff in a memo that they were exiting because of “the extraordinary events of the last few weeks.” They did not give a date for their departures, but Adams said they and Parker will remain “for the time being to ensure a seamless transition.” Bove’s directive for prosecutors to drop Adams’ case touched off firestorms within the Justice Department and New York political circles, with seven federal prosecutors quitting in protest — including the interim U.S. attorney for Manhattan — and fellow Democrats calling on Adams to resign. On Friday, after a week of recriminations and resignations, Bove and a pair of Justice Department officials from Washington stepped in and filed paperwork asking Manhattan federal Judge Dale E. Ho to dismiss the case. Ho has yet to take action on the request. Adams, a former police captain, pleaded not guilty last September to charges that he accepted more than $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions and lavish travel perks from foreign nationals looking to buy his influence while he was Brooklyn borough president campaigning to be mayor. The Justice Department said in its filing Friday that it was seeking to dismiss Adams’ charges with the option of refiling them later, which critics see as a carrot to ensure his compliance on the Republican president’s objectives. In his memo ordering prosecutors to ditch the case, Bove said the new, permanent U.S. attorney would review the matter after the November election. “It certainly sounds like President Trump is holding the mayor hostage,” Rev. Al Sharpton, an Adams ally, said Tuesday. “I have supported the mayor, but he has been put in an unfair position — even for him — of essentially political blackmail.” City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams became the latest Democrat to call on the mayor to resign, saying that with the deputy mayor resignations it’s clear he “has now lost the confidence and trust of his own staff, his colleagues in government, and New Yorkers.” Speaker Adams is not related to the mayor. Other leaders, including Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Nydia Velázquez, and Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado, have called on Adams to step down.

The drama over Adams’ legal case played out as the mayor met with Trump’s border czar in New York on Thursday and announced increased cooperation on the Trump administration’s efforts to remove immigrants, including reestablishing an office for immigration authorities at the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail. In their memo to staff announcing their exits, Torres-Springer, Joshi and Williams-Isom wrote: “Due to the extraordinary events of the last few weeks and to stay faithful to the oaths we swore to New Yorkers and our families, we have come to the difficult decision to step down from our roles.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Mayor Adams to Top Commissioners: Don’t Criticize Trump, Don’t Interfere with Immigration Enforcement",
    "text": "Mayor Eric Adams gathered his top commissioners and officials early Monday to give marching orders under the new administration: don’t criticize President Trump, don’t interfere with immigration enforcement and trust the mayor, multiple sources told THE CITY. Adams scheduled the approximately hour-long meeting, which was held at the Municipal Building, late Friday, after days of confusion over guidance on what to do if Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrive at city buildings, including schools and hospitals. THE CITY reported in January that one memo instructed city employees to intercept ICE agents attempting to enter city-owned buildings until city lawyers could weigh in. But Hell Gate reported last week that another memo told employees they could let federal law enforcement in if they feel “reasonably threatened.” The mayor began the meeting Monday by asking his top officials how they felt and that they shouldn’t be shy about sharing, sources told THE CITY. After some people expressed their concerns and asked for clearer guidance from the mayor, Adams ordered them to stop complaining and to keep their heads down and refrain from criticizing President Donald Trump — and trust that he will make sure the city doesn’t get federal grants pulled, multiple people told THE CITY. They were also ordered to not be critical of the president or federal government on social media. Trump has already threatened to pull federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities, where laws or policies limit local government cooperation with immigration enforcement. New York City’s laws allow cooperation with ICE only in limited instances involving people convicted of certain felonies, or with a judicial warrant. Attendees spotted by THE CITY entering the meeting included Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, Schools Chancellor Melissa Aviles-Ramos, Health and Hospitals CEO Dr. Mitchell Katz, Department of Social Services Commissioner Molly Wasow Park, and multiple deputy mayors. The mayor, School’s Chancellor, police commissioner and nearly every other top city official are inside the municipal building right now. Multiple sources, believe it is to clear up ICE protocol. Chancellor and Mayor didn’t say much this morning.[image or embed] On Sunday, Aviles-Ramos released a video assuring parents, students, and school staff that “any non-local law enforcement is not permitted” inside school buildings. She declined to clarify or answer questions as she entered the meeting. Adams also told his top officials they needed to stop complaining about President Trump and move on because he was elected — which echoes what he’s repeatedly shared in press briefings. “Mayor Adams often speaks to his top leaders to discuss what they’re seeing on the ground in their respective departments and ways we can continue working together to provide for the people of New York City,” his spokesperson, Kayla Mamelak Altus, said in a statement after this article was published. “As he has said publicly many times, the mayor wants to find ways to work with the federal administration, not war with them. Tweets do not solve problems, which is why addressing issues on the streets is what this administration is going to do. Delivering for New Yorkers and protecting our employees is — and always will be — our North Star.” The administration also on Monday released a new flow chart to help city employees know what to do when interacting with non-local law enforcement. This is part of updated guidance sent to city employees today on what to do about in-person interactions with non-local law enforcement like ICE[image or embed] The mayor has said he won’t publicly criticize the president and has refused to criticize Trump’s statements or actions when pressed by reporters. Trump said in December he would “look at” potentially pardoning Adams, whose federal corruption trial is set to begin in April. It’s fueled speculation that the mayor is acting chiefly to obtain a pardon or dropped charges from the president, even as Trump threatened to withhold crucial funding from the city. Following THE CITY’s reporting, many candidates seeking to unseat Adams, including Comptroller Brad Lander, criticized Adams’ instructions to top-level staff. “Today Eric Adams instructed New York City employees from top to bottom to aid and abet his efforts to win a pardon from Donald Trump,” he said in a press conference held outside the Municipal Building. State Sen. Zellnor Myrie, who is also running for mayor, said Adams’ “irresponsible actions and words will only keep New Yorkers away from getting the services they need to survive, and undermine the sanctuary city policies that have been upheld by both Democratic and Republican mayors.” And Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani said that the mayor “has narrowed the focus of city government to a singular goal: keeping himself out of prison.” Over the weekend, Trump threatened to end congestion pricing by withholding federal grants to New York City. “If I decide to do it, I will be able to kill it off in Washington through the Department of Transportation,” he told the New York Post. He also said during that interview he would get rid of bike lanes and “sidewalks in the middle of the street” in Manhattan. Earlier Monday, Elon Musk posted to X that his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) “just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants.” He said “a clawback demand” would be made to get the money back. Adams has previously praised Musk, saying in November he was “one of the people I think it was important to bring on board.” “We’re dealing with an antiquated government filled with bureaucracy, unwilling to make any changes,” Adams said in an interview on PIX 11. “Government has to change. It’s not serving people correctly.” During a press conference in early December, Adams said he looked “forward to Elon Musk, who can take us to Mars.” And the mayor repeated those sentiments on Jan. 22 when he said, “I’m an Elon Musk guy” on a popular YouTube show. Another mayoral spokesperson, Liz Garcia, criticized the Biden administration in a lengthy statement and said they “left New York City largely on its own to manage an international humanitarian crisis.” She added that the city has “continued to receive previously allocated reimbursements through the past week. We will discuss this matter directly with federal officials.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Key Federal Agencies Refuse To Comply With Musk's Latest Demand In His Cost-cutting Crusade",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Key U.S. agencies, including the FBI, State Department and the Pentagon, have instructed their employees not to comply with cost-cutting chief Elon Musk’s latest demand that federal workers explain what they accomplished last week — or risk losing their job. The pushback from appointees of President Donald Trump marked a new level of chaos and confusion within the beleaguered federal workforce, just a month after Trump returned to the White House and quickly began fulfilling campaign promises to shrink the government. Administration officials scrambled throughout the weekend to interpret Musk’s unusual mandate, which apparently has Trump’s backing despite some lawmakers arguing it is illegal. Unions want the administration to rescind the request and are threatening to sue. Some officials are resisting. Others are encouraging their workers to comply. At some agencies, there was conflicting guidance. One message on Sunday morning from the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., instructed its roughly 80,000 employees to comply. That was shortly after the acting general counsel, Sean Keveney, had instructed some not to. And by Sunday evening, agency leadership issued new instructions that employees should “pause activities” on the request until noon Monday. “I’ll be candid with you. Having put in over 70 hours of work last week advancing Administration’s priorities, I was personally insulted to receive the below email,” Keveney said in an email viewed by The Associated Press. Keveney laid out security concerns and pointed out some of the work done by the agency’s employees may be protected by attorney-client privilege: “I have received no assurances that there are appropriate protections in place to safeguard responses to this email.” Musk’s team sent an email to federal employees on Saturday giving them roughly 48 hours to report five specific things they had accomplished last week. In a separate message on X, Musk said any employee who failed to respond by the deadline — set in the email as 11:59 p.m. EST Monday — would lose their job. Democrats and even some Republicans were critical of Musk’s ultimatum, which came just hours after Trump encouraged him on social media to “get more aggressive” in reducing the size of the government through his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, was among the members of Trump’s party who had concerns. “If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this,” Curtis, whose state has 33,000 federal employees, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. ... It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut and you have to be cruel to do it as well.” On ABC’s “This Week,” Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., questioned the legal basis the Trump administration would have for dismissing tens of thousands of workers for refusing to heed Musk’s latest demand. The email did not include the threat about workers losing their jobs. For Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., there was no doubt: “The actions he’s taking are illegal,” he said on “Face the Nation.” Trump mocked the affected workers in a meme Sunday on his social media network. The post featured a cartoon character writing a list of accomplishments from the previous week led by, “Cried about Trump,” “Cried about Elon,” “Made it into the office for once,” and “Read some emails.” Newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel, an outspoken Trump ally, instructed bureau employees to ignore Musk’s request, at least for now. “The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures,” Patel wrote in an email confirmed by the AP. “When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.” Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, sent his staff a message Sunday that may cause more confusion. Martin noted that he responded to Musk’s order. “Let me clarify: We will comply with this OPM request whether by replying or deciding not to reply,” Martin wrote in the email obtained by the AP, referring to the Office of Personnel Management. “Please make a good faith effort to reply and list your activities (or not, as you prefer), and I will, as I mentioned, have your back regarding any confusion,” Martin continued. “We can do this.” The night before, Martin had instructed staff to comply. “DOGE and Elon are doing great work. Historic. We are happy to participate,” Martin wrote at that time. Officials at the Departments of State, Defense and Homeland Security were more consistent. Tibor Nagy, acting undersecretary of state for management, told employees in an email that department leadership would respond on behalf of workers. “No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command,” Nagy wrote in an email. Pentagon leadership instructed employees to “pause” any response to Musk’s team as well. “The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and it will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures,” according to an email from Jules Hurst, deputy undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness. “When and if required, the Department will coordinate responses.” The Homeland Security Department told employees that “no reporting action from you is needed at this time” and that agency managers would respond, according to an email from R.D. Alles, deputy undersecretary for management. Everett Kelley, president of the 800,000-member American Federation of Government Employees, said in a letter Sunday to the administration that it should rescind Musk’s request and apologize to all federal workers by the end of the day. “We believe that employees have no obligation to respond to this plainly unlawful email absent other lawful direction,” he wrote, describing Musk as “unelected and unhinged.” Thousands of government employees have already been forced out of the federal workforce — either by being fired or through a “deferred resignation” offer. There is no official figure available for the total firings or layoffs so far, but the AP has tallied hundreds of thousands of workers who are being affected. Musk on Sunday called his latest request “a very basic pulse check.” “The reason this matters is that a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all!” Musk wrote on X. “In some cases, we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks. In other words, there is outright fraud.” He has provided no evidence of such fraud. Separately, Musk and Trump have falsely claimed in recent days that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments.

    "title": "‘F**k That’: Federal Workers Say They’re Scared But ‘Digging In’ Amid Trump’s Chaos",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — For the last two weeks, federal workers have been swept up in chaos and fear as President Donald Trump barrels ahead with his plans to purge civil servants from the U.S. government and potentially replace them with loyalists. Trump has already fired or sidelined at least 17 inspectors general, more than a dozen federal prosecutors, national security employees, career diplomats and dozens of senior officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development, the civilian foreign aid agency that billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump ally who is not an elected official, claims he can close down permanently despite the lack of a clear legal path to do so. Beyond that, the president is actively trying to root out and terminate federal workers who have any connections to diversity, equity and inclusion programs — to the point where people are being incentivized to rat each other out if they suspect a colleague may be hiding their work on these issues. At the Department of Education, for example, at least 60 employees have already been put on leave and lost access to their emails because they previously attended one diversity training. If that’s not stressful enough, the Trump administration has been pressuring millions of federal employees to agree to a so-called “buyout,” a vaguely written offer of months of pay in exchange for quitting their jobs. Anxiety and confusion are clearly high across government agencies. But federal workers say something else is bubbling up, too: resistance. HuffPost talked to more than a dozen civil servants across eight federal agencies about what they’re experiencing internally, what the mood is like and how people are responding to Trump’s efforts to force them all out. A clear theme that emerged is that while these employees are scared, they’re also mad. And they’re not going anywhere. “Fuck that,” said one Environmental Protection Agency employee who, like everyone who spoke to HuffPost, spoke only on the condition of anonymity to protect their job. People’s moods are changing “like every hour” because of the fear and uncertainty of what’s to come, the EPA staffer said. But some of Trump’s efforts to force people out are already backfiring, at least somewhat, like his mandate that all employees return to in-person work within 30 days — an effort to make people quit. “Resistance Day!” this EPA employee said of the vibe at work one day last week, with everyone together again. “I was feeling so demoralized. But being in the office with everyone was so grounding. Ironically for the Trumpies, bringing us back to the office will make us stronger morale-wise.” The Trump administration’s “buyout” offer also seems to be flopping, said some workers. On Jan. 28, the Office of Personnel Management sent an email to more than 2 million federal employees with the subject line, “Fork in the Road,” offering to pay people through Sept. 30 with full pay and benefits in exchange for them quitting their jobs via a new “deferred resignation” program. The email’s subject line is the same message that Musk sent to Twitter employees after he acquired the company. Many federal workers have recognized this as a scam. That’s partly because Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who represents lots of federal workers in his state, has been publicly warning people not to take it. It’s also because hundreds of thousands of federal workers are part of a strong union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), that’s been helping them navigate Trump’s rapid-fire actions. The organization issued a detailed FAQ breaking down all the reasons the so-called “buyout” is not actually a buyout and is wholly unreliable and possibly illegal. And the union has offered federal employees a place to get answers to their questions together; a recent AFGE meeting brought together roughly 1,600 people, according to one attendee. “I don’t know anybody who is taking this offer,” one federal scientist said of the deferred resignation pitch. “The buyout that’s not even real?” Ironically, the “Fork in the Road” email that went out was also being flagged as a scam by the security system built into federal employees’ inboxes. “We have a very clear email button for reporting phishing,” said a second EPA employee. “The amount of people who have reported this as phishing is very high. It reads, ‘scam.’ Literally, that ‘Fork in the Road’ email.” This EPA staffer marveled at the volume of attorneys who likely received that email and could see how nonsensical it was ― a sign that, for all their threats and intimidation, at least some of the Trump administration is a sloppy mess. “Whoever wrote that email really underestimated who they were sending it to,” this person said. “I very much feel like the general consensus is we are scared, but we are digging in.” Several federal employees and their supporters have taken to the social media platform Reddit to connect and share their plans for fighting what is happening. “This non ‘buyout’ really seems to have backfired,” reads one thread last week by an anonymous federal employee that drew lots of engagement. “I’ll be honest, before that email went out, I was looking for any way to get out of this fresh hell. But now I am fired up to make these goons as frustrated as possible, [return to office] be damned.” “Hold the line!” this person adds. “I’ve been telling my coworkers to hold the line,” reads another thread by this federal employee, from a few days later. “So happy to see everyone here saying the same thing.” To be sure, some federal workers are struggling with feeling helpless and demoralized. Some don’t know how they can fight back in their particular jobs and are worried that Trump is setting up the entirety of the government to fail by fueling mistrust and fear of retribution within its ranks. “I am terrified,” said one Interior Department employee. “I want to speak up, for I know what is happening is wrong, yet I know if my protests reach the wrong ears I will be fired without hesitation and I have a family to provide for. Bosses are forced to enforce policies they deeply disagree with, but must or face further punishment for them and their teams.” “I do not use this term lightly,” said this federal worker, “but it feels very fascist.” That’s the sentiment shared by at least one State Department employee, who described messages from higher-ups instructing them to expose colleagues who they think may be working on DEI initiatives or otherwise “face adverse consequences.” This federal worker also discovered that at least one instructor of a routine departmental training was told they weren’t allowed to use the phrase “the Biden administration” or talk about the last four years at all. “It is like 1984,” said this employee, referring to the dystopian novel by George Orwell about a fictional dictator who controls everything and constantly monitors people. A State Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Defense Department employee, meanwhile, fumed about Trump’s “short-sighted and performative” decision to require all employees to return to in-person work. “There are people I work with who do incredible work while working from home that will likely lose their job because of this. Some of them purchased a home and moved away based on this work agreement,” said this employee. “A 30-day grace period for such a significant change is a slap in the face to those who work hard.” What’s especially ridiculous, this person said, is that federal office buildings outside of Washington, D.C., often don’t have enough desks, cubicles or shared work spaces to accommodate everyone returning to in-person work because these facilities have never been properly funded. “Assuming all federal office buildings function like those in D.C. is insulting and infuriating,” said this Defense Department staffer. “I do not use this term lightly, but it feels very fascist.” Civil servants from across federal agencies, from NASA to the U.S. Navy to the National Park Service, also emphasized that a big reason they’re ready to fight Trump’s efforts to dismantle the government isn’t just because they need a job. They described their pride in working on something bigger than themselves and in taking an oath to the Constitution to serve their country. “Not to be cheesy, but taking the oath of office really meant something to me,” said the previously mentioned federal scientist. “I feel like that obligates me to fight. I took an oath to the Constitution, to defend against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” “Elon’s emails are having the opposite effect on me than what was intended, like other [federal workers],” said an Education Department staffer. “Reinvested in my work.” “It’s heartbreaking that we’re at the point where nothing is certain, where even the most basic rights are suddenly in question, and where so many people ― with good cause ― are simply too exhausted and overwhelmed to continue the fight,” said one Forest Service employee. “There’s only one thing I am sure of ― that I will work towards the protection of nature in the [redacted] National Forest until my final breath,” said this employee. Trump isn’t showing signs of relenting in his efforts to purge career civil servants. On Friday, perhaps identifying one of his biggest obstacles, he said he plans to nullify federal employee union contracts that agencies agreed to late in Biden’s term. “Such last-minute, lame-duck [collective bargaining agreements], which purport to bind a new President to his predecessor’s policies, run counter to America’s system of democratic self-government,” Trump claimed, though he did not provide a clear legal justification for nullifying existing union contracts. AFGE called the announcement yet another effort by Trump and Musk “to frighten and confuse” career federal employees.

    "title": "Oscar Favorite ‘Anora’ Wins Best Film, Director And Actor At The Independent Spirit Awards",
    "text": "Sean Baker’s “Anora” won best film, best director and best actor for Mikey Madison at the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday in what could be a preview of next Sunday’s Oscars: The film about a Brooklyn sex worker and her whirlwind affair with a Russian oligarch’s son has emerged in recent weeks as an awards season front-runner. The Spirit Awards, held in a beachside tent in Santa Monica, California, is the shaggier, more irreverent sister to the Academy Awards, celebrating the best in independent film and television. Host Aidy Bryant called it “Hollywood’s third or fourth biggest night.” In accepting the directing prize, Baker spoke passionately about the difficulty of making independent films in an industry that is no longer able to fund riskier films. He said indies are in danger of becoming calling card films — movies made only as a means to get hired for bigger projects. “The system has to change because this is simply unsustainable,” Baker said to enthusiastic applause. “We shouldn’t be barely getting by.” “Anora’s” best film competition included Jane Schoenbrun’s psychological horror “I Saw the TV Glow,” RaMell Ross’ adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s “Nickel Boys,” Greg Kwedar’s incarceration drama “Sing Sing” and Coralie Fargeat’s body horror “The Substance.” This year had several other possible Oscar winners celebrating. Kieran Culkin, considered an Oscar favorite, won the supporting performance award for “A Real Pain.” His director, co-star and writer Jesse Eisenberg won best screenplay for the film about two cousins embarking on a Holocaust tour in Poland. Culkin was not there to accept — he also missed his BAFTA win last weekend to tend to a family member — but other Oscar nominees like Madison and Demi Moore were. Madison won the top acting prize over Moore at the BAFTAs last weekend, as well, and stopped Saturday to pet Moore’s dog Pilaf on the way to the stage. Acting categories for the Spirit Awards are gender neutral and include 10 spots each, meaning Madison and Moore were up against Oscar nominees like Colman Domingo (“Sing Sing”) and Sebastian Stan (“The Apprentice”). The documentary prize went to “No Other Land,”  the lauded film by a Palestinian-Israeli collective about the destruction of a village in the West Bank which doesn’t have distribution. It’s also a strong Oscar contender in a competitive category. The filmmakers were not in attendance to accept the award. “Flow,” the wordless animated Latvian cat film, won best international film. At the Oscars, it’s competing in the international film category and animation. While the Spirit Award winners don’t always sync up with the academy, they can often reflect a growing consensus as in the “Everything Everywhere All At Once” year. The awards limit eligibility to productions with budgets of $30 million or less, meaning more expensive Oscar nominees like “Wicked” and “Dune: Part Two” were not in the running. Sean Wang accepted best first feature and best first screenplay prizes for “Dìdi.” He said it was special to be sharing the stage with one of his stars, Joan Chen, who was also nominated for the same award 25 years ago for “Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl.” The Netflix phenomenon “Baby Reindeer”  also picked up several prizes, for actors Richard Gadd, Jessica Gunning and Nava Mau. Mau, who is trans, spoke about the importance of actors sticking together “as we move into this next chapter.” “We don’t know what is going to happen, but we do know our power,” Mau said. “We are the people and our labor is everything.” Other television winners included “Shōgun,” for best new scripted series, and “How to Die Alone,” for best ensemble. “How to Die Alone” creator and star Natasha Rothwell was emotional while accepting the ensemble prize. The show was recently canceled after its first season. Rothwell said it was “a show about the need to feel seen, to be valued just as you are.” “For Black stories, visibility isn’t a privilege: It is a necessity,” Rothwell said. “We deserve to take up space, to be complex, to be hilarious and to be fully human.” The generally lighthearted show took a moment to acknowledge the impact of the wildfires on Los Angeles. Bryant made a plea to anyone watching the show, in the audience or on the YouTube livestream,  to help rebuild L.A.  She pointed to a QR code that appeared on the livestream to make donations to the Film Independent Emergency Filmmaker Relief Fund, providing grants to alumni impacted by the wildfires. The show also paid tribute to longtime Film Independent president Josh Welsh, who died earlier this year at age 62. Welsh had colon cancer. Bryant said in her opening that it had been a “great year for film and a bad year for human life.” The “Saturday Night Live” alum kicked off the event ribbing some of the nominees, like Emma Stone. “Emma was a producer on four nominated projects tonight,” Bryant said. “But even more importantly, her hair is short now.” Stone also featured prominently in Eisenberg’s speech, when he picked up the best screenplay prize for “A Real Pain.” Since they met on the set of “Zombieland” in 2009, he said, she’s been supportive of his writing despite being “the most famous person I know” and produced both of his films. “I think of her not as my producer, but as a fairy godmother, like I’m riding the coattails for her goodwill,” Eisenberg said.

She and her husband Dave McCary’s production company Fruit Tree also produced Julio Torres’ “Problemista” and “Fantasmas” and Schoenbrun’s “I Saw the TV Glow.” “I Saw the TV Glow” went into the show tied with “Anora” with six nominations.

    "title": "Reviewers Love This Folding Exercise Bike For Staying Active — And It’s On Sale",
    "text": "The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. Staying active and healthy is tough when the weather is nasty out, and this week, that’s definitely the case for a lot of folks anticipating snow or icy conditions. Luckily, we found a stationary bike that’s perfect for getting moving in the house to combat the weather and it’s on sale. This space-saving stationary bike is foldable for easy storage, features resistance bands for strength training, offers 16 levels of resistance for building leg strength and is a gentle, low-impact exercise (according to doctors!) that some reviews say is perfect for those with knee pain or coming out of physical rehab. It also has a stand for holding an e-reader or phone, just in case you prefer to get tasks done or have some entertainment while pedaling away. Usually $159.99, you can get it for up to 29% off (depending on color) or as low as $116.99. This stationary bike comes mostly pre-assembled, so building it won’t take long, and several reviewers say it’s easy to set up. It has a quiet flywheel so you won’t disturb your neighbors, a built-in resistance band (so it won’t ever get lost!) and supports a maximum weight of 300 pounds. Folded up, one reviewer in particular says it’s about the size of standard golf clubs. “I wanted an exercise bike to stay active during the winter. Coming from a background in sports wanted something that would allow me to stretch my legs enough to get a good workout in and also with a good amount of resistance for interval training . This does the job and does it well. Received as a Christmas gift. Definitely recommend the buy” — Lex  “Assembled within one hour of receipt, easy assembly in spite of the minimalist instruction booklet. The tools provided are adequate for the job, but if you have your own tools, they will be better. The only thing missing from the kit is the recommended threadlock liquid for installing the pedals.....note, however, that the right side pedal has right hand threads, while the left side pedal has left hand threads.....this means that, assuming you only pedal forward, the pedals will only try to tighten themselves onto the crank, so they are VERY unlikely to loosen in use. (sort of like knock-on wheels on English sports cars....the knock-on spinners on the left side have left hand threads for the same reason)..... Performance: they claim less than 20dB in use, my experience is that this exercycle is almost silent in use, no odd vibrations, no shaking or rattling parts.....the seat is comfortable....all of the metal structure is plainly over engineered, this is a well designed and executed machine! The range of magnetic resistance is excellent for exercise routines.” — SanLeandroGuy  “This is by the easiest bike I’ve ever assembled and the instructions were clear and concise. I needed this bike as part of my in home physical therapy session after my knee replacement surgery and I absolutely love it.” — Mathilda  “I could not be happier with this purchase. It was super easy to assemble (roughly 10mins), comfortable while in use (although my butt was a little sore after mile 10) and when folded is so compact and easy to store, being roughly the size and width of a set of golf clubs. The added wheels make this easy to carry around the house, and the compact design makes it easy to pop this thing in front of the TV for some active screen time. Give me an anime episode or a tv show and 8 miles feels like nothing! The resistance mechanism on this bike is great, very much comparable to the expensive bikes that are in gyms. The resistance straps within the design offer a versatile training experience as I am able to work arms and shoulders in the process of a good cardio/ leg workout. Because of this purchase, on days where im feeling off or just too tired to get out to the gym, I can hop on this, lower the resistance, and take a calm and steady pace to keep myself active! I think this is a must have for every home.” — NickRN@Nite  “The product is being used for personal exercise. The product was delivered within a week of the order being placed. The product arrived in perfect condition. The assembly instructions were clear and assembly of the product went quickly and smoothly. The product worked perfectly after assembly and delivers a good workout. The stretch bands are handy for getting in some upper body exercise while exercising the legs. The monitor with time, speed, distance, etc. is easily readable while exercising.” — Robert Schlappe By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Fox News Host Doesn’t Get How This Kendrick Lamar Guy Won ‘All These Grammars’",
    "text": "Jeanine Pirro “didn’t get” Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show — or apparently how to properly pronounce words. On Monday’s episode of “The Five,” the network’s legal analyst decided to blast the “Not Like Us” rapper’s performance Sunday, and her hot take was pretty shallow. “I want to talk about the halftime show,” Pirro said in a clip obtained by Mediaite. “Now, I got to tell you, what a nightmare. I kept sitting there saying, ‘You know, maybe I just don’t get this guy.’” She continued, “Then I find out there’s this subplot, there’s this drama with Drake. And, you know, he can do a concert. This guy, Ken, um, uh, Kendall Lamar.” “Kendrick,” Pirro’s co-host Jessica Tarlov interjected. But Pirro kept going without correcting her misidentification. “And he won all these Grammars,” Pirro said, referring to the “Alright” rapper’s 22 Grammys, five of which he won earlier this month — and eliciting giggles from her fellow panelists for butchering the pronunciation of the prestigious award show. “But, you know, we had Usher. We had The Weeknd, we had Beyoncé, and we had Rihanna. I mean, we had performers,” Pirro added. “I don’t know what the hell this guy was doing, but I didn’t get it.” Pirro’s criticism echoed many Super Bowl fans’ gripes about Lamar’s halftime show. Some were disappointed that his performance lacked the typical over-the-top “proud to be an American” spectacle that viewers are accustomed to seeing during the Super Bowl. And although Lamar certainly seemed to have a whole lot of fun dragging Drake on a national stage, his beef with the Canadian rapper wasn’t really the “subplot” of his performance — at least according to K-Dot’s fans. They say that the underlying statement the Pulitzer Prize-winning artist was trying to make during his more somber and subtle performance was political. (Unfortunately, President Donald Trump, who was in attendance at the game, left before Lamar’s performance ended.) Lamar’s performance began with a close-up of a beaming Samuel. L Jackson dressed as Uncle Sam, seemingly representing the razzle-dazzle patriotism that Super Bowl fans expect to see during the halftime show. Jackson’s Uncle Sam acted as an emcee throughout Lamar’s performance, and as The Hill pointed out, quickly revealed himself to be more of an Uncle Tom. The term, which stems from Harriet Beecher Stowe’s 1852 novel “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” refers to Black Americans who turn their backs on their community to submit to white Americans. At one point, the actor’s “Uncle Sam” told the rapper and his dancers that they were “too loud, too reckless, too ghetto,” conjuring stereotypes about Black Americans and hip-hop culture. Yet, instead of showing any semblance of shame for being too “ghetto,” Lamar and his dancers — who were all wearing red, white or blue jumpsuits — got into formation of the American flag. Although there’s several interpretations of what this could have meant, one suggestion is that Lamar and his dancers were being defiant, and saying that they too are Americans despite how Uncle Sam — or the current administration — may feel about it. Lamar’s fans on X, formerly Twitter, also had thoughts about the political statements throughout his performance, which you can read below. ppl complaining about how boring it was really need to open their eyes... this was bigger than entertainment the amount of political references and symbolism isINCREDIBLE and the fact that Kendrick did all that while Trump was watching makes it even better pic.twitter.com/DQuW2Y1e9R What a Black History Moment! The Super Bowl halftime show wasn’t just about entertainment—it was a protest, and some people missed the message because they were focused on the surface. What Kendrick Lamar brought to the stage was deeper than music—it was a call to wake up.… pic.twitter.com/dTNNyhfdDA The MAGA agenda relies on fear and chaos. So when Kendrick Lamar uses a platform as big as the Super Bowl halftime show to say no, we are not afraid, that in fact, we are a collective moving with a common purpose, it’s a direct hit to what MAGA needs to survive. pic.twitter.com/SKm8UtH1Vz samuel l jackson as uncle sam, the personification of america, telling kendrick his performance is \"too ghetto\" and then it cutting to kendrick's all-black backup dancers arranged as the american flag all while That Man is in attendance? kendrick i was not familiar with your game Needed this so much right now. I just called out the fact that Kendrick Lamar carried that red, white, and blue theme through. He owned it!My fam knew what that meant.THEY don’t want us here, but they do not own the flag. “Not Like Us” pic.twitter.com/zWGZ8yUjS4 Count on Kendrick to deliver an entertaining Super Bowl halftime show that doubled as a complete, coherent and compelling artistic / political statement.

    "title": "Amazon Is A Gold Mine For French Skin Care — And Reviewers Love These Anti-Aging Finds",
    "text": "You don’t have to be a francophile to appreciate France’s ability to formulate some impressive beauty goods — notably skin care products meant to support and improve the appearance of aging skin. It’s hard to not romanticize French-founded wonders and Parisian pharmacy staples like the Embryolisse’s Lait-Crème Concentré face cream, a truly luscious dry oil by Nuxe or a vitamin-rich serum that contains volcanic water straight from a spring in Vichy, France. Fortunately, Amazon can serve as your exclusive supplier for some of these reviewer-loved and internationally adored French products, many of which you can shop in the list ahead. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Time and time again, dermatologists have told us that retinoids are an essential ingredient for promoting cellular turnover and stimulating collagen production. A313 is a French pharmacy (and HuffPost) favorite cream containing three different types of retinol, each of them at an effective concentration without being overly irritating. It also features a distinctive texture that's closer to a hydrating balm. Promising Amazon reviews: “Since I’ve been using A313 for about 6 months my skin’s general health and condition have significantly improved. It immediately and successfully lightened the sun-induced hyperpigmentation I had. My dark sun spots have faded to almost nothing, so I don’t need to apply makeup to hide them. In addition, my skin appears less wrinkled and has become somewhat firmer and smoother.” — Diana Duque This iconic and ultra-rich French face cream contains a blend of calming aloe, soy proteins, skin-softening shea and beeswax. Not only has it gone viral several times on social media platforms like TikTok, this secret bestseller also comes highly recommended by makeup artists as the perfect makeup primer for preventing foundations or powders from settling into fine lines and wrinkles. Promising Amazon review: \"This is the FIRST facial lotion I've found that worked with sensitive + combination skin!! It does NOT make me break out - which is very rare. Incredible product! I put it on at night and wake up to the most beautiful, smooth, glowing skin! I see its easing up the crows feet around my eyes, making me feel a little younger.\" — Kristi-Lynn Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Marisa Garshick previously suggested the Vichy Neovadiol serum, a product specifically designed for peri- and post-menopausal skin. This serum combines a blend of proxylane, cassia extract, vitamins (b3, C and E), omega fatty acids and Vichy volcanic water. She believes this multi-tasking combination has the potential to improve the appearance of dark spots, fine lines and wrinkles while firming the skin and boosting hydration. Promising Amazon review: \"Any woman in perimenopause or menopause this is must have for your skin. I have experienced notable results after a month of use. I’ve been using the product for six months and can certainly tell the difference. This helps fade fine lines and the hydration provides a more youthful appearance.\" — Roseburg, Oregon This intensive and restorative day cream by Clarins was also a former pick by Garshick for anyone with deeply dehydrated skin — a common problem that comes with age and a contributing factor to fine lines. She said it incorporates organic harungana, which works similar to retinol while also being gentle on the skin.\"It also contains the anti-pollution complex to protect the skin from changes related to pollution and blue light,\" she said. Promising Amazon review: \"Definitely a luxury cream for older and mature skin, affected by aging. This dense moisturizer helps with sagging jowls and dryness that develops over time. A little WILL go a long way so make this jar last by just using a nickels worth at a time!! Especially useful during dry times of the year, it’s like a double dose of moisturizer for dehydrated skin.\" — Chloe The Resveratrol-Lift serum from Caudalíe claims to get its firming and elasticity-boosting power from the antioxidant resveratrol, a plant-based retinol alternative that can protect collagen in the skin. It also contains squalene and vegan collagen, which can work together to visibly firm and lift, as well as another popular hydrator, hyaluronic acid, which draws moisture into the skin. Promising Amazon review: \"Look, is this an overtly expensive serum? Yes. Is it worth the premium cost...? IMO, YES! However: this won't be for everyone as it really benefits those looking to specifically tighten and lift your cheeks, nasolabial lines and forehead over time. Or for those simply looking for great preventative aging products!I've used many anti-aging serums, retinols and retinol alternatives but this one has supplemented them all. I love the proprietary and oil-free formula in this; it never once disrupted or caused my skin irritation or break outs from the beginning and I'm a very pale person w sensitive skin who does not wear makeup at all.\" — M The Avène RetrinAL intensive cream claims to target multiple signs of skin aging like loss of elasticity, sun spots and fine lines by using a specific retinol and peptide blend exclusive to the RetrinAL line. This combination works to smooth, hydrate and plump skin, while a photostable form of vitamin E can prevent premature skin aging caused by environmental stressors. Promising Amazon review: \"I am 54 years old. This product was recommended to me by my aesthetician to brighten my complexion and fade brown spots/sun damage. The product is odorless. It comes in a small pump dispenser and only dispensers a small amount of whitish cream. I apply the whitish cream to my face, neck and cleavage. The cream does not leave a film on your skin and goes on smoothly. I was instructed by my aesthetician to use this product daily as an evening routine prior to going to bed. After the first day's use of this product, I noticed my face was smooth and I didn't need moisturizer. After 1-2 weeks, I noticed a dramatic difference in the my skin texture. My skin was soft, smooth, a lot of my age spots and wrinkles virtually disappeared or began to fade. After approximately 3+ weeks, my complexion was brighter. The product leaves you with a healthy glow and your skin texture appears tighter, more firm. I continue to use this product nightly as part of my routine. I would definitely recommend it! As a precaution, use sunscreen when outside with any retinal products to avoid further sunspots/damage. The price at the dermatologist office was $20 more than Amazon.\" — Imani If you're desperate to target moisture loss and dryness-related wrinkles, this lightweight and fast-absorbing booster by Vichy may be able to help. The gel-like serum features a concentrated dose of hyaluronic acid, a popular humectant that draws moisture into the epidermis and helps to plump skin. It's supplemented with Vichy volcanic water meant to help strengthen the skin barrier, something that could potentially be compensated with age. Promising Amazon reviews: \"I'm 48 and am told I look about 10 - 12 years younger than that age. I've also been on the hunt for the best most effective anti aging skin care products around. I'm totally going to add this to the list. I have sensitive skin and have hormonal breakouts. This product did not add to either of these issues. It has really surprised me in how much it's moisturized my skin without irritation. I also like it because the smell it has is minimal and not strong at all. The other benefit is that it lasts a long time, you only need a little bit.\" — giddeup17 \"I have heard about Vichy products, but have never tried them until now. I actually loved this Mineral 89 formula. Goes on light and absorbs into my aging skin quickly. I have been using it daily twice a day for the past month (in the morning and before I go to bed). My skin is actually glowing and has a more youthful appears and glow. I find this to be a great moisturizer which does not interfere with my other beauty products (i.e. sunscreen, foundation, etc). This is a reasonably priced product compared to other moisturizers out there and I think it does a much better job than most. I am sold on Vichy now and will be expanding my knowledge of the product line and bring more into my daily beauty regimen.\" — M.Kelly After speaking with dermatologists about the ways to target and prevent thin and crepey skin, sunscreen — and more specifically, tinted sunscreen — was high up on more than one expert's list because tinted formulations can help shield skin from visible UV rays in overhead lighting. This popular universally tinted sunscreen fluid by La Roche-Posay offers SPF 50 broad spectrum sun protection using 100% mineral filters and iron oxide pigments. This never-cakey and matte-finish screen is also enriched with antioxidants to prevent premature skin aging caused by environmental stressors. Promising Amazon reviews: \"Flawless. I was extremely happy I found this product. I'm in my 50's and I was not wanting to wear foundations that looked caked on or show all my flaws. I use the light tint which matches perfectly with my skin tone and covers flawlessly. Stays on all day with one application. One bottle has lasted me 6 months! So it is well worth the money.\" — Amazon customer \"I use this year round as a base coat & it helps so much with the wrinkles & keeping a youthful look. I am only 53 but everyone says I look a good 8-10 years younger. I love the product & just a couple drops does the whole face & neck. A bottle lasts me 3-4 months easily.\" — Robin This vitamin C serum by La Roche-Posay may be able to brighten and improve uneven skin tone, address irregular skin texture and prevent premature skin aging. It uses a trusted and well-studied antioxidant (vitamin C) and salicylic acid to gently exfoliate dead skin and clear pores. Promising Amazon review: \"This stuff has significantly improved my skin within a short period of time. I am still on my first bottle. I started out using the red bottle, which is the Retinol 3B at night (wonderful stuff too!!!) then I thought to try the vitamin C during the day, with sunscreen of course.I was starting to get the 40-year-old looking skin, i.e. large pores, loosening, dullness, etc. and tried a few different things to help. Some of the stuff was okay and some stuff did not work at all. After incorporating these two products (i.e. the pure Vitamin C and the Retinol 3B serums) into my day and nighttime skin regimen, I can honestly say my skin looks younger. I am still working to fade some dark spots, but again, my skin looks\" — EbonyC. Packed inside this radiance-boosting concentrate is 10% bifidus prebiotic, an ingredient that the French luxury brand Lancôme claims to support the skin's moisture barrier. It also contains hyaluronic acid to help plump and enhance moisture retention and a type of vitamin C that may help to brighten and smooth. Promising Amazon reviews: \"Love, love love this! It makes my skin tighter and [pores] smaller. It really seems to brighten my skin as well. Only using about a month now but notice a difference if i miss a day. I am 60 yo and i really think this has helped to make my skin look less saggy.\" — Kathy \"I love it!! Because It's clearly helping me to diminish fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots, giving me a more youthful and radiant complexion. You can say goodbye to dull skin and hello to a fresh, firm, and glowing appearance. Incorporate this Anti-Aging Face Serum into your skincare routine and embrace a more youthful version of yourself!\" — Carly Spring Consider this homeopathic ointment the French pharmacy equivalent of Vaseline or Elizabeth Arden's pricy eight-hour cream. The non-greasy and sheen-free formula can protect skin from the elements, address dry patches, fill in deep lip lines and restore dry flaky lips. Use it as an everyday lip balm, to slug the face or prep the skin for a smooth and flawless makeup application. This price listed below is for two tubes of cream. Promising Amazon review: \"Oh yeah, France. The stuff has worked miracles on my aging lips. It works great under lipstick or by itself. Also very quickly healed some abrasions my son got on The back of his hands doing yard work. I don’t know if I’d recommend it all over for the face.\" — Sandra S. Formulated to nourish, repair and hydrate both hair and skin, this all-over dry oil claims to moisturize skin for up to eight hours while imparting a healthy and youthful glow. It contains seven precious botanical oils and antioxidant-rich vitamin E and is scented with notes of vanilla and orange blossom. Promising Amazon review: \"Oh why didn't I discover you earlier? Amazing ! absorbs really fast. The smell does not last long for those who do not like it. Works on skin way better than any anti-age creams and lotions. A very little goes a long way. I have been testing on my forearms which were starting to look a bit crepy with sun exposure and only 3 weeks on I am already noticing a difference. I use it on my face, neck, hands, arms and hair to prevent static. Very very little for fine hair I would recommend for it might weigh it down. I tried different oils before : coconut, argan, you name it but this one works wonders for it does not stay on your skin. I am hooked !

    "title": "Why Is It So Hard To Find A Normal One-Piece Swimsuit?",
    "text": "As a not-thin, not-straight person, the bathing suit has become a particularly loaded item of clothing. Through the years, I’ve felt pressure to hide my body, pressure to “reclaim” my body and most recently, pressure to to publicly show my lack of shame and unapologetic body confidence via donning a two-piece anytime I’m near water. Growing up sentenced to unflattering swim dresses and catalog tankinis intended for someone five times my age, my initial move to the bikini felt revolutionary. The more I loved my body, the more I loved wearing two pieces — for their peeing/changing/layering convenience and because they made me feel good about myself. I’ve been a strict two-piece wearer for nearly a decade now, and never thought I’d go back to covering up. Yet, on a recent trip to a Philadelphia public pool with a friend and her kid, it occurred to me that it could be nice to have a one-piece in the mix. Not to hide my body, just to ensure I can splash around without worrying about a nip slip or exposing my buns. Besides, a one-piece is one item to launder and pack instead of two. It requires no matching or coordinating. And frankly, as I bid farewell to my 20s, a one-piece just feels more comfortable for me when I’m at the beach with my family or asking the teenage lifeguard for the pool hours. I wanted a basic, affordable one-piece that covered my whole tush and cost less than $100. And reader, I did not realize how hard it would be to find one. As I started to look for a modern one-piece, it seemed every option had huge cut-outs, a myriad of criss-cross straps and buckles and was cut so high up the leg it was virtually a thong. Everything looked like a bad interpretation of an ’80s party or neon lingerie one may wear at an electronic music festival in the desert. For the record: I was explicitly looking for something nondescript. My personality is cheeky enough, I’d love my bottom to be fully covered. What’s worse? Most options seemed to cost north of $150, with no clear explanation of, say, the ethical sourcing or advanced construction that would merit said pricetag. After looking for probably too long, I found and have worn an option I’m happy with and rounded up some other promising ones below. They are basic, easy, one-piece swimsuits that give ample coverage, have no extra clasps or tassels and cost under $100. Many come in fun colors and patterns, many are neutrals and all offer some modesty without looking dated. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. This high-neck one-piece is made by Knix, a brand best known for its innovative period underwear. Although this particular suit doesn't offer leakproof protection (plenty of Knix swimwear does, however) it does extra support in the form of an internal shelf bra, removable cups and adequate butt coverage. It's also made with UPF50+ fabric to help offer protection from the sun. You can find it in this fun limited edition tangerine color and in sizes XS-4XL. Promising Knix review: \"I love the high neck front. The low back is beautiful as well. I appreciate that there’s enough butt coverage where it’s not too cheeky. I am extremely happy with my purchase!\" — Rach Zip her up or let her hang, this adorable short-sleeve suit can be as modest as you want it. It has a full-coverage bottom and sewn-in soft cups to keep you supported at the lake, pool, or wherever you enjoy water time. This comes in a ton of colors in sizes XS-XXL. Promising review: \"I have received a lot of compliments on this bathing suit. The quality and fit are excellent. Color is as expected. I love the extra cover on the shoulders. The zipper is an active zipper and is easy to use, adjustable and stays in place. Will buy again.\" — Elizabeth L. Ok, so this is probably the most spicy option as it has a little V-neck action and some detailing on the front of the waist, but it still has two basic, adjustable straps that do not crisscross or do anything else funky. It has removable cups, a full coverage bottom and a UPF 50+ rating to protect you from the sun. This comes in four colors in S-L with some options up to a 24. Promising review: \"This has become my go to swimsuit. I have now owned it for 2yrs and it’s held up perfectly. It slims just the right spots with good coverage.\" — Sarah Quince is known for their high-quality items at great prices and this cami-style swimsuit is no exception. It covers your bum, the brand says it won't pill or snag and has adjustable straps. It offers UPF 50, had removable cups and is chlorine, oil and sunscreen-resistant, keeping you looking fresh for many summers to come. This comes in five colors in XS-XL. Promising review: \"I wanted a suit that would make me feel comfortable chasing my toddlers around while still feeling cute and this is it! It’s the perfect red. I have a long torso so one piece don’t often work for me but this one was great.\" — Tess O. If you want something that will look like a body suit or cute tank top when you wear it with jeans — you found it. This cute suit has adjustable straps that you can make criss-cross and sweet buttons that you can fasten at your leisure. It has some nice ruching around the tum and a nice ribbed fabric. With full bum coverage, you got your new favorite suit. This comes in a bunch of colors in S-XL. Promising review: \"As someone who hates swimsuits, I can’t say enough nice things about this one. It’s flattering, has good coverage and support, and looks great. I was debating between a medium and large, and could have probably fit into both, but, at least for me, was better off sizing down to a medium (158 pounds, 5’6”).\" — Shae M Whether you're crushing laps in the pool or just want to feel really supported, this sporty option offers a high neckline, racer back and full coverage on the bum. It has wide straps for chest support and sewn-in cups for coverage and comfort. This comes in over 7 patterns in sizes S-XL. Promising review: \"I needed a swimsuit that was best for water aerobics and lap swimming AND this suit does it all. It also looks great on me.\" —  Kay Fletcher How cute and summery is this vintage-inspired ruched one-piece? It screams vacation whether you're under a cabana or in the backyard running through the sprinkler. It has some masterful ruching and light breast padding making it look way more expensive than it is with adjustable straps and a full-coverage bottom. This comes in many fun colors and patterns, and some netural options in sizes S-XL. Grab the coupon for 10% off. Promising review: \"I have been putting on weight for some time and was going away and needed a suit. Took a chance and I’m so happy I did. There were other suits I had to return but not this one! I like the full coverage bottom. So flattering. I am currently 5’2 about 180. I felt confident and comfortable. Held up well through a few swims and washes so far. I absolutely love it. Don’t hesitate. I also received compliments on the look.\" — Greg Incerto Finally, a suit that boasts lower-cut leg openings. This option from Land's End features the brands \"tugless tank\" style that keeps you covered without needing to pull or readjust as you move.

Liked it so mush that I bought two more in other colors!\" — Momtad Offering subtle pin-up vibes while still being super wearable, this one-piece has ruching all down the front with adjustable wide straps and removable pads. It has a little tummy control for extra support. This comes in a bunch of colors in sizes 6-18. Promising review: \"Love this bathing suit! I wear size 12 clothes but I ordered a 14 in this so it wouldn’t be so tight (I’m 67 years old). Couldn’t ask for better quality and fit! It’s adorable! It has a full back, which I like. Had adjustable straps too!\" — Paudie Full coverage in a fun color, this suit from L.L. Bean is breathable and chlorine-resistant.

    "title": "Gene Hackman Once Revealed Why He Didn’t Officially Announce His Retirement",
    "text": "Gene Hackman was a true giant in Hollywood, and his death this week has left many reflecting on his storied career. The Hollywood legend and two-time Oscar winner was renowned for starring in films like “French Connection,” “Bonnie and Clyde” and “Hoosiers.” But he revealed in a candid interview with Empire in 2009 that his health was preventing him from continuing to work. “The straw that broke the camel’s back was actually a stress test that I took in New York,” Hackman said at the time. “The doctor advised me that my heart wasn’t in the kind of shape that I should be putting it under any stress.” Hackman also discussed his decision to step away from the limelight in a 2008 interview with Reuters, and said he had officially retired. “I haven’t held a press conference to announce retirement, but yes, I’m not going to act any longer,” he told the outlet, before explaining why he hadn’t been very public with the news. “I’ve been told not to say that over the last few years, in case some real wonderful part comes up, but I really don’t want to do it any longer,” he said. Hackman admitted he missed acting but said he found the business “very stressful.” “The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,” the “Superman” star said. “It had gotten to a point where I just didn’t feel like I wanted to do it anymore.” Hackman’s last role was in the 2004 film “Welcome to Mooseport,” in which he portrayed a former U.S. president. He was 74 when the film came out. Hackman and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, were found dead Wednesday at their property in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Foul play was not initially suspected. However, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adam Mendoza said Friday on the “Today” show that authorities are “not ruling that out” just yet. Mendoza also admitted that it was “very difficult to put a timeline together” of when the couple died. Evidence indicated that “several days, possibly even up to a couple weeks” had passed before the bodies were discovered by a maintenance worker, the sheriff said.

    "title": "'We're Pissed!': Angry Constituents Confront DOGE-Backing GOP Rep At Chaotic Town Hall",
    "text": "Rep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.) got a less-than-warm reception from voters on Thursday as he faced anger and pushback over his support for the Trump administration’s cost-cutting crusade in the federal government. McCormick ― who reportedly spoke to “hundreds of critics” at the city hall building in Roswell, Georgia ― was met with boos and jeers as attendees questioned whether he was doing them a “disservice” by backing billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency budget-slashing frenzy. “You don’t think I’m going to stand up for you?” asked McCormick, who received boos from the crowd in response, according to a clip shared by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Greg Bluestein. Bluestein ― who captured a line spilling out of the building prior to the event ― shared another clip showing McCormick emphasizing the federal deficit and later telling the crowd that “nobody can hear” when they’re yelling. Attendees, while opposing McCormick’s assertion that departments and agencies are deciding who to layoff or fire, criticized Musk for “deciding” who to cut while others were heard declaring “we’re pissed” and chanted “shame,” NBC News reported. Another video from Bluestein shows an attendee asking McCormick why a “supposedly conservative party” is “taking such a radical and extremist and sloppy approach” to the cuts. He referred to the Trump administration firing probationary employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as its efforts to rehire workers at the National Nuclear Security Administration. McCormick — who recently made headlines when he suggested that children taking part in school lunch programs “sponge off the government” — argued that “a lot of the work” done by probationary employees at the CDC “is duplicitous with AI.” “Once again, one of the problems we have—” the congressman continued before the crowd interrupted him. He later added, “If we continue to grow the size of government and we can’t afford it, it’s going to have shortfalls in your Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.” The attendee told McCormick that he understood “trying to do more with less” but disagreed with the “chainsaw approach” to the cuts. “Why is this being jammed down the pipe, so rushed and sloppily?” asked the man, whose question garnered applause.

The response from constituents in Roswell, part of a congressional district where McCormick won nearly 65% of the vote in November, eerily mirrors scenes of voters shouting down GOP lawmakers at town halls not long after President Donald Trump first took office in 2017. Republicans, at the time, went on to duck town hall meetings with voters, who found other means to call out their representatives as a result. Democrats also faced angered constituents themselves back in 2009 when the ACA was up for debate.

    "title": "Jimmy Carter Wins Posthumous Grammy",
    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former President Jimmy Carter has won a posthumous Grammy award. Carter, the peanut farmer who won the presidency in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Vietnam War, died in December at age 100. Prior to his passing, Carter was nominated in the audio book, narration, and storytelling recording category at the 2025 Grammys for “Last Sundays in Plains: A Centennial Celebration,” recordings from his final Sunday School lessons delivered at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia. Musicians Darius Rucker, Lee Ann Rimes and Jon Batiste are featured on the record. It’s Carter’s fourth Grammy. His posthumous Grammy joins his three previous ones for spoken word album. If the former president won before his death, he would’ve become the oldest Grammy award winner in history. Jason Carter, Jimmy Carter’s grandson who now chairs The Carter Center governing board, received the award on his behalf. “Having his words captured in this way for my family and for the world is truly remarkable,” he said in an acceptance speech. “Thank you to the academy.” In the category, Jimmy Carter beat out Barbra Streisand, George Clinton, Dolly Parton and producer guy Oldfield. If Streisand won instead of Carter, it would have been her first Grammy win in 38 years. Currently, the oldest person to win a Grammy was 97-year-old Pinetop Perkins in 2011. “He’s such an enormous music fan. He loves the creative aspect of music,” Jason Carter said backstage about his grandfather. “It’s been an important part of his political life, an important part of his personal life. He’s an artist in many ways.” Former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have two Grammys apiece. First ladies Michelle Obama and Hilary Clinton have also each won.

    "title": "No One Expected These Music Stars To Miss Out On Grammys This Year",
    "text": "This article includes material from HuffPost’s weekly culture and entertainment newsletter, The Culture Catchall. Click here to subscribe. For every surprising win at the Grammy Awards, you can bet there’s always a snub (or several) right around the corner, too. This year, the 67th annual ceremony, hosted by Trevor Noah, was filled with shocking moments — from Beyoncé’s long overdue Album of the Year win to Kendrick Lamar sweeping Record and Song of the Year with his scathing diss track, “Not Like Us.” However, between those victories were stunning losses for some of music’s biggest stars. In a rare turn of events, Taylor Swift — whose chart-topping “The Tortured Poets Department” album yielded five nominations, including the big three categories (Record, Song and Album of the Year) — walked away with zero gramophones for the first time in quite a while. The same goes for Billie Eilish, who received seven total nominations — including Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album for “Hit Me Hard and Soft” — but also left Sunday’s ceremony empty-handed. To be fair, this year’s major category nominations were undeniably stacked, and Swift and Eilish have taken those wins home before, so it’s hard to think of their recent losses as snubs. Swift holds the record for most Album of the Year wins of anyone in Grammy history, and Eilish has won the big three on at least one occasion (not to mention she also has two Oscars). Still, that didn’t stop fans from calling out the singers’ Ls online. Not the #GRAMMYs using Taylor for views and then snubbing her for no reason on her BEST album to date 🙄 pic.twitter.com/ltUooGpv0B 0 grammys for this album and for billie is the most ridiculous thing i’ve ever seen. they did her so wrong, she definitely atleast deserved album of the year and song of the year. this album is pure art. pic.twitter.com/cfwgkUd97m Billie Eillish got hella robbed, Hit me Hard and Soft is literally her best album so far and she got no awards for it, dang and I’m not even a Billie fan but the Grammys messed up that one just woke up to the news of billie not winning a single award, grammys you’re such a joke pic.twitter.com/0Osqi7z4GU I’m not even an avocado but Taylor and Billie had the biggest albums of the year and for them to get no grammys at all is crazy pic.twitter.com/Wq9xbpp3AD Finneas, Eilish’s older brother and longtime collaborator, issued a statement to fans on Sunday to quell the commotion surrounding his sister’s losses. “I don’t wanna see ANYONE with a photo of me or billie as their PFP gettin’ in fights with other artists’ fans in comment sections!!!” the producer wrote on his Instagram story. “Be at peace! Congratulations to all!!” Other notable artists who missed out on snagging gramophones this year are Post Malone, who extended his near-record losing streak again with no trophies for his eight 2025 nominations (he has 18 career nominations and zero wins); André 3000, whose “New Blue Sun” debut instrumental LP was nominated for Album of the Year; and Shaboozey, who, despite having one of the longest-running No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 — “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” — and six nominations, did not become a first-time Grammy winner. Some have argued that this year’s Grammys felt like the Recording Academy made up for past upsets, pointing to prime examples like Beyoncé’s top prize, more major awards for Black artists, and The Weeknd ending his yearslong boycott of the show with a surprise performance. Perhaps that factored into why Swift, Eilish, and others didn’t sweep categories as some expected. In my humble opinion, the 2025 Grammys felt like the Recording Academy finally got a lot of things right for a change: a woman winning Best Rap Album for the third time in history, a rap record snagging two of the big three trophies and a Black woman becoming a first-time Best Country Album winner (that Quincy Jones tribute could’ve been better, though).

(I hold this critique for all award shows that weren’t designed with people of color in mind).

    "title": "Israel Delays Release Of Palestinian Prisoners, Citing 'Humiliating' Handovers Of Hostages",
    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel says the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners is delayed “until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies” at handovers of Israeli captives in Gaza. The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office came early Sunday as vehicles apparently carrying prisoners left the open gates of Ofer prison, only to turn around and go back in. The release of 620 Palestinian prisoners had been delayed for several hours and was meant to occur just after six Israeli hostages were released on Saturday. It was meant to be the largest one-day prisoner release in the Gaza ceasefire’s first phase. Five of the six hostages freed Saturday were escorted by masked, armed militants in front of a crowd — a display that the U.N. and others have criticized as cruel after previous handovers. The Israeli statement cited “ceremonies that demean the dignity of our hostages and the cynical use of the hostages for propaganda purposes.” It was likely a reference to a Hamas video showing two hostages who have yet to be released watching a handover in Gaza on Saturday and speaking under duress. Hamas had released the last six living hostages expected under the ceasefire ’s first phase, with a week remaining in the initial stage. Israel’s announcement abruptly put the future of the truce into further doubt. Freed were three Israeli men seized from the Nova music festival and another taken while visiting family in southern Israel during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the 16-month war in Gaza. The two others were held for a decade after entering Gaza on their own. Five were handed over in staged ceremonies that the Red Cross and Israel have condemned as cruel and disrespectful. Omer Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov and Eliya Cohen were posed alongside Hamas fighters. A beaming Shem Tov, acting under duress, kissed two militants on the head and blew kisses to the crowd. They wore fake army uniforms, though they were not soldiers when abducted. Cohen’s family and friends in Israel chanted “Eliya! Eliya! Eliya!” and cheered. “You’re heroes,” Shem Tov told his parents as they later embraced, laughing and crying. “You have no idea how much I dreamt of you.” His father, Malki Shem Tov, told public broadcaster Kan his son was held alone after the first 50 days and lost 17 kilograms (37 pounds). Earlier Saturday, Tal Shoham, 40, and Avera Mengistu, 38, were freed. Mengistu, an Ethiopian-Israeli, entered Gaza in 2014. His family told Israeli media he has struggled with mental health issues. The Israeli-Austrian Shoham was taken from Kibbutz Be’eri. His wife and two children were freed in a 2023 exchange. Later, Israel’s military said Hisham Al-Sayed, 36, was released. The Bedouin Israeli entered Gaza in 2015. His family has told Israeli media he was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia. Israel’s government didn’t respond to questions about the delay in releasing prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the ceasefire deal, with spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanou accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of “deliberately stalling.” The hostage release followed a heartrending dispute when Hamas on Thursday handed over the wrong body for Shiri Bibas, an Israeli mother abducted with her two young boys. The remains were determined to be those of a Palestinian woman. Netanyahu vowed revenge for “a cruel and malicious violation.” Hamas suggested it was a mistake. Israeli forensic authorities confirmed a body handed over on Friday was Bibas. Dr. Chen Kugel, head of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said they found no evidence Bibas and her children were killed in an Israeli airstrike, as Hamas has claimed. Kugel did not give a cause. Hamas denied the Israeli military claim, based on forensic evidence and unspecified “intelligence,” that its militants killed the children “with their bare hands,” calling it a lie aimed at justifying Israeli military actions against civilians in Gaza. The ceasefire deal has paused the deadliest and most devastating fighting ever between Israel and Hamas, but there are fears the war will resume. Hamas has said it will release four bodies next week, completing the truce’s first phase. After that, Hamas will hold over 60 hostages — about half believed to be alive. Talks on the ceasefire’s second phase are yet to start, but negotiations are likely to be more difficult. Hamas has said it won’t release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu, with the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, says he’s committed to destroying Hamas’ military and governing capacities and returning all hostages, goals widely seen as mutually exclusive. An Israeli official said Netanyahu would meet with security advisers on Saturday evening about the ceasefire’s future, focusing “on the goal of returning all our hostages, alive and dead.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting had not been formally announced. Wenkert, Cohen, Shoham and Shem Tov had an “extremely difficult period in captivity,” the Beilinson hospital said, but it did not give details at the families’ request. Niva Wenkert, Omer’s mother, told Israel’s Channel 12 that “on the surface, he looks OK, but there’s no telling what’s inside.” “This is an unforgettable moment, where all emotions are rapidly mixing together,” Shoham’s family said, and called for a deal to free all hostages still held. Families and others rallied again Saturday night in Tel Aviv to pressure Netanyahu’s government for a deal. “How is it possible that President Trump and special envoy (Steven) Witkoff are more committed to the return of Israeli hostages than you are?” said Naama Weinberg, cousin of deceased hostage Itay Svirsky. “Netanyahu, these are your citizens who were abandoned on your watch!” Hamas later released a video showing two hostages still held, Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa Dallal, as they sat in a vehicle and spoke under duress at the handover for Shem Tov, Cohen and Wenkert. A group representing hostages’ families called the video “sickening.” The 620 Palestinian prisoners meant to be freed include 151 serving life or other sentences for attacks against Israelis. Almost 100 would be deported, according to the Palestinian prisoners’ media office. A Palestinian prisoner rights association said they include Nael Barghouti, who spent over 45 years in prison for an attack that killed an Israeli bus driver. Also meant to be released are 445 men, 23 children aged 15 to 19, and a woman, all seized by Israeli troops in Gaza without charge during the war. Israel’s military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed vast areas of Gaza, reducing entire neighborhoods to rubble. At its height, the war displaced 90% of Gaza’s population. The Oct. 7 attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have died in the war. ___ Shurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Jahjouh from Rafah.

    "title": "'That Day Is Here': CNN Data Reporter Reveals Trump's New 'Great Weakness'",
    "text": "CNN data reporter Harry Enten spotted a major warning sign for President Donald Trump in the latest polling data as voters give him low marks in the one area that used to be his greatest strength: the economy. “I honestly never thought I’d see the day in which Donald Trump would be polling so poor on the economy, but that day is here,” Enten said on Thursday. Enten said four new polls “tell a consistent story” about Trump: His approval ratings, which were in positive territory last month as he began his second term in office, have now completely reversed. “Trump is on the negative side of the ledger,” Enten said. “His net approval is negative. He is underwater like ‘The Little Mermaid.’” All four of the new polls released Thursday show him with a negative net approval rating, he pointed out, making it Trump’s “worst day of polling” since he took office. But it’s his numbers on the economy that really stand out. “This was one of Donald Trump’s great strengths,” Enten said. “Now it’s one of his great weaknesses.” Enten said that in February 2017, at a similar point during Trump’s first term in office, an Ipsos poll had him up by 16 points on the economy. Now, he said, that same poll has him down by 8. He said it comes down to one core issue ― and it’s the same one that bedeviled Trump’s predecessor. “As I said last week, inflation ate the Joe Biden presidency alive, and right now it is very much the case that Donald Trump is in danger of inflation eating his presidency alive, because his net approval ratings on the economy are underwater.” See more below: The last day has been the worst polling day for Trump during his entire 2nd term. -4 polls show his net approval rating underwater like The Little Mermaid. -The 3 polls with a trend line show his ratings going down. -His one time strength (the economy) is now a weakness. pic.twitter.com/l9IQOhXS9K By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "13 Fire Safety Items You Should Always Have In The House",
    "text": "While planning and preparing can’t stop emergencies from happening, having the supplies you need and some sense of direction can keep you and your family safer during a catastrophe. This is certainly the case for home fires, according to Michael Kozo, New York City Fire Department (FDNY) captain and commanding officer of the FDNY’s Fire Safety Education Unit. Home fire safety “isn’t as simple as having a ‘go bag,’” Kozo told HuffPost. “We’re talking a little bit more about preparedness in terms of fire safety education. It’s all about having an escape plan in your home. Have everybody in your home sit down together and go over an escape plan. Then you practice it.” Per Kozo, the number one way to be prepared for a home fire is to have working, regularly tested smoke alarms in every room of your house. He recommends checking the batteries once a month as well as brushing them off to make sure dust doesn’t get stuck in them. With the rise in wildfires, it feels remiss to discuss home fire preparedness without looking into wildfire safety. Jon Heggie, battalion chief at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) defines home wildfire preparedness as “having all the things readily available if you are asked to evacuate.” While this can mean an already packed to-go bag containing things like extra clothes, food, water and medication, Heggie says it’s also helpful to just keep a running list of where your important documents and sentimental items are around the house. “We don’t want people to live in a constant state of fear and being packed, ready to go,” Heggie said. “But having that, you know — insurance papers, hall closet. Pictures, pick ’em up here. Know where those items are throughout your house to be able to grab and go at a moment’s notice.” Whether you’re preparing a to-go bag or just want to equip your house the best you can for a fire, the experts break down the things you need to be prepared in the event of a blaze. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. \"The number one thing where we can all start with being prepared in our home for fire is smoke alarms,\" Kozo said. \"There are quite a few statistics out there that say that having and maintaining working smoke alarms reduces your chances of dying in a fire by 50%. The number one thing we advocate and insist is that people have working smoke alarms in every room.\" After installing a fire alarm in every room of your home, Kozo recommends testing each alarm once a month. \"You still have to test it monthly, make sure that it's working properly, make sure that there's no dust in there,\" he said. This 120-volt AC smoke detector comes with a 9-volt battery and a 10-year limited warranty. You can purchase a single alarm or, on Amazon, get a pack of three, six or 12. When a fire emergency strikes, you don't have time to collect your valuables from different drawers. To give you peace of mind and to help you leave the building as quickly as possible, Krista Farley Raines, regional communications director for American Red Cross Central Appalachia Region, recommends storing important items in a fire-proof safe that can be recovered after the fire is put out. Instead of having one more thing to look for, grab and take with you out of the burning house, you can make sure you and your family are safe, knowing your jewelry and old photos will be protected as well. This safety box is fireproof and waterproof; it can hold letter and A4 size documents lying down. Based on the product's UL rating, the interior contents will remained protected for up to 30 minutes when the box is heated to 1,550 degrees. \"Fire escape ladders provide a simple, easy-to-store way to help ensure that you and your family get out safely in the event of a house fire,\" Farley Raines said. \"If you live in a two- or three-story home, you should have one ladder in every occupied room on floors above the main level.\"This tangle-free fire ladder measures 13 feet and can hold up to 1,000 pounds. This editor's pick, the Jackery Explorer 240 portable power station, is beloved by reviewers for its ability to power electronics in an emergency and the light weight (under 7 pounds). It features an AC outlet and two USB-A ports, so you can plug in up to three devices at once. You also don't have to worry about the power station itself running out of juice if your home loses power or you have to evacuate; you can charge this using your car outlet, or Jackery's own solar panels, which you can buy separately. Promising review: \"I purchased two of these for the rolling power outages in California from wildfires. I specifically wanted the 200 watts to power my mini fridge if needed as it has an AC outlet. I love this product as it is very portable and easy to charge using the Solar panel I got directly from Jackery. I use it regularly to power my iPad and it has also come in handy twice when power was lost due to heavy storms in my area this past winter. Nice solid construction and at only six pounds, I can easily move it from room to room. I’m quite happy with this product and feel safer now too.\" — June This hand-crank weather radio comes equipped with seven pre-programmed NOAA weather stations so you can remain up-to-date on important weather changes. But that's not all: The radio also features an LED flashlight, reading lamp, SOS alarm, compass, headphone jack and emergency cell phone charger with USB input. Promising review: \"I live in Sonoma, California. In 2017 I had to evacuate, not prepared very well. Then this year, 2019, after a little \"shake 'em up\" I decided to better prepare so I bought this emergency radio. I didn't have to evacuate the Oct. fire but the power was out for a week. I'm really glad I had this little radio for updates and company.\" — hippyrick Per Heggie, flashlights are useful in any sort of emergency, especially if a fire happens at night. This set comes with two high-powered, waterproof flashlights. Heggie says to make sure you have extra batteries for the flashlights and other devices you may need. Kozo advises keeping two home fire extinguishers — one by the kitchen in the event of a small kitchen fire and one in your bedroom if there's a fire near where you or your family is sleeping. However, he's explicit when he says a home fire extinguisher is a tool to help you safely exit your home — not completely put out a house fire. \"We don't recommend you try to act as a firefighter and put out this huge fire,\" Kozo said. \"After about 45 seconds or so, the fire's gonna be beyond your control. That extinguisher, you'll be able to knock down just enough fire where you'll be able to get out safe or maybe get to your children's bedroom or something like that.\" As Heggie says, every family's to-go bag will look different. Still, he shares that a first-aid kit is something all families will be glad to have. This one contains everything from bandages to ibuprofen tablets. In addition to first-aid supplies, Heggie says you'll want to have some toiletries for you and your family. Rather than running around the house finding things in the moment, this kit has everything you need including deodorant, toothpaste and a razor. In addition to smoke alarms, Kozo urges you to have a carbon monoxide alarm on every level of your home.\"Install carbon monoxide alarms to alert your family to this invisible, odorless, colorless gas before it’s too late,\" Farley Raines told HuffPost. \"A small amount of carbon monoxide can poison or kill a person if it is breathed in over a long period of time — such as overnight while sleeping.\"This carbon monoxide alarm lasts up to five years and uses a 9-volt battery. Heggie urges you to keep food and water for your human family in your to-go bag. He also recommends packing everything your pet may need, like their food and medications or an extra leash. This is a set of two collapsible food and water bowls that stack easily and make an instant space for your pet to eat and drink on the go. You can get these bowls in two sizes. \"If you have battery-powered smoke alarms, replace the batteries at least once a year,\" Farley Raines said. \"Check the batteries when the time changes from standard to daylight saving each spring and then back again in the fall.\" Many smoke and carbon monoxide detectors (like the two we listed) use 9-volt batteries; this two-pack from Energizer has a five-year shelf life. During a fire, you may not have time to clearly communicate who else is in your home. Farley Raines says putting firefighter rescue alert stickers on your outside windows and doors can instruct the team on who may still need to be rescued. \"Firefighter rescue alert stickers placed on windows help firefighters locate children, the elderly, disabled residents and pets,\" she said. This fire rescue alert is a matte vinyl sticker that comes in five sizes. And for additional fire safety items to consider, take a look at this collection of fireproof document bags to put your mind at ease: This document bag was designed by professional firefighters, who purportedly put the bag through a house fire simulation where it was exposed to direct flames, radiant heat and water to ensure its durability through fire and water. The outside of the bag is covered with high-visibility reflective tape to help ensure that you'll be able to easily find it with a flashlight in a nighttime emergency. It comes with a top handle or a crossbody shoulder strap for hands-free carrying. (Note: It does not have a lock.)Its large internal pocket is made with the same material as the fireproof, water-resistant outer layer, giving your documents and important items double the protection. The bag comes with a Velcro-detachable wallet that's also outfitted with the same reflective tape design to help with visibility; you can either keep it attached to the front for easy access, or store it inside the inner pocket for extra security.This fireproof document bag is 17 by 12 by 5 inches.Promising reviews: \"I purchased this document bag to hold all those life documents you can’t lose. I like it because it is just one big bag. No little compartments or organizing features. So it holds a large binder as well as many envelopes. I hope I never have to find out if it is really waterproof and fireproof! But for now, I feel like all my important documents are together in one place. The bag is very sturdy — I can pick it up by the handle and the Velcro closure does not loosen. Highly recommend.\" — Sue Z. Stein\"This was a gift for a grandson just setting out in life and needing a safe place to keep all the important documents in one spot. Well made, and well organized!\" — Anne Wingo This fireproof and water-resistant option features a reflective strip for nighttime visibility and a customizable combination lock for added security. It's spacious, with a number of organization features including eight mesh pockets, five file pockets and 10 card slots, plus a main compartment and areas for discs and money.In addition to a top handle and shoulder strap, the bag has a strap on its back that you can attach to the handle of rolling luggage for convenient travel.This is also available in a version without a reflective strip.Promising review: \"I like the product. I've put all my important papers in this bag, and I will use it if and when I may have to evacuate during hurricanes. Having one place and one bag to get; when it may be short notice time to evacuate. I've even put a small first aid kit. It seems to be made well. Glad I made this purchase.\" — Melissa Krueger This medium-sized document bag is designed to withstand temperatures up to 2,000 degrees thanks to its double-layered, silicone-coated fiberglass. (The silicone coating also promises to make this item waterproof.)It's designed with seven built-in file folders, four mesh bags for storing passports or money, 16 card slots, four pockets for discs, and a larger main pocket for binders and larger document stacks. The bag has a built-in lock that you can set with a customized combination, and has a wide handle so you can easily travel with it.It's 14.17 by 10.63 by 3.93 inches, and is available in two colors.Promising review: \"I am loving my new safe storage for important documents, I have a place to keep passports, wedding license, car titles, mortgages and wedding photos and if disaster happens I can have my mind at ease in this case, love that it has a Fireproof zipper, code lock design and strong handle add storage security and carrying safety. More wider strap handle design on the back allows you to insert a suitcase handle. I like I have a choice I can you put it in my home, office, car, safe box, or any cabinet, and take it anywhere i go.\" — Jenn A By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "House Republicans Eye Big Cuts To Medicaid And Food Assistance",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — House Republicans on Wednesday unveiled a broad outline of their plans for the federal budget, using cuts to social programs to help pay for trillions of dollars in tax cuts. The budget outline indicates Republicans are planning $4.5 trillion in tax cuts over ten years. Spending cuts would offset part of that cost, but only part, so that meeting the blueprint’s goals would add trillions of dollars to the country’s deficit. The document doesn’t specify exactly what programs to cut. But analysts say the clear implication is that Republicans are looking for deep reductions in programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, both of which serve low-income Americans, given the GOP ruling out cuts to Medicare or Social Security. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Tuesday said Republicans could save “a huge amount of money” by rooting out fraud in those programs. He also said that a major goal was to goad more Americans into the workforce by cutting benefits to the unemployed. “Work is good for you. You find dignity in work. And the people that are not doing that, we’re going to try to get their attention,” Johnson said at a press conference Tuesday. “So everyone needs to take a deep sigh of relief and understand that we’re not going to harm any Americans with this. What we’re doing is the right thing by the people.” But the cuts the new budget document envisions would likely require savings well beyond what adding work requirements or eliminating fraud would generate. At the same time, the GOP budget document envisions a much higher budget deficit, because the proposed spending reductions wouldn’t come close to offsetting the tax cuts. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), the top Democrat on the budget committee, said their proposal “slashes critical programs that millions of hardworking Americans rely on, all while adding trillions of dollars to the deficit to bankroll massive giveaways for giant corporations and billionaires like Elon Musk.” Republicans have openly acknowledged that despite their furious opposition to big budget deficits, they themselves are making no effort to fully offset the cost of their tax cuts. Instead, they have said their proposed changes would boost the economy so much that tax receipts from increased business activity will make up the difference. “When we spend under reconciliation, we don’t have to offset it,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, told reporters on Wednesday of the GOP’s plan. One respected budget expert has said Republicans are using “fantasy math.” The new House budget blueprint is in the form of a resolution that Republicans plan to mark up this week, kicking off the start of a lengthy congressional process for setting spending priorities. Eventually the entire House will have to vote on a resolution, and then negotiate with the Senate over whatever that chamber produces. Senate Republicans are pushing forward with their own slimmer budget plan that would first enact border security, defense and energy policy, and tackle tax cuts later on. The party is still not on the same page about which path to take, and Trump hasn’t indicated which strategy he’d prefer, either. Finding consensus won’t be easy, especially in the House, where Republicans can lose only one Republican vote and still pass legislation without Democratic support. There’s also a sharp disagreement between House Republicans who want to cut even more deeply, and those who worry the cuts in the document already go too far. It’s not clear where those cuts are supposed to be, because the budget document simply has instructions for various committees to find enough savings to hit fixed targets. But there are some clues. The document instructs the House Energy and Commerce committee to find $880 billion in ten-year savings. Analysts and liberal advocates told HuffPost that is a huge tell, because Energy and Commerce has jurisdiction over Medicaid, the federal-state program that pays medical bills for more than 70 million low-income Americans. And Medicaid has been in the Republican crosshairs for decades. Republicans have talked openly about trying to cut Medicaid by introducing “work requirements,” under which Medicaid beneficiaries would have to demonstrate they are employed or are seeking employment, or had a valid reason not to do so. In reality, the majority of Medicaid beneficiaries already work, or cannot because they’re disabled or are caring for another person, among other reasons. Past attempts to attach work requirements to Medicaid ended up reducing Medicaid rolls substantially, producing the sorts of savings that Republicans would like to see. But studies have later found that work requirements frequently took coverage away from people who qualified for coverage and simply couldn’t make their way through the reporting requirements. Still, the magnitude of those savings means that Republicans might try to do more than impose work requirements. Republicans could for example try to introduce a “per capita cap” or some other mechanism that would limit federal spending on the program going forward, effectively ending the open-ended funding commitment Washington now makes to the states. Republicans could also roll back several reforms designed to make enrollment simpler, especially for children. “Cuts of the magnitude required of the Energy and Commerce Committee leave little doubt that the Budget Resolution sets the stage for deep cuts to Medicaid,” Allison Orris, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told HuffPost. “This is not a budget that protects Medicaid enrollees.” Another possibility would be to scale back or eliminate federal funding for the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid, or find some other way of cutting from the health insurance program known as Obamacare, which Republicans tried to repeal outright during Trump’s first term. “While there’s not going to be an ACA repeal debate, or it at least won’t be called that, these federal health spending reductions could approach or even exceed what Republicans attempted in the 2017 repeal effort, Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the health care research organization KFF, told HuffPost. Any of these options could lead to substantially less federal spending – and substantially fewer people with health insurance.

    "title": "7 Things You Should Know Before Going Out To Eat Hot Pot",
    "text": "If you haven’t yet shared the joys of a convivial hot pot meal, then you’ve got something to look forward to — unless you have no idea what you’re doing. But we’re here to fix that. It’s always more fun to share this food with a crowd, so gather a bunch of friends and experience the laughs, fun and delicious surprises that can happen around that steaming pot of broth. The process might seem intimidating to the uninitiated, but your waitstaff will be used to guiding first-timers. If you’d like to brush up on process and etiquette before your meal, we talked to hot pot aficionados nationwide for a Hot Pot 101 crash course. The answer to the question is pretty simple since it’s right there in the name. You’re given a pot of steaming liquid, and you can cook your food directly in the pot, right there at the table. Chef Kenneth Wan owns Denver’s MAKfam restaurant, which was recently included in the Michelin Guide for Bib Gourmand. He described it this way: “I like to think of hot pot as a Chinese version of fondue. It’s a popular dining experience across many Asian countries, from Japanese shabu-shabu to Korean and Vietnamese hot pot that all have their own regional flavors and styles.” Chef Justin Lee of New Jersey’s Fat Choy restaurant agreed with Wan’s fondue comparison, but added, “It has a lot more action and is more raucous than any fondue I’ve had, though. It’s a party in a pot.” “Party” is a key word for this type of dining, Wan said. “Honestly, I’ve never met anyone who didn’t love hot pot. It’s social, interactive and delicious, which is a perfect recipe for fun.” Hot pot is a form of dining that’s been more than 2,000 years in the making, according to Tony Kwan, a food columnist for the Richmond News. “The first forms of hot pot dining appeared in the Shang and Zhou dynasties, approximately 1600 to 256 B.C.,” he said. “Using copper pots for hot pot started during the Three Kingdoms period, 220 to 280 A.D.” Jay Li, executive vice president of KPOT Korean Barbeque and Hot Pot, also noted that hot pot as an experience is deeply rooted in Asian culinary traditions. Like Kwan, he pointed to a Chinese dynastic origin. “There are even some stories of Mongolian soldiers using their bronze helmets as the first-ever hot pots,” he said. Li has his own theories about why this way of eating has endured: “It’s a beloved tradition due to the communal dining experience where friends and family gather around a simmering pot of broth, cooking and sharing a variety of meats, seafood, vegetables and noodles.” Wan explained the basics: “Depending on the restaurant, you’ll either have an individual induction burner and pot of broth in front of you, or you’ll share one or two induction burners with a pot divided into sections. “The next step is choosing your broth base. Many hot pot restaurants are all-you-can-eat, where you order meat and premium seafood from your server, while a buffet of raw vegetables, noodles, tofu, fish balls and other ingredients is available for you to grab and cook at your table.” Personalization, variety and togetherness are some of the reasons that people love to eat like this. Joanne Liu is the founder of Denver’s Mile High Asian Food Week. “What I love most about hot pot are the variety of delicious ingredients and the social aspect of the experience,” Liu said. “First, there are so many ingredients to choose from — thinly sliced meats, seafood, vegetables, noodles, dumplings and more. Everyone gets to mix their own dipping sauces, so it’s fun to know what unique flavor combinations people create. It’s an interactive experience where you get to cook your own food right at the table. Finally, it’s a meal that brings people together.” “I won my wife’s heart with some steaming hot pot magic. ... Turns out, she wasn’t thinking much about me at the time — she was just psyched to eat hot pot. But hey, hot pot did its magic, and now it’s a staple of our life together.” The flavor of your meal can be perfectly suited to your own spice preference. “I think a common misconception is that because ingredients are boiled, the food is bland,” Kwan said. “In fact, the food is very flavorful, as you can select from a wide variety of different broth bases, from very light to very spicy. The final broth that you can enjoy, after cooking all the ingredients in it, can also be a rich and complex blend of the various ingredients you’ve cooked in the broth. In addition, the mixture of ingredients and the multitude of sauces gives you much more variety than a traditional dining experience.” All that togetherness makes hot pot the ultimate romantic meal, some say. Wan has his own real-life hot pot romance story: “I won my wife’s heart with some steaming hot pot magic,” he said. “We first crossed paths during happy hour, and I was immediately smitten. In our brief chat, I discovered a crucial detail: She was obsessed with hot pot. A few weeks later, my birthday rolled around, and I hatched a plan to have a friend invite her to my hot pot birthday party, and I crossed my fingers that she’d show up. She did, and sparks flew — or maybe it was just the bubbling broth — but we clicked instantly.” “Turns out, she wasn’t thinking much about me at the time — she was just psyched to eat hot pot. But hey, hot pot did its magic, and now it’s a staple of our life together. To this day, we love recreating those cozy, flavor-packed dinners at home.” Everyone has an opinion about how to do hot pot, so of course these experts had good advice to make your experience even more delicious. “As long as you mind your manners, there’s really no wrong way to enjoy it,” Kwan said. “Just put the food in, take it out when it’s cooked to your taste, and enjoy.” Order enough, not too much: “Don’t order more than you can eat,” Wan said. “Hot pot is usually all-you-can-eat, but it’s not a free-for-all, so only take what you can finish. Most places will charge you for uneaten items, and nobody wants to be that person.” Keep sauces tidy: “Try not to create a mess at the sauce bar, and don’t spill any sauce onto other sauces,” suggested Luti Salem, co-owner at Arlington, Virginia’s Mala Tang restaurant. Watch those chopsticks: “If you’re sharing a pot, don’t dip your chopsticks in the broth,” Wan said. “It’s not just a hygiene thing, it’s also about being considerate. Use the communal tongs and scoops provided to grab your food from the pot. It keeps the experience clean and enjoyable for everyone.” Patience, please: “If a pot is already filled to the brim with ingredients, it’s best to avoid adding anything else for a few minutes,” Li said. “And it’s important to wait until the broth is heated to the correct temperature before adding your ingredients to cook.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Safety first: “Be careful how you place hot pot items into the boiling water,” Liu said. “There have been times when my kids just dropped in fish or beef balls, and it splattered everywhere. Use hot pot utensils to gently place them in the broth.” Pot hoggers beware: “Make sure to retrieve all of your ingredients from the pot,” Li said. “If you put a dumpling in to cook for a few minutes, make sure you go back for it when it’s ready and don’t leave it floating around the pot.” Noodles last: “I do have a particular order of what I eat while doing hot pot,” Liu said. “I will eat veggies, seafood and meats first, and leave any noodles at the end of my meal. I do this for two reasons: the noodles will soak up all the broth at the end of the meal, and I can fill up on all the other delicious foods without getting full from the noodles.” Another reason for this “noodles last” approach comes from Salem, who said, “Make sure to eat everything else before you start cooking your noodles to make sure they won’t get stuck on the bottom and burn the pot.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "How To Be A Carry-On-Only Traveler — Even For A Long Trip",
    "text": "Traveling is stressful enough without having to worry about lost bags. Hopping on a plane can also be expensive — with the skyrocketing costs of airplane tickets, many travelers are reluctant to fork over their hard-earned cash to check a bigger bag. As a result, more travelers are traveling with a carry-on only. With the right gear and some strategic choices, it’s possible to travel carry-on-only for longer trips, even if passing through places with vastly different climates. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. To avoid overpacking, focus on clothing that travels well and is versatile enough to wear multiple times throughout your trip. Choosing items that coordinate and layer well will help you make the most of your carry-on-only wardrobe. Stick with one color palette, such as black and gray, or neutrals like beige and brown. If that sounds too boring, choose accessories in one accent color that goes with everything. Select clothing that resists odors and wrinkles to extend the time between washings. Merino wool clothing is an investment but ticks all the boxes for travel all year long thanks to its temperature-regulating properties. Shoes take up a ton of space in luggage. To free up space, try to limit yourself to one pair of shoes and wear them on the plane. Selecting a pair of shoes that is ultra-comfortable and goes with everything is key. If you really need to pack more than one pair of shoes, wear your biggest, bulkiest pair on the plane and pack smaller items like socks and undies inside the shoes you put in your suitcase.

    "title": "Hunter Schafer Says She Was Issued A Passport With A Male Sex Marker, Thanks To Trump Order",
    "text": "Hunter Schafer had “a bit of a harsh reality check” thanks to an upcoming trip. The “Euphoria” star — who is one of the most prominent transgender women in Hollywood — posted a TikTok story on Friday in which she says her new passport was issued with an ‘M,’ or male, legal sex marker, even though she listed her legal sex as female on her application. In a roughly eight-minute video, which was also uploaded and shared in full to X, formerly Twitter, the “Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes” star, 26, noted that her gender has been listed female on all her government-issued IDs since she applied for a driver’s license as a teenager. She later noted that she never had her gender changed on her birth certificate, however. The switch in Schafer’s gender marker is likely a result of President Donald Trump’s executive order declaring the government will now only recognize “two sexes, male and female.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NOTUS in January that the order will not impact passports that were issued prior to Trump taking office. But she also said that any passports issued after Trump signed the order, including those being renewed, will show the marker that reflects a person’s sex assigned at birth. Schafer said that she recently had to renew her passport because it was stolen while she was working in Barcelona, Spain last year. Schafer said that since it was stolen she was issued a temporary passport, which had a female marker, but it expired. Schafer said she had to renew her actual passport because she’s traveling abroad next week. “I’m sure most of us remember on, I think, the first day of Trump’s presidency, he signed an executive order to declare only two genders recognized by the state, male and female assigned at birth,” Schafer said in the video. She appeared to quote a page from Advocates for Trans Equality advising transgender travelers: “The Bureau of Consular Affairs has frozen passport applications requesting a gender marker change or renewals or new applications with a gender marker differing from an applicant’s gender assigned at birth.” A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on individual passport applications and referred HuffPost to Trump’s executive order. The “Kinds of Kindness” actor said that she decided to speak out about her experience because she wanted to make others aware of “the reality of the situation, in that it is actually happening,” and not because she wants to “create drama or receive consolation.” “I was shocked, because, I don’t know, I just didn’t think it was actually going to happen,” she said. Schafer went on to admit some of the reasons why she initially thought this new policy wouldn’t directly affect her. “I want to acknowledge my privilege, like not only as a celebrity trans woman who is white, and thin, and can adhere to contemporary beauty standards, and I can participate in all of that, and I ‘pass.’ And it still happened,” Schafer said. Schafer went on to say that she personally doesn’t “give a fuck that they put a ‘M’ on my passport.” “It doesn’t change really anything about me or my transness. However, it does make life a little harder,” Schafer said. She continued, “It’s going to come along with having to out myself to, like, border patrol agents and that whole gig, much more often than I would like to or is really necessary.” Schafer also acknowledged that even though she’s making assumptions about what her personal experience may be like, other trans people may have similar or even more extreme issues while traveling internationally. “Thinking about other trans women who this might also be happening to, or other trans people,” Schafer said, “the list only gets longer, as far as the intricacies that come along with the difficulty that this brings into real life shit.” Schafer attempted to conclude her video on a slightly more positive note — though she got in one last jab at Trump.

    "title": "Some iPhone Users Are Reporting A Major Issue With Their Alarm. Here's What's Happening.",
    "text": "If you rely on your iPhone as an alarm clock, you are hardly alone ― but you should be aware of a potential issue that could lead to oversleeping, missed appointments or tardiness. Over the past month, several iPhone users on TikTok have shared their experience with an apparent bug that impacts the device’s alarm function, with a few of the videos going viral on the platform. Basically, some are claiming that their alarms are either failing to activate or are going off with no sound. “I’ve been using the iPhone alarm for 10 years ― never had an issue. Well, two days ago I woke up an hour and a half late for work to a phone call from my boss saying, ‘Hey, you coming in today?’” TikTok user @brunson_state shared on the app. “If your alarms have not been going off and you have an iPhone and you think you have been sleeping through them, you are not in the wrong,” said Alexie Armour, another user, who added that the alarm problem caused her to miss her airport transportation and subsequently have to pay $500 to park her car at the airport. The comments section for both videos is filled with responses from people who’ve had similar experiences and thought their brains were malfunctioning; “I THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY” is a common comment. Both TikTok users believe they’ve identified the source of the issue: a feature called “Attention Aware,” which was first introduced in 2023 with the release of iOS 17. The feature utilizes the iPhone’s TrueDepth camera to determine whether or not a user is actively paying attention to their device and then automatically adjusts certain settings and behaviors accordingly. So if you’re looking at your phone, the display brightness won’t dim, and the volume of the sound for your alerts lowers. But, as some have pointed out, the feature may mistakenly register someone as awake and looking at their phone when they are actually asleep ― thus leading to the silent alarms. “It’s basically like AI, and it naturally detects if it should put the alarm off or not, or it will dim the sound of it,” Armour said in her TikTok video. “Why would you put a feature that turns off alarms on its own?” The alarm problem first surfaced in April 2024 when users started sharing their experiences on social media. At the time, NBC News correspondent Emilie Ikeda and Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern both confirmed that Apple was aware of the issue and working on a solution. Still, it seems the problem has persisted for some people in subsequent iOS versions; it’s unclear if it’s the same issue from last year or a different one leading to the same problem. (Apple did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for an update.) Fortunately, users have shared helpful workarounds. The main one is to disable the “Attention Aware Features” function on your iPhone. To turn it off on your device: 1. Open “Settings” 2. Go to “Accessibility” 3. Tap “Face ID & Attention” 4. Toggle off “Attention Aware Features” You can also find this feature under “Voice Control” in “Accessibility.” Additionally, you’ll want to check on your alarm volume and potentially adjust the slider for “Ringtone and Alerts” under “Sound & Haptics” in your settings. Toggle off the “Change with Buttons” option below that if you don’t want to accidentally lower alarm volume over the course of your regular iPhone use. Setting multiple alarms on different devices or apps can lower your odds of oversleeping if your regular iPhone alarm fails. This is particularly helpful for important wake-ups like early morning flights or can’t-miss meetings. And of course, if you want to really safeguard yourself against technical shenanigans, consider investing in a real, old-fashioned physical alarm clock.

    "title": "Ira Madison III's New Book Is A Love Letter To Pop Culture And His Grandmother",
    "text": "Long before Ira Madison III shared his witty musings on his hit weekly podcast “ Keep It,” his grandma nurtured his love of all things entertainment. Whether it was through their shared affection for Angelina Jolie, “The Young and the Restless,” or eventually “Pose” (“I was home for the holidays and I discovered that she was really into “Pose” and I had never actually even told her to watch it,” Madison says), she helped his penchant for pop culture develop early. And while the audience thirsting for his hilarious commentary has grown, he’s still the same old Ira with the same saucy takes. In “Pure Innocent Fun,” Madison’s newly minted essay collection, the 38-year-old TV writer and cultural critic uses his signature wit to examine his childhood as a Black closeted gay boy in the Midwest. Through the lens of pop culture, he shares what it was like growing up fat (while watching Oprah’s obsessive yo-yo dieting), how the characters of “The OC” reminded him of the white boys from his Catholic high school, and how Steve Urkel and Carl Winslow’s relationship helped him process his own relationship with his absent father. His grandmother’s influence reigns supreme in Madison’s life and throughout the book; she is, in fact, the reason he decided to write “Pure Innocent Fun.” Madison told HuffPost more about his grandmother’s influence, where his love for Whoopi Goldberg comes from, and how he felt about Carrie Underwood’s recent inauguration performance. An entire chapter of your book is dedicated to your love of Whoopi Goldberg. There’s a generation that primarily knows her for her bad takes on “The View,” so can you talk a bit about the impact her acting career has had on you? I dedicated the book to my grandmother, and I think a lot of my cultural touch points begin with her. It begins with what was in the living room when I was a kid, what VHSs were on display, which ones you’d pick and watch. And she loved Whoopi Goldberg. “Ghost” was a movie that my family rewatched all the time when there’d be holiday gatherings. I feel like “Ghost” was a movie that was either always on TV or someone was watching it, but I remember seeing that so many times. “Eddie” and “The Associate,” those were two big ones, too. So I associate her with that. And, you know — the takes. I was never really like a full, avid “The View” viewer, and so I would hear about the takes and I’d be like, “OK, Whoopi,” and move on. So I still have nice memories of the movies. You write about coming out to high school friends in the book but didn’t write about coming out to your family — so how was that? For me, largely, the “coming out” was coming out to myself, coming out to friends, you know, immediate people in my life. It took me a while to even really be comfortable with that. With my family, it was never more of a direct “I’m gay” conversation, you know? It was more like through my writing and through just living as a gay man in Chicago and then New York, that it really started to come out. I specifically remember I did a play at NYU that my family all came to see and watch and it was pretty obvious, but it was sort of like an unspoken thing with my family. But I never really sat and had one of those made-for-TV conversations about coming out with my family. In writing about your own self-image and self-perception, you say that you experienced the specific pressures of attending school with “white boys who were very much the all-American.” Has writing this book helped you heal that? I think so. I’ve never been a person who sort of even read my writing out loud. I had to do it in grad school, obviously in, like, class workshops. I’m not a person who would like to even be in the room when it’s being read or something. I’ve finally gotten used to reading a lot of my work out loud and being comfortable with stories I’ve been sharing and myself. And I actually think that one of the biggest things that helped me do it was recording the audiobook. You wrote a lot in the book about your love of theater and wanting to perform — and you have a great stage presence. Is that something that you’re still looking to fulfill? Yes and no. I enjoy being on stage from time to time, but I don’t think that in any, you know, serious manner I see myself really trying to pursue acting. You did make a brief and rather authentic cameo in Netflix’s “You.” Were you a writer on it? No, what happened was I had sold a television show like a year prior to Greg Berlanti, who was a producer on [my show]. And I remember specifically talking about how much I loved “You” and I met like the producer [of “You”], Sarah Gamble, and they actually made the cameo for me just because I was a fan of the show. You write a whole chapter about “American Idol” in the book. What are your thoughts on Carrie Underwood’s recent inauguration performance? Well, I mean, listen, Jesus took the notes, didn’t he? I think that whatever you have to say about Miss Carrie Underwood and her performance, somebody was looking out. A higher power was looking out for that performance because it was a mess. So the karma came back swiftly. Another one: Do you want to do a spirit tunnel at Jennifer Hudson’s show? And I love Miss Jennifer Hudson.

    "title": "IRS Will Lay Off Thousands Of Probationary Workers In The Middle Of Tax Season",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The IRS will lay off thousands of probationary workers in the middle of tax season, according to two sources familiar with the agency’s plans, and cuts could happen as soon as next week. This comes as the Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection. It’s unclear how many IRS workers will be affected. Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to almost all federal employees through a “deferred resignation program” to quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30. However, IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season were told they will not be allowed to accept a buyout offer from the Trump administration until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees. It is unclear how many workers will be impacted by the layoff announcement plan. Representatives from the U.S. Treasury and IRS did not respond to Associated Press requests for comment. Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency.

Republicans have been successful at clawing back that money, and billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have called for the U.S. to “delete entire agencies” from the federal government as part of his to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities. Elected officials are trying to fight against DOGE plans. Attorneys general from 14 states challenged the authority of to access sensitive government data and exercise “virtually unchecked power” in a lawsuit filed Thursday. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, says the actions taken by Musk at the helm of DOGE can only be taken by a nominated and Senate-confirmed official. It cites constitutional provisions that delineate the powers of Congress and the president.

And so, you grab the nearest thing to hand to try and zsush up your outfit a bit. In Jaden Smith’s case, that appeared to be a massive model of a spooky haunted house. On Sunday evening, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith’s son was one of the first stars to hit the red carpet at the Grammys, where he was seen sporting a smart, albeit rather plain, black suit. So, to give his look a bit of drama, the musician and “Karate Kid” actor was seen sporting a headpiece in the shape of a haunted house as he made his way into the event. Well, at least he probably doesn’t need to worry about anyone wearing the same thing as him on the red carpet.

    "text": "Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville predicted Monday that Democrats will receive a boost in direct response to Elon Musk’s gutting of government through the nonofficial Department of Government Efficiency. Billionaire Musk will “be the greatest generator, let me say this very specifically, the greatest generator of Democratic turnout ever, more than Barack Obama,” Carville told NewsNation’s Chris Cuomo. “Musk will turn out more Democrats than Obama could, and I understand the gravity of that statement, but if he keeps going, that’s what’s going to happen,” he added. Cuomo asked why. Carville replied: “Well, I was privy to some data that in a very critical state, and the Musk stuff is like nothing I’ve ever seen in the history of polling. Like, nothing. And we’re a month into the game.” Carville didn’t expand on the data. But recent polls have indicated that Americans are souring on the world’s richest man over his attempts to slash government spending and jobs. Earlier, Carville doubled down on his call for Democrats to hold tight and “play possum” to allow the effect of the Trump-implemented chaos to fully take hold among the electorate.

    "title": "'I Did The Math, Sean': James Carville Hits Hannity With Searing Fact Check On Live TV",
    "text": "James Carville took to Fox News on Thursday where he pushed back against host Sean Hannity in a debate on cost-cutting efforts under President Donald Trump. Hannity, in a live interview with the longtime Democratic strategist, declared that he was scrolling through “all the waste, fraud and abuse” in the federal government as an on-screen graphic touted “accomplishments” by the Trump administration’s nonofficial Department of Government Efficiency. Carville then swerved away from the host’s question to call out a separate graphic on “questionable spending” at the U.S. Agency for International Development, which has a budget of about $40 billion compared to the $6.8 trillion federal budget. “I did the math, Sean, it actually comes to something like 0.014%,” Carville said. He continued, “So take the $41 billion, put it against the $6 trillion and see what you’ve done when your president is responsible for more federal debt than any president in the history of the United States.” The national debt — under Trump’s first term in office — grew by $7.8 trillion, the largest four-year increase in history, The Washington Post found last year. Carville: USAID spent $41 billion the federal budget is 6 trillion. Actually comes to something like .014%. So take that and put it against the 6 trillion and see what you have done when your president is responsible for more federal debt than any president in the history of the United States. Earlier in the interview, Hannity declared that the Democratic Party is for “tens of billions spent abroad for a Green New Deal, DEI woke agenda and transgenderism” as he asked Carville what happened since President Bill Clinton balanced the budget during his White House stint. “Well, we got to get that $100 million for condoms for Hamas,” said Carville, who mocked the president’s debunked claim. Hannity, toward the end of the interview, claimed that Trump made America “energy independent” for the first time in 75 years, adding that Democrats have been “fighting against that” with electric vehicle mandates. “I think you need a new playbook, I really do,” Hannity said. “I’m not too worried about the high school track meet,” replied Carville, referring to Hannity’s earlier remarks on transgender athletes in sports.

    "title": "My J6 Neighbor Was Released From Prison By Trump. I'm Furious About What Happened The Day He Got Home.",
    "text": "Last week my next-door neighbor was pardoned for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. When his sister called my home to announce his imminent return, I was shocked at my husband’s enthusiasm to welcome him home. “We’d love to have him over for dinner to celebrate his homecoming,” he said. I glared at him with my mouth agape. How did he expect me to share a table with a Proud Boy? When I asked my husband why he instantly invited him over, he replied, “He’s our neighbor, and we should be neighborly.” It’s as if my husband wants bygones to be bygones. I wonder if he’s thinking that what’s done is done and there’s nothing we can do about it, so we might as well be nice and move forward. “You understand I won’t be there, right?” I told my husband. “Do we really have to discuss this now?” he asked, not taking my concerns seriously after working a double shift. I’ve been emotionally distraught since our neighbor was released from prison along with all the other Jan. 6 rioters Trump pardoned. My husband and I have both avoided watching or reading or listening to the news since the election, thereby sheltering ourselves from reality. I was doing well keeping my anxiety at bay until Friday when we learned about our neighbor’s release. My husband’s invitation, in my opinion, gives the impression we aren’t outraged over our neighbor’s illegal actions. It’s as if we’re welcoming him home from a six-month vacation instead of incarceration for a violent crime. Before his imprisonment, our neighbor didn’t hide the fact that he was a Proud Boy, and our whole neighborhood witnessed the FBI surrounding his property, red lights whirling and speakers blaring, “Come out with your hands up,” when he was arrested for his participation in the events of Jan. 6. Despite our political differences, he has always been friendly, protective of our property when we’re out of town, and willing to go out of his way to help us with projects or when we needed a helping hand. In return, while he was imprisoned, my husband cut his grass and watched over his house during the recent hurricanes. His first morning home, our neighbor returned the hummingbird feeder that had landed behind his house during Hurricane Helene or Milton. Our dogs wagged their tails as he reached over the fence to pet them. My mom, who lives with us, walked over to say hello. I refused to join them. From the table under the lanai drinking coffee in my pajamas, I could hear him regale my mom with the story of his release from prison. “After Trump pardoned us, the D.C. mayor wasn’t planning to let me out,” he said, explaining his Proud Boy mates were waiting outside the federal penitentiary and threatening to call in their members and start a mini J6 if he wasn’t released. Their motto is to “leave no man behind,” he exclaimed. “Trump was circling above in a helicopter watching the scene of Proud Boys chanting, ‘Let him free,’” our neighbor explained to my mom. I listened, fuming, as he complained about the 4XL clothes the prison guards dressed him in, and which made him look like a “homeless person.” He said he was eventually let out the back door instead of into the fanfare of his gathered friends. Our neighbor said he was unfamiliar with the area, so he wandered over to a restaurant where he saw people wearing MAGA hats. Feeling safe, he asked if he could use someone’s phone. When he explained he had just been pardoned for the Jan. 6 riot, the patrons of this restaurant shook his hand and offered to buy him a meal. At that point in the story, I couldn’t stand listening to anymore of his bolstering and walked into our house. I was raised Catholic, so being nice, kind and generous were family traits that were instilled in me from a young age. Every Thanksgiving, New Year’s Eve or any other holiday, my mom would always invite an acquaintance or even a stranger to our house because they had nowhere else to go. The virtues of “do unto others as you’d like to be treated,” and “treat your neighbor as yourself” have been drilled into my head, along with the Thumper rule: “If you can’t say something nice, don’t say nothing at all.” But I’m not ready to forgive and welcome my neighbor back with open arms. I don’t know if I will ever be. Still, I’m a strong believer in forgiveness. I know it releases the burden of anger and resentment on myself and can lead to improved mental and physical health. On the other hand, I don’t think the images of a mob violently attacking our Capitol, assaulting police officers and attempting to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election will never go away. For me, it’s just like the 9/11 terrorist attack — the memories are still there, even decades later. Every time I see an airplane fly too low or near a building, I cringe, afraid it’ll strike. And now, every time I see my neighbor, fury for those who tried to overthrow our government burns in my stomach. I commend my husband for being able to separate my neighbor’s actions from the nice guy he is around our home. Part of me wishes I could do the same to unburden myself of this anxiety. But the idea of breaking bread with my neighbor after he took part in an effort to overthrow our government stresses me out even more. Far from my neighbor feeling remorse for his actions, he is victorious. I wouldn’t be able to swallow his nonsense, let alone food.

    "title": "'Harry Potter' Actor Reveals Why Filming Series Wasn't A Magical Experience",
    "text": "The Chamber of Secrets may not be the only place where truths are hidden within the hallowed halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Jason Isaacs, the actor renowned for playing the scheming Lucius Malfoy in the “Harry Potter” film series, recently shared a behind-the-scenes secret he’s been holding on to. While appearing on a Feb. 21 episode of the BBC program “The One Show,” Isaacs got candid about his experience. “It’s a terrible confession to make: they weren’t that much fun to make,” he admitted, according to Entertainment Weekly. “It’s quite boring making big special effects films; however, the pleasures all come afterward.” Still, the actor said that a special kind of magic still came over him when he viewed the films with his family. “Even though I was in the films, when I’ve taken godchildren or nephews and nieces to the [studio tour] and the thing comes up and suddenly you’re in the Great Hall,” the actor said, “every time, I burst out in tears. It’s incredibly moving and overwhelming. There’s some magic that happened in those stories.” HBO’s announcement that “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling will play a part in the upcoming TV adaptation of the series caused controversy due to Rowling’s vocal anti-transgender views. In November, the network told Variety and The Wrap that it has “been working with J.K. Rowling” and involved in the “Harry Potter business for more than 20 years.” “With millions of fans continuing to enjoy movies, games and experiences, we’ve had great success and her contribution has been invaluable,” the statement read.

    "title": "‘Very, Very Bad’: Ex-Government Economist Makes Bleakest Trump Prediction",
    "text": "It “seems almost unavoidable at this point” that the United States is “headed for a deep, deep recession” thanks to the Trump administration’s massive government job cuts and pullback from official contracts, a former Obama-era Department of Labor economist has warned. Jesse Rothstein, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of California, Berkeley, predicted on BlueSky this week that the employment report for March 2025 will show “bigger job losses than any month ever outside of a few in 2008-9 and 2020.” (I.e. — when America was hit by the 2008 financial crash and then, later, by the coronavirus pandemic). It seems almost unavoidable at this point that we are headed for a deep, deep recession. Just based on 200K+ federal firings & pullback of contracts, the March employment report (to be released April 4) seems certain to show bigger job losses than any month ever outside of a few in 2008-9 and 2020. Rothstein also envisioned “enormous private market uncertainty” that would make companies reluctant to hire. It’s “going to be very, very bad,” he said he feared. President Donald Trump has tasked billionaire Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, with slashing public spending via the non-official Department of Government Efficiency. The current total number of federal jobs cut is unclear. But Rothstein estimated it to be more than 200,000. The gutting of government is just one Trump policy that economists have warned could plunge America into a new financial crisis. Others include Trump’s imposition of tariffs on imports and his vow to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Jessica Lange Has Hilariously Blunt Response When Asked About  'American Horror Story'",
    "text": "Jessica Lange might have enjoyed a professional renaissance after starring on “American Horror Story,” but fans shouldn’t expect to see the two-time Oscar winner reappear on the horror anthology franchise anytime soon. Appearing at the Dublin International Film Festival Thursday, Lange had a jarringly blunt response when asked about returning to “American Horror Story” for its upcoming 13th season. “Oh, Christ, no,” the actor said. “I mean, I haven’t done it for more than 10 years, 12 years. So no, I’m not doing it.” When the journalist asked Lange if she’d reconsider her decision if the “American Horror Story” creative team invited her back, she doubled down on her answer. “No,” she quipped, before walking away. “Oh Christ no!”💀SPIN caught up with #JessicaLange at the Dublin International Film premiere of her latest ‘Long Day's Journey Into Night’, and got her reaction to rejoining the cast of #AmericanHorrorStory 🍿For the full story see https://t.co/VMbqZge7CX#dublin #irish pic.twitter.com/FTftAgl9R4 Lange’s comments come after “American Horror Story” co-creator Ryan Murphy hinted at his plans to invite much of the series’ “original, gangster cast” back for Season 13, which has been rumored to be its last. “I did have a wonderful conversation with Sarah Paulson the other day, and she was like, ‘Okay, I think it’s time we get the band back together, so let’s make some calls here,’” he told Variety in October, adding: “I love that show. I’ll never give up on that show.” Lange won critical praise ― and an Emmy ― for her portrayal of Constance Langdon on the premiere season of “American Horror Story,” later subtitled “Murder House,” which aired in 2011. The actor picked up a second Emmy for the show’s third season, “Coven,” but left as a principal cast member following the fourth season, “Freak Show,” in 2014. She briefly reappeared as Constance on Season 8, “Apocalypse.” Despite her apparent lack of interest in more “AHS,” Lange continues to enjoy a professional relationship with Murphy, having appeared in his series “Feud: Bette and Joan” in 2017 and “The Politician” in 2019.

    "text": "Jimmy Kimmel said President Donald Trump likes to “pretend” he’s a Christian to keep his evangelical supporters happy by going to events such as this week’s National Prayer Breakfast. “It’s like when you’re a kid and your mom made you go to church ’cause grandma was in town,” Kimmel said Thursday night on “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” “You have to act like you go every week.” Trump said ”we have to bring religion back” at the bipartisan event. But Kimmel has some doubts about the president’s sincerity. “Who better to bring it back than the guy who sells ‘God Bless The USA’ Bibles for $59.99,” Kimmel snarked. “Of all the unbelievable things about Donald Trump, religious people believing he is also a religious person might be the toughest one to understand.” The late-night host made a prediction on what would happen if Trump ever met Jesus. “He’d call him a loser and he’d tell him to get a haircut and put a shirt on,” Kimmel said.

    "title": "Jon Stewart Hilariously Points Out 1 Terrible Decision Democrats Keep Making",
    "text": "Jon Stewart thinks a certain Democratic leader is lacking so much in the rizz department that he’s doing his party a disservice. On Monday night’s episode of “The Daily Show,” Stewart was unpacking President Donald Trump’s unhinged tariff threats against Canada and Mexico. “[Trump’s] trade war has awoken a sleeping giant. Not Canada, not Mexico, but the Democratic minority Senate leader. Release the Schumer!” Stewart said, sarcastically referring to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). Stewart then played a clip of the politician at a press conference Sunday, in which Schumer held a can of Corona beer and an avocado, and attempted to explain to the American people how the potential tariffs will impact their wallets. “It’s going to affect beer, OK? Most of it — Corona here — comes from Mexico. It’s going to affect your guac. Because what is guacamole made of? Avocados,” Schumer said while holding his props. After the clip played, Stewart appeared perplexed. “Your response to the trade war is to fucking tell us guacamole is made of avocados?” Stewart exclaimed. The “Daily Show” host was so annoyed by this clapback at Trump that he decided to pause the show and do an aside in which he blasted Schumer’s ability to effectively combat Republicans’ agenda. “Democrats, can you please stop fucking trotting Schumer out there every time Trump traverses into the unreal? He’s not good at this. What is the decision-making process here?” he said. Imagining a meeting among Democratic operatives, Stewart continued, “‘Hey, who should we get out there to effectively battle one of the most savvy presidential media manipulators in history? Oh, I don’t know, how about Schumer? He’s uninteresting, but at least he’s monotone. Oh wait, and Chuck, before you go out there, you look too young! Put on these readers and lower them on your nose. Perfect!’” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about. Join our loyalty program to support our work and go ad-free.

    "title": "Hot Mic Captures Justin Trudeau Warn Of Trump 'Absorbing' Canada: The 'Real' Deal",
    "text": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday told business and labor leaders that Donald Trump’s annexation proposal is the “real” deal as the American president has threatened to make the neighboring country the 51st U.S. state, according to remarks caught on a hot mic. “They’re very aware of our resources, of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those,” said Trudeau, whose comments on U.S. interest in Canada’s critical minerals were captured when he thought the media “left” the room, per CNN’s Paula Newton. He continued, “But Mr. Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.” Trudeau’s comments come after Trump threatened to hit America’s northern neighbor with 25% tariffs, a move that sparked counter-tariffs from both Canadian officials and leaders in Mexico — which was also subjected to U.S. president’s threats. Trump would later step back from the threats, delaying tariffs by 30 days in Canada and Mexico after both countries signed onto furthering efforts in law and border enforcement. Trump had pointed to fentanyl coming from Canada into the U.S. as a reason for his tariffs threat, despite a minimal amount of the deadly synthetic drug seized at the northern border. The U.S. president has entertained making Canada the 51st state since late last year, when he met with Trudeau at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The Canadian prime minister told CNN’s Jake Tapper early last month that Trump was getting people to be “somewhat distracted” by his comments as they would move away from talk of tariffs on oil, gas and electricity. Newton, in her reporting on Trudeau’s remarks from Friday, said the Canadian government believes U.S. officials will be “driving a very hard bargain economically” so that Trump’s 51st state proposal is the “only option left.” Trudeau, in public comments on Friday, said Canada must be thinking “tactically and strategically” on Trump’s threats as it looks to steer clear of future tariffs.

    "title": "Kash Patel Clears Senate Committee, Heads To Senate Floor For Confirmation Vote",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Thursday to advance the nomination of Kash Patel to the full Senate, moving him one step closer to being confirmed as President Donald Trump’s next director of the FBI. The vote was 12–10, along party lines. The vote came after long-winded speeches from senators from both parties, with Democrats listing all the reasons they view Patel as unqualified and not trustworthy for the job, and Republicans saying he’s fine. Patel, a loyal ally to Trump, previously criticized the FBI’s investigations into Trump’s potential coordination with Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He’s called for rooting out the “deep state” in government, a conspiracy theory about a secret network of federal government officials who are actually running the government. He’s described some of the defendants charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection as “political prisoners.” He also has potential conflicts of interest given his private-sector work with companies tied to the Kremlin and the Chinese Communist Party. If confirmed as FBI director, Patel would be responsible for countering Russian espionage and treating China as a potential national security threat, despite accepting money from companies connected to both of them. Perhaps most alarmingly, Patel would bring to the FBI his “enemies list” of more than 50 current and former U.S. officials, whom he could potentially target for retribution on Trump’s behalf. In his 2023 book, “Government Gangsters,” Patel refers to these officials as “members of the Executive Branch deep state” and calls them a “dangerous threat to democracy.” On top of all that, on Tuesday, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) accused Patel of potentially lying to the committee when he told them he didn’t know about the ongoing purge of career FBI officials. Durbin, the top Democrat on the panel, said whistleblowers shared notes with him from a recent meeting at the agency, led by FBI Director Brian Driscoll and acting FBI Deputy Director Robert Kissane, where they said a group of top officials must resign or be fired, and that “KP wants movement at FBI, reciprocal actions for DOJ.” A Patel spokesperson chalked up Durbin’s claims as “second-hand gossip to push a false narrative.” During Thursday’s hearing, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said he was “stunned” the panel was even considering Patel’s nomination. “I can’t believe I need to say this, but at a minimum, our FBI director should not have conflicts of interest with the Chinese Communist Party and Vladimir Putin,” said Booker. “This person has obfuscated, has lied, has shown an utter lack of character and straightforwardness with this committee,” he said. “It is just obvious to me, of all the people that this president has nominated, I voted for many of them, this stands apart from what this committee should demand from anyone coming before it.” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) brushed off Democrats’ concerns with Patel. “He’s been treated unfairly,” Tillis said. “I think Mr. Patel is going to come and fix an agency that I have great admiration for, that I still believe is the gold standard for law enforcement agencies in the world, in the history of the world,” he said. Patel now awaits his confirmation vote by the full Senate. He will almost certainly be confirmed, as there are currently no Republicans who have said they plan to oppose him.

    "text": "The gag is: Keke Palmer is revealing the moment when she realized she was famous. On “The Jennifer Hudson Show,” Palmer opened up about motherhood and key moments in her career, including the gig she credits with making her truly feel like a “celebrity.” “I would have to say probably when I did ‘True Jackson, VP,‘” Palmer said. “When I did ‘True Jackson, VP,’ everything changed.” Before she began starring in the Nickelodeon sitcom, which first aired in 2008, Palmer was a seasoned child actor, starring in films like “Akeelah and the Bee” and Tyler Perry’s “Madea’s Family Reunion.” But a seemingly a casual visit to Universal Studios that served as her “a-ha” moment. “I was just going and hanging out,” Palmer remembers. Then, in an instant, while with family, “a hundred” people swarmed them. In that surreal moment, Palmer realized life would never be the same. She later said that she felt “overwhelmed and gagged” by the whole ordeal. Two years ago, Palmer added another title to her resume: mother to son Leo. She told Hudson that her son has “given her new life,” and lovingly shared that he is “coming into his personality” and has already started mimicking her mannerisms. The “One of Them Days” star also discussed her family’s legacy of having twins. Both of her parents are twins, and she has twin siblings, as well.

    "title": "Kendrick Lamar Televised His Revolution On The World’s Biggest Stage",
    "text": "Ever since he was coronated as the new King of West Coast rap over a decade ago, Kendrick Lamar has lived up to his own hype. Whether winning accolades in the name of hip-hop, using his spotlight to make pointed political statements or conjuring up the most savage rap beef since Tupac and Biggie (and coming out victorious), the Compton superstar has a knack for being the moment — and defining the next. Lamar did so in 2024, when he squabbled with rap adversary Drake. He punctuated the century’s most sensational battle with an eviscerating diss track unlike any we’ve ever seen (“Not Like Us” won a record five Grammy Awards last weekend) and restored rap’s competitive spirit. The culture-shifting aftermath — which included the rap titan’s victory lap music video and the debut performance of his chart-topping diss at “The Pop Out” concert on Juneteenth — paved the way for Lamar to perform at the Super Bowl LIX halftime show in New Orleans Sunday night, upping his milestone tally yet again. We can argue that the opportunity arose solely because of Drake and Lamar’s verbal sparing last year. But even without the controversy, the latter’s remarkable career run was enough to clinch him a headlining spot that’s only been awarded to music’s upper echelon. The event’s timing, coinciding with his epic year, was too perfect to pass up. Thus, excitement bubbled after the NFL declared Lamar the 2025 Super Bowl halftime entertainment, a first for a solo hip-hop act. Being the first always comes with the pressure to make history and make it memorable. In the months leading up to Lamar’s performance, many asked how one lone rap star would advance the genre and entertain the masses simultaneously on the world’s biggest stage. Was it possible? Lamar answered the call with a Super Bowl set touted as “The Great American Game” — taking place during the actual great American rematch between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs — by Uncle Sam himself (portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson). From the moment Jackson introduced the rapper’s long-awaited performance, viewers knew something unprecedented would transpire on the field. And it did. Several things did, actually. Over 13 and a half minutes, Lamar ditched the tradition of performing his greatest hits and instead opted for storytelling by way of his latest album, “GNX” — plus a few hits from his album “Damn” (“Humble” and “DNA”), a “Black Panther” soundtrack standout (“All the Stars” featuring SZA) and another blistering Drake-aimed diss track (“Euphoria”). “GNX” was surprise-released mere months before Lamar took his place on the 50-yard line, so the stunning decision to perform five of its 12 tracks (out of an 11-song setlist) perplexed viewers who had anticipated more nostalgic smashes. But it made sense if you paid attention to the Compton emcee’s most recent statements. “It’s very hard for me to live in the past,” Lamar explained in his Apple Music pre-Super Bowl interview. “I respect the past wholeheartedly. But being in the now and being locked into how I feel and the energy I have now, that’s the LA energy for me. That’s something that I want to carry over to New Orleans and for the world to see.” Lamar kept his word. On Sunday, his “now” looked like capturing a snapshot of the current crumbling America that’s eliminating DEI policies, cracking down on immigration and targeting the rights of marginalized communities. That divided nation was one of the many symbols in Lamar’s Americana-themed performance, with captivating imagery by design — red, white and blue colors for the dancers and himself, overly patriotic garments for Jackson that mirrored a 1917 World War I propaganda poster, Lamar performing amid a Black-bodied American flag. The subverted iconography proves that heavier topics were on Lamar’s mind. That felt more urgent and timely than celebrating his hit songs of yesteryear (if that’s what you’re looking for, go stream “The Pop Out: Ken & Friends” again). So, even while keeping with the jovial party atmosphere summoned by records like “Squabble Up,” Lamar made space for hushed reflections proposed on B-sides like “Man at the Garden.” “I’m crashin’ out right now; it ain’t safe with me. I did it with integrity, these boys try hate on me, just wait and see,” he rapped in front of a light post surrounded by his squad. “More blood be spillin’, it’s just paint to me. Dangerously, ain’t no change in me, ain’t no shaming me. Flip a coin, you want the dangerous me or the famous me?” Both seemed to make an appearance on Sunday: “I want to perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,” Lamar boldly jabbed as a brief snippet of “Not Like Us” played, a double-whammy reference to Drake and his recent defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group — the rapper’s longtime label he’s accused of excessively promoting Lamar’s “defamatory” song. Making statements is in Lamar’s artistic nature. His career has thrived on it since the days of “Section.80.” So, for a man who has interrogated the conditions of being Black in America throughout his years — the coming-of-age tale of a Black Compton youth on “good kid, m.A.A.d city,” the tackling of race, identity and oppression on “To Pimp a Butterly,” a chain-gang led by him illustrating the corrupt American criminal justice system at the 2016 Grammys — it’s no surprise that Lamar chose to depict culture over pure merriment Sunday night. What else would you expect from a Pulitzer Prize winner who declared, “I wanna represent for us” on “The Heart Part 5?” “Twenty years in, still got that pen dedicated to bare hard truth,” Lamar noted in his opening Super Bowl number. Still, Lamar’s political gestures rang a bit hollow when you consider the vessel for his performance art. The NFL, a for-profit corporation that thrives on consumerism and that condemned kneeling protests, took note of the rap icon’s impact last year and deliberately used his star power to cash in on increased viewership and ad revenue for its annual championship. And Lamar let it; the price of admission to the league’s biggest stage. That’s a fair critique. There was similar commentary when Beyoncé rolled out her country offering “Cowboy Carter” last year, toting the American flag on the album’s covers to assert the history of Black cowboy culture. These symbolic reminders of Black Americans’ contributions are powerful and sometimes compelling. However, they will always be flawed when explored within or around the confines of a racist and capitalist system — especially alongside an actual act of resistance, like the performer who stormed the Super Bowl field wielding a Sudanese-Palestinian flag with “Sudan” and “Gaza” written on it. On the flip side, there’s still a revolutionary message at the heart of Lamar’s Super Bowl show. Or at least that’s what his dazzling theatrics set out to prove. Much like the corporation he made a deal with, Lamar manipulated his performance to push his agenda, albeit not perfectly. Though with Sunday’s access, the rapper monopolized the chance to “make a difference from inside the system” and use a global platform to his advantage. To what end? That remained largely unknown until Lamar uttered a damning phrase at the top of his set. “The revolution ’bout to be televised,” the 37-year-old warned, repurposing the late Gil Scott-Heron’s 1971 poem, “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.” “You picked the right time but the wrong guy,” Lamar added tauntingly. According to Wired, the goal of Lamar’s performance was to “portray [his] life as a video game. “I think the [video game theme] was symbolic, his way to reach young people,” show art director Shelley Rodgers explained to the publication. “A lot of it is showing his journey, traveling through the American dream.” Lamar’s vision of that was quite complex. Beginning with a Playstation controller-inspired motif, Lamar crafted a live show on Sunday that became more than just another finisher move to stomp on Drake’s figurative grave again. From performing rhymes about “sit[ting] down and be[ing] humble” between a split American flag to rapping about having “loyalty” and “royalty inside my DNA” in front of that same symbol of nationalism, to “walk[ing] your enemy down with a poker face” in front of millions of viewers, the political metaphors were aplenty with President Donald Trump in attendance. The “too loud, too reckless, too ghetto” spectacle was Lamar’s way of showing a chaotic American reality in all its facets, much to the chagrin of a disapproving Uncle Sam. “Mr. Lamar, do you know how to play the game?” Jackson, in character, spewed angrily at the rapper to get him to fall in line. But to know Lamar is to know he does anything but. Hence why he got away with doing the unthinkable onstage: performing his entire first verse of “Not Like Us” — censored for sensitive language, but still full of pedophile allegations aimed at Drake, a memed name-drop and that iconic “A minorrrrrrr” zinger (and who can forget that loaded cameo from a crip-walking Serena Williams). It’s a moment many didn’t think we’d actually see, especially after Drake’s legal action against the song and Lamar’s earlier jeer — and definitely not to such a degree. But not even rap litigation could dissuade Lamar. “It’s a cultural divide … this is bigger than the music,” he rapped. “They tried to rig the game, but you can’t fake influence.” Lamar’s mic-drop moment could’ve ended there, but he finished his performance with a celebratory wink to his hometown sound and the producer partially responsible for its nationwide embrace. “Mustaaaaaard,” Lamar introduced the “GNX” heater “TV Off” cozied up next to the man himself. He closed out by repeatedly instructing viewers to turn their televisions off before cameras abruptly cut to a lit-up sign that read, “Game over.” That final sly remark could’ve been a nod back to Scott-Heron’s call to action and Lamar’s original intent to televise the revolution he spoke of. It could’ve also been another subtle blow to Drake that, despite his best efforts, Lamar’s crown isn’t up for the taking: “It’s important I deserve it all because it’s mine. Why you think you deserve the greatest of all time?” That’s the interesting thing about art. We’d be here all day if we broke down every last detail of Lamar’s Super Bowl extravaganza. There are far more hidden messages the chronically online will dissect and obsess over for the next few days and possibly weeks leading up to Lamar’s North American “Grand National” stadium tour with SZA, which kicks off in April. “I think this is going to be one of those performances where people are going to be digging up Easter eggs for years to come,” Apple Music’s Nadeska Alexis predicted to Lamar ahead of the Super Bowl. Fevered social media discourse is already backing up that claim. As with any musical event from Lamar, his endgame is, at the very least, to get his audience to pause and ponder and, at most, consider another perspective. From what viewers witnessed on Sunday, that seems to be a small part of the rapper’s vision for the American Dream. “I’ve always been very open about storytelling through all my catalog and my history of music,” Lamar noted in his Apple Music interview. “I’ve always had a passion about bringing that on whatever stage I am on … I like to always carry on that sense of making people listen but also see and think a little.” Not many other hip-hop acts have possessed that devotion and reverence for the culture and used their platform to push it to another level like Lamar. So when they ask who attempted that on the world’s biggest stage, of all places, “Tell ’em Kendrick did it.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Hits Back At Critics Of Her ‘Wasteful’ Valentine’s Day Flowers",
    "text": "Kourtney Kardashian has, once again, issued a pointed response to critics of her love of massive floral displays. On Monday, the reality television personality and Poosh founder shared a carousel of photos on Instagram that documented her Valentine’s Day celebrations. One of the images showed more than a half-dozen bouquets of long-stemmed red roses surrounding a heart-shaped floral centerpiece. The tile floor beneath the arrangements was also covered in rose petals. Though most of the comments on the post were complimentary, a few criticized Kardashian over her “wasteful” arrangements. “What a waste of flowers. You and your sisters all do this and it’s not cute or funny,” one person wrote. “You don’t need all those flowers.” Added another: “It would be cool if there was a community garden somewhere that would use the arrangements in their compost.” Kardashian responded to one of the critics, noting that the flowers were later donated “to a local hospital,” per BuzzFeed. In a second reply, she clarified, “actually half went to an ER and half to an assisted living facility.” Kardashian, who is married to Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, has been called out on social media in the past for appearing to take her love of flowers to the extreme. While celebrating her birthday in 2023, she and Barker enjoyed a weekend getaway in Santa Barbara, California, where their suite was decked out with enormous bouquets of tulips.

When one commenter asked what Kardashian was planning to do with the flowers after the celebration, she replied: “We donate them to the children’s hospital.” The floral brouhaha comes just days after Barker and Kardashian’s 15-month-old son, Rocky, appeared on “The Kardashians” for the first time since his birth. Though the toddler’s face was blurred at his parents’ request, he was seated with the family as they enjoyed dinner at Los Angeles’ Petersen Automotive Museum.

    "title": "Kylie Jenner (Maybe) Missed This Joke About Timothée Chalamet At The BAFTA Awards",
    "text": "Timothée Chalamet and Kylie Jenner’s appearance together at this year’s BAFTAs led to a joke that social media users can’t get over. While attending the ceremony in London’s Royal Festival Hall on Sunday, Chalamet, 29, and Jenner, 27, sat together — prompting the show’s host, David Tennant, to tease the couple. In a clip shared on TikTok, Tennant is seen announcing that somebody in the crowd deserved “a very special mention.” “We’re very privileged tonight to be joined by the runner-up in New York’s recent Timothée Chalamet look-alike competition,” Tennant said before gesturing toward Chalamet, whose portrayal of Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown” has been raking in the awards nominations this year. Tennant’s joke was in reference to the viral look-alike contest in New York’s Washington Square Park last October, in which the actor showed up to witness a sea of his doppelgängers gathered in person. Tennant went on to ask Chalamet how long he would be in London, to which the “Dune” star replied, “Three days.” “You’ve got to work on the voice, not quite got the voice yet,” Tennant quipped, before setting his sights on an adjacent Jenner. “But lovely attention to detail, you’re with a Kylie Jenner lookalike!” he said. “Well done, well done team!” The couple laughed at the host’s joke, but Jenner went an extra step by animatedly pointing to herself while mouthing the words, “It’s me!” Jenner’s response set off a string of comments on TikTok and elsewhere, as users accused the reality star of not understanding Tennant’s “lookalike” reference. “Kylie did not get the joke i fear 😭😭,” one person wrote. Another said, “Kylie has no idea who anyone is or what’s going on 😂.” “The way she didn’t get his joke either 😭😭,” someone else added. Other TikTok users defended Jenner, with one noting that her response could’ve been her way of “joking” back with Tennant. “Everyone saying she didn’t get the joke, I think she did and tried joking with them! she’s saying something like ‘that’s me’ or something,” another wrote. Someone else added, “Everyone saying she doesn’t get it like she doesn’t have internet at home????” Chalamet and Jenner were first linked romantically in April 2023. The pair made their public debut after they were photographed kissing at Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour months later in September.

    "title": "Jeff Bezos’ Fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, Opens Up About ‘Turbulent’ Start To 2025 In Cryptic Post",
    "text": "Weeks after her much-scrutinized appearance at President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Lauren Sánchez is in a contemplative mood. On Monday, the author and former news anchor ― who is engaged to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ― offered a cryptic take on her 2025 thus far with an Instagram photo of herself piloting what appears to be a small aircraft. “Some years start with turbulence, but that’s just the wind reminding you to spread your wings,” she wrote in the accompanying caption. “Good to be back in the air…Here’s to flying farther than we ever imagined.” Sánchez’s allusion to “turbulence” could, of course, be interpreted any number of ways. However, many were quick to interpret her comment as a nod to the backlash she received from both ends of the political spectrum for her lacy ensemble at Trump’s Jan. 20 swearing-in. No stranger to skin-baring designs, Sánchez attended the event in a white Alexander McQueen pantsuit. Her blazer featured a plunging neckline from which the top of her push-up corset bra was visible. Among the many conservative figures who blasted what was described as Sánchez’s “lingerie-inspired” look was former Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who wrote on X: “She has no class. No dignity. No respect.” Photos and video showing Sánchez seated beside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who appeared to be glancing down at her chest, quickly went viral. Sánchez has not publicly commented on the criticism her outfit received. Days after the inauguration, however, she responded to an Instagram video posted by comedian Whitney Cummings, who lightly defended the look as something that “looks cute in a mirror” but doesn’t photograph well. In the comments, Sánchez shared a red heart emoji, but nothing more. By Tuesday, Sánchez’s Instagram post had received more than 7,500 likes and drawn a plethora of comments from some of her celebrity pals. One of those comments came from singer-songwriter Jewel, who angered fans with an appearance at another of Trump’s inaugural events.

    "title": "Law Professor Spots Televised 'Quid Pro Quo' Moment Between Eric Adams And White House",
    "text": "New York University law professor Ryan Goodman says the alleged “quid pro quo” arrangement between New York City Mayor Eric Adams and President Donald Trump’s administration was captured Friday in broad daylight — when the legally embattled mayor appeared on national television. Adams was indicted in September on allegations he accepted bribes and illegal campaign contributions, but went on to curry favor with Trump by working with him on immigration. On Monday, the Department of Justice ordered federal prosecutors to drop the charges. The directive from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove argued that Adams’ case should be dropped so the mayor could continue to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policy. A few days earlier, Adams and Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, had a curious exchange on Fox News. During an appearance Friday on “Fox & Friends,” Homan said: “If [Adams] doesn’t come through, I’ll be back in New York City, and we won’t be sitting on the couch. I’ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, ‘Where the hell is the agreement we came to?’” Goodman, who previously served as special counsel at the Defense Department, argued Friday on CNN’s “OutFront” that Homan thus unwittingly exposed the rumored deal on television — and said, “This is the quid pro quo. It seems like this is the implicit threat.” Goodman then essentially parsed through Homan’s statement. “If you don’t come through on your part of the agreement,” Goodman said of Homan’s implicit threat, “I’m coming back to claim what we have, which is that we have submitted to the court that the case is still strong, and we’re asking the court to dismiss it, but not to throw it completely away.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Goodman argued that the order from Bove, rather than rewarding Adams for cooperating with Trump, is “actually weaponization to keep the case hovering” above Adams’ head. The order specifically noted that the DOJ could bring the same charges against Adams at some point in the future.

    "title": "Lawrence O'Donnell Flags Moment Trump Was ‘Fully Humiliated On The World Stage’",
    "text": "MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell on Monday highlighted the moment earlier in the day that he believed President Donald Trump was “fully humiliated on the world stage” after the president was fact-checked — to his face — by French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. Macron made Trump “the first president in history who had to be interrupted and corrected by an ally when the president of the United States was lying and lying about that ally,” claimed O’Donnell. O’Donnell noted how Macron had interrupted “blustering” Trump, who was parroting his “standard line about Europe’s aid to Ukraine, the lie that Europe has loaned money to Ukraine, and it’s a loan, and Ukraine has to pay it back.” “Trump became the first American president in history fully humiliated on the world stage by instantly getting caught and corrected in his lie,” he continued. Macron “actually reached out, grabbed the arm of the American president, to stop him from telling a lie about France and the rest of the countries of Europe,” he noted. Trump has ramped up his anti-Ukraine rhetoric in recent days as he seeks to broker a peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion in 2022, and without the input of Ukraine. The U.S. president was “humiliated and exposed in a way that no previous president ever could be because no previous president would be pathological enough to try to tell a lie like that right in front of the person he’s lying about. And no previous president could possibly be stupid enough to try to tell a lie like that,” said O’Donnell. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "'I Am Finally Free!': Leonard Peltier Released From Prison After Nearly 50 Years",
    "text": "WASHINGTON — Native American rights activist Leonard Peltier was released from prison on Tuesday morning, ending his nearly 50 years of incarceration after the U.S. government lied, threatened people and hid evidence to put him behind bars. “Today I am finally free! They may have imprisoned me but they never took my spirit!” Peltier said in a statement. “Thank you to all my supporters throughout the world who fought for my freedom. I am finally going home. I look forward to seeing my friends, my family, and my community. It’s a good day today.” NDN Collective, an Indigenous rights group that has been leading Peltier’s legal effort, shared photos of Peltier moments after leaving prison, outside in the sun. Peltier, 80, had been in prison ever since the federal government accused him of murdering two FBI agents in a 1975 shoot-out on Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. There was never evidence that he committed a crime, and federal law enforcement officials later admitted they never did figure out who shot those agents. But the FBI needed someone to take the fall after losing two of its agents, and all of Peltier’s co-defendants were acquitted based on self-defense. So, Peltier became their guy. His trial was rife with misconduct. The FBI threatened and coerced witnesses into lying. Federal prosecutors hid evidence that exonerated Peltier. A juror acknowledged on the second day of the trial that she had “prejudice against Indians,” but she was kept on anyway. The government’s case fell apart after these revelations, so it simply revised its charges against Peltier to “aiding and abetting” whoever did kill the agents ― based entirely on the fact that he was one of dozens of people present when the shoot-out took place. Peltier was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive life terms. Over the decades, virtually every international human rights leader, including Mother Teresa, Desmond Tutu and Pope Francis, denounced Peltier’s imprisonment and urged his release. Members of Congress, celebrities, tribal leaders, Indigenous rights groups and millions of regular people called for his freedom. Peltier maintained his innocence the entire time, which almost certainly contributed to him remaining behind bars. In a stunning final act, Joe Biden, a proud ally to Native American communities and tribes, last month granted clemency to Peltier with just minutes left in his presidency. He set his release date for Tuesday. Biden didn’t grant a full pardon, however; he commuted Peltier’s sentence to home confinement. That means Peltier, an enrolled citizen of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, can return home to Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota but must remain in his house. NDN Collective is hosting and livestreaming a celebratory event in Belcourt, North Dakota, on Wednesday to welcome Peltier home. The group helped to purchase and prepare a house for Peltier to move into upon his return home. “Today our elder Leonard Peltier walks into the open arms of his people,” said Nick Tilsen, founder and CEO of NDN Collective. “Peltier’s liberation is invaluable in and of itself — yet just as his wrongful incarceration represented the oppression of Indigenous Peoples everywhere, his release today is a symbol of our collective power and inherent freedom.” Peltier is in poor health, which was a factor in Biden releasing him. He is now blind in one eye and uses a walker to get around. Due to frequent lockdowns in his maximum security prison in Florida, he spent most of his later years confined to inches of space in a cell. His health problems include an aortic aneurysm and diabetes, which sent him to the hospital in July with “open wounds and tissue death on his toes and feet.” He was hospitalized again in October. And an asterisk amid the celebration is that Peltier still faces home confinement. Biden almost certainly opted for commuting Peltier’s sentence over a pardon (which would have meant he was fully free) as a nod to the FBI, which has strongly opposed Peltier ever being released — based on incredibly flawed arguments — and criticized Biden’s decision to do so.

This detail makes Peltier’s release somewhat bittersweet for organizations that have long advocated for his freedom. “Leonard Peltier’s release is the right thing to do given the serious and ongoing human rights concerns about the fairness of his trial, his nearly 50 years behind bars, his health and his age,” said Paul O’Brien, executive director of Amnesty International USA. “While we welcome his release from prison, he should not be restricted to home confinement.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "10 High-End Mascaras That Are Actually Worth Every Penny",
    "text": "You might wonder how it can be that some mascaras cost $5 while others cost north of $40. For those of us who watch our money yet take caution of what we put around our eyes, is there any reason not to opt for the cheaper version and call it a day? For one, the formula. Luxury mascaras can take advantage of “high-end ingredients that drugstore mascaras cannot afford,” cosmetic chemist Ni’Kita Wilson previously explained. Now, take the issue of excessive flaking, when a mascara disintegrates and smudges under and around the wearer’s eyes. You may be less likely to deal with that cosmetic problem with a more expensive mascara. “The fibers used in high-end mascaras may adhere to the lashes better because [those brands] can either afford to add more of them or a combination of fibers to give the desired effect,” Wilson explained. And, as many of us mascara lovers may intuit, the design of the mascara brush is “just as important as the formula.” Having the money to spend on designing an especially effective brush may make a luxury mascara stand out. Makeup artist Aleksandra Ambrozy told HuffPost that in her experience, “drugstore [mascaras] just don’t deliver” compared to higher-end options, especially when it comes to bestowing notable length and volume sans clumping. Some of the price differences between luxury and drugstore mascaras can also come down to marketing. And, for parent companies that own both high-end and drugstore brands (for example, L’Oreal owns luxury brand Lancome and drugstore brand Maybelline), the company may share elements of the formulas across entities. (One way to check either way? Compare the ingredients.) It all depends on the individual, of course, and as us makeup lovers know, a drugstore mascara can certainly knock it out of the park — you don’t have to spend a lot to rock a gorgeous eye look. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted. “I like mascaras which give length and volume without clumping and I always find that the drugstore ones just don’t deliver,” Ambrozy previously explained to HuffPost, noting that in her experience as a makeup artist, high-end mascaras have performed \"far more superior to drugstore ones.\" “My all-time favorite [mascara] right now is Maneater by Tarte,\" Ambrozy said. \"[It provides] amazing buildable volume and length.\" Ambrozy also recommended Dior's Diorshow Lash-Extension Effect mascara in previous HuffPost coverage. That version of Dior's runway-famous Diorshow mascara has since been discontinued, but based on our research, we think Diorshow Iconic Overcurl mascara is a great substitute. This style is the brand's current bestselling and highest-rated mascara on Sephora, designed to deliver major curling and emphatic volume. Its strategically bent brush helps draw out the curve and length of lashes while the formula nourishes with jojoba esters. Ambrozy also recommended Lancôme's since-discontinued Grandiose Extreme mascara. Based on our research, we think Lancôme's Lash Idôle lengthening and volumizing mascara is a close match. The two Lancôme releases share overtly bent brushes designed to push up and fan lashes alongside ultra-tiny bristles to define and lengthen. One hack from a pedestrian mascara lover (myself)? If you're unsure about trying a more expensive formula, try out the travel size first. As Wilson noted in previous HuffPost coverage, the inclusion of certain ingredients — like polymers — in high-end mascaras could justify an increased price tag. Tubing mascara may be a good example of this. Distinct from standard mascara, tubing formulas contain polymers that wrap around lashes to lengthen and define; traditional mascara, on the other hand, utilizes pigmented waxes and oils that have a greater propensity to smudge and flake. Folks with sensitive eyes may also find tubing formulas preferable since they require much less tugging and rubbing on the eye area to remove. Caliray's Come Hell or High Water tubing mascara is an Allure 2022 Best of Beauty award winner, designed to curl, add volume and wash off with warm water. Tarte's Tartlette XL mascara is an incredibly popular tubing option, currently the bestselling tubing mascara at Sephora and an Allure 2024 Best of Beauty award winner. The formula is equipped with peptides and biotin to lift lashes while thickening and conditioning them for a defined, lush look. \"As a longtime member of the straight lashes community, I’ve tried at least 20 mascaras in an attempt to get mine to have some sort of volume or curl,\" wrote former HuffPost writer Kristen Adaway in previous coverage. \"[Benefit's Badgal Bang] mascara makes it look like I actually have long lashes ... and after multiple hours of wear, didn't smudge or give me the dreaded raccoon-eye effect,\" Adaway said. \"I also have sensitive eyes and I had zero irritation while I was wearing it.\" Too Faced's Better Than Sex mascara is an iconic high-end mascara, not just for its brow-raising name but for its dramatically fluttery look. Paired with a curl-priming polymer formula, the mascara's hourglass brush and grabby bristles claim to coat every lash while pushing lashes out for length. I've long loved Milk Makeup's Kush volumizing mascara for the fringey, thickly defined volume it gives me, which I attribute to its finely bristled brush and buildable yet nourishing formula. In my opinion, Tarte's Lights, Camera, Lashes mascara is a slept-on heavy hitter. It purportedly increases lashes' curl by 35%, delivering an effortless smoldering eye. Its inky color adds extra definition to eyes, and the wand's defined brush sports short and long bristles to capture every single lash. Thrive Causemetics' bestselling Liquid Lash Extensions is another popular tubing mascara, both for its sensitive eye-friendly ingredients and its results (which, per reviews and reviewer photos, live up to its name). I've been pining for this mascara myself. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Compare that to Apple’s MagSafe Charger, which retails for $36 (and doesn’t even come with a charging adapter!), and the savings are pretty sweet! This minimal magnetic charging pad attaches to MagSafe-compatible devices for wireless charging. For Apple users, that includes any generation of iPhone from 12 onwards and AirPods 2 and 3, including Pro models. The chargers light-up when they’re connected to show you they’re working or if there’s a problem with your phone’s connection. It’s ultra-thin and works with compatible cases, too! Many reviewers said they were skeptical of this third-party Apple dupe. But take it from reviewer Maxim Shapiro: “I thought that these would not work as well as the ‘real’ Apple charging pads but I was very happily surprised that these work exactly the same way... [You] really can not tell the difference. I use them everywhere and would definitely purchase these again!” “I thought that these would not work as well as the “real” Apple charging pads but I was very happily surprised that these work exactly the same way, you really can not tell the difference. I use them everywhere and would definitely purchase these again!” — Maxim Shapiro  “This 2-pack Magnetic Wireless Charger has been a game-changer, especially when my old phone’s charging port started malfunctioning. The magnetic alignment is spot on, snapping my iPhone 14 Pro securely into place for fast, reliable charging. The 5ft cable offers plenty of flexibility, and the sleek, compact design looks great and is easy to take on the go. Having two chargers is super convenient—I keep one at home and one at the office, so I’m always covered. This is a fantastic value and a must-have for anyone looking for a hassle-free charging solution!” — Heather D.  “I purchased this product for my elderly father. Hs iPhone has a Magsafe case on it, and he had a lot of difficulty with his previous much larger qi charger aligning his phone on the right spot to ensure that it would charge. Many times, he would place on the charger to charge overnight only to find that because his phone was not perfectly centered on the charger...charging failed. These chargers have been AWESOME. They are a “no brainer” when it comes to putting your phone on the charging pad. I was a little wary when they arrived because compared to the charger he had, they were much smaller. This had zero effect. With or without the case, the phone is magnetized to the charger and there is not a question of whether or not it is connected correctly. Charging has become a non-issue because of these chargers!” — Amazon Customer  “We recently got new iPhone 16’s. So this is the first time I was able to use a magnetic charger. Love it! With our previous iPhones I had to either plug it in to charge it or center it on the wireless charger & had to make sure the light was on, telling me it was charging. These new magnetic chargers immediately “click” right on to the phone. No question it is working. So glad I bought the double pkg so husband & I both can charge our phones at night. Also, this is the first “usb-c” that I have needed, so I have a “ton” of iPhone lightening chargers, so this also gives me (2) usb-c wall “adapters “, if needed.” — MaryE  By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "We Asked Doctors How They REALLY Feel About The Trump Admin's 'Make America Healthy Again' Plan",
    "text": "Last week, the White House released a Make America Healthy Again Commission executive order that outlines a host of goals with a main purpose of addressing chronic disease in adults and children. And some medical experts are skeptical. “Make America Healthy Again” is a Trump campaign promise and now commission that’s led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was recently appointed Health and Human Services Secretary. The commission has an overarching goal of reducing the prevalence of chronic illness in Americans and looking at the “over-reliance” on certain medications, such as weight-loss drugs, mood stabilizers and ADHD medication. It also cites the rising rates of autism and ADHD, and the United States’ lower life expectancy when compared to other countries. On the surface, there is nothing inherently wrong with the overall aim to make people healthier, happier and free of illness, two doctors told HuffPost. Physicians want to lessen chronic disease incidence. However, the approach of the Make America Healthy Again initiative worries experts. “At the heart of the matter, you’re not gonna find a doctor in this country who doesn’t want to ‘Make America Healthy Again.’ That’s something we all strive to do,” said Dr. Eric Burnett, an internal medicine doctor at an academic medical center in New York and a health communicator on social media. “We want to be healthy. We want to decrease chronic diseases in the general population and specifically in children,” said Dr. Sheila Young-Mercado, the president of the Association of Black Women Physicians. And there is absolutely a chronic disease problem in this country, Burnett said. “I deal with the chronic disease epidemic every day as a hospitalist. I see the end stages of chronic illness when patients get sick enough to be in the hospital.” What Burnett personally disagrees with is the undertones of the executive order and the overall messaging of the Make America Healthy Again Commission. Burnett said the executive order claims that no one really knows what’s causing the chronic disease epidemic in the United States. “It suggests there’s some sort of sinister aspect to it ― that we’re hiding something, or that it’s an over-reliance upon medications, that doctors fail to address root causes of chronic illness and just give them medications just to sort of brush them off,” Burnett said. Here’s what else concerns medical experts about the Make America Healthy Again executive order: Burnett noted that in the executive order, there’s a subsection about the so-called “harms” of SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, like antidepressants and antipsychotic medications. It also mentions America having an “over-reliance” on medications for chronic diseases. Specifically, the order calls for the commission to “assess the threat that potential over-utilization of medication” and “assess the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants and weight-loss drugs. “What that does is it sort of vilifies medication and makes it seem like doctors are trying to just give you a pill to get you away when that’s not true,” Burnett said. “Most doctors will attempt to do lifestyle modifications first before relying on medications.” “But I think what RFK Jr. fails to realize, or he’s failing to express to the public, is that chronic disease is multifactorial. It’s not just one simple fix,” Burnett continued. “There’s socioeconomic factors, there’s social determinants of health, there’s genetics that all obviously need to be addressed in a multifactorial, multidisciplinary manner that takes time, takes effort, takes money, and I think that’s what he’s not doing. He’s simplifying it and vilifying the medical profession in the process, further eroding trust.” As mentioned above, the order specifically targets the prescription of mental health medications like Lexapro, Prozac and Zoloft, in addition to antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. The order instructs the commission to look at the “prevalence and threat” of these medications. But SSRIs, antipsychotics and other mental health-focused medications are proven to be beneficial for the treatment of conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. While taking these medications can carry some risks, that is also true for any medication out there. And for those who need these mood-stabilizing medications, the risk of not having access can be incredibly dangerous, too. Many people rely on SSRIs, for example, to manage suicidality. When people can’t get the medications they need, they also tend to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol, Young-Mercado said. Instead of worrying about the “threat” of these medications, Young-Mercado said the root cause for the prescription of these mood-stabilizing drugs needs to be addressed, too. “At the heart of this, it’s really looking at what’s happening in our societies — what are the levels of child abuse? What are the levels of intimate partner violence? What are the levels of community violence? What is the level of workplace trauma? What is the level of stress?” she said. “If we want to decrease reliance on these medications, what are the environmental factors that are driving them?” While the executive order does not explicitly mention alternative medicine, Burnett believes the messaging sets up distrust in traditional health care by using phrases like “over-reliance on medication and treatments” and “we must ensure our healthcare system promotes health rather than just managing disease.” In recent years, there’s been a distrust when it comes to science and medicine, despite tons of evidence. The medical industry needs trust — not an executive order that seemingly sows doubt about prescription medications and proper disease management. “We’re at this juncture where we need buy-in from the public ... and if he vilifies us, making us seem to be just these pharma shill pill-pushers, it’s going to make the people run towards the holistic wellness industry, which obviously has their their own agenda,” Burnett said. While there can be room for alternative or holistic wellness in your health routine, it can’t always be the only answer. For example, when a patient with diabetes stops taking medication because they’re convinced their pills are a scam and turn to holistic treatments like supplements instead, they get sicker and wind up in the hospital. “And that’s the thing, when you have these wellness influencers and people who are trying to push this ‘MAHA’ movement of ‘get off medications and just live a healthier lifestyle’ ... those holistic practitioners are never going to see the downstream consequences of their actions,” Burnett said. This is where Burnett’s frustration lies. “I want to try to explain to people the importance of this. We’re not trying to over-rely on medication, they do serve a role, but this narrative that they’re spinning on that side is making it difficult,” Burnett noted. The social determinants of health are a set of factors that can greatly impact a person’s well-being ― and they are often circumstances people are born into. They include racism and discrimination, education levels, access to nutritious foods, financial stability and pollution. These factors play a huge part in chronic illness development and management. For example, if you live in an area with high air pollution, you’re more likely to develop asthma. Or if you’re a single parent who works multiple jobs to make ends meet, it’s likely harder to get to the doctor or pay for items that help you manage an illness properly. Burnett noted that he hasn’t heard Kennedy or the other people in charge address the social determinants of health, and these aren’t outlined in the new executive order, either. “I think we just don’t see the emphasis placed on that, which makes me question how serious he is about ‘making America healthy again’ when he doesn’t address the things as a physician that I see all the time that influence chronic illness,” Burnett said. Burnett is also concerned about the gutting of diversity, equity and inclusion programs enacted by the current administration and how that could further create health care disparities, which could make these social determinants of health even more pronounced. Looking at “health care disparities and how to address them is going to be viewed as DEI, and we’re not going to be able to ― at least on the federal level ― have funding to investigate why healthcare disparities exist,” Burnett said. There is certainly room for improvement when it comes to the health of Americans, but focusing on so-called “threats” of medications and an “over-reliance on treatments” isn’t a great starting point. “We want to make Americans healthy, but we’re not going to provide the funding to do it,” said Young-Mercado, who is referring to health insurance access in this country. “I think ... when we’re looking at who’s writing these documents, we have to assume that having access to health care isn’t actually an issue for them, so it may not be something that they’re really thinking about.” Access to health care includes having health insurance at all, but also being able to afford an expensive bill that isn’t covered by insurance and being able to access government health care programs for those who are eligible. For instance, more than 70 million Americans get their physical health care and behavioral health care through Medicaid, but currently, Republicans have their eye on the state-federal health care program and want to cut billions of dollars in funding to Medicaid. “If we want to be able to address chronic diseases and increase life years in the U.S., then we have to maintain and improve Medicaid for our population. That’s not something that we can get rid of,” said Young-Mercado. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

When someone says that Europeans are so much healthier than Americans, Burnett points to two things — “A, they have walkable cities, right? They have cities where their infrastructure is such that people can walk around. They don’t have to drive a half an hour to get to the supermarket. And B, they may have access to universal health care. They don’t have to worry that if they go to their doctor for, you know, for something, that they’re going to be in six figures’ worth of medical debt.” “I think that there’s also a disconnect in the realities of how we want to create this program, how we want to envision making America healthy without the underlying funding to make it happen. That’s our major problem,” said Young-Mercado. By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Rubio Says El Salvador Will Accept U.S. Deportees From Any Nation, Including Americans",
    "text": "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late Monday that El Salvador’s president has offered to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including violent American criminals now imprisoned in the United States. President Nayib Bukele “has agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,” Rubio said at a signing ceremony for an unrelated civil nuclear agreement with El Salvador’s foreign minister. “He’s also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentence in the United States even though they’re U.S. citizens or legal residents,” Rubio said. He had just met with Bukele at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours. After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele’s offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges. Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet Trump administration demands for a major crackdown on immigration amid turmoil in Washington over the status of the government’s main foreign development agency. He arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to reduce or eliminate China’s presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so. Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio’s five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador. President Donald Trump’s administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States. The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a “safe third country” agreement. That would mean the U.S. could deport non-Salvadorean migrants to El Salvador. Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele’s offer was for detainees of any nationality. Rubio said Bukele then went further and said his country was willing to accept and to jail U.S. citizens or legal residents convicted of and imprisoned for violent crimes. Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals. Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front, criticized the “safe third country” plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington’s “backyard to dump the garbage.” The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them. Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It’s unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras. “Mass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,” Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. “It impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it’s not good for anyone.” Monday’s deportation flight came as Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States. “This is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,” Rubio said. “And it would have been impossible to do without the strong partnership we have here with our friends and allies in Panama. And we’re going to continue to do it.” His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available. While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency’s Washington headquarters after billionaire Elon Musk announced Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency. Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations. The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades — although its new status will likely be challenged in court — and will be run out of the State Department by department officials. In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress. On his weekend discussion with Panama’s president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Trump’s warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Trump’s insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative. “I understand that it’s a delicate issue in Panama,” Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. “We don’t want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,” he said. “I don’t believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it’ll yield fruits and result in the days to come.” But back in Washington, Trump was less diplomatic, saying: “China’s involved with the Panama Canal. They won’t be for long and that’s the way it has to be.” “We either want it back, or we’re going to get something very strong, or we’re going to take it back,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “And China will be dealt with.” As he has in the past, Trump again criticized the Carter administration for having signed a 1970s treaty to cede control of the canal to Panama and said it was a pact that Panama has since “totally violated.” “They’ve agreed to certain things, but I’m not happy with it,” Trump said. ___ Zamorano reported from Panama City. ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of Marco Rubio at https://apnews.com/hub/marco-rubio.

    "title": "Mark Ruffalo Lets A Donald Trump Jab Hang In The Air And ‘Fallon’ Audience Eats It Up",
    "text": "Actor Mark Ruffalo — who has never been shy about slamming Donald Trump — threw shade at the president without saying his name while promoting new sci-fi dystopian comedy “Mickey 17” on Thursday’s episode of “The Tonight Show.” “I play a petty dictator,” Ruffalo told host Jimmy Fallon of his role as authoritarian politician Kenneth Marshall in Oscar-winning director Bong Joon Ho’s latest film, due out next week. The “Avengers” star let the comment hang in the air as laughter rippled through the “Tonight Show” audience. “At the time, we shot it three years ago, and I thought this is over the top,” Ruffalo then said. Pausing for effect, he added: “And now, I realize it’s totally underplayed.” The cheers and applause grew and Ruffalo cracked: “I mean, I made a documentary.” Watch here: Ruffalo and Bong last week told reporters in Seoul that the character wasn’t inspired by Trump, despite rumors that he was. “As the film portrays various political nightmares and depictions of dictators, viewers appear to project their own history onto them,” said Bong, per the Yonhap News Agency. “He is an archetypal petty dictator,” Ruffalo said. “We’ve seen this kind of leader time and time again over the last century. They are all the same — egotistical, fragile, self-centered and self-serving.” Ruffalo has for years been a vocal critic of Trump and campaigned for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. “We got our asses kicked,” he admitted following Trump’s victory in November. “We suffered a great loss,” Ruffalo said. “It’s a loss that touches deeply on so much of what we’ve worked for and we’ve hoped for and dreamed of for such a long time now.” Watch the trailer for “Mickey 17” here: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Regularly Replacing Your Mascara Is Imperative. Here Are 12 Subscribe & Save Options That Can Help",
    "text": "Pop quiz: When was the last time you replaced your old mascara with a new one? If you can’t remember, or the answer is “a long, long time ago,” we have some kind of gross news for you. In previous reporting, optometrists and cosmetologists told HuffPost that using old, expired mascara can spread bacteria to your eyes, increasing the risk of infection and irritation. They recommended a cadence of every two to three months for tossing that old tube and getting a new one. For those of us who aren’t using up a whole tube every three months, it may be easy for this guidance to slip your mind when the time to replace it rolls around. Luckily, there’s an easy fix for that that you should only have to set up once: Automatic replenishment programs like Amazon’s Subscribe & Save, Walmart Subscribe, Dermstore’s Auto-Replenishment and Sephora’s Auto-Replenish let you set a specific frequency for shipping new replacements of products to your home, and in some cases, will charge you less for a subscription product than if you bought it as a one-time purchase. So, if you wear mascara regularly, check out our list of a bunch of highly-rated mascaras that are eligible for auto-replenishment. (Tip: Some of these come in mini sizes too, so if you don’t think you’ll use up a full-sized tube in time, you can get a smaller one.) Pick your favorite, set the two- to three-month frequency, and enjoy your dolled-up lashes without having to set a reminder to run to the store. Easy-peasy. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team.

I tried going the false eyelash route but was a complete failure at applying them. My hair stylist told me about Grande Lash mascara so I gave it a try. I have been using it for 10 months and I can honestly say that I am now seeing a difference in the length and thickness of my lashes! I turned 60 recently and my lashes are looking healthy and full with this mascara. I feel like my eyes are noticeable once again.

    "title": "CBS Agrees To Hand Over '60 Minutes' Harris Interview Transcripts To FCC",
    "text": "CBS says it will turn over an unedited transcript of its October interview with Kamala Harris to the Federal Communications Commission, part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing fight with the network over how it handled a story about his opponent. Trump sued CBS for $10 billion over the “60 Minutes” interview, claiming it was deceptively edited to make Harris look good. Published reports said CBS’ parent company, Paramount, has been talking to Trump’s lawyers about a settlement. The network said Friday that it was compelled by Brendan Carr, Trump’s appointee as FCC chairman, to turn over the transcripts and camera feeds of the interview for a parallel investigation by the commission. “60 Minutes” has resisted releasing transcripts for this and all of its interviews, to avoid second-guessing of its editing process. The case, particularly a potential settlement, is being closely watched by advocates for press freedom and by journalists within CBS, whose lawyers called Trump’s lawsuit “completely without merit” and promised to vigorously fight it after it was filed. The Harris interview initially drew attention because CBS News showed Harris giving completely different responses to a question posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker in clips that were aired on “Face the Nation” on Oct. 6 and the next night on “60 Minutes.” The network said each clip came from a lengthy response by Harris to Whitaker’s question, but they were edited to fit time constraints on both broadcasts. In his lawsuit, filed in Texas on Nov. 1, Trump charged it was deceptive editing designed to benefit Harris and constituted “partisan and unlawful acts of voter interference.” Trump, who turned down a request to be interviewed by “60 Minutes” during the campaign, has continued his fight despite winning the election less than a week after the lawsuit was filed. The network has not commented on talks about a potential settlement, reported by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Paramount executives are seeking Trump administration approval of a sale of the company to another entertainment firm, Skydance. ABC News in December settled a defamation lawsuit by Trump over statements made by anchor George Stephanopoulos, agreeing to pay $15 million toward Trump’s presidential library rather than engage in a public fight. Meta has reportedly paid $25 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit against the company over its decision to suspend his social media accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. ___ David Bauder writes about the intersection of media and entertainment for the AP.

    "text": "Members of Congress were denied entry into the Department of Education building in Washington, D.C., on Friday. Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.) posted a video Friday that appears to show federal officers blocking the entrance to the building. “They’ve called armed federal officers to the scene,” Frost posted on Bluesky. “We aren’t dangerous. We are here to represent our people. To defend public education. This is an authoritarian regime. You cannot block members of Congress from entering the Department of Education.” Video Frost took shows officers inside the building, denying access to representatives outside. In another video, Frost points out a sign on the door that says “All access entrance.” “And right here they have armed officers acting like we’re dangerous,” he said. “A year ago, I’d be able to walk into this building and not be locked out. This is what they’re doing.” President Donald Trump has tapped unelected billionaire Elon Musk to head the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk has inserted his own supporters into several government offices to seek out sensitive data, including at the Department of Education. “Elon is allowed in, but not you, not your elected representatives,” Frost said. “Not parents, not students. Elon, he can go in. His goons can go in, but not the representatives of the people.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Mitch McConnell, A Polio Survivor, Slams RFK Jr.'s Confirmation",
    "text": "Former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the only Republican senator to oppose Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation as health secretary, slammed the anti-vaccine activist as a “peddler of dangerous conspiracy theories” after Thursday’s vote. “I’m a survivor of childhood polio. In my lifetime, I’ve watched vaccines save millions of lives from devastating diseases across America and around the world,” said McConnell, who’s predicted to end his political career when his term ends next year. “I will not condone the relitigation of proven cures, and neither will millions of Americans who credit their survival and quality of life to scientific miracles,” he continued. Kennedy, now secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, is notorious for spreading anti-vaccine propaganda, dismissing the abundance of science proving the safety and efficacy of immunization and repeatedly propping up the myth that vaccines cause autism. In his remarks Thursday, McConnell dismissed Kennedy’s characterization of himself as someone who’s simply asking questions and advocating for more research. “Individuals, parents, and families have a right to push for a healthier nation and demand the best possible scientific guidance on preventing and treating illness,” the Kentucky senator said. “But a record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts.” Trump dismissed McConnell’s comments, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that the Kentucky senator is a “bitter guy.” “He’s not voting against Bobby. He’s voting against me,” Trump said. When asked if he was doubting McConnell’s polio experience, Trump replied: “I have no idea if he had polio.” In his new role, Kennedy will have multiple avenues to rein in vaccine access and uptake, including by revising government vaccine advisories, requiring additional post-market studies on vaccines, sowing public distrust in immunization overall and weakening legal protections for vaccine makers.

McConnell — who contracted polio at two years old and credits the vaccine with saving him from a disease that once killed or paralyzed over half a million people each year — spoke out against Kennedy as a nominee shortly after a media investigation in December found that a lawyer helping Kennedy select top health officials for the new Trump administration had petitioned the federal government to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine for children. The lawyer, Aaron Siri, may be up for a prominent job in Kennedy’s HHS, The New York Times reported late last year.

    "title": "Monica Lewinsky Opens About How She Deals With A Difficult Anniversary",
    "text": "In 1998, Monica Lewinsky went through one of the biggest scandals in American politics — but she’s refusing to let her past dictate her future. When Lewinsky was a 24-year-old White House intern, her affair with then-President Bill Clinton thrust her into the spotlight. On Jan. 16, 1998, Lewinsky was detained by the FBI and later questioned by Justice Department lawyers. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, published on Feb. 14, she details how she and her family turned that life-changing event into a “Survivors’ Day.” “We celebrate. Sometimes my mom buys me a gift or I buy myself a gift, and just make a moment of really acknowledging,” she told the magazine. She described the incident with the FBI as the “worst day of her life thus far.” Even though she’s reclaiming her narrative, Lewinsky revealed that there are still times where she feels “triggered or angry or feel sad” about the scandal and press coverage. But the passage of time has helped her “shed a lot of that.” Lewinsky, now 51, looked back at the affair with Clinton and described it as an “abuse of power.” “The idea of being in a relationship with a 24-year-old is insane to me, on so many levels,” she said. Lewinsky also revealed to the outlet that she’s planning on using her voice to continue to inspire and encourage the masses. Her new podcast, “Reclaiming,” will provide guests an opportunity to talk with Lewinsky about an event that impacted their lives, and how they’ve reclaimed their identity “on their own terms.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Netanyahu Under Pressure To Extend Gaza Ceasefire As Hamas Releases Emaciated Hostages",
    "text": "MUGHRAQA, Gaza Strip (AP) — New details and growing shock over emaciated hostages renewed pressure Sunday on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend a fragile Gaza ceasefire beyond the first phase ending in three weeks. Talks on the second phase, meant to see more hostages released and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, were due to start Feb. 3. But Israel and Hamas appear to have made little progress, even as Israeli forces withdrew Sunday from a Gaza corridor in the latest commitment to the truce. Netanyahu sent a delegation to Qatar, a key mediator, but it included low-level officials, sparking speculation that it won’t lead to a breakthrough. Netanyahu, who returned after a U.S. visit to meet with President Donald Trump, is expected to convene security Cabinet ministers on Tuesday. Trump himself suggested he was losing patience with the deal after seeing the emaciated hostages released this week. “I watched the hostages come back today and they looked like Holocaust survivors. They were in horrible condition. They were emaciated. It looked like many years ago, the Holocaust survivors, and I don’t know how much longer we can take that,” he told reporters onboard Air Force One as he traveled to the Super Bowl on Sunday. “I know we have a deal where we’re supposed to get — they dribble in and keep dribbling in — but they are in really bad shape,” he said. “You know at some point, we’re going to lose our patience.” Trump also repeated his pledge to take control of the Gaza Strip. “I’m committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we’re committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn’t move back. There’s nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site. The remainder will be demolished,” he said. Trump said Arab nations would agree to take in Palestinians after speaking with him and insisted Palestinians would leave Gaza if they had a choice. “They don’t want to return to Gaza. If we could give them a home in a safer area — the only reason they’re talking about returning to Gaza is they don’t have an alternative. When they have an alternative, they don’t want to return to Gaza.” Israel has expressed openness to the idea — ”a revolutionary, creative vision,” Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday — while Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it. Egypt said it will host an emergency Arab summit on Feb. 27 to discuss the “new and dangerous developments.” Trump’s proposal has moral, legal and practical obstacles. It may have been proposed as a negotiation tactic to pressure Hamas or an opening gambit in discussions aimed at securing a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia condemned Netanyahu’s recent comment that Palestinians could create their state there, saying it aimed to divert attention from crimes committed by “the Israeli occupation against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are being subjected to.” Qatar called Netanyahu’s comment “provocative” and a blatant violation of international law. Families of remaining hostages said time is running out as some survivors described being barefoot and in chains. “We cannot let the hostages remain there. There is no other way. I am appealing to the cabinet,” said Ella Ben Ami, daughter of a hostage released Saturday, adding she now understands the toll of captivity is much worse than imagined. The father of a remaining hostage, Kobi Ohel, told Israel’s Channel 13 the newly released men said his son, Alon, and others “live off half a pita to a full pita a day. These are not human conditions.” Ohel’s mother, Idit, sobbed as she told Channel 12 her son has been chained for over a year. Michael Levy said his brother, the newly released Or Levy, had been barefoot and hungry for 16 months. “The decision-makers knew exactly what his condition was and what everyone else’s condition was, and they did not do enough to bring him back with the urgency that was needed,” he said. On Saturday, as Israelis reeled, former defense minister Yoav Gallant said on social media that the deterioration in hostages’ conditions was something “Israel has known about for some time.” The ceasefire that began on Jan. 19 has held, raising hopes that the 16-month war that led to seismic shifts in the Middle East may be headed toward an end. The latest step was Israel forces’ withdrawal from the 4-mile (6-kilometer) Netzarim corridor separating northern and southern Gaza, which was used as a military zone. No troops were seen in the vicinity Sunday. As the ceasefire began last month, Israel began allowing hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to cross Netzarim and return to the north. But the deal remains fragile. On Sunday, civil defense first responders in Gaza said Israeli fire killed three people east of Gaza City. Israel’s military noted “several hits” after firing warning shots and warned Palestinians against approaching its forces. Cars piled with belongings headed north. Under the deal, Israel should allow cars to cross Netzarim uninspected. Troops remain along Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt. Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the troops’ withdrawal showed the militant group had “forced the enemy to submit to our demands” and thwarted “Netanyahu’s illusion of achieving total victory.” Israel has said it won’t agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza until Hamas’ military and political capabilities are eliminated. Hamas says it won’t hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops. During the ceasefire’s 42-day first phase, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Israel has said Hamas confirmed that eight of the 33 are dead. Families of the hostages gathered in Tel Aviv to urge Netanyahu to extend the ceasefire, but he is also under pressure from far-right political allies to resume the war. Trump’s proposal for the U.S. to take control of the Gaza Strip may also complicate the situation. “They are dying there, so we need to finish this deal in a hurry,” said Ayala Metzger, daughter-in-law of hostage Yoram Metzger, who died in captivity. The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas’ attack that killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated. Violence has surged in the occupied West Bank during the war and intensified in recent days with an Israeli military operation against Palestinian militants in the territory’s north. On Sunday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said Israeli gunfire killed two women, one of them, Sundus Shalabi, eight months pregnant. It said Rahaf al-Ashqar, 21, was also killed. The shooting occurred in the Nur Shams urban refugee camp, a focal point of Israeli operations. Israel’s military said its police had opened an investigation. Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz on Sunday announced the expansion of the operation that started in Jenin several weeks ago. He said it was meant to prevent Iran — allied with Hamas — from establishing a foothold in the West Bank. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "New Orleans Saints Helped Church A Lot With Pedophile Priest Damage Control: AP",
    "text": "NEW ORLEANS — As New Orleans church leaders braced for the fallout from publishing a list of predatory Catholic priests, they turned to an unlikely ally: the front office of the city’s NFL franchise. What followed was a monthslong, crisis-communications blitz orchestrated by the New Orleans Saints’ president and other top team officials, according to hundreds of internal emails obtained by The Associated Press. The records, which the Saints and church had long sought to keep out of public view, reveal team executives played a more extensive role than previously known in a public relations campaign to mitigate fallout from the clergy sexual abuse crisis. The emails shed new light on the Saints’ foray into a fraught topic far from the gridiron, a behind-the-scenes effort driven by the team’s devoutly Catholic owner who has long enjoyed a close relationship with the city’s embattled archbishop. They also showed how various New Orleans institutions — from a sitting federal judge to the local media — rallied around church leaders at a critical moment. Among the key moments, as revealed in the Saints’ own emails: — Saints executives were so involved in the church’s damage control that a team spokesman briefed his boss on a 2018 call with the city’s top prosecutor hours before the church released a list of clergymen accused of abuse. The call, the spokesman said, “allowed us to take certain people off” the list. — Team officials were among the first people outside the church to view that list, a carefully curated, yet undercounted roster of suspected pedophiles. The disclosure of those names invited civil claims against the church and drew attention from federal and state law enforcement. — The team’s president, Dennis Lauscha, drafted more than a dozen questions that Archbishop Gregory Aymond should be prepared to answer as he faced reporters. — The Saints’ senior vice president of communications, Greg Bensel, provided fly-on-the-wall updates to Lauscha about local media interviews, suggesting church and team leaders were all on the same team. “He is doing well,” Bensel wrote as the archbishop told reporters the church was committed to addressing the crisis. “That is our message,” Bensel added, “that we will not stop here today.” The emails obtained by AP sharply undercut assurances the Saints gave fans about the public relations guidance five years ago when they asserted they had provided only “minimal” assistance to the church. The team went to court to keep its internal emails secret. “This is disgusting,” said state Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans. “As a New Orleans resident, taxpayer and Catholic, it doesn’t make any sense to me why the Saints would go to these lengths to protect grown men who raped children. All of them should have been just as horrified at the allegations.” The Saints told AP last week that the partnership is a thing of the past. The emails cover a yearlong period ending in July 2019, when they were subpoenaed by attorneys for victims of a priest later charged with raping an 8-year-old boy. In a lengthy statement, the team criticized the media for using “leaked emails for the purpose of misconstruing a well-intended effort.” “No member of the Saints organization condones or wants to cover up the abuse that occurred in the Archdiocese of New Orleans,” the team said. “That abuse occurred is a terrible fact.” The team’s response did little to quell the anger of survivors of clergy sexual abuse. “We felt betrayed by the organization,” said Kevin Bourgeois, a former Saints season ticket holder who was abused by a priest in the 1980s. “It forces me to question what other secrets are being withheld. I’m angry, hurt and re-traumatized again.” After the AP first reported on the alliance in early 2020, Saints owner Gayle Benson denied that anyone “associated with our organizations made recommendations or had input” on the list of pedophile priests. The Saints reiterated that denial in its statement Saturday, saying no Saints employees “had any responsibility for adding or removing any names from that list.” The team said that no employees offered “any input, suggestions or opinions as to who should be included or omitted from” the list. Leon Cannizzaro, the district attorney at the time, last week denied any role in shaping the credibly accused clergy list, echoing statements he made in 2020. He told AP he “absolutely had no involvement in removing any names from any list.” Cannizzaro said he did not know why the Saints’ spokesman would have reported he had been on a call related to the list. The emails, sent from Saints accounts, don’t specify which clergymen were removed from the list or why. They raise fresh questions, however, about the Saints’ role in a scandal that has taken on much larger legal and financial stakes since the team waded into it, potentially in violation of the NFL’s policy against conduct “detrimental to the league.” The outsized role of Saints executives could draw new attention from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who is scheduled to address reporters Monday as New Orleans prepares to host its 11th Super Bowl. Messages requesting comment were sent to the NFL. Taken together, the emails portray a coalescing of several New Orleans institutions. U.S. District Judge Jay Zainey, who was copied by the Saints on the public relations efforts, cheered Bensel on from his personal email account, thanking the team’s spokesman “for the wonderful advice.” A newspaper editor similarly thanked Bensel for getting involved. “You have hit all the points,” Zainey, a fellow Catholic, wrote in another email to Bensel, praising a lengthy note the Saints spokesman sent to local newspaper editors. “By his example and leadership, Archbishop Aymond, our shepherd, will continue to lead our Church in the right direction — helping us to learn and to rebuild from the mistakes of the past.” Zainey later struck down a Louisiana law, vigorously opposed by the church, that would have allowed victims to bring civil claims irrespective of how long ago the alleged sex abuse took place. He declined to comment. The list marked a watershed in heavily Catholic New Orleans — a long-awaited mea culpa to parishioners intended to usher in healing and local accountability. It came at a time when church leaders were seeking to retain public trust — and financial support — as they reckoned with generations of abuse and mounting litigation that eventually drove the Archdiocese of New Orleans into bankruptcy. That litigation, filed in 2020, involves more than 600 people who say they were abused by clergy. The case has produced a trove of still-secret church records said to document years of abuse claims and a pattern of church leaders transferring clergy without reporting their crimes to law enforcement. While it has since expanded, the list of accused priests was missing a number of clergy when it was originally released, an earlier AP investigation found. The AP identified 20 clergymen who had been accused in lawsuits or charged by law enforcement with child sexual abuse who were inexplicably omitted from the New Orleans list — including two who were charged and convicted of crimes. Still, the list has served as a roadmap for both the FBI and Louisiana State Police, which launched sweeping investigations into New Orleans church leaders’ shielding of predatory priests. Last spring, state police carried out a wide-ranging search warrant at the Archdiocese of New Orleans, seizing records that include communications with the Vatican. Since the Saints began assisting the archdiocese, at least seven current and former members of the local clergy have been charged with crimes ranging from rape to possession of child sexual abuse material. The extent of the abuse remained largely unknown in 2018, a year the Saints won nine consecutive games on the way to an NFC Championship appearance. As the church prepped for a media onslaught, Bensel carried out an aggressive public relations campaign in which he called in favors, prepared talking points and leaned on long-time media contacts to support the church through a “soon-to-be-messy” time. Far from freelancing, Bensel had the Saints’ backing and blessing through what he called a “Galileo moment,” suggesting Aymond would be a trailblazer in releasing a credibly accused clergy list at a critical time for the church. In emails to editorial boards, he warned against “casting a critical eye” on the archbishop “is neither beneficial nor right.” He urged the city’s newspapers to “work with” the church, reminding them the Saints and New Orleans Pelicans — the city’s NBA team, also owned by Benson — had been successful thanks, in part, to their support. “We did this because we had buy-in from YOU,” Bensel wrote to the editors of The Times-Picayune and New Orleans Advocate, “supporting our mission to be the best, to make New Orleans and everything within her bounds the best.” “We are sitting on that opportunity now with the Archdiocese of New Orleans,” he added. “We need to tell the story of how this Archbishop is leading us out of this mess.” Benson and Aymond, the archbishop, have been confidants for years. It was the archbishop who introduced Benson to her late husband, Tom Benson, who died in 2018, leaving his widow in control of New Orleans’ NFL and NBA franchises. The Bensons’ foundation has given tens of millions of dollars to the archdiocese and other Catholic causes. Along the way, Aymond has flown on the owner’s private jet and become almost a part of the team, frequently celebrating pregame Masses. When the clergy abuse allegations came to a head, Bensel, the Saints’ spokesman, worked his contacts in the local media to help shape the story. He had friendly email exchanges with a Times-Picayune columnist who praised the archbishop for releasing the clergy list. He also asked the newspaper’s leadership to keep their communications “confidential, not for publication nor to share with others.” His emails revealed that The Advocate – after Aymond privately complained to the publisher — removed a notice from one online article that had called for clergy abuse victims to reach out. Kevin Hall, president and publisher of Georges Media, which owns the newspaper, said the publication welcomes engagement from community leaders but that outreach “does not dilute our journalistic standards or keep us from pursuing the truth.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "New Study Reveals Parents Do Have A Favorite Child. Here's Who It Is.",
    "text": "When snow began to fall the other day, my children made a beeline outside to scoop it up and stomp around. Within minutes, they were chucking snowballs at one another, most of which disintegrated mid-flight and landed in a flurry on their faces and necks. There was a lot of delighted shrieking, punctuated every few minutes by an aggrieved howl of “No fair!” or “He hit me!” Both of my kids wanted to throw snow at their sibling. Neither wanted snow to land on their exposed skin. I stood there uselessly saying benign things like, “Gentle!” and “Not the face!” Finally, my 11-year-old daughter ran up to me to deliver an accusation: “Whenever I hit him, you say ‘Stop,’ but when he hits me, you say nothing!” I looked over at my 15-year-old son and raised my eyebrows to ask, “Does this sound familiar?” “You know what he says?” I told my daughter. “That when he hits you, I say ‘Stop,’ but when you hit him, I say nothing.” “Oh,” my daughter said, quietly assessing this predicament. Over the years, whether wielding snow or Nerf guns or water balloons, both of my children have regularly accused me of favoring their sibling over them. The problem with identifying favoritism is these shifting perspectives: the parent’s and each siblings’. None of us are unbiased, and we’re all predisposed to see ourselves as the aggrieved ones whenever confronted with criticism. With siblings, some degree of comparison is inevitable, and it’s hard not to show your relief when one kid is behaving by piling on the praise for the sibling who is doing their homework or brushing their teeth. I don’t feel like I’m showing favoritism to one kid, but that’s mostly because I’m so overwhelmed by the unique ways they are both trying my patience. While every family has their own particular dynamic, researchers have discovered that, in most families, favoritism actually follows a similar pattern. Researchers from Brigham Young University and Western University pulled from 30 peer-reviewed journal articles and dissertation/theses, along with 14 databases, for their meta-analysis of “parental differential treatment,” or the ways that parents treat siblings differently. They categorized parents’ actions into categories of “differential affection, differential conflict, differential resources — like how much time you spend with your kids or things that you give to them — as well as differential autonomy or freedom — like how much leeway you give kids,” Alex Jensen, one of the study’s authors, told HuffPost. A parent might show differential treatment by spending more time with one child, or spending more money on them, for example. The researchers examined how this differential treatment varied by the children’s birth order and gender, as well as their temperament and personality. While previous research has been mixed when it comes to favoritism and gender, this study found that “daughters tend to be favored, and that was across the board,” Jensen said. Both mothers and fathers tended to show differential treatment for daughters. Not surprisingly, “agreeable or conscientious children tend to be favored. That’s also across the board,” Jensen said. When it came to birth order, it was also no surprise to see that parents tended to grant first-born children more freedom and autonomy — these children are, after all, older than their siblings by definition. But this favoritism persisted into adulthood, Jensen said, well past the point when a parent would worry about a child’s ability to, say, go to the store on their own. It’s possible that some patterns, like relying on the competence of an eldest daughter, begin in childhood and continue throughout adulthood. Jensen thinks this could be one explanation for why parents tended to favor girls, noting that they have a reputation of being easier to manage, behavior-wise, than boys. “Maybe daughters are just a little bit easier to parent,” Jensen said, noting that if girls have fewer behavior problems than boys at school, it makes sense that a similar pattern would emerge at home. This seems more likely to him than another theoretical explanation: that parents treat daughters differently because they presume they will one day become the caregivers of their elderly parents. “From an evolutionary kind of standpoint, I guess that’s possible,” Jensen said, albeit less so than the theory that girls are simply “easier to parent.” The big question, of course, is why favoritism matters. Of all the things parents are supposed to be tending to, what are the consequences of letting favoritism go unchecked? Does it really matter if, once in a while, I avert my gaze the moment my daughter lobs a snowball at my son’s head? But like many other relationship dynamics in childhood, favoritism in a family can cast a long shadow. Children who are favored “tend to have better mental health, do better in school, have better family relationships. They’re less likely to engage in substance use than other teenagers. They get in less trouble at school and home,” Jensen said. Children who are not favored, on the other hand, are more likely to have negative outcomes. It’s possible, Jensen noted, that when favoritism goes to an extreme, even the favored child will suffer because of it — but it would be tricky to determine when that line is crossed in a particular family, let alone in the general population. While a family might fall into a pattern of favoring daughters, older siblings or children who are more conscientious (who wouldn’t want one of those?), there can also be a huge amount of variation over the years in the way that parents feel about their children. Dr. Blaise Aguirre, a psychiatrist who is a professor at Harvard Medical School and author of the forthcoming “I Hate Myself: Overcome Self-Hatred And Realize Why You’re Wrong About You,” told HuffPost, “people, just generally speaking, tend to feel closer to those who are temperamentally similar to who they are.” For example, if an emotionally intense child has a parent who is less so, “they just don’t understand how a child could be so reactive, and so it can be confusing,” Aguirre said. He added that parents tend to prefer easygoing children, the kind who don’t get calls home from the teacher. Aguirre also noted that a person’s parenting can change significantly between a first child and subsequent children. “These relationships are in constant states of flux,” he said. Infants, Aguirre noted, are sort of hard-wired to charm their parents in a way that protects their own survival. As children grow, however, some parent-pleasing behaviors can lead to comparisons among siblings and accusations of favoritism. In addition, “we tend to remember rejection far more than we remember praise,” Aguirre said. “If you’re getting equal amounts of praise and rejection, if you could actually measure 50% praise, 50% rejection, when your parents criticize you for your behavior, you’re going to remember that more.” Unless the praise is for a sibling. “You’ll remember your sibling’s positive praise, much more than you remember their rejection,” Aguirre said. As a parent, you can’t always control how your child recalls and interprets the things that you say or do. You can, however, listen with an open mind to any concerns your child has, whether they have to do with favoritism or something else. If a child says you’re playing favorites, Aguirre suggested that a parent say something like, “That’s just not my experience, but clearly, it’s yours. So, tell me: What is it that you see?” “Getting them to kind of understand their own state of mind and understand the state of mind of the parent,” and having them “name and label what their experience is,” Aguirre said, often has the effect of making a child feel less upset. Aguirre said that he would advise parents to talk with their children without delay about any feelings that arise. “Often the perception is in the mind of the child,” he said. “I think that the best thing to do is to sort of deal with it right away, lest it become ingrained in the child who sees themselves as less favorable, as being defective in some way.” A parent might ask a child to consider another’s perspective, like I did with my daughter, or reassure their child that they love them for what makes them unique, not how their math grades or musical talent compares to a sibling’s. Aguirre recalled one way that his mother cleverly eliminated the chance that any of her eight children might accuse her of favoritism. “When my mom was dying, we were all spending time with her. She said, could she have a chat with each of us individually? And so I went in there, and she says, ‘I’m just going to tell you, you’re my favorite.’” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Nicolas Cage Warns Of Dire Scenario Presented By AI: 'That Is A Dead End'",
    "text": "Nicolas Cage is urging Hollywood not to let artificial intelligence destroy the “truth of art.” The “Dream Scenario” star received a Saturn Award on Sunday for his performance in the satirical drama and delivered an impassioned acceptance speech after thanking writer-director Kristoffer Borgli for creating the “disturbing but hilarious” world of the 2023 film. “But there is another world that is also disturbing me,” Cage said at the podium, per Variety. “It’s happening right now around all of us: the new AI world. I am a big believer in not letting robots dream for us. Robots cannot reflect the human condition for us.” “That is a dead end if an actor lets one AI robot manipulate his or her performance even a little bit, an inch will eventually become a mile and all integrity, purity and truth of art will be replaced by financial interests only,” he continued. “We can’t let that happen.” Those words arrived shortly after Paul McCartney and Elton John criticized a U.K. copyright law that would allow companies to use their music to train AI models, or in John’s words to the Sunday Times, to “ride roughshod” over laws that “protect artists’ livelihoods.” The speech also followed substantial backlash against director Brady Corbet, who recently admitted using AI to refine Adrien Brody’s Hungarian dialogue in “The Brutalist.” The film was recently nominated for 10 Oscars, including a best actor nod for Brody. Cage previously confessed he’s “terrified” that artificial intelligence could “steal” his likeness after he dies, and argued Sunday that the consequences of standardizing its use to alter performance or replace artists would be devastating for human culture entirely.

    "title": "I'm The Parent Of A Nonbinary Kid. I'm Terrified What Trump's Plan For Schools Could Mean For Them.",
    "text": "When my 10-year-old nonbinary child began kindergarten at our local public school in 2019, my husband and I worried about how they would be received by teachers and classmates. We live in a progressive neighborhood, at least on the outside. Walking past the historic brownstones on the way to school, we might see rainbow flags and posters with the words, “It’s the Guns!” or simply, “Fuck Trump!” And yet, when we approached our child’s teacher and principal before the start of their kindergarten school year, we were told they were the first nonbinary child at the school. Thankfully, their teacher and school administrators were supportive of our child’s gender identity. Their teacher offered to read the books we provided to the school because they didn’t have any at the time. They also agreed to share them with the other teachers. One afternoon, when I arrived at pickup, their teacher stopped me at the door. “I wanted to tell you how great it went today when I introduced one of the books you gave us at story time,” she said. She told me how she had read aloud the pages of the illustrated picture book, “Who Are You: A Child’s Guide to Gender Identity.” “The kids seemed to just get it,” she added. A few months into the school year, I asked my child how they felt at school if someone referred to them as a boy or a girl. “Oh, I don’t have to say anything,” they told me. “My friends just tell them.” My child not only felt seen, they felt protected and loved among their peers. It was a great comfort to know we had people (of all ages) in our child’s corner. Now, more than ever before, I feel like we were one of the lucky ones. During those incredibly formative elementary school years, we were living under a much different landscape of tolerance for trans and nonbinary youth. The progress and acceptance that have marked my child’s school experience are now at risk of disappearing. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive action stating that the U.S. government will now recognize only two sexes, male and female. This was soon followed by an executive order that, among other actions, directs federal agencies and programs to significantly limit access to gender-affirming care for trans and nonbinary youth under the age of 19. As of Feb. 15, the order has been temporarily blocked by two federal judges, but some U.S. health care providers have preemptively stopped offering treatment for young trans patients. In addition, Trump issued an order specifically for America’s public schools. The executive order, titled “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,” attempts to uproot “gender ideology,” which Trump defines as the idea that “there is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one’s sex.” The order could keep schools that affirm and support students’ trans and nonbinary gender identities (for example, by allowing trans kids to participate in school sports) from receiving federal funding — which is especially essential for those in underserved or poor communities. I’m struggling to see what exactly is “radical” about public school education as it stands. There is currently no prescribed curriculum to teach gender diversity in U.S. public schools. In New York, schools are required to provide HIV/AIDS instruction, but sex education (including on gender identity) is left for individual school districts to decide. In the past, advocates have attempted to pass progressive sex education legislation, but this was brought to an abrupt halt in early 2020 in order to prioritize pandemic relief efforts. The New York City Department of Education currently operates under a set of best practices for supporting transgender and nonbinary students, titled “Guidelines to Support Transgender and Gender Expansive Students.” These guidelines include directing school staff to use gender-neutral language in all school communications and to provide access to restrooms consistent with a child’s gender identity. But the “curriculum” section of the guidelines is just 180 words and is vague at best. And now, what little support exists for trans and nonbinary kids in America’s schools is at risk of being thrown out altogether or becoming grounds for federal retaliation. If federal agencies move forward with implementing Trump’s orders to “file appropriate actions against K-12 teachers and school officials who violate the law,” merely using the term “nonbinary” to describe a minor could be grounds for legal action. While I’m grateful our child came out at school at a time when doing so was not as dangerous as it is under this new administration, I fear school will become an unwelcoming environment for my child and other students like them. Studies show that affirmation of one’s gender identity by others has major implications for mental health among trans youth. According to the Trevor Project, 42% of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year, including more than half of transgender and nonbinary youth. Affirming environments — such as supportive schools and communities — can reduce suicide risk by up to 50%. Recently, our school distributed a letter from our superintendent and members of our district’s school community, reinforcing the district’s commitment to “fostering an inclusive, equitable, and supportive environment for all students.” In the letter, the district states they will continue to follow the “Guidelines to Support Transgender and Gender Expansive Students” and to offer resources to make students feel affirmed and recognized, such as the “Hidden Voices” curriculum (which celebrates the contributions of LGBTQ+ and other marginalized individuals). I am heartened by messages like this and hope our community remains steadfast in resisting efforts to limit what schools can teach. For now, I’ve been protecting both of my children from the horrors of the news within reason. I try to summarize what’s going on because I don’t want them to live in the dark. When they have specific questions, I answer them clearly and simply, careful not to overexplain or make them feel overwhelmed or unprotected. But both my kids are painfully aware of how much intolerance can truly live in some people’s hearts. I’m doing what I can to stay ahead of things, like joining private groups on encrypted platforms with other parents like me. My child is not yet at a stage in development where we might consider puberty blockers, but I’m listening closely to what families with kids who have been receiving gender-affirming care are going through right now and taking detailed notes and screenshots on backup methods of obtaining these prescriptions. Parents like us are even trading ideas about where to move abroad. As the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors who fled their country because of persecution, it is impossible for me not to feel echoes of the past in the attempted limitations planned for trans and nonbinary Americans. For the parents of trans and nonbinary kids, it feels like the world is crashing down around us, and too few are fighting with us or on our behalf. Sadly, among my parent friends, this topic rarely comes up in conversation. Recently, a friend texted me to ask if friends and family members have been checking in with us to see how we are doing in the face of so much hate directed at families like ours. I hadn’t thought about it until they asked, but my heart sank when I tallied the numbers and typed back, “Only 2 people.” We cannot be complacent about the many ways Trump is attacking our children, and especially LGBTQ+ kids. Parents, caregivers and allies need to know just how much is at stake should these actions turn into law. Restricting civil rights is everyone’s problem. Today, the target is trans kids and adults, among other marginalized groups. Tomorrow, who knows? We need those who are concerned to reach out to the trans and nonbinary people in your community, to advocate for us in school board meetings, and to contact local representatives. I don’t have all the answers, but I know that I — and others like me — cannot do this alone. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "text": "If you were to ask me to sit at my desk with my feet flat on the floor for an entire workday, I simply could not. And neither could a lot of people, I would assume. In fact, I’ve quickly learned from TikTok that many sedentary workers love to sit cross-legged despite the common complaint that most office chairs are not created to allow for such positional flexibility. Many users on the app went nuts over an office chair that featured an extra-wide seat and no arm rests, allowing crossed-legged seating that’s incredibly comfortable. A quick search on Amazon would reveal that the retailer offers several office chair designs like the one on TikTok, as well as different versions that reviewers claim also allow them to sit “criss-cross applesauce.” We rounded up some of the best reviewed options of work chairs that encourage adaptive sitting in the list ahead. You’ll find standard executive chairs with flippable arm rests, “mediative chairs” that quite literally allow for sitting in every possible way under the sun and a fuzzy clamshell-style chair just like the one seen on TikTok.

In an episode of Monica Lewinsky’s podcast, “Reclaiming,” on Tuesday, the host and her guest discussed their struggles with anxiety over the years. “I was anxious, but I didn’t understand it was anxiousness,” Munn said. The pair agreed that “anxiety” wasn’t a word they encountered growing up, with Munn’s mother insisting on describing Munn’s worries as her being “stubborn.” Over time, Munn realized that an “underlying part” of who she is her strong reaction to “fairness and unfairness.” That prompted her to hint at a “traumatic” experience she had while filming. “There [were] other things that happened on this movie set personally that were really not OK,” Munn said. “I had to file complaints with the studio, and there’s a lot of other little things that go along with it, but it got to this place where I was offered a lot of money.” The “X-Men: Apocalypse” actor disclosed that she was offered “seven figures” to accept an apology. “It came along with an NDA,” she said, adding that she would have “never talked about it,” because she “wanted to move past it all.” However, Munn declined to sign the non-disclosure agreement, feeling the offer was deeply wrong. “This was like the reckoning — the Harvey Weinstein reckoning that began it all,” she continued. “This was that time period, and this was when people were targeting anyone who signed an NDA saying. ‘Oh, you only did it for the money,’ so I was afraid that my voice and speaking up would just reverse any kind of validity to my voice.” Munn expressed fears of retaliation if she signed the NDA and was “concerned” that it would hinder her ability to speak out against future injustices. So during a meeting with the studio, she turned to her lawyer and told him she was not accepting the offer — a move she attributed on Tuesday to her feistiness from childhood.

    "title": "Senate Confirms Pam Bondi As Attorney General",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate confirmed Pam Bondi as U.S. attorney general Tuesday evening, putting a longtime ally of Donald Trump at the helm of a Justice Department that has already been rattled by the firings of career employees seen as disloyal to the Republican president. The vote fell almost entirely along party lines, with only Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, joining with all Republicans to pass her confirmation 54-46. Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and corporate lobbyist, is expected to oversee a radical reshaping of the department that has been the target of Trump’s ire over the criminal cases it brought against him. She enters with the FBI, which she will oversee, in turmoil over the scrutiny of agents involved in investigations related to the president, who has made clear his desire to seek revenge on his perceived adversaries. Republicans have praised Bondi as a highly qualified leader they contend will bring much-needed change to a department they believe unfairly pursued Trump through investigations resulting in two indictments. “Pam Bondi has promised to get the department back to its core mission: prosecuting crime and protecting Americans from threats to their safety and their freedoms,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. But Bondi has faced intense scrutiny over her close relationship with the president, who during his term fired an FBI director who refused to pledge loyalty to him and forced out an attorney general who recused himself from the Justice Department’s investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign. While Bondi has sought to reassure Democrats that politics would play no part in her decision-making, she also refused at her confirmation hearing last month to rule out potential investigations into Trump’s adversaries. And she has repeated Trump’s claims that the prosecutions against him amounted to political persecution, saying the Justice Department “had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it’s got to stop.” Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., praised Bondi as “accomplished and competent” but said his “grave concern is really about President Trump and what he is clearly demanding.” “That clearly is a loyalty oath to him as opposed to a demand for straightforward, candid advice, including if the president is asking for something to be done like the prosecution of a political adversary,” Welch said. Bondi’s confirmation vote came just hours after FBI agents sued the Justice Department over efforts to develop a list of employees involved in the Jan. 6 prosecutions, which agents fear could be a precursor to mass firings. Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove last week ordered the acting FBI director to provide the names, titles and offices of all FBI employees who worked on the Jan. 6 cases — which Trump has described as a “grave national injustice.” Bove, who defended Trump in his criminal cases before joining the administration, said Justice Department officials would carry out a “review process to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary.” Justice Department officials have also recently forced out senior FBI executives, fired prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith’s team who investigated Trump and terminated a group of prosecutors in the D.C. U.S. attorney’s office who were hired to help with the massive Jan. 6 investigation. Bondi repeatedly stressed at her confirmation hearing that she would not pursue anyone for political reasons, and vowed that the public, not the president, would be her client. But her answers at times echoed Trump’s campaign rhetoric about a politicized justice system. “They targeted Donald Trump,” Bondi told lawmakers. “They went after him — actually starting back in 2016, they targeted his campaign. They have launched countless investigations against him.” She added, “If I am attorney general, I will not politicize that office.” Trump nominated Bondi for attorney general after it became clear that his initial pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, could not win enough support from Republican senators to be confirmed. Bondi has been a fixture in Trump’s orbit for years, and a regular defender of the president-elect on news programs amid his legal woes. In a 2023 Fox News appearance, she suggested that “bad” Justice Department prosecutors would be investigated under the Trump administration. “The investigators will be investigated,” she said. Smith has said politics played no part in his decisions and the evidence his team gathered was sufficient for Trump to have been convicted at trial on charges of scheming to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Smith dropped that case and a separate one charging Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, after Trump’s election win in November, citing longstanding Justice Department policy prohibiting criminal cases against a sitting president.

    "title": "I Couldn’t Stop Yelling At My Kids. Then I Uncovered Something Surprising From My Childhood That Was Causing It.",
    "text": "I’m standing in my kitchen chopping garlic when my 2-year-old shouts for more cheese crackers. The timer on the oven beeps at me to flip the fish sticks when I hear a loud wail from the living room. My middle son has hit my oldest, and now they’re both clamoring for me in tears. “What happened now?” I bellow, my nerve endings frazzled from the exhaustion of being a mom to three kids ages 5 and under while pregnant with my fourth. “Come on, guys! I’m trying to cook dinner. Why can’t we just play nicely?” Rather than respond with care and empathy for my child who got hurt, I feel like a volcano has erupted right there in the kitchen. Suddenly I’m burning to yell at everyone for everything. I take a huge breath in and hug my son. I direct a dirty glare toward my other kid but eventually hug him, too, and ask that the kids talk about and apologize for what happened. Then I immediately feel ashamed of my overblown reaction. They’re just kids, and everyone is OK. The thing is, this incident was par for my parenting. Everyday moments used to catapult me into a fit of rage: a cup of spilled juice, a splotch of marker on the ottoman, running a few minutes late to a social event. I would yell at my kids and shame them for little things, things that all kids do. I knew that what I was doing wasn’t great, and I knew it was probably harming my kids. But I didn’t know how to break the cycle. I searched for answers, following social media accounts of well-known child psychologists and parenting experts, like Becky Kennedy (who gives phenomenal advice, by the way). I tried being more patient and empathetic with my kids, and it worked — to a degree. But there was still something inside of me that caused me to unleash on my kids at a moment’s notice. I’d then feel shame, apologize, and the cycle would repeat. I didn’t want to be a rage-filled, yelling, anxious mom. What was my problem? I had seen talk therapists and cognitive behavioral therapists in the past when I went through a breakup or needed help communicating better with my husband. But after continued struggles as a mother, I knew I needed to dig deeper. Oddly enough, my mom had told me about her recent experience of seeing an EMDR therapist to work through traumatic memories from her childhood and how she felt freer, better than she ever had. In fact, she said she wished she had gone 30 years ago and told me that she and my dad would give me some money for it so I could experience the mental and emotional freedom that they had. Little did I know, I would exceed their gift and keep going to my therapist every other week for three years, spending over $4,000 out of pocket. I signed up to see an EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) and IFS (internal family systems) therapist. EMDR is a psychotherapy technique that helps you reprocess traumatic memories to reduce the level of disturbance within your mind and body. During EMDR sessions, I would recall difficult core memories while I moved my eyes side to side. Over time, the memories that haunted me (and the memories I never knew existed that were underlying) became less potent and my anxiety less frequent. IFS psychotherapy involved seeing that I — and every human being — is made of multiple parts. Working within this model, I learned how to identify, accept and heal my younger parts, and create more harmony within myself. Digging into childhood memories to heal myself as a mother sounded a bit “woo woo” and far-fetched, but week by week, the internal work fundamentally changed how I lived and parented. Across three years in therapy, I discovered that most of the incidents that triggered me in parenting were reminders of the past. I was surprised to uncover this because I had a “good” childhood. We always had a roof over our heads. My parents were generous (after all, they even paid for some of my therapy) and, like so many parents, did the best they knew how for their kids. They weren’t alcoholics or abusive. But some things I now realize I could have benefited from, like more emotional attuning and opportunities to speak my own voice. At first I was angry at my parents for all the things they had done or not done. And sure, anger is part of the healing process. But what was most transformative was focusing on how to notice when a younger, emotional part of me was being triggered by my own children. Session after session, I sat on my therapist’s couch to talk about what was challenging me: spills, messes, running late, noises, a daughter who was loud and independent. Rather than handing out a list of coping skills, my therapist taught me how to notice when my body was being triggered by the past. When my daughter shouted and resisted, a younger part of me remembered when I wasn’t allowed to speak up or balk at parental instruction. When my sons fought, it reminded me of when my tears and feelings were suppressed. When I’m running late, my body goes on high alert, remembering the pressure I felt to get out of the door as a kid. My therapist told me that I had to learn to notice when something in my body changed, like a tenseness in my chest, a pause in my breath, my hands forming fists and shaking in the air. When those bodily manifestations begin, that’s my signal. That’s when I know I’m about to go off, rage or shame or yell. That’s when I know something is bubbling up from my past, something that keeps me from being present in the moment. If I do nothing, my body gets hijacked, and I respond with an emotional outburst instead of peace and calm. So now that’s my daily work: noticing what’s happening in my body and when a younger part of me seems to be flaring up. Sometimes that means I picture my 5-year-old self in the room with me now, seeing her tiny face and golden blond hair. I might say hi to her and tell her that she’s safe now and she’s not that little girl anymore. She is strong and capable. The practice of seeing and talking to “little me” might sound trippy, and it certainly feels that way at times, but with practice, it works. My therapist also told me I needed to get present in those triggering moments. Luckily, there are a few simple ways I can do that. I can rock my feet against the floor, pressing down on the hardwood from my ankle to my toes. I can glance at the wedding ring on my finger or the wrinkles on my hand to remind myself that I’m 37 now and married with four kids. I can look around the room and describe objects out loud, like the framed photo of the six of us at the beach or the thriving monstera plant sitting in the yellow pot. I can take a breath (not necessarily even a deep one) to find myself in my current adult body. When I ground myself in the present (which, let’s be honest, isn’t easy to do when I’m overstimulated and exhausted), I can slow down the moment, almost as if I’m bending time. The slowness creates an opening, a chance to think before I respond to one of the kids. Like a bit of $4,000 magic, I can answer my daughter with more patience, give her a chance to speak her mind or cry in my arms. More than anything, I have more agency over my emotions and the inevitable triggers of parenthood. I feel more connected and grounded, and attuned to my kids. I’m calmer, less anxious, less reactive and explosive. Rather than yelling or shaming my kids when they spill their cereal, I’m more likely to say, “We can clean that up!” Rather than running myself ragged, answering everyone’s needs, I’m more likely to notice when I need a break. Stepping away for a few moments prevents me from saying or doing something I’ll regret. I still mess up. I still say things to my kids I shouldn’t. I still raise my voice sometimes. But far less than I used to, which I believe my kids have noticed. They laugh more. They’re more at ease, less scared I’m going to go off on them. They seem more confident, too, and able to express their feelings. I’ll overhear one of the kids sharing how they feel sad or hurt as they work out the issue with their sibling. I watch in awe as my son asks for space when he’s frustrated. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "How Period Underwear Work And The Best Ones, According To Reviews",
    "text": "Many people have been making the economic switch from single-use period products to reusable menstrual items. Among these popular alternatives: period underwear. If you’ve never tried period underwear before, the idea of simply free-bleeding into an undergarment may seem counterintuitive and possibly terrifying. How is a thin piece of fabric supposed to absorb everything, keep you feeling dry and comfortable and also preventing odor? The inner workings of most, if not all period panties, are fairly simple. According to many brands, the stain-proof gusset section is typically enforced with multiple layers of a unique technical fabric that absorbs and holds liquid, while the top layer is constructed of moisture-wicking filaments to make the underwear feel instantly dry and eliminate any unpleasant smell, all while feeling and moving just like regular underwear. If you’re now imagining a swirling sea of red come laundry time, it turns out period underwear care is pretty low maintenance and much more sanitary than you would think. Many reviewers and underwear care guides recommend giving the panties a quick rinse before tossing them in the washing machine with cold water and mild laundry detergent, then leaving them to air dry. It’s important to note that period underwear companies offer a range of absorbency levels in their panties and briefs, so you should find an option that meets your anatomy and flow needs. In the list below, you can find period underwear in a variety of styles, absorbency levels and price points that can be great for anything from backup leak insurance to first-in-line period protection.

I have a rather heavy flow for the first three days of my cycle so for these to not only keep me feeling dry when they’re full of blood but to also not even leak through onto my clothes or my bedding well they get a full five stars from me. There was no gross smell from blood just sitting in them.” – Monique Proulx Masters This pair of hip-hugging underwear by Thinx is made with the same breathable and moisture-wicking cotton as most of the brand’s panties and can absorb up to 12 tampons' worth of fluid without feeling bulky. They feature a lower-rise fit, a comfort-stretch band and a four-layer gusset that promises leak protection for up to 12 hours.Promising Thinx review: “I've tried a number of brands of period underwear, but this specific style of Thinx is the absolute best.

    "title": "Philadelphia Eagles Soar Over Chiefs In Decisive Super Bowl Victory",
    "text": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Yo Philly: Jalen Hurts and Nick Sirianni are world champions. A ferocious Philadelphia Eagles defense tormented and frustrated Patrick Mahomes while Hurts made all the plays the offense needed. So much for the Kansas City Chiefs’ quest for a Super Bowl three-peat. It wasn’t even close. Cooper DeJean got a pick-6 on his 22nd birthday, Josh Sweat pressured Mahomes all night and the Eagles routed the Chiefs 40-22 on Sunday to secure the franchise’s second Super Bowl championship. Hurts threw for two touchdowns and ran for a score on a tush push to earn Super Bowl MVP honors, and Vic Fangio’s defense was so dominant that the Eagles didn’t need much from Saquon Barkley. The game-changing running back finished with 57 yards, breaking Terrell Davis’ record for yards rushing in a season, playoffs included. Hurts threw for 221 yards. “This is the ultimate team game. You can’t be great without the greatness of others. Great performance by everybody — offense, defense, special teams,” Sirianni said. “We didn’t really ever care what anyone thought about how we won, or their opinions. All we want to do is win.” Hurts has been doubted since he started for Alabama in a national championship game and was benched for Tua Tagovailoa at halftime. Finishing second to Mahomes in MVP voting two years ago didn’t quite silence all the detractors. Now, he’s hoisted the Vince Lombardi trophy. Sirianni, who mocked fans chanting “Fire Nick!” during a victory over Cleveland in October and was called a “clown” on national television, also quieted critics by adding a championship ring to a coaching resume that includes the fifth-best winning percentage in league history. “Things come right on time. The last time around, it wasn’t our time, it wasn’t my time and sometimes you have to accept that you have to wait your turn,” said Hurts, who nearly led the Eagles to victory against the Chiefs two years ago in Arizona. With Donald Trump becoming the first president in office to attend a Super Bowl, the Eagles outplayed Kansas City in every facet, delighting a raucous pro-Philly crowd that celebrated each score with a familiar rendition of “Fly! Eagles! Fly!” Even Taylor Swift’s presence couldn’t help the Chiefs. They lost for the first time in 10 games this season with the pop superstar in a suite watching boyfriend Travis Kelce, who didn’t catch a pass until late in the third quarter. Not in Kansas City’s worst nightmares could its fans have imagined such a lackluster performance. The Chiefs had won three of the previous five Super Bowls, losing 31-9 to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers four years ago. Mahomes was 8-0 against Fangio’s defenses before the longtime coordinator and former Broncos head coach outcoached Andy Reid, capping his first season with his hometown team. Reid fell to 3-3 in Super Bowls, including a loss with the Eagles. The Eagles sacked Mahomes six times, the most of his career, including 2 1/2 by Sweat and two by Milton Williams. And they did it without Fangio calling a single blitz. “Defense wins championships,” Hurts said. “We saw how they played today. We saw the difference they made in the game. They gave us opportunities, gave us short fields. And we’re able to do what we do.” Barkley, the 2024 AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year, only had 31 yards rushing in the first half when Philly built a 24-0 lead. The Chiefs were aiming to become the third team in NFL history to win three straight championships and the first to three-peat in the Super Bowl era. Two years ago, Mahomes led a comeback and Harrison Butker kicked the game-winning field goal in the final minute for a 38-35 victory over the Eagles. Mahomes rallied Kansas City to an overtime victory over San Francisco last year. “That’s a great football team and we had to come out and play our best, and we did,” Sirianni said. This time, a revamped Philly defense featuring eight new starters from the 2022 team made sure Mahomes had no chance to pull off his magic. Sirianni was showered with Gatorade with nearly three minutes left in the game while backup QB Kenny Pickett took snaps in mop-up duty. “Today was a rough day all around. Nothing went right. I didn’t coach well. Proud of our guys for fighting. We will learn from this,” Reid said. “Too many turnovers, too many penalties. Against a good football team, can’t do that.” Barkley helped push Hurts into the end zone from the 1 to give Philadelphia a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. Up 10-0 after Jake Elliott’s 48-yard field goal, Sweat and Jalyx Hunt sacked Mahomes on consecutive plays. Mahomes then rolled out and made an errant throw that was picked by DeJean, who returned it 38 yards for a 17-0 lead. “When you have a great line up front ... makes it easier on the back end, and when they take the run away, it allows us to get the pass rush going,” DeJean said. It was Mahomes’ first pick-6 in 21 career playoff games and ended a streak of 297 straight passes without an interception. “We didn’t start how we wanted to. The turnovers hurt. I take all the blame for that,” Mahomes said. All-Pro linebacker Zack Baun picked Mahomes again late in the second quarter, and Hurts connected with A.J. Brown on a 12-yard TD pass for a 24-0 lead. Hurts threw a perfect 46-yard TD pass to DeVonta Smith to make it 34-0 late in the third. Mahomes fired a 24-yard TD pass to Xavier Worthy to avoid the shutout, but the 2-point conversion failed. He threw two late, mostly meaningless TD passes, one to DeAndre Hopkins and another to Worthy. After two weeks of discussions about questionable calls that led to public perception that officials favor the Chiefs — a theory NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called “ridiculous” — the first penalty of the game only fueled critics. A 32-yard pass from Hurts to Brown to the Chiefs 18 on fourth-and-2 was negated by a penalty for offensive pass interference. Brady, now a Fox analyst, and officiating analyst Mike Pereira both disagreed with the call, although Brown shoved Trent McDuffie’s facemask. On the next possession, the Eagles benefited from an unnecessary roughness penalty on McDuffie against Dallas Goedert following an incomplete pass on third-and-5. Hurts then connected with Jahan Dotson on a 27-yard pass to the 1 and scored on the next play. Hurts’ streak of 217 passes without a pick ended in the first half when he was intercepted deep in Kansas City territory, but the Chiefs didn’t capitalize. The Green Bay Packers are the only NFL team to win three championships in a row, doing it from 1929-31 and 1965-67. The NBA’s Los Angeles Lakers from 2000-02, led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neill, are the last team in the major American professional leagues to win three straight titles.

    "title": "The Pope Slept Peacefully, Had Breakfast After Pneumonia Diagnosis, Vatican Says",
    "text": "ROME (AP) — Pope Francis slept well, got out of bed and ate breakfast Wednesday, the Vatican said, after tests confirmed the 88-year-old pontiff had developed pneumonia in both lungs in a further complication that raised concerns about his ability to fight off the infection. In an early update Wednesday morning, the Vatican said Francis spent his fifth night in Rome’s Gemelli hospital peacefully. “He had a tranquil night, woke up and had breakfast,” spokesman Matteo Bruni said. The Vatican on Tuesday said tests confirmed the pneumonia in both lungs and that respiratory infection also involves asthmatic bronchitis, which requires the use of cortisone antibiotic treatment. “Laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the Holy Father’s clinical condition continue to present a complex picture,” the Vatican said. Nevertheless the pope, who had the upper lobe of his right lung removed as a young man, is in good spirits and is grateful for the prayers for his recovery, Bruni said. On Wednesday, Francis’ vicar for Rome urged all the faithful to devote an hour of silent prayer before evening vespers services. Francis was admitted to the Gemelli hospital in a “fair” condition on Friday after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. On Monday, medical personnel determined that he was suffering from a polymicrobial respiratory tract infection, meaning a mix of viruses, bacteria and possibly other organisms had colonized in his respiratory tract. “The follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon ... demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy,” Bruni said Tuesday. Bronchitis can lead to pneumonia, which is a deeper and far more serious infection of the lungs’ air sacs. Pneumonia can develop in part of one lung or an entire lung or both lungs. It tends to be more serious when both lungs are affected because there isn’t healthy lung tissue to compensate. Treatment varies by severity but can include providing oxygen through a nasal tube or mask, intravenous fluids — and treatment of the underlying cause of the infection. To date, Francis is breathing on his own, has eaten breakfast every day, gotten out of bed, read the newspapers and done some work from his hospital room. The Vatican hasn’t provided any information about how Francis is responding to any of the drugs he has been given other than to say he isn’t running a fever. Dr. Carmelo D’Asero, an infectious disease and geriatric disease expert in Rome, said Francis’ lack of a fever was not necessarily a positive thing, given the seriousness of his infection. “A high fever is a sign of an immune response to a pathogen,” he said. “Having a low fever and having a serious bronchial infection ... is a sign of a decreased immune response and that makes us worry a little bit more, let’s say. Maybe if he had a fever, it would have been better.” The Vatican has given no indication of how long the pope might remain hospitalized, only saying that the treatment of such a “complex clinical picture,” which has already required several changes in his drug regimen, would require an “adequate” stay. Despite the less than positive news about Francis’ condition, a rainbow appeared over the Gemelli hospital on Tuesday afternoon and Francis received get-well drawings and cards from children being treated in the hospital’s oncology ward.

    "title": "Prince William's Former Aide Opens Up About 'Lowest' He's Ever Seen The Royal",
    "text": "A former aide and adviser to Prince William has opened up about the exceedingly difficult time the Wales family had last year. “Within a couple of weeks, if you’re Prince William, you find out that both your wife and your father have cancer,” Jason Knauf told “60 Minutes Australia” in a new interview released Sunday. “I couldn’t believe it.” When the interviewer asked about Knauf’s own phone call with William after Kate’s shock diagnosis, the former adviser called it “awful ― absolutely awful.” “It’s the lowest I’ve ever seen him,” Knauf said, before explaining that “the problem was that all this crazy sort of conspiracy theory stuff kicked off in the background, online. ‘Was she really ill?’” “But [William and Kate] didn’t want to say yet that she had cancer because they hadn’t told the children, and they were still working through how to tell the children,” he said. Knauf began his work with the royal household in 2015, serving as communications secretary for the then-Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry in 2015 before rotating through several influential roles. Knauf’s tenure is perhaps most widely recognized for his involvement in the bullying allegations leveled against Meghan Markle during her time within the royal family. Kate did eventually reveal her cancer diagnosis to the world in March 2024, just before her children went on Easter break and were out of school and therefore slightly shielded from the media circus. King Charles announced he had cancer a month prior after undergoing prostate surgery. Neither royal has released details about the type of cancer. The Princess of Wales let followers know in September that she had completed chemotherapy treatment. Earlier this year, she said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, that her cancer was in remission.

    "title": "Public Health Physician Schools Ex-RNC Spox With The 'Hardcore Truth' For Trump",
    "text": "A public health physician put President Donald Trump’s administration on blast on Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House looks to fire thousands of federal health workers. “When you gut the very teams, scientists, physicians, leaders who have been trained, who have studied, who have lived experience ... so that we are not unable to neutralize threats, you only proliferate threats in the United States and you proliferate those threats abroad,” said Dr. Chris T. Pernell on “CNN NewsNight” with Abby Phillip. “This is not pseudoscience. This is not conjecture. This is not imagination. This is hardcore truth.” The report notes that — on top of slashing jobs at the Department of Health and Human Services — the White House is preparing an executive order that would also call for the Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other health agencies to make cuts. Pernell, the regent-at-large for the American College of Preventive Medicine and director of the NAACP Center for Health Equity, declared that the Trump administration didn’t learn its “lessons” following the COVID-19 pandemic. She said there are now “proliferating” threats to public health in the president’s second term. Former Republican National Committee spokesperson Madison Gesiotto, in her appearance on the CNN panel, cited declining trust in public health officials, prompting Pernell to question her argument. It led to a heated clash between the two. “I think there’s legitimate questions as to whether we can trust the so-called experts, and I think people across the country feel this sentiment,” argued Gesiotto, adding that she’s not saying “doctors are bad or every expert is bad.” She continued, “But I think those are legitimate questions because we were told this vaccine is safe, this will stop the spread of COVID and then they evolved into saying it’s not going to stop —.” Moments later, Pernell called out Gesiotto over her “misinformation” as she noted that both her father and cousins died as a result of pandemic, adding that she volunteered for a vaccine trial and her sister was a “long COVID survivor.” The two clamored to speak over one another before Pernell pointed to the White House’s “fundamental lack of understanding” when it comes to public health.

    "title": "Rachel Maddow Savages MSNBC In Fearless Biting Of Hand That Feeds Her",
    "text": "MSBNC host Rachel Maddow shredded her network Monday for its “bad mistake” in canceling colleague Joy Reid’s show and “indefensible” removal of “non-white” hosts in or around prime time. (Watch the video below.) Reid, who is Black, is departing the news network, while Alex Wagner, who is of Burmese descent, will reportedly be reassigned. Maddow sounded off on the personnel moves after she and other colleagues said goodbye to Reid. “I have so much more to learn from her,” Maddow said. “I do not want to lose her as a colleague here at MSNBC, and personally, I think it is a bad mistake to let her walk out the door. It is not my call, and I understand that. But that’s what I think.” Maddow continued, “It is also unnerving to see that on a network where we’ve got two ― count them ― two non-white hosts in primetime, both of our non-white hosts in primetime are losing their shows, as is Katie Phang on the weekend. And that feels worse than bad, no matter who replaces them. That feels indefensible. And I do not defend it.” She then scolded her employer for the job loss of behind-the-scenes staff who would have to reapply for positions within the company. “That has never happened at this scale in this way before when it comes to programming changes, presumably because it’s not the right way to treat people,” she said. “And it’s inefficient and it’s unnecessary, and it kind of drops the bottom out of whether or not people feel like this is a good place to work.” Wow.

    "title": "Man Dies Just Days After Pleading Guilty In Shooting Of Black Teen Who Rang Wrong Doorbell",
    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — An 86-year-old Kansas City man has died just days after pleading guilty to a lesser charge in the 2023 shooting of Ralph Yarl, a Black honor student who rang the white man’s doorbell by mistake, prosecutors announced Wednesday. Andrew Lester was charged with first-degree assault and armed criminal action in the shooting of the then-16-year-old, who survived and is now a freshman at Texas A&M. Before his trial was scheduled to begin, he pleaded guilty Friday to a lesser charge of second-degree assault, which carries up to seven years behind bars. He was scheduled to be sentenced on March 7. Cher Congour, a spokeswoman for the Clay County prosecutor’s office, said Lester’s attorney called the office and the court, and informed them of his death. “We have learned of the passing of Andrew Lester and extend our sincere condolences to his family during this difficult time,” the prosecutor’s office said in a news release. “While the legal proceedings have now concluded, we acknowledge that Mr. Lester did take responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty in this case.” The news release offered no cause of death. The case shocked the country and renewed national debate about gun policies and race in the U.S. Yarl showed up on Lester’s doorstep on the night of April 13, 2023, after he mixed up the streets where he was supposed to pick up his twin siblings. Lester’s attorney, Steve Salmon, had argued that Lester was acting in self-defense and that he was terrified by the stranger who knocked on his door as he settled into bed. Authorities say Lester shot Yarl twice: first in the head, then in the arm. Yarl testified at a hearing that he rang the bell and then waited for someone to answer for what seemed “longer than normal.” As the inner door opened, Yarl said, he reached out to grab the storm door, assuming he was at his brothers’ friends’ parents. He said Lester shot him in the head and uttered, “Don’t come here ever again.” Although the bullet didn’t penetrate Yarl’s brain, the impact knocked him to the ground. Yarl said Lester then shot him in the arm. The teen was taken to the hospital and released three days later. His family said the shooting took a big emotional toll and they had filed a lawsuit against the retired aircraft mechanic. “Now, another Black child harmed by prejudice will never see the man who shot him face the full weight of the justice system. While Lester finally admitted guilt, it came at the very last moment—after two years of stalling. That delay leaves our family reeling,” Yarl’s family said in a written statement Wednesday. Salmon said last year that Lester’s physical and mental condition had deteriorated. He said Lester had heart issues, a broken hip and had been hospitalized. Lester also lost 50 pounds (23 kilograms), which Salmon blamed on the stress of intense media coverage and death threats he subsequently received. During Friday’s hearing, the judge asked Lester whether he was in poor health. Lester responded yes. “Ralph is doing his best to be okay,” a spokesperson for the family said in a text. A judge had previously ordered a mental evaluation of Lester but allowed for the trial to proceed after its completion. The results of that evaluation were not released publicly.

    "title": "Republicans Just Can't Seem To Condemn Trump's Policy Shift Toward Putin",
    "text": "Republican lawmakers and officials, some of whom are otherwise vocal in their opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin, continue to avoid condemning President Donald Trump’s recent hostile rhetoric toward Ukraine and the besieged country’s leader. Over the past week, the president has become increasingly sympathetic toward Russia, which invaded neighboring Ukraine almost four years ago. On Saturday, Trump repeatedly lied about the war to right-wing attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference, falsely claiming that the U.S. has provided more military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine than Western Europe, and painting Kyiv as the reason the war has not yet ended. Now, GOP officials who have spoken out against Russia and supported the U.S. backing of Ukraine are trying to balance those existing positions while remaining loyal to Trump, who has a history of trying to gain favor with Putin. Just last week, Sen. Roger Wicker (Miss.) called Putin a “war criminal” who should “be in jail for the rest of his life,” Sen. John Kennedy (La.) said he “makes Jeffrey Dahmer look like Mother Theresa,” and Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) called him “a cancer and the greatest threat to democracy.” All three senators did not mention Trump by name. “I think the president has been very critical of Putin, and I’m not sitting here defending Putin. Putin is not a good guy. At the same time, that’s up to the Russian people. That’s not up to us to make that decision,” Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. Putin has not held free and fair elections in Russia for decades, and is known for imprisoning his critics. Mullin did not provide an example of Trump criticizing the Russian autocrat. “I will reiterate: Vladimir Putin is a vile dictator and thug, and he is clearly responsible for the war in Ukraine,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), who serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee, told ABC’s “This Week.” “Russia, China and Iran have been working in a coordinated effort to undermine and destabilize the United States, Europe, Israel and the free world,” he continued. “They are not our allies or our friends, and we must be clear-eyed about that.” The Trump administration has been negotiating a peace deal with Russia to end the war, initially without including Ukraine. Instead, Trump demanded that Ukraine give the U.S. $500 billion worth of profits from the former Soviet republic’s rare earth minerals, as compensation for the aid Kyiv receives to defend itself against Russia. “We’re going to undercut the Ukrainians... Oh, and by the way, we’re going to get their precious minerals at the bargain rate prices as a threat to do even worse,” Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who is part of the Armed Services Committee, told ABC’s “This Week.” “This is not a statesman or a diplomat,” he continued. “This is just someone who admires Putin, does not believe in the struggle of the Ukrainians and is committed to cozying up to an autocrat.” “Essentially, this is the President Trump surrendering to the Russians … This is not a statesman or a diplomat. This is just someone who admires Putin.” Democratic Sen. Jack Reed decries Pres. Trump's recent verbal attacks on Ukrainian Pres. Zelenskyy. https://t.co/RMqaMBfrbg pic.twitter.com/68VGIihI6Y When Zelenskyy initially declined the offer ― citing that it does not give the security guarantees Kyiv needs ― Trump responded with public attacks. The Republican described the Ukrainian leader as a “dictator,” accused him of starting the war in the first place, called for new elections in Kyiv, took the country’s potential NATO membership off the table, and said that Ukraine will unlikely be able to reclaim the parts of its territory seized by Russia. “The war didn’t need to happen. It was provoked,” Steve Witkoff, U.S. special envoy to the Mideast, told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “It doesn’t necessarily mean it was provoked by the Russians. There were all kinds of conversations back then about Ukraine joining NATO. The president has spoken about this, that didn’t need to happen. It basically became a threat to the Russians.” Lawler said that while he does not agree with Trump’s characterization of Zelenskyy, he hopes that the Ukrainian leader would understand that, essentially, he would have to bow his head to Trump and cooperate if he wants to keep receiving U.S. assistance. The congressman also excused the Trump administration’s discussion with Russia over a possible deal, saying that no agreement can logically be made without bringing Moscow to the table. “I have been very clear in my support for Ukraine,” Lawler said. “But this kind of back and forth, saying that the president is falling for Russian disinformation, does not help his cause for sure.” At a forum of government officials in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said Sunday that considering foreign as a debt to be repaid would set a dangerous precedent, and that the minerals proposal has been taken off the negotiating table. Witkoff said he expects a peace deal to be signed this week. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

The leader said he would give up his presidency if it meant Ukraine would have NATO protection. “What we have to do is keep the pressure on, and then go into negotiations ― negotiations that will include the Ukrainians, not exclude them,” Reed said. “And then with this pressure hopefully, Putin will decide that the cost is too great to continue this effort. It’s a tough, tough road to go, but it’s a better one than conceding and watching the destruction of Ukraine.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "RFK Jr., America's Loudest Anti-Vaxxer, Confirmed As Health Secretary",
    "text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the notorious vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist who experts warn will sabotage public health efforts worldwide, has been confirmed as President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. The chamber confirmed Kennedy by a vote of 52-48 largely along party lines. Former longtime Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a childhood polio survivor, was the only member of his party to vote against Trump’s pick. Kennedy, an “unfathomable” nominee in the eyes of public health experts, has questioned the link between HIV and AIDS, tied gay and transgender identities to chemical exposure, pushed to remove fluoride from drinking water, suggested COVID-19 was genetically engineered to target certain races, claimed Black people may have different immune systems and suggested anti-depressants are more addictive than opioids and are linked to school shootings. But he’s perhaps best known for the misinformation he’s spread about vaccines. He’s said they aren’t tested enough — something experts dispute — and has suggested vaccine trials that would be ethically dubious, potentially requiring children to go without protection against severe disease. He’s also falsely linked vaccines to autism. When given the chance to walk that claim back during his confirmation hearing, he refused. Justifying his vote, McConnell said in a statement that over his lifetime, he has “watched vaccines save millions of lives from devastating diseases across America and around the world.” “I will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures, and neither will millions of Americans who credit their survival and quality of life to scientific miracles,” he said. Now that Kennedy has been confirmed, he’ll have multiple avenues to curtail vaccine access and uptake, including by revising government vaccine advisories, abolishing the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, requiring additional post-market studies on vaccines, sowing public distrust in immunization and weakening legal protections for vaccine makers. Trump has suggested he’ll let Kennedy do whatever he wants with American health guidelines. “I’m going to let him go wild on health. I’m going to let him go wild on the food. I’m going to let him go wild on the medicines,” Trump said at a campaign rally in October. In 2023, when Kennedy was still a candidate for president, he said at an anti-vaccine conference that with him in charge, the country would “give infectious disease [research] a break for about eight years.” He has instead emphasized a focus on dietary issues and “chronic disease.” An early test of Kennedy’s leadership may be his response to the growing outbreak of bird flu, which largely presents in animals but has begun infecting humans. Pandemic experts say they have serious concerns about the virus swapping genes with the seasonal flu, allowing it to spread more easily. Despite his many misleading statements in the past, Kennedy spent much of his Senate confirmation hearings claiming that he’s supportive of vaccines. When confronted by Democrats with comments he’s made in the recent years ― from saying that “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” in 2023, to saying he’d “pay anything” to go back in time and not vaccinate his children in 2020 ― Kennedy repeatedly said his remarks had been taken out of context. The pushback against Kennedy from the public health community has been enormous. Last month, more than 700 experts in the field signed an open letter pleading with senators not to confirm him. Before that, more than 17,000 doctors signed a similar letter. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

While the pundits debated the legal reach of Elon Musk as he runs roughshod to downsize federal agencies, host Abby Phillip tossed it to the former “Daily Show” star to analyze how much control President Donald Trump has over the leader of the nonofficial Department of Government Efficiency. “I look at this Trump-Elon relationship ― you ever had a homeboy who had a girlfriend nobody liked?” Wood said, drawing laughter. Wood, who hosts “Have I Got News For You” on CNN, said the friend has to act as if “Oh, we’re fine. We’re happy.” “It is going to take a consecutive series of brave people to keep this administration from going off the rails,” he continued. Earlier, Phillip expressed concern over Musk’s criticism of judges who stymy his and Trump’s maneuvering. “You’re going to need a bunch of brave judges because he’s going to come for their heads, too,” Wood said.

    "title": "Senate Confirms Project 2025 Architect Russell Vought As Trump's Budget Director",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate confirmed Russell Vought as White House budget director on Thursday night, putting an official who has planned the zealous expansion of President Donald Trump’s power into one of the most influential positions in the federal government. Vought was confirmed on a party-line vote of 53-47. With the Senate chamber full, Democrats repeatedly tried to speak as they cast their “no” votes to give their reasons for voting against Vought, but they were gaveled down by Sen. Ashley Moody, a Florida Republican who was presiding over the chamber. She cited Senate rules that ban debate during votes. The Thursday night vote came after Democrats had exhausted their only remaining tool to stonewall a nomination — holding the Senate floor throughout the previous night and day with a series of speeches where they warned Vought was Trump’s “most dangerous nominee.” “Confirming the most radical nominee, who has the most extreme agenda, to the most important agency in Washington,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in a floor speech. “Triple-header of disaster for hardworking Americans.” Vought’s return to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which he also helmed during Trump’s first term, puts him in a role that often goes under the public radar yet holds key power in implementing the president’s goals. The OMB acts as a nerve center for the White House, developing its budget, policy priorities and agency rule-making. Vought has already played an influential role in Trump’s effort to remake the federal government as one of the architects of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for Trump’s second term. The budget office is also already shaking up federal spending. It had issued a memo to freeze federal spending, sending schools, states and nonprofits into a panic before it was rescinded amid legal challenges. In the Senate, Republicans have stayed in line to advance Vought’s nomination and argued that his mindset will be crucial to slashing federal spending and regulations. Senate Majority Leader John Thune pushed for his confirmation this week, saying he “will have the chance to address two key economic issues — cutting burdensome government regulations and addressing excessive spending.” Vought has often advanced a maximalist approach to conservative policy goals. After leaving the first Trump administration, he founded the Center for Renewing America, part of a constellation of Washington think tanks that have popped up to advance and develop Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda. From that position, Vought often counseled congressional Republicans to wage win-at-all-costs fights to cut federal programs and spending. Writing in the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, Vought described the White House budget director’s job “as the best, most comprehensive approximation of the President’s mind.” The OMB, he declared, “is a President’s air-traffic control system” and should be “involved in all aspects of the White House policy process,” becoming “powerful enough to override implementing agencies’ bureaucracies.” During Trump’s first term, Vought pushed to reclassify tens of thousands of federal workers as political appointees, which could then enable mass dismissals. Vought has also been a proponent of the president using “impoundment” to expand the executive branch’s control over federal spending. When Congress passes appropriations to fulfill its Constitutional duties, it determines funding for government programs. But the impoundment legal theory holds that the president can decide not to spend that money on anything he deems unnecessary because Article II of the Constitution gives the president the role of executing the laws that Congress passes. During confirmation hearings, Vought stressed that he would follow the law but avoided answering Democrats’ questions on whether he would withhold congressionally allotted aid for Ukraine. Democrats charged that Vought’s responses amounted to an acknowledgment that he believes the president is above the law. In response to questions from Republican lawmakers, Vought did preview potential budget proposals that would target cuts to discretionary social programs. “The president ran on the issue of fiscal accountability, dealing with our inflation situation,” he said.

Vought has also unabashedly advanced “ Christian nationalism,” an idea rising in the GOP that the United States was founded as a Christian nation and the government should now be infused with Christianity. In a 2021 opinion article, Vought wrote that Christian nationalism is “a commitment to an institutional separation between church and state, but not the separation of Christianity from its influence on government and society.” ___ By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

I definitely recommend these shoes.\" — Charmy The Devotion X Max RS walking shoe offers serious shock absorption with a much taller cushion, and is built for high-performance fitness walking. Its arch support, responsive cushioning and other design features have earned the shoe an American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA) Seal of Acceptance for promoting good foot health. Grab a pair in 11 colors and sizes 5-12, with medium and wide options. Promising review: \"Goodbye to all other brands of sneakers. Arch support is a must for me and for too long I've had to settle for \"good enough\" & \"it'll do\". It might just be a few millimeters difference in placement of the arch support from other brands but it has made the most impact. In addition to typical arch support, there's support for the center of my foot. There is support for the outside of my foot as well. I normally buy a pair of sneakers at a time. I bought 3 pairs within 2 months because the fit is incredible. The shoe feels as if it was made for my feet. It's snug at the skinny part of my foot, in a good way, and roomy at the widest part. I'm spreading the word to all of my women friends. Don't ever change the foot bed and you'll have my loyalty for life!\" — Lilac While the Devotion X doesn't have as high a cushion as the Devotion X Max RS, this bestselling shoe has also earned a seal of acceptance from the APMA.

Was reading thru info on how to heel from an extremely painful bout of ankle tendonitis, I saw the Devotion X had been recommended by orthopedic Dr’s. Thought these were fairly cute and very well priced. The shoes are actually cuter in person than I expect and fit so well right out of the box. They were comfortable for hours the first time I wore them! Helped tremendously stabilizing my ankle and keeping it in a neutral position. Slowly working up to my usual activity levels. Excited to wear them this spring and I’ll order another pair to break in before a trip to Scandinavia this fall.\" — PJBuck The Viv classic sneaker can pair well with jeans or a dress, and has a similar everyday vibe to something like the Adidas Superstars. Made with faux leather, these lace-up shoes have less thick cushioning than some of Ryka's other walking shoe models. But with the padded collar, cushioned heel and \"made for women\" fit that's a constant across all Ryka shoes, these are still plenty comfortable. If you prefer a more streamlined look, try out the Viv. It comes in three colors, including a metallic silver and sizes 5-12, with medium and wide options. Promising review: \"This is my first pair and I will be buying more! I suffer from plantar fasciitis and other issues and finding a comfortable shoe these days is difficult. These have room for my toes to move (podiatrist said this is important), support for my arches (flat feet), and chusion for my foot overall. Finally a company that gets women's feet!\" — Shoppermom The Mary Jane style is a timeless classic, and Ryka's offering features the iconic strap with an adjustable hook-and-loop closure for comfort. The back has a heel pull tab to easily slip the shoe on, and the heel collar is also padded for more cushioning. This is an option for a slightly dressier or less athletic-looking shoe that still provides support and comfort. You can buy these Mary Janes in four colors and sizes 5-12, with medium and wide options. Promising review: \"This is perfect causal but functional shoe. The Mary Jane is summery, but has a secure strap, arch support, cushioned heel. This provides a solid shoe for me. And looks cute with capris, ankle pants.\" — BHnovi2 The Jumpstart lace slip-on sneaker offers the sleek look and feel of a lace-up sneaker with the ease of a slip-on shoe. Made for casual walking, the Jumpstart features laces that stretch all the way across the breathable, stretchy mesh upper for a bit of a different look, and also has the padded heel, cushioning and arch support Ryka is known for. Both the tongue and heel have pull tabs for easy-on, easy-off. Get a pair of the Jumpstart in six colors and sizes 5-12, with medium and wide options. Promising review: \"Recently purchased for traveling on honeymoon cruise! So much walking involved and not a bit of foot pain at all! These are perfect slip ons without looking too “granny.” I usually have trouble with shoes slipping off my ankle but Ryka got it right! More narrow heel and slightly wide toe box.\" — SpongeBobswife For another slip-on sneaker option, you can try the Jog On slip-on sneaker. Some faux suede elements on the upper in addition to the stretch fabric make this shoe a stylish standout. Everyday, casual walking can feel like a breeze with the Jog On's thick cushioning, padded heel and slip-on design with stretch laces and a heel pull tab. In the reviews, nurses, people with plantar fasciitis and others have sung the praises of this slip-on, with one reviewer calling them \"the goldilocks\" of slip-on shoes (not too tight or too wide). The Jog On is available in seven colors and sizes 5-12, with medium and wide options. Promising review: \"Amazing slip on sneakers! Perfect for walking the dog and working out. I truly think they are more comfortable than new balance or Nike. Will never go without them!\" — Mmspenc4 Reviewers have put the Dash 3 walking shoe through all kinds of tests — walking for miles, going to Zumba class and treading over gravel, sand, pavement and more — and have declared this sneaker a winner. It's lightweight, has a padded collar and features a breathable mesh upper with faux leather overlays. Grab a pair in three colors and sizes 5-11, with medium and wide options. Promising review: \"LOVE LOVE LOVE this shoe. Comfort. Support. Wide toe box. I can put these on and forget about my feet all day because they are happy!\" — Julia in PA The Effortless sneaker has a lot of stylistic flair: The shoe features a faux suede upper, a terry cloth collar lining, scalloped trim and a scalloped tongue. But that doesn't mean Ryka skimped on quality or arch support in designing this shoe, with the same \"made for women\" fit and cushioning throughout. This is a \"good walking shoe that doesn't look like I just stepped out of a gym,\" as one reviewer put it. You can get it in five colors and sizes 5-12, with medium and wide options. Promising review: \"Love these! Comfortable and such a nice pop of color. they don't make my large feet look like clown shoes\" — Old Woman If you do a lot of your walking on trails or hikes, the Sky Stride can help you navigate uneven terrain. This walking shoe has a skeletal guidance system for built-in support and stability under the midfoot and a padded collar that provides extra cushioning. The mesh lace-up front is adorned by suede overlays yet one reviewer said their \"feet don't get hot / sweaty\" in the shoes even after hours of wear. Get your own Sky Stride in three colors and sizes 5-12, with medium and wide options. Promising review: \"My tried and true sneaker for years was discontinued and other replacements failed to hit the mark until now!! These sneakers are the best thing I have ever put on my feet. Excellent arch support and the wide width is perfect. My back, knees, ankles, and feet feel better since I started wearing these!\" — Kate R By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Donald Trump Meme Coin Faces Pushback From Silicon Valley Rep.'s New Bill",
    "text": "California Democrat Rep. Sam Liccardo, a freshman congressman who represents Silicon Valley, said he’s surprised the first piece of legislation he’s sponsoring takes aim at President Donal Trump’s meme coin. “That wasn’t my plan when I ran for office, I can assure you,” said Liccardo, the former mayor of San Jose. But the president’s launch of a meme coin just before taking office last month needed some kind of response, said Liccardo. Those who bought the meme coin right after launch made out, but the price quickly dropped leaving others with big losses. Even Trump-supporting crypto enthusiasts found the launch distasteful. “That behavior is so self-evidently unethical that it raises the question why isn’t there a clear enough prohibition,” he said, adding that Trump’s meme coin raises concerns about transparency, insider trading and improper foreign influence. The bill is set to be called the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement, or MEME act. According to a draft of the legislation, it would block the president, members of Congress, and other senior officials, as well as their spouses and children, from issuing or sponsoring securities, commodities and cryptocurrencies like meme coins. It would also force Trump to disgorge any profits he’s made from the sale of his meme coins. Liccardo’s bill, which he plans to introduce Thursday, has no chance of passing in this Republican-controlled Congress. But the freshman lawmaker said it would serve as a placeholder if Democrats come to power as well an important symbolic gesture against what he called obvious corruption. His bill comes amid a fractured Democratic Party struggling to find its footing in the early weeks of the Trump presidency. Meme coins are a strange and highly volatile corner of the crypto industry that often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Critics view them as nothing more than Ponzi schemes that enrich insiders and unethical celebrities. Supporters say meme coins could be early indicators of ways in which the internet could revolutionize financial and other transactions. Trump has long defied presidential norms when it comes to endorsing and promoting products like branded Bibles and perfume. But he’s leaned in particularly hard with cryptocurrency-related projects that could significantly boost his personal wealth. The Trump meme coin quickly soared in price to nearly $70 shortly after it was launched but has since fallen to about $12. Researchers have estimated that trading fees have generated tens of millions of dollars for entities that launched the coin, including a company owned by Trump. Trump and his sons also helped launch a decentralized finance cryptocurrency platform last year, and the president has backed online stores that sell crypto-themed sneakers and $100,000 watches. The Trump family business recently released an ethics agreement that prohibits Trump from “day-to-day” decision-making involving outside business deals and limits financial information shared with him. Once a skeptic of cryptocurrencies, Trump changed course and promised last year to make the U.S. the world capital of digital assets. The cryptocurrency industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, embraced Trump and spent heavily to help him win last year’s election. First Lady Melania Trump also launched a meme coin that spiked in value around the inauguration but has since cratered. A crypto developer who said he helped launch that meme coin was also involved in a disastrous meme coin launch that’s led to Argentine President Javier Milei facing a corruption probe. That developer, Hayden Davis, has said meme coins are essentially a rigged game that benefit a small group of people at the expense of retail investors. “It is an insiders’ game. This is an unregulated casino,” Davis said. Besides a criminal prohibition, Liccardo’s bill would also allow private investors who lose money on a meme coin backed by a public official to sue. Liccardo said that’s a key part of the legislation, given what he sees as a lack of independence in the current Justice Department. “You need to have some enforcement mechanism and a private right of action helps to keep everybody honest,” Liccardo said.

    "title": "GOP Strategist Spots ‘Bad Sign’ That Trump Voters Are Already Having Second Thoughts",
    "text": "Buyers’ remorse is starting to set in for some of President Donald Trump’s voters, longtime Republican strategist Sarah Longwell suggested on Wednesday. Essentially, nothing has changed for those who backed Trump for the “one very specific reason” that they believed “things are too expensive,” Longwell told MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace. And now, Longwell said, those voters are being increasingly caught up in the chaos of the Elon Musk-run Department of Government Efficiency’s “vast” and brutal cuts that are having negative consequences nationwide. “You can see it in the poll numbers. I can hear it in the focus groups, like it’s already starting to turn,” said Longwell, founder of the Republican Voters Against Trump group and publisher of the center-right-leaning Bulwark website. “And that is a bad sign for Trump because honeymoons, even for him he was getting a pretty muted honeymoon, but honeymoons still usually last a little bit longer than this,” she added. To hammer the point home, Wallace aired audio of one focus group member who said: There’s a lot of babies being tossed out with the bathwater, to use an old-fashioned phrase, in this first few weeks. I’m disappointed about this with President Trump because he served before, we’re just forfeiting respect internationally daily. If we had a drinking game where everyone took a drink when the word ‘reverse course’ or ‘walking this back,’ we’d be drunk in 20 minutes. It’s chaos up there.

    "title": "Sean Ono Lennon Mocks Drake While Accepting Beatles Grammy",
    "text": "Drake probably won’t remember the 2025 Grammys fondly. Not only did rap rival Kendrick Lamar win five Grammys for his anti-Drake diss track “Not Like Us” ― including both Record of the Year and Song of the Year ― but Drake also got shade from a son of one of the Beatles. Earlier in the evening, Sean Ono Lennon, the son of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, accepted the Grammy for Best Rock Performance on behalf of his father’s band. He used the occasion to offer some sage advice “to the young people out there.” “Never get into a rap battle with Kendrick Lamar,” Lennon said, referencing Lamar’s long-running beef with Drake that came to a head last spring. On Friday, Lennon also suggested on social media that “Somebody should check on Drake.” When a commenter asked for the latest, Lennon replied, “deafening silence.” And after another person asked if Drake had gone to jail, he responded, “Spiritual jail, yes.” Although Lennon hasn’t explained what, if anything, he has against Drake, AmericanSongwriter.com notes that on a 2018 track with Meek Mill, the rapper said, “I got more slaps than the Beatles.” In 2019, as Drake was breaking many of the Beatles’ chart records, he celebrated by getting a tattoo where he waves back at the band, pictured walking behind him in “Abbey Road” formation. Lennon’s mocking of Drake shocked many people on X, formerly Twitter. I was not expecting John Lennon's son to shit on Drake during the Grammy awards pic.twitter.com/Torkuzk42P Dawg why Drake just catch a stray by John Lennon son who won Best Boxed or Special Limited Package? 😂😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/r7CNblCtel I know Drake wishes he heard this message early 2024 🤣😭 Somebody do the meme with the crying face behind the happy face but make it Drake drake at home seeing this like \"turn this tv off turn this tv off\"🎶 Preach, Sean!

    "title": "Second 'Exonerated 5' Member Announces Run For Office In New York",
    "text": "Two years after New York City elected one of the five men whose wrongful convictions as teens gained national attention, a second member has decided to join him in running for office. Raymond Santana, who was 14 when police arrested him and the other “Exonerated Five” members, announced his grassroots campaign for New York City Council’s District 8 on Tuesday. The 50-year-old activist said he is running as a Democrat to represent the very neighborhoods he was born and raised in. “Raymond knows what most New Yorkers know — that the current system isn’t working for communities like the South Bronx and East Harlem. And that’s why he’s running to represent his home on the New York City Council,” Santana’s campaign website says. The candidate, according to the site, also plans to focus on reforming the criminal justice system, increasing access to affordable housing and providing more economic opportunities for marginalized communities. Despite having lived primarily in Georgia since 2015 — where he is registered to vote — the candidate told The New York Times that he had frequently returned to New York City, both for family and for lobbying legislation that would protect youth targeted by police. He said he only moved back full-time to East Harlem last year, according to the paper. Santana’s campaign comes just a couple years after fellow Exonerated Five member Yusef Salaam won a City Council seat in neighboring Harlem — an election that for many symbolized progress in the very city whose prosecutors unjustly incarcerated the five Black and Latino boys decades earlier. Santana told NY1 that he has spoken to Salaam about his decision to run. A spokesperson for Salaam’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment, though the councilman told the Times that “those who have been closest to the pain should have a seat at the table.” In addition to Salaam and Santana, New York police arrested Kevin Richardson, Korey Wise and Antron McCray in the 1989 rape and beating of a white female jogger in Central Park. All five teenage boys — gaining the name “Central Park Five” — were convicted in the attack and served between five and 12 years in prison. The case inflamed racial tensions in the city and highlighted the criminal justice system’s harsh treatment and adultification of Black and brown boys. New York City Mayor Edward Koch called the teens “monsters,” while President Donald Trump infamously used his position then as a high-profile businessman to take out full-page ads in newspapers like the Times calling for the boys to face the death penalty. Santana initially served five years on the wrongful conviction before getting 20 months added on for a parole violation. He also served four years on a separate drug charge. The convictions were overturned in 2002 after a man whose DNA evidence linked him to the crime confessed to carrying out the attack alone. The prosecutors in the case were later found to have used false confessions and inconclusive physical evidence in the trial against the boys. The city agreed to a settlement that paid the wrongfully accused about $1 million for each year they were incarcerated in the case. Now the five men are called the Exonerated Five, with most of them using their public position to push for justice reform. The group filed a defamation suit just weeks before Trump won the election last year, accusing him of lying during a presidential debate that the five men killed a person. Four of the men — including Salaam and Santana — also spoke out against Trump last year at the Democratic National Convention.

    "text": "Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are set to tie the knot, but the producer candidly admitted he has one worry about his relationship with the “Emilia Pérez” actor. The newly engaged couple sat down for their first joint interview last week, where Blanco confessed his hesitation in their courtship. “I wake up in the morning—I know she does the same thing—and I’m like, ‘How can I make her life better?’” Blanco told Interview magazine. “Holding her isn’t close enough. I want to be inside of her whole body. I just feel a thing for her that I can’t even explain. I’m so sappy.” “It’s very romantic,” Gomez said, while her fiancé added, “I just smile every day.” Still, Blanco said he’s “so scared” that one day Gomez is “just going to wake up and be like, ‘What? No,’” he added with a laugh. Luckily, it sounds like he doesn’t need to worry. “You’re stuck with me,” the singer assured him. The “Only Murders In the Building” star and cookbook author announced her engagement to Blanco in December after they were first linked in June 2023. The two told Interview magazine that they first met many years ago when Gomez was around 16 or 17. “It’s actually very difficult to figure out,” the singer said. Blanco said it was when the two “first had music come out in 2013 or something.” “Her mom set up a meeting between the two of us. This is right when I became big and she wasn’t a singer yet,” he said. We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "Selena Gomez Admits Some 'Emilia Pérez' 'Magic' Is Gone After Costar's Tweets",
    "text": "Selena Gomez is the latest person connected with “Emilia Pérez” to admit that the film’s Oscar campaign has been affected by the resurfaced tweets of its star Karla Sofía Gascón. During an onstage interview Sunday night at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where Gomez was receiving the Virtuosos Award, she discussed the controversy’s effect on her. “Some of the magic has disappeared,” Gomez conceded when asked about the topic. The actor insisted she is still happy with the film, saying she chooses “to continue to be proud of what I’ve done and I’m just grateful. I live with no regrets, and I would do this movie over and over again if I could.” Although “Emilia Pérez” is up for 13 Oscars ― with Gascón nominated for Best Actress ― the actor’s racist, bigoted and controversial social media posts have stirred up negative publicity for the film since coming to light last month. One of the tweets criticized the diversity of the 2021 Oscars, where Daniel Kaluuya, who is Black, and Youn Yuh-jung, who is South Korean, won Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. Ironically, Gascon’s nomination this year is a triumph for diversity, as she is the first openly trans actor to be nominated for Best Actress. In another now-deleted tweet from October 2022 ― long before Gascón and Gomez worked together ― Gascón appeared to comment on a photo of Gomez posing with Hayley Bieber, who is married to Gomez’s ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber: “She’s a rich rat who plays the poor bitch whenever she can and will never stop bothering her ex-boyfriend and his wife,” read the post on X, formerly Twitter. Gascón denied writing that post and insisted it was a fabrication. “Of course that’s not mine,” she insisted to CNN en Español. “I have never said anything about my partner. I would never refer to her that way.” She also declined to withdraw from the Oscars race, claiming she has “not committed any crime” nor “harmed anyone.” “I am neither racist nor anything that all these people have tried to make others believe I am,” she said. Gomez didn’t comment on Gascón’s post during her interview on Sunday night. Still, her comments about the controversy make her the third person connected with “Emilia Pérez” to offer their thoughts on it. Zoe Saldana, who is up for Best Supporting Actress, said earlier this month that she’s “still processing everything that has transpired” and added, “It makes me really sad because I don’t support and don’t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.” Last week, “Emilia Pérez” director Jacques Audiard said that the controversy has affected his relationship with Gascón, with whom he had worked closely. “When you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected,” Audiard said. “It’s as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sofía said is inexcusable.” You can watch Gomez’s full interview below.

    "title": "Serena Williams Sparks Controversy For Her Super Bowl Crip-Walk",
    "text": "Serena Williams’ field choreography during Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime show in New Orleans on Sunday have caused some backlash. During a Tuesday segment of ESPN’s “First Take” podcast, TV personality Stephen A. Smith and fellow commentator Shannon Sharpe both expressed their discomfort with the moment. Their unease was rooted in rumors about an alleged past romantic connection between Williams and rapper Drake. They both agreed that a wife shouldn’t engage in “trolling” her ex, referencing her brief appearance during Lamar’s “Not Like Us,” a diss track aimed at Drake. Former NFL player Ryan Clark, a guest on the show, pointed out that Williams’ performance went beyond a petty rivalry. “She’s from Compton,” Clark reminded Smith and Sharpe. Like Lamar, the 23-time Grand Slam title holder hails from the city, and her “Crip Walk” performance was an homage to the area’s cultural history in the 1970s. The two commentators, who are both unmarried, didn’t seem to miss the cultural reference but maintained their original stance. “We know that,” Smith replied to Clark. “Even if she’s not from Compton, everybody knows her and Drake were together at one time,” Sharpe said, adding that the performance was an attempt to “get their lick back on Drake.” “If I’m married, and my wife is going to join trolling her ex, go back to his ass,” Smith said, doubling down on his position. Clark quickly clapped back and humbled Smith, saying he would be a “kept man” if he dated Williams, presumably referring to their respective net worth. Williams’ husband, tech entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, didn’t share the same views. On X, formerly Twitter, he praised the halftime show as “pretty fantastic,” and pointed out that Williams faced similar backlash after doing the Crip Walk at Wimbledon in 2012.

    "title": "Snow Removal Tools Older Reviewers Said Were Easy To Use",
    "text": "Though it looks nice while it’s falling, snow can be a pain in the bum to get rid of. While shoveling and scraping can be difficult for people at any age, snow removal can be extra tasking for those with a few extra winters under their belts. To help you and your loved one stay safe this season, we rounded up some highly-rated snow and ice removal tools endorsed by older reviewers as lighter weight and easier to use than other options. From shovels to compact snow blowers to brushes and salts, we rounded up a selection of all sorts of snow removal needs, each endorsed by mature users. Whether you get a single big storm or multiple snowfalls this winter, we hope you find your new favorite handy tool to keep your walkways open and your windshields clear. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. Clocking in at under 10 pounds, this cordless electric shovel is far lighter than a traditional snow blower. It has a rechargeable battery offering a 25-minute run time and can throw snow up to 20 feet away. The 13-inch shovel head is adjustable, letting you choose the direction you need, and the extra handle on the rod helps reduce strain through your back. Promising review: \"We got snow the day after I received it. Before then, my neighbors were doing my shoveling because I am a senior. I took this shovel out and began clearing the snow on my own. It was easy to use and not heavy at all. I would recommend it to anyone.\" — Diane The easiest way to remove snow? Let an electric heated mat do all the work for you. As reviewers say, this is not a budget item, but it's a durable and incredibly useful tool that can last for many winters to come. Simply lay down your mat or mats on walk walks or stairs, plug it in and enjoy as it melts up to 2 inches of snow per hour. Be sure to grab the connecting 6-foot, watertight outdoor power cord, which is not included, to connect multiple mats or to connect your own mat to your home power source. Promising review: \"This works GREAT! Bought for my 70 year old mother for Christmas to get to her morning paper. Makes her much more confident in not slipping. Bought this and the step mats that attach to it. Expensive, but for a older person, gives them piece of mind, for sure!\" — Cheryl An ergonomic dual handle makes this shovel easier on your back and arms. The spring-loaded second handle helps you fling snow away without excessive hunching, bending, lifting and extending. The shovel head measures 18 inches across with a 50-inch handle. Find this in three colors, with the red being cheapest. Promising review: \"The SnowJoe is really rounded out my Minnesota Snow Removal Arsenal. I replaced my conventional snow shovel with the SnowJoe and haven't had a sore back since! As a senior, any back saving tool is welcome and I feel like I'm throwing the snow as easily as I did as a younger buck!\" — craig Though they're not technically a snow-removing tool, this pair of heated gloves can keep your fingers toasty, making shoveling or brushing your car way easier — especially if your hands are achy or tightened up in the cold. With a rechargeable battery, they offer three heat settings and are wind and waterproof, while still letting you use a touch screen. Reviews say these make for a great gift, especially for one's parents or grandparents, who may not splurge for themselves but will really enjoy using these in the cold. Promising review: \"My 84 year old father insists on plowing his driveway. We live in Michigan, so it gets cold on his John Deere. He complained his fingers and thumbs get cold. He would NEVER buy these for himself, but we decided to splurge a little. He raved about these gloves like a kid with a new toy. He immediately recognized the leather quality and could not be more appreciative. He said his hands are warm, and he can spend more time outside where he's happy. LIFE IS GRAND.\" — James At 15 pounds with an easy-carrying handle, this bucket of ice-melting salt is easier to transport than some other options and comes with a useful scooper tool. The salt is 100% magnesium chloride, which the brand says won't irritate paws and comes in rounded pellets, not spiky pieces, making it softer for pets to step on. Promising review: \"I purchased this because it was pet friendly. This was my first time living with snow in 45 years so I really didn't know what to look for. This product works VERY well. I am very happy with the results. I'm a senior citizen so having the ability to get rid of the ice is important to me. Buy it - you will like it!\" — Scooty Another worker-smarter-not-harder snow hack: a windshield cover that you can simply slide away to clear snow. Measuring 47 inches by 78 inches, this waterproof and scratch-resistant cover fits most cars and is easy to install with elastics that go around your mirrors. Say goodbye to hacking away at ice on your windshield and save time getting your car ready to go in the morning after a storm. Promising review: \"Best windshield, mirror cover I have ever had in 60+ years of driving in cold climates! Large size completely covers windshield of my Subaru Forester, mirror covers perfect size. Easy to put on for senior citizen; snow slides off slick surface when removing.\" — NoseInBook This 18-inch wide foam snow pusher is another great tool for clearing your car or off flat surfaces like an outdoor table or a covered hot tub. The foam head is lightweight, under two pounds, and easy to wield and is gentle on glass and sensitive surfaces. The rod expands from 33 to 52 inches. If you're often shoveling in the dark or just always need more brightness, check out the option equipped with LED lights. Promising review: \"Great snow tool for seniors when they have to clean off their cars. If someone you know has problems reaching or arthritis prevents them from doing the job this snow Joe is the best!\" — Vito Centrone If you've been intimidated by heavy, gassy snow blowers of blizzards past, allow us to introduce you to the Snow Joe. It's an electric \"snow thrower\" that weighs just under 26 pounds, making it more manageable to push around. The adjustable chute lets you choose where you want the discarded snow to go, clearing up to 580 pounds per minute with an 18-inch wide clearing path. Peek through the reviews, and you'll see a ton of older folks love it, as well as single moms, people who live alone and adult children who got it for their parents. Promising review: \"I love this snow blower. Have used it about 5 times so far and have been very pleased with myself that I can use a snowblower. I am a female senior citizen and weigh in at 105 pounds and if I can use it then just about any one can. So easy to assemble and the instructions were not time consuming. I bought this machine so I can clear pathways thru the snow for my dog and not break my back shovelng. My dog will never thank me for this but at least she is happy to run the paths.\" — octoberwine Another compact option, this electric blower weighs 11 pounds and has an extra auxiliary handle for control and mobility. The brand says this small but mighty machine can move up to 300 pounds of snow per minute, clearing snow 12 inches wide. Reviewers in snow-heavy places like Minnesota call it a \"game changer.\"Promising review: \"Excellent purchase; a lightweight snow blower; good quality; easy to lift and easy to push; does a real nice job of removing snow on sidewalk, porch, patio,etc. ;I recommend it highly for seniors because of its light weight and easy push; priced right for quality blower; I'm 85 and found it easy to use and easy to lift; easy to assemble, don't need to pay anyone to do it; my nurse put it together in 15 minutes for me; would buy again.\" — Gman A new take on a classic shovel, this smart option has an ergonomic handle that lessens strain on your back. Measuring 60 inches high, the shovel smartly curves, meaning you don't have to bend and lift so hard. Promising review: \"For a 75 year old it was the ideal shovel. Having back problems of lumbar region it helped reduced the stress in that region. I would recommend to any one.\" — F P Forget the bending and lifting and opt for this extra-wide snow pusher. It comes in two sizes, 36 and 48 inches across and helps you clear off decks, driveways and other larger areas by pushing the snow instead of needing to lift it in multiple loads. Promising review: \"I have never written a product review on Amazon despite being a regular shopper. But this product is the bomb. We live in the snow belt outside of Cleveland and I’m 62 years old. We have a long driveway that slopes down toward the house so we must keep driveway dry in order for it to be passable even with an AWD vehicle. I’ve tried everything including snow plow folks who only show up sporadically. This thing makes short work of our driveway making it possible to get in and out of our garage. I have the 36” version for heavier snow and 48” one for lighter snow. Great product.\" — Java Frustration Part brush, part squeegee and part scraper, this versatile car brush really does it all. Ensure your windshields and car windows are clear and help push snow off the top of your car. The adjustable handle can extend up to 47.2 inches long and can come apart for easy storage. Promising review: \"After gifting these Car ice scrapers/snow removers to my two great-nephews and husband, I decided to treat myself to one. I am a short ( 5' 2\") 70 year old woman and this item is great for getting all the snow removed from the roof of my car, as well as reaching across the front and back of the car to remove snow. I'm one happy New Englander!!!\" — Phyllis L. Morneau A tried-and-true snow brush, this option gives you a brush head on the top and a scraper on the bottom. It measures 26 inches, so it's a no-brainer to keep in your car, ensuring you're always ready. With over 16,000 5-star reviews this is fan favorite you'll be glad to have. (There’s also a slightly different model available for $9.) Promising review: \"This is a great item. We have had a lot of snow this winter. Also ice on the windshield. This works very well under all conditions. I like the length of it. The handle, with the grip is easy for my old, stiff fingers to wrap around. The ice scraper end works great, much better than most of the other ones I have. The design makes this brush/scraper easy to use. I'm glad I bought it. This is a great seller. The transaction was easy and the service great. Quick, and with great packing.\" — Ollie By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Social Media Reacts To Bill To Rename Greenland 'Red, White And Blueland'",
    "text": "A Georgia Republican’s bill to rename Greenland had a lot of social media users seeing red on Tuesday. The bill introduced by Rep. Buddy Carter would authorize President Donald Trump to purchase Greenland and then rename the autonomous Danish territory a more patriotic “Red, White and Blueland.” Carter made sure to be as sycophantic as possible in a statement about the proposed legislation: “America is back and will soon be bigger than ever with the addition of Red, White, and Blueland.” “President Trump has correctly identified the purchase of what is now Greenland as a national security priority, and we will proudly welcome its people to join the freest nation to ever exist when our Negotiator-in-Chief inks this monumental deal.” Carter also promoted the bill on social media, hoping to make “Red White & Blue Land” trend. RT for Red, White, & Blueland 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/DK7QjlxDXj Although Greenland is part of Denmark, Trump has talked about acquiring it since at least 2019 and brought it up again in December while announcing his pick for ambassador to Denmark. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the president’s interest in Greenland last month and insisted, “This is in our national interest and it needs to be solved.” Danish officials have insisted repeatedly that Greenland is not for sale, and one Danish member of the European Parliament bluntly told Trump to “fuck off.” It seems many people on social media had a similar reaction after hearing about Carter’s bill, which he tried to promote on X, formerly Twitter. This is stupid and makes you look stupid. Is this dumb shit what you were sent to Congress to do? How it must've felt to write this bill pic.twitter.com/1yApIeHWGk Here it is folks...our next great territory -- Red, White and Blueland.The stupid is off the charts. 🤦 pic.twitter.com/mMYc0xQw8n The Republican party is giving off \"Baby's first globe\" vibes\"Mommy, what is this?\"\"It's Greenland, dear.\"\"Mommy, why don't they call itRed, White, and Blue Land?\"\"Because we're not children, dear.\"\"Mommy, what is this?\"(sigh) \"That's the Gulf of Mexico, dear.\" https://t.co/YMrc9KSgnj Surely it should be Redwhiteandblueland, not Red, White, and Blue Land.

    "title": "Social Media Reacts To Tulsi Gabbard's Confirmation As National Intelligence Director",
    "text": "The Senate may have confirmed Tulsi Gabbard as Donald Trump’s director of national intelligence, but many people on social media remain skeptical that she is the right person for the job. The Senate voted narrowly 52-48 for Gabbard, mostly along party lines (except for former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell). The confirmation comes after months of contentious debate about Gabbard’s qualifications for the role, with her lack of experience in the intelligence field, her pro-Putin views, and her support of now-deposed Syrian President Bashar Assad all playing factors. Not surprisingly, people on social media had thoughts, including many politicians. I’m the first CIA officer elected to the Senate and had the honor to help stand up @ODNIgov after 9/11. We need someone in this office who has the competence & character to make the tough decisions, in the dead of night, to keep Americans safe.Tulsi Gabbard isn’t that person. pic.twitter.com/uQoVyveIOZ Tulsi Gabbard — or as Russian state media calls her, “our friend Tulsi” — is not on the right side of the clash of civilizations America is engaged in.But my Republican colleagues just confirmed her anyway. pic.twitter.com/xdB9tZaaM4 It is hard to imagine someone more disqualified to run our intelligence agencies than Tulsi Gabbard. Regular citizens had thoughts as well. Now that Tulsi Gabbard was confirmed today how many of our allies will just stop sharing intelligence with us....?

    "title": "Sonia Sotomayor Has Faith Court Orders Won’t Be Ignored Amid Fears About Trump’s Views",
    "text": "Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Tuesday expressed faith in the foundations of U.S. democracy amid concerns that the country is on the brink of a constitutional crisis in the early days of President Donald Trump’s second term in office. Trump’s allies, including Vice President JD Vance, have argued that courts are infringing on the Trump administration’s authority as many of their extreme policies aimed at reshaping the federal government have been blocked by judges. While Sotomayor did not mention Trump, she explained the responsibility the courts have in using what she described as the “soft power” afforded to them by the Founding Fathers to interpret the Constitution. “We have to, in our opinions, make it clear to the society, to the presidents, to the Congress, to the people, that we are doing things based on law and the Constitution as we are interpreting it fairly,” she said at an event hosted at Miami Dade College. Sotomayor, who was nominated to serve on the court in 2009 by former President Barack Obama, also suggested that, unlike other branches of government, the Judiciary stands the test of time. “Court decisions stand, whether one particular person chooses to abide by them or not, it doesn’t change the foundation that it’s still a court order that someone will respect at some point,” she said. “That’s the faith I have in our system.” The liberal Supreme Court justice said most U.S. presidents historically have followed the rule of law, despite some exceptions. “We’ve had moments where it’s been tested, but by and large we have been a country who has understood that the rule of law has helped us maintain our democracy,” she said. “But it’s also because the court has proceeded cautiously.” A social media post by Vance over the weekend following a judge’s decision to temporarily block the so-called Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department data and subsequent statements by people close to the president prompted concerns about whether the Trump administration would be prepared to openly defy a court order, thus plunging the nation into uncharted territory. Earlier this month, Sotomayor shared her disagreement with the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in Trump’s presidential immunity case.

    "title": "Stephen A. Smith Disses Pete Hegseth's Qualifications On Fox News, And Yikes",
    "text": "Stephen A. Smith is slamming Fox News for some brazen hypocrisy — while on Fox News. The sports commentator appeared on Tuesday’s edition of “Hannity” and sternly pushed back when its conservative host reiterated the baseless claim from President Donald Trump that diversity, equity and inclusion efforts caused a recent deadly plane crash. A midair collision in Washington, D.C., between a military helicopter and an American Airlines jet killed all 67 people aboard the vehicles last week, before a plane crash Friday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, killed all six people aboard and one person on the ground. Sean Hannity claimed Tuesday that the Federal Aviation Administration hired people with “severe intellectual” and “psychiatric” disabilities prior to the crashes, citing language from the FAA’s website that Trump pointed to at a recent briefing about the accidents. He failed to mention that the wording came from a biographical questionnaire the agency implemented to broaden recruitment, however, and had been on the FAA website since at least 2013. But Smith was mostly baffled that a Fox News host was worried about “unqualified” people in high positions. “My issue with the eradication of DEI was … the explanation that the Trump administration and others were giving about it,” Smith said Tuesday. “I don’t want to hear DEI automatically being about people who happen to be minorities that are unqualified.” The ESPN personality eventually told Hannity that they should discuss Pete Hegseth, a former “Fox & Friends Weekend” host who was confirmed last month as Secretary of Defense, “because he’s your former colleague” — only for Hannity to protest. “Keep my friend outta this,” he warned Smith. “Excuse me,” Smith replied Tuesday. “Listen, I’m not bringing up anything personal. I’m simply saying, ‘My God, Sean.’ When you’re talking about people who are unqualified, I wish him nothing but the best — he served our country in the military, I get all of that.” He continued, “But when you are a weekend host on Fox News and now you’re the defense secretary of the United States overseeing three and a half million people, that is not qualified!” Hannity argued otherwise because Hegseth served in the military and attended an Ivy League university. But he failed to acknowledge the lack of evidence that either of the pilots involved in the recent crashes were unqualified — or without similar accomplishments.

    "text": "“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert said “it got weird” on Wednesday as President Donald Trump defended the budget cuts pushed by tech billionaire Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency. “You’ve seen that with some of the things that I read at speeches. I read them, and people can’t believe when I read them,” Trump said. ”$20 million here, $30 million here for, y’know, a little educational course on something. Circumcision, right? Circumcision.” Colbert was left baffled by the sudden shoutout to “circumcision.” “That long, rambling response actually reminds me of circumcision,” Colbert said. “Because somebody really should’ve cut that dickhead off.” Colbert’s studio audience erupted at the joke. Trump seemed to be referring to a USAID program funding voluntary male circumcision in Mozambique to reduce AIDS transmission, but the president didn’t mention any of those details.

    "title": "Stephen Colbert Says Trump's Bizarre New Conspiracy Theory Is Straight From 'The Stupid Hole'",
    "text": "“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert said President Donald Trump delivered a “kind of very weird” answer to a fairly ordinary question earlier this week. A reporter on Air Force One asked about potential budget cuts at the Defense Department. Trump answered by saying “we’re gonna go into Fort Knox to make sure the gold is there.” “OK, that wasn’t the question,” Colbert said. “So what the hell is Trump talking about?” Fortunately, Colbert did the homework on this one. “Follow me down the stupid hole, friends,” he said and then explained the “fringe” conspiracy theories about Fort Knox that tech billionaire/Trump backer Elon Musk has been “obsessed with” lately. He also had an idea for what Trump might want to investigate after Fort Knox ― and broke out his impression of the president to explain it. “We’re gonna see if there’s really silver at Long John’s,” Colbert said. “If the silver’s not there, then I solved that placemat for nothing.” See more in his Thursday night monologue: By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Stephen Colbert Trolls Don Jr. Over The 'Pretty Dumb' Video That Got Him In Trouble",
    "text": "“Late Show” host Stephen Colbert said Donald Trump Jr. may be in hot water in Italy after he was accused of shooting a protected duck. The duck, Colbert said, has a “beautiful deep-orange plumage with a touch of pale white around the eyes” and wondered why the president’s son would have “such hostile feelings” toward it. Then he showed a side-by-side image of the duck next to Trump’s father, President Donald Trump, who shares an orange/white color scheme. “Oh my God!” Colbert exclaimed. Colbert also showed what he called a “pretty dumb” video of Trump out on the hunt. In the video, Trump sinks down in a pit blind, looking out presumably for fowl to bag. When the camera returned to Colbert, he slowly appeared from the bottom of the screen, mimicking Trump in the blind: “I made this fort to hide from the ducks,” Colbert said. “They can’t get me in here, and now all this stale bread is mine.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "text": "A performer during Sunday night’s Super Bowl halftime show unfurled a Palestinian and Sudanese flag and ran around the field before being tackled by security. The person was part of the 400-member field cast during Kendrick Lamar’s performance but his demonstration was not part of the script, the NFL said in a statement to HuffPost. “The individual hid the item on his possession and unveiled it late in the show,” the league said. “No one involved with the production was aware of the individual’s intent.” The man’s flag had both countries’ flags stitched together with “Sudan” and “Gaza” written across it. Roc Nation, which produced the show, also said that the act “was neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal.” The NFL said, “The individual will (be) banned for life from all NFL stadiums and events.” The New Orleans Police Department said the man was ejected from the stadium without arrest or a court summons issued. The man first appeared waving the flag while standing on top of a car as the entertainers danced below him. He jumped off the vehicle and then the stage when a person with long hair appeared to approach him. Once on the field, he ran in circles waving the flag before being tackled and dragged off the green, video shows. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "'Sweet Magnolias' Finds Its Way Back To The Magic Of The First Season",
    "text": "Sometimes, you just need to “pour it out” with close friends and a pitcher of margaritas. That was especially true when Netflix’s “Sweet Magnolias” first aired in May 2020 when we’d all been socially isolating and sheltering in place just long enough to forget what it was like before COVID, before we could only see our friends in Zoom boxes or standing 6 feet apart. When the South Carolina-set show based on the books by Sherryl Woods first premiered, I was still mourning the loss of my mom to cancer. That fresh grief exacerbated the loneliness and isolation I felt while taking care of a 6-week-old and a 21-month-old while my husband worked from home, and I ached for normalcy. I wished that I could escape the crying and tantrums and endless diaper changes for a night away from home to “pour it out” (literally or metaphorically) with a close friend. But, I couldn’t. Instead, I watched the show’s three best friends — Maddie (JoAnna Garcia Swisher), Helen (Heather Headley) and Dana Sue (Brooke Elliott) — meet for their weekly margarita night, and immersed myself in the romances and family dramas they navigated while taking care of each other. While the small-town setting and dialogue was often filled with stereotypical southern phrases and overly saccharine exchanges, the sweetness of the show was comforting at a time when I needed to be taken care of. I felt the same way about the show’s second season, which was a bright spot during the winter of 2022. However, by the third season, I wondered if the show had lost its charm. That season, the show shifted from a gentle soap opera to an almost unwatchable mess. The exchanges between characters were too emotionally wrought, the plot was meandering, and the stakes were so low that I almost didn’t finish watching it. Also, as someone who lives in Memphis, I didn’t know if I could get past the caricature of the South that the show had become. I didn’t plan on watching the fourth season. However, when the trailer for the new season aired with the three best friends clinking their salt-rimmed glasses, I wanted to watch them “toast hope, love, and occasionally top-tier gossip.” While the writing is still overly sentimental and overwrought (almost every line of dialogue is a heartfelt exchange), this season was better, and, like the first two, it is being released at a time when a comfort watch is exactly what I need. The fourth season begins with a time jump that is a little jarring at first. Maddie and her ex-baseball-playing beau are still together but are now engaged, and she has published the children’s book she was working on with her daughter and mother. Helen is still broken up from her first love, Ryan (good riddance!), but is now dating a new character while helping Mayor Peggy (she apparently ran and won), and obviously pining for Chef Erik (Dion Johnstone). Dana Sue has stepped back from her restaurant to spend more time on the community foundation that she started with the money the town matriarch, Frances Wingate (Cindy Karr), left her last season. There’s also a new group of younger friends, the self-proclaimed “Mini Magnolias.” Last season, Dana Sue’s 16-year-old daughter Annie (Anneliese Judge) wished for friends that would be as close as sisters, and now CeCe (Harlan Drum) and Lily (Artemis) have become her own, (non-alcoholic) beverage-sharing trio. Because the first episode begins in media res, it takes a bit to put all these pieces together, to figure out which plot threads the show teased at the end of Season 3 and decided to follow. However, by the end of the first few episodes, the season unfolds with more direction than the one that came before. Part of this is because it has a stronger framework. The season is structured around the holidays. Without spilling any (sweet) tea, I’ll only reveal that the show opens with a Halloween episode and ends with a Christmas one. In between, the season is a mix of personal and natural disasters that the members of Serenity handle with their hallmark grace and hospitality as they work to save their town that the previously corrupt mayor has put in financial jeopardy. There’s also a healthy helping of what Helen would refer to as “Tabasco” spicy romance (read family friendly) as some couples commit to their relationships more fully and others fall in love. Ultimately, this season of “Sweet Magnolias” fulfills its promise as a heartfelt drama. At its core, it continues to be a show about what it means to be a good friend to your best friends, your neighbors, and even the people whom you can’t stand (like Cathy, Dana Sue’s sister-in-law who does make another appearance). While this season, like the three previous ones, includes some overly-emotive dialogue and cringey oversimplifications of the South, I didn’t care as much about that as much I did in Season 3. Maybe this is because these shortcomings don’t feel like such terrible things at this particular moment in time. Maybe I am willing to give this show the benefit of the doubt that the people of Serenity so often extend to each other because I yearn for the community they have created and fight to maintain. Maybe it’s just not such a bad thing to hyperbolize kindness in a world that is neither gentle nor kind.

I’m not as isolated or lonely as I was in March 2020, but I am just as anxious and uncertain about the future. Unlike the early weeks of the pandemic, we can gather and “pour it out” with those closest to us, but it’s hard to talk to anyone right now without feeling the way their palpable stress mirrors our own. From illness during this winter’s “quad-emic” to the rising cost of everything to the increasingly divisive actions of an executive branch that is creating chaos and sowing separation and dehumanizing our neighbors, it’s hard to feel hopeful about anything, especially our country. This season of “Sweet Magnolias” is a good reminder that in the midst of struggle, “pouring it out” still matters. As Maddie says as town spokesperson, the challenges the town has faced have “strengthened everyone’s resolve to give of their time and talents to help their neighbors.” The notion may sound like a “quaint” platitude (or an example of how heavy-handed the show’s writing is), but right now, I find myself being drawn to language like that, to hope and kindness, and, if nothing else, this season of “Sweet Magnolia” serves up a heaping of that.

    "title": "This Legacy Brand Carpet Cleaner Is 'So Much' Better Than Bissell. Grab It For Under $100.",
    "text": "The Bissell Little Green carpet and upholstery cleaner is legendary among HuffPost readers and even discerning editors who personally swear by its cleaning powers. But, today we meet a more affordable alternative that not one, but several reviewers are calling better than the famous green original — and it’s even cheaper because it’s currently on sale for 23% off at Amazon. The Hoover CleanSlate Plus is a versatile and compact machine that combines powerful suction, scrubbing action and “shampooing” to remove messes and stains from virtually any soft surface. Its cleaning capacity is only maximized by its impressive array of included attachments that make the Hoover a true hero, including a narrow upholstery attachment that can reach messes in tight corners like along stair edges, baseboards and upholstery grooves. Plus, the intentionally long-corded design and and diminutive size means that the CleanSlate is super easy to pull out and take anywhere in your home (or out to your car). Users of this machine have likened it to a non-negotiable home essential as it’s managed to make unfortunate pet messes (diarrhea, vomit, pee — you name it) disappear like magic, while also breathing new life into carpets and furniture. It can even tackle larger “life-size” messes, according to the maker. One reviewer also laid out some key differences between the Hoover and the Bissell citing factors like greater portability, better attachments, stronger suction and better drying power. If you’re a fan of the classics and still want to opt for the Bissell Little Green instead (which, we still believe is a great choice) then you’re in luck because it’s also currently on sale for 19% off at Amazon. “Better than the little green machine! I normally don’t write reviews but after taking this for the first time I am extremely impressed. I have a white sectional I spent way too much money on and after reducing a large dog my sectional started looking light beige… gross. I have a little green machine and have tiredly cleaned and cleaned and cleaned the entire thing with my little green machine. It would cause streaks and the suction wasn’t great. The nozzle for suction was also so small. I was at my wits end and just wanted to buy a new sectional but decided to give it one more go. The first pass through in one cushion sucked up so much yellow dirt and it was only a week ago I cleaned it with the little green. I was shocked - the large nozzle makes it go so much faster and the suction is POWERFUL. I also used the smaller scrubber for the welted areas (places I couldn’t get to before) and WHOA my sectional looks almost new. I used the cleaner that came in the box for one full clean and then used hot water and a splash of a scented detergent (diva, iykyk) and I am so happy. I would highly highly recommend this over all of the other ones I’ve used in the past.” — Nikki “Bissell Who? This little Hoover spot cleaner works great! I can understand what people say about the suction not being the best, however, if you properly angle it and do slow passes per the instructions, it works great! After years of using the Bissell green machine (at least 4 purchases over the last 15 years), we will NEVER go back to Bissell. Also, the suction arm on the Hoover is designed better than the Bissell, I don’t think it will break where the hose meets the wand like the Bissell always did.” — Ashley T. “If your pet had accidents - even just every once in a blue moon, this thing is worth its weight in gold. I’ve used it on a soft medium high pile carpet, and you can see how this machine gets the dirt out of it, not only from the surface but from deep down. Because of that it will prevent unpleasant odors that may be noticed when just dapping or hand cleaning the carpet. It’s perfect in size, easy to carry, the hose is long enough & so is the electric cord. It’s literally a (carpet) life saver.” — FS-IND “I have a senior dog who pees in the house from time to time regardless of training. With that in mind, this unit is far superior than the Bissell Little Green Machine. At first, I wasn’t sure if paying the extra $20 or so for a chargeable battery was worth it but now I’m convinced. If your pet makes messes frequently enough, the last thing you want to deal with is an annoying cord and knowing where your outlets are. Sure, the running time is roughly 15 minutes but unless you’re cleaning the entire room, that’s plenty of time for spot cleaning. The other features that make it so much better than Bissell is the design is way more user friendly. You can actually put the container down on a flat surface to refill it with cleaning solution. And plus all of it comes apart so you can clean the containers themselves. You couldn’t even open the dirty tank on the Bissell to clean out the dog hairs which is such a head scratcher! The battery charges quickly, you have a more powerful mode (which I haven’t had to really utilize), and the hose cleaning attachment fits flush into a little nook at the top. Everything about this little unit is very well thought out! Highly recommend!” — jaydub “I had the little green machine made by Bissell but this is SO MUCH better. The main attachment is so much wider so it takes half the time to clean up a mess. It’s so much easier to clean the hose also which adds to the longevity of the machine” — aubrey The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics.

    "title": "Tom Robbins, Literary Prankster-Philosopher, Dies At 92",
    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Tom Robbins, the novelist and prankster-philosopher who charmed and addled millions of readers with such screwball adventures as “Even Cowgirls Get the Blues” and “Jitterbug Perfume,” has died. He was 92. Robbins’ death was confirmed by his friend, the publishing executive Craig Popelars, who said the author died Sunday morning. Pronouncing himself blessed with “crazy wisdom,” Robbins published eight novels and the memoir “Tibetan Peach Pie” and looked fondly upon his world of deadpan absurdity, authorial commentary and zig zag story lines. No one had a wilder imagination, whether giving us a wayward heroine with elongated thumbs in “Cowgirls” or landing the corpse of Jesus in a makeshift zoo in “Another Roadside Attraction.” And no one told odder jokes on himself: Robbins once described his light, scratchy drawl as sounding “as if it’s been strained through Davy Crockett’s underwear.” He could fathom almost anything except growing up. People magazine would label Robbins “the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters,” who “dips history’s pigtails in weird ink and splatters his graffiti over the face of modern fiction.” A native of Blowing Rock, North Carolina who moved to Virginia and was named “Most Mischievous Boy” by his high school, Robbins could match any narrative in his books with one about his life. There was the time he had to see a proctologist and showed up wearing a duck mask. (The doctor and Robbins became friends). He liked to recall the food server in Texas who unbuttoned her top and revealed a faded autograph, his autograph. Or that odd moment in the 1990s when the FBI sought clues to the Unabomber’s identity by reading Robbins’ novel “Still Life with Woodpecker.” Robbins would allege that two federal agents, both attractive women, were sent to interview him. “The FBI is not stupid!” he liked to say. “They knew my weakness!” He also managed to meet a few celebrities, thanks in part to the film adaptation of “Even Cowgirls,” which starred Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves, and to appearances in such movies as “Breakfast of Champions” and “Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.” He wrote of being Debra Winger’s date to the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony and nearly killing himself at an Oscars after-party when — hoping to impress Al Pacino — he swallowed a glass of cologne. He had happier memories of checking into a hotel and being recognized by a young, pretty clerk, who raved about his work and ignored the man standing next to him, Neil Young. In Robbins’ novels, the quest was all and he helped capture the wide open spirit of the 1960s in part because he knew the life so well. He dropped acid, hitchhiked coast to coast, traveled from Tanzania to the Himalayas and carried on with friends and strangers in ways he had no right to survive. He didn’t rely on topical references to mark time, but on understanding the era from the inside. “Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,” he wrote in his memoir, published in 2014. “I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.” His path to fiction writing had its own rambling, hallucinatory quality. He was a dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate) who joined the Air Force because he didn’t know what else to do. He moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early ’60s and somehow was assigned to review an opera for the Seattle Times, becoming the first classical music critic to liken Rossini to Robert Mitchum. Robbins would soon find himself in a farcical meeting with conductor Milton Katims, making conversation by pretending he was working on his own libretto, “The Gypsy of Issaquah,” named for a Seattle suburb. “You must admit it had an operatic ring,” Robbins insisted. By the late 1960s, publishers were hearing about his antics and thought he might have a book in him. A Doubleday editor met with Robbins and agreed to pay $2,500 for what became “Another Roadside Attraction.” Published in 1971, Robbins’ debut novel sold little in hardcover despite praise from Graham Greene and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, but became a hit in paperback. “Even Cowgirls Get the Blues” came out in 1976 and eventually sold more than 1 million copies. “Read solemnly, with expectations of conventional coherence, ‘Even Cowgirls Get the Blues’ will disappoint,” Thomas LeClair wrote in The New York Times. “Entered like a garage sale, poked through and picked over, ‘Cowgirls’ is entertaining and, like the rippled mirror over there by the lawn mower, often instructive. Tom Robbins is one of our best practitioners of high foolishness.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

Domestic stability was another prolonged adventure; one ex-girlfriend complained “The trouble with you, Tom, is that you have too much fun.” He was married and divorced twice, and had three children, before settling down with his third wife, Alexa d’Avalon, who appeared in the film version of “Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.” Robbins’ other books included “Half Asleep in Frogs Pajamas,” “Fierce Invalids Home from Home Climates,” “Villa Incognito.” His honors included the Bumbershoot Golden Umbrella Award for Lifetime Achievement and being named by Writer’s Digest as among the 100 best authors of the 20th century.

    "title": "Tony Hawk Reveals Why He Wishes Kurt Cobain Was Still Alive, And It’ll Break Your Heart",
    "text": "If Tony Hawk’s moving tribute to Kurt Cobain makes you cry, all apologies. Over the weekend, Hawk decided to honor the late Nirvana frontman after stumbling upon an old ticket stub from a concert he went to on Oct. 20, 1991. Posting an image of the stub to his Instagram story, Hawk explained that after he competed in a skateboarding competition in Houston, Texas, he decided to check out an alternative rock band from Seattle called Nirvana — who had just released the hit “Smells Like Teen Spirit” just two months prior. “Went straight from S.U.A.S event at Houston skatepark to this concert in 1991,” he wrote. “It was as transformative as live music can possibly be: We all experienced something rare and powerful that night. The world would never be the same.” Although many rock fans likely share the same sentiment about the band, which consisted of Cobain, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic at the height of their fame — Hawk’s post then takes a very personal turn. Cobain died by suicide in 1994, leaving his wife, musician and actor Courtney Love, to raise their 20-month-old daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, on her own. In 2023, Frances Bean Cobain married Tony Hawk’s son, Riley Hawk. A year later, the couple welcomed a son, Ronin Walker Cobain Hawk. This means that the skateboarding legend and late grunge icon share a grandson. “I wish Kurt were here,” Hawk concluded. “So he could see the incredible woman his daughter has become, meet her devoted, caring husband, and hold our wondrous grandchild.” I am sobbing at Tony Hawk posting about his grandchild who is also Kurt Cobain's grandchild pic.twitter.com/pa7eseMich When a screenshot of Hawk’s post made its way to X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday, fans got pretty emotional. “Who the fuck is cutting onions?” one X user wrote. “it’s 7 in the morning and this made me sob in public,” echoed another. “I choose to believe in the multi-verse bc there has to be a timeline where Kurt Cobain and Tony Hawk are hanging out together, being the coolest F*ing grandpas ever. That has to exist. I choose that in a parallel world, it does,” another said. “American royalty I can get behind,” said a fourth user. On the 30th anniversary of Kurt Cobain’s death in April 2024, Frances Bean Cobain posted a tribute to her dad on Instagram in which she admitted that she’s been grieving him “for almost as long as I’ve been conscious.” “I wish I could’ve known my Dad,” Frances Bean Cobain wrote. “I wish I knew the cadence of his voice, how he liked his coffee or the way it felt to be tucked in after a bedtime story. I always wondered if he would’ve caught tadpoles with me during the muggy Washington summers, or if he smelled of Camel Lights & strawberry nesquik (his favorites, I’ve been told).” Although she never really knew her dad, the “Come As You Are” singer’s daughter said mourning someone her entire life has led her on “an expedited path to understanding how precious life is.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

It’s a soft white noise not loud, but don’t let the water run out I swear it ruins it. Grandma can use this bad boy. And it’s FAST\" — Makayla soto Athleta's pants are a big hit with shoppers as people love how comfortable they are while still being fashionable and not feeling like they're in gym clothes.

Promising review: \"I purchased a much more expensive monocular a few years ago…it is fine, but…after purchasing this for a friend, now I want one for myself! Why? It is lighter and easier to focus…even with one hand. The optics are just as good as the more expensive one, and the warranty is great!\" — Kathy A dead phone or tablet is a terrible inconvenience and if it's always happening to you, then you need a power bank like yesterday. Try this Heyday option that's pretty and packs a real punch, per reviewers. It's available in two different power capacities: 5000 and 10,000 mAH . Promising review: \"Such a great power bank! I drove cross country with my little ones and this held power for over 9 hours while charging tablets actively while they played! Easy to use charges quickly and is cute!\" — Militarywise Skip out on pouring your skincare into bottles sized appropriately for a plane because these already are!

Listen, cordless vacuums are cute, but if you have a bunch of kids, pets, or a work area you need to frequently clean — you may need something that can run longer than the charge time. This Bissell Cleanview cleaner has a triple-action brush roll, making it perfect for pet hair. The 27-foot power cord lets you get where you need to go and the quick-release extension wand helps you get little nooks and crannies high and low. It's 20% off today and hasn't been on sale since early December. Promising review: \"If you’re looking for a vacuum that definitely sucks, look no further! I had a small shark vacuum that just could never fully clean our carpets, it would always fill up with dust/pet hair and the carpet would still never look/feel fully clean. This vacuum is definitely a work-horse, does a phenomenal job at cleaning. My carpet finally looks “fluffy” and I can literally smell a difference in my apartment! For the price, it’s an amazing vacuum with quality comparable to a high end Dyson. The attachments work great, the cord winds itself up at a touch of a button and easily gets to hard to reach areas under furniture. The engineers at Bissell did an amazing job at creating a quality vacuum at a very affordable price. If you have any pets or little ones, this will do a phenomenal job at keeping your home clean. 100% worth every penny!\" — Isaac Another winter driving must-have is a portable tire inflator. This option boasts a 4.8 rating on Walmart, likely because its four pre-set inflation modes (bike, motorcycle, car and ball) make it so easy to use. It can also be used as an emergency power bank to charge your phone and can continuously run for two hours of air compression between charges. This is a 28% off flash deal at Walmart so you have mere days to grab it at this price. People love love LOVE Hokas and because of this, they're rarely actually on sale in a good amount of sizes and colors. Today, we spy with our deal-hunting eyes an Aqua Breeze/Celery Juice pair of Hokas with a 32% off discount hiding out at Nordstrom. Nab these while so many sizes are available. If you already love your Amazon Alexa, but sometimes wish the sound quality was higher — this may be a perfect find for you.

Wi-Fi enabled, you can stream all your favorite listening apps on it and connect it to your Bluetooth devices, set it up with your record player or add it to your existing Sonos collection, for even more dynamic sound. Promising review: \"Added this one to our system and it's been wonderful. So bougie having our whole house filled with music! Sonos is my favorite for home music flexibility, as you can have the system play the same thing everywhere, or pick something different for any single or grouping of speakers. And they sound SO GOOD! Love love love!\" — Lucy If you've scrolled through any realm of beauty TikTok in the last few months, you've likely seen this cushion foundation in its trademark red case. Made from Korean makeup brand Tirtir. Their cushion foundation offers medium to full coverage, with a satin finish. It's meant to feel super airy and lightweight on the skin, lasts through the day and works to boost your skin's elasticity as you wear it. The brand now has an expansive 40-shade color range. Promising review: \"I was skeptical buying this just because I’ve seen it all over TikTok. But once I saw it was on amazon I had to buy it since Amazon makes it easy to return if I don’t like it. But let me tell you, this is by far the BEST make up product I have ever owned. I have the Dior concealer for my under eyes and it does nothing compared to this. This covers my dark circles completely and any hyperpigmentation! I showed my boyfriend and he asked if I even had make up on because my skin looked so natural but flawless. I don’t even need to use a lot and it’s completely full coverage. It feels like I have nothing on my skin! My pores are completely covered (no primer) and it honestly makes me look 5 years younger! I’m not even joking. I am not a fan of foundations because they always feel heavy and look cakey but not this. My face looks like a baby’s bum!\" — Chelseynicolle [This review was shortened for length, read whole thing here.] Another power bank option, the Jackery is a fan-favorite around HuffPost, loved for its quality, straight-forwardness and easy-to-store/carry shape. This Jackery 300 is perfect for beach days, car camping or having around during storm season. It weighs just over 7 pounds, with two AC outlets, one USB-C port, one \"fast charge\" USB port and a carport. It can juice up to six devices at once from your laptop to your phones to cameras and drones. Get it for 35% off list price today. Promising review: \"Just went through the Texas winter storms and was SOOO glad I had my Jackery 300. With the rolling blackouts this little guy gave me the piece of mind I needed. Once we go use to the blackouts, we even splurged and used it to power the PS4 and a 55” TV. It was perfect. When the power was on it charged up and when the power went off we kept on playing. We could almost play 3 hours on a full charge. Made the winter storm so much more enjoyable.\" — R. Sorensen Per reviewers, it's \"the best smoothie maker you can buy\" — all thanks to its 900 watts of power that make it even stronger than the original Nutribullet that came out. It'll come with the powerful motor base, an extractor blade, a 32-ounce cup, a 24-ounce cup, a to-go lid, a lip ring and a lip ring with a handle and recipe book! It's on sale at Amazon, Target and Nutribullet with Amazon and Target offering a 20% discount. Promising review: \"Amazing! I use it every single day, it’s powerful and the matte white is so pretty and sleek. It’s easy to clean and I’ve had no issues at all. I only wish there was a smaller cup, other than that it’s great!\" — CeCe Made of 77% cotton with a smidgen of elastane for a touch of comfy stretch, Madewell's boatneck top brings oodles of comfort and enough warmth without too much thickness. Today, Madewell's got it on a 59% discount. Even better, it's available in three colors and all sizes – XXS to XXL, by the way — in stock. This beauty has a 14-cup capacity and you can program it as much as 24 hours in advance so your coffee's hot and ready at exactly the right time. Though Walmart notes the Ninja coffee machine and glass carafe as being only $20 off, our trackers tell us it was originally $99 which means you're getting a 40% discount. Promising review: \"Brews an extremely enjoyable hot cup of coffee. I tried both the regular and rich settings. Both were as promised. Auto brew timer setting works perfectly. The warmer plate and heat settings work extremely well. Coffee is hot from start to finish but never burned or bitter. Mesh filter cleans easily with a soft sponge. I'm a bit extra so I use a paper cone filter inside the mesh filter. I've been using for several weeks and it's perfect every time. We brew several pots throughout each day, each brew is consistent. The best coffee pot I have ever had!!\" — Dawn Another Madewell winner that's newly marked down is this versatile Safari jacket. Throw it on over over top or wear it closed or open. Wear it over dresses or jumpsuits. Go with denim or other neutral bottoms. There are few ways to get this layer wrong other than missing out on it being 61% off and fully stocked in sizes XXS to XXL. Promising reviews: \"I have been eyeing this jacket for such a long time!! I am petite (5 foot), this jacket is perfectly at my hip. I love that it has a belt, so it also gives me a waist. It goes well with so many bottoms and shoes as well. This jacket is light, yet it does warm. I would wear this in fall or early winter. Also perfect for spring! I can also wear layers underneath.\" — Inesita Tory Burch is one of the most iconic accessory brands for its sleek, durable and sophisticated bags and shoes. This mini Miller crossbody bag is perfect for on-the-go days and the upcoming spring season in this Coral Crush hue. Today it's 40% off which translates to over $100 off in this coral hue only for a limited time. Per our trackers, this is the cheapest price you'll find this color in. Bonus: We also spotted the matching credit card holder for 63% off at Neiman Marcus. Though the brand calls them \"cereal bowls\" these cheerful ceramics are great for ice cream, soup, little salads or truly anything else. Crafted in Portugal from glazed stoneware, they're dishwasher- and microwave-safe (though they may get hot in the micro, so be careful grabbing them.) This set comes in the mixture of colors pictured, bringing a little texture and vibrance into your home. At $30 for a set of six, that's $5 a bowl, which is not too bad if you ask me. Promising review: \"I have wanted these for a long time, and I was surprised when they came on sale. I immediately purchased them and I’m so glad I did. They are in perfect condition and work so well on our kitchen. They’re deep enough for anything you would need (soup, cereal, yogurt, etc.)\" — Atr125 Before you replace your dishwasher or call out a contractor because it's constantly leaving a white film on your dishes, try these TrueFresh tablets. They'll lift limescale, grease and odors so your dishes actually start to get clean again. Promising review: \"In the past, it wasn't even worth using my older dishwasher because i spent more time trying to keep the filters clean than it was worth. was easier to just hand wash the dishes. not anymore. my dishwasher is 16 years old. i use this monthly, and it works great.\" — Walmart Customer By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "These Are The Top Pillows From Amazon That Have Officially Gone Viral",
    "text": "If there’s one thing that never sleeps, it’s online advertisements for pillows. Whether you’re scrolling through Instagram, chatting on Facebook or learning new recipes on TikTok — you’re probably seeing ads for pillows. Lots of them. With so many options, it can be overwhelming to know what will be your perfect pillow. And as you can’t physically try them out, you have to go by photos, reviews and articles to guide you. To help cut through the noise, we picked six of the most popular and most comfortable pillows you can find on the web. Most of them have gone viral on TikTok (with reviews saying they live up to the hype) and others come from Instagram ads or Reddit recommendations. Each comes with thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of 5-star reviews, singing the praises of each option. We’ll break down what makes each pillow different, why it might be for you and even link to videos of happy sleepers. So kick your heels up and lay your head knowing you’re getting all the info. HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently curated by the HuffPost Shopping team. Prices and availability are subject to change. What: The Beckham hotel collection bed pillows aren't just famous on TikTok, they're also consistently a top-selling item at HuffPost. Interior designer Natalie Rebuck previously called the pillow “fluffy,” and noted that “they really hold up over the years.” A 250-thread count cotton cover makes them super soft and snuggly while the polyester fill is responsive to your head and shoulders and breathable. Great for all styles of sleepers (back, stomach, side), they keep their shape and feel super plush. They can also go in the washer and dryer for easy cleaning and re-fluffing. Find them in queen and king sizes. Great for: Hot sleepers, people wanting down alternative, anyone who prefers a super plush pillow, stocking your guest room or rental property. Amazon score: 4.3 out of 5 stars; 244,197 ratings Promising reviews: \"God himself must use these pillows. I have (or had haha) insomnia not to mention a bad neck/back *and* hot flashes. The comfort is CRAZY. The cooling is AMAZING (even with silk pillowcase). Thank you TikTok for influencing me!!!!\" — Rickie White \"I absolutely love these pillows. I have been on the hunt for yearssss and couldn’t be happier to have stumbled across this brand through a TikTok home influencer. I’m extremely particular and these pillows meet my picky standards.\" — Deky \"I was skeptical at first because I rarely invest in nice beddin...for what reason? Idk! My boyfriend has these at his place and really encouraged me to buy them. I thought my pillows at home were good enough until I bought these. Wow and I mean wow - they are so comfortable and I've gotten incredible sleep ever since buying them. Hate to say it but he was right and I'm so satisfied with my purchase. Saving for the future when I need a pillow refresh!\" — Jen Menninger \"I have never slept better then I have on this pillow. I don't know why I waited so long to purchase this. I has great reviews for a reason. It is that good! I ordered two and then then next day ordered another two that's how much I reall like these pillows. They are great for back and side sleepers so no matter how you sleep this is a great pillow. Try it!\" — Amazonshopper What: Versatility is the name of the game with the Coop adjustable pillow. Crafted with an inner liner and outer cover, it's stuffed with a unique blend of cross-cut memory foam and microfiber that you fill to your liking. The pillow comes with extra stuffing and the ability to open it, so you can make it more or less firm. The brand recommends less stuffing for stomach sleepers, medium for back sleepers and the most stuffing for side sleepers. See it in action here. Great for: Side sleepers, anyone who's picky about pillows and wants to customize their own, anyone who changes their sleep position and wants the ability to change their pillow without needing to buy a new one. Amazon score: 4.5 out of 5 stars; 60,831 ratings Promising reviews: \"I hardly ever write reviews but I have to for this. I saw this pillow on TikTok and it got me curious so I immediately came to Amazon. OMG it’s such a game changer. I’m a side sleeper and this pillow is heaven. It’s some of the most comfortable sleep I have had in ages. I love it so much I bought a second one and have my eye on the body pillow. Obsessed! You need this in your bedroom.\" — MT \"When you get sick of replacing pillows every few months do yourself a big favor and Try COOP Pillows. They will last years and years, covers are washable and comes with a little extra stuffing to adjust how much support you want. They are costly I won’t deny, but after you waste money on the cheap ones every few months you could have bought these once.\" — Thomas \"They received a number one rating in the consumer reports report in 2024 so I figured I would try. They are great, wonderful support, I used to wake up with a stiff neck, not anymore. I like the idea of having extra fill. Definitely worth the expense and getting the waterproof jackets to go over them. Glad I made this purchase.\" — Jeffrey \"I've been searching for a pillow that would give me the support I need as a side sleeper. I've gone through tons of pillows and my neck/shoulder pain would remain. Saw someone recommend this on Reddit and decided to try it. And it was the the right choice. This pillow is insanely comfortable, breathable, and supportive. Within a week my neck and shoulder pain was gone. I sleep like a baby with this pillow. I can't recommend this enough. It's worth every penny\" — Jamie Evans What: At $10 for a two-pack, this set of Bedsure soft and supportive pillows is stuffed with high-grade microfiber in three levels — soft, medium and firm. It's a \"cloud-like\" pillow that's plushy and soft and responds to your head and neck as you roll or move. Bedsure as a brand gets a lot of love on TikTok, with people also drooling over their fuzzy blanket. Great for: Side and back sleepers, people who like a soft and plushy pillow, anyone looking for an affordable bulk buy. Amazon score: 4.3 out of 5 stars; 14,051 stars Promising review: \"I've never purchased pillows online before. But i could not find a pillow in store I liked or felt was reasonably priced for the quality. I took a risk in buying these pillows and wow, so happy i did. Soft and true to size. The filling is still plump after weeks of use. I'll be purchasing another set in the future.\" — Kate \"I just bought these to put into my shams, but I’ve kept using them to sleep on because they’re so comfy! Like a cloud honestly, yet supportive at the same time. A miracle basically.\" — Julia Pierannunzi \"These are very comfortable pillows. They keep their shape, they puff right up. Worth my money, I’ll order these again, cost was good also.\" — Linda \"I cannot get out of bed with these pillows! I took them out the packaging and let them rise for about 20 minutes before pulling them apart/fluffing and oh my gosh, they are so plush and soft!\" — NanaBanana What: Utopia bedding gusseted pillows that retail for $15 each that TikTok loves for being cool and comfortable.

I saw these on tiktok and they are the best I’ve found for a decent price anyway ! You can just fluff em right back up!! Great quality!\" — Jenny Miri \"I have never bought pillows online before. This was a different thing for me. But best choice I’ve made. I got it and within a few minutes it was super fluffy and ready to use. The color was pure white. Same size as a normal pillow. They keep you cool for a while. Very fluffy.\" — Eric \"These pillows are just how they were described. That hotel feel and they remain cool all night. Very comfortable pillows. I just bought more for my kids.\" — Jason \"I purchased these for guest room, and loved them enough to buy for my own, then sent them to my daughter for her guest room. Full, yet soft. Firm, yet contouring. Pillows stand beautifully on a made bed.\" — Nancy J. Baker What: Cervical neck pillows have seemingly taken over TikTok, with users saying they're great for neck and shoulder pain, spine alignment and comfortable sleeping no matter how you sleep. While there are truly countless options on Amazon, this adjustable memory foam version has solid ratings and Amazon reviews crediting TikTok for introducing them to the pillow. Made with a countered, ergonomic design and memory foam, you can flip it in a bunch of ways depending on how you sleep. Great for: People dealing with neck and shoulder pain, anyone who wants more alignment or neck support while they sleep Amazon score: 4.3 out of 5; 3,530 ratings Positive reviews: \"I didn’t know if I would like this pillow but after seeing it a billion times on tiktok i thought I would try it out. It is so comfortable, stays cool, and is well worth the money. The little dip in the middle just fits my head so nicely. It is easy to fall asleep with this pillow.\" — Haley \"I bought this after seeing tiktoks about ergonomic pillows and I was skeptical to try, but I don’t regret it. I’ve never slept so comfortably in my life that I can actually sleep through the night. I definitely recommend to help with back/neck pain when sleeping. I would definitely buy another one to have as my second pillow.\" — Taylor D \"I bought this around 6 months ago after seeing a ton of people raving about it online. I have always had issues with knots in my shoulders and tension headaches. It provides really good support for my neck and I feel like I wake up with less pain. I like that the insert has different parts you can remove to adjust the height and that the cover is washable. It’s maybe a little warmer than a traditional pillow but nothing too bad. I would definitely buy again!\" — Amazon customer \"Best pillow ever!! I would change the name to Miracle pillow. My neck and shoulders were sore for months and after one night of sleeping my pain was gone. After 1 week still great. Highly recommend.\" — Christina What: Mattress company Casper's original pillow is as beloved as all their other products. It's a down alternative pillow with a 100% breathable percale cotton cover that can go in the washing machine and is great for all styles of sleepers. The innovative pillow-in-pillow design makes it easy to clean and super supportive with a two-inch gusset for even weight distribution as you slumber and strong neck alignment. It's on the pricier side of the list, but reviewers say it's worth it as it's bouncy nature moves with you if you're tossing or turning. Great for: People who move a lot in their sleep, people who know and like the Casper brand, anyone looking for a little firmness and superior support. Amazon score: 4.4 out of 5 stars, 11,427 ratings Promising reviews: \"I was so skeptical to fall into the scheme of advertisements on Instagram for this pillow but I’m so glad I gave it a try. Given it’s probably not for everyone I can honestly say I feel like I really missed out on some good sleep all this time ! This pillow is not too soft not too hard just like the advertisements say my neck feels supported and I feel so refreshed ! I was not given anything for this review- I would absolutely pay full price for this pillow if I had to.\" — Joyce \"This pillow is amazing. It's nice and fluffy, which was a little concerning at first because I like my pillow to be a tad firm, and at first it seemed too flat. When I looked online at reviews I discovered the brand posted a video specifically about how to fluff the pillow and let me tell you... This was a game changer. Now it's fluffy, yet supportive. Moldable but a bit firm. And when it gets a little flat again you just need to fluff it up and you're good to go once more!\" — Kymbee8 \"I didn’t realize it has been nearly 5 years since I first received this pillow. It is the best pillow I have ever had.\" — lr \"Best pillow I have ever purchased. Its fluffy, soft, but firm and holds its shape. This pillow has a removable outer layer for easy washing and provides great neck and shoulder support.\" —  Elena carrasquillo By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "This Is The 'Best Travel Or Commuter Mug Made' According To Reviewers And It's Under $30",
    "text": "The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. It’s a bummer when your hot drink loses steam because it’s cold out or, well, your mug just sucks. If you’re a big coffee (or tea!) drinker, we might’ve found the mother of all insulated bottles to keep your hot drinks hot and your cold drinks cold. Made by Zojirushi, who also makes every sushi’s chef’s favorite rice maker, this stainless steel mug is leakproof, tough-as-nails, well insulated and, best of all, up to 27% off (depending on color) its usual price of $29.99. And reviewers are absolutely going nuts over it. It’s garnered a near perfect 5-star average rating based on over 21,000 reviewers who sing its praises as being the “a perfect mug,” the “best travel or commuter mug made” and a “hidden gem.” It’s also so confidently leakproof, one reviewr swears it can be “used as a football.” If you’re on the hunt for that end-all-be-all travel companion, grab this one while it’s on sale! This 16-ounce travel mug features stainless steel vacuum insulation for keeping beverages hot or cold for hours, plus it has a BPA-free plastic lid flip lid for one-handed use and a wide mouth for accommodating full-size ice cubes. It’ll fit in your cup holder, thankfully, and so many users believe it’s truly the best out. Take this review, for example: ”This is the hands down the best travel mug made. It is so good that my coffee from two days was still warm when I poured it out. It is so good that you have to be careful to get the beverage to the right temperature BEFORE you close the lid.” Or this rave one, who says it’s the best they’ve tried: “I have also bought many mugs of various brands, including Yeti and Contigo [and many] others. My Zojirushi mug outdoes all of them.” Although it’s available in several colors, the lowest price is on its frosty blue model. But if you’re on the hunt for something more colorful, check around the product listing to see other on-sale colors! “This is the hands down the best travel mug made. It is so good that my coffee from two days was still warm when I poured it out. It is so good that you have to be careful to get the beverage to the right temperature BEFORE you close the lid. Otherwise you have a very hot beverage that is difficult to cool without taking off the lid. I have two colors, flat black and the pink. I will say that the pink from my wife’s mug has worn down a bit after three years but it still looks great. My flat black one is going strong after two years. Both go through the dishwasher day after day. This mug is well worth the slightly higher price. It never leaks, not once. Sipping is easy and there is no splash factor as you sip. Plus they just look cool and you get a satisfying pop every time you open the lid.” — C. Drake  “[…] This really is my idea of a perfect travel mug. You can’t make it leak (even when you throw it sideways into a purse for a few hours), you really can use it one-handed, and it really does keep the drinks hot. I’ve done tea in this as well and it was just as good an experience; Never tried hot cocoa as zojirushi advises against milk products being used (If I recall correctly, it was something to do with the pressurized, sealed containers being able to build pressure due to milk doing what milk does). Regardless, what I’ve asked of it, the mug has proceeded to do with flying colors. I cannot recommend this mug strongly enough. If you ever find yourself wanting to have a small, reliable, and easy-to-use travel mug, then you cannot go wrong with zojirushi.” — Emily (This review has beeen edited for length. Read the full review.)  “This bottle is game changer. I purchased millions of bottles only to abandon them after a few uses. This one is a keeper! I actually stopped drinking from my mugs at home as they do not hold temperature well. Heated mugs ruin the taste. This one holds temperature forever. It is sleek and attractive design. Beautiful lavender color. 16oz is perfect size. I purchased 20oz before and returned it as it was too tall and I never could finish the tea I make in these mugs. Another important feature is the mouth of this mug. It is non-drip and it does not pour out like crazy, but at the same time, the drinking reservoir is rather wide. There are other models with very narrow mouth and I wasn’t big fan of the narrow design as it stresses my mouth somehow. This mug is perfection!” — Oxana S.  “This is by far the best thermos I have ever owned. I work in the trucking-logistics industry and I go into work early in the mornings. This thing keeps my coffee warm all the way until lunch with the top open! Not just warm but up until around 10 am I still have to be careful not to burn my tongue. I love it. Doesn’t leak. Easy to wash. The only draw back is the top is a little hard to get apart to hand wash but once you learn how it works it’s no biggie. Definitely worth the money. If you’re looking to buy one I don’t think you’ll be disappointed in this one at least this old trucker thinks so, lol if that means anything.” — Billy  “I bought my Zojirushu from Amazon in 2013 and bought one as a gift for my boss the following Christmas. Since then I have also bought many mugs of various brands, including Yeti and Contigo among others. My Zojirushi mug outdoes all of them. I like my coffee screaming hot from the first sip to the last, and I have a tendency to linger an hour or more over my first cup of the morning. Often I’ll set my cup of coffee down, then get busy and don’t get back to it for several hours. I have also left my coffee in the car until the end of the workday. In all of these instances the Zojirushi has kept my coffee very, very hot.

    "title": "Trevor Noah Had Trump On His Mind During Grammys Monologue",
    "text": "Trevor Noah didn’t shy away from politics while hosting this year’s Grammy Awards. The former host of “The Daily Show” weighed in on several of President Donald Trump’s most controversial new policies at the event, where he riffed on immigration, tariff wars and more during his opening monologue. “There’s been a few changes in Washington. So I’m gonna enjoy tonight because this may be my last time I get to host anything in this country,” the South African comic smirked. Taking a swipe at one of the president’s favorite election conspiracies, Noah joked that the Grammy’s voting body, the Recording Academy, was made up of 13,000 industry professionals and “20 million illegal immigrants.” (Though the quip appeared to be mocking Trump, the entertainer earned heaps of online criticism for making immigrants the butt of the joke.) As Noah’s commentary continued, he mentioned superstar Beyoncé’s latest tour news and wondered if the president’s threats of a trade war might make life too expensive for anyone to afford concert tickets. “There’s tariffs,” he reminded the audience. “We can’t afford a new tour, right? Maple syrup is about to be $50.” While Noah was kidding, soaring prices for Canadian goods may soon be a reality for Americans. One day after Trump followed through on his threats to levy 25% tariffs on products coming into the U.S. from its northern neighbor, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau retaliated by declaring the same import tax on an array of American commodities. Trudeau’s decision was a coordinated effort with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whose own country was also targeted by Trump’s Saturday executive order. Trump defended his actions in a Sunday morning post on Truth Social, in which he accused Canada, Mexico and China of engaging in a “decades long ripoff of America.” We're bringing you the exclusives, scoops and hot takes on the news all your friends are talking about.

    "title": "Trump Defends Tariffs, Says There May Be 'Some Pain' To 'Make America Great Again'",
    "text": "President Donald Trump said there may be “pain” in making America “great again” when he defended his decision to impose tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in a Truth Social post on Sunday. “THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA,” Trump wrote. “WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE — AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!” Canada and Mexico have ordered retaliatory tariffs, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Saturday that the tariffs split America and Canada apart instead of “bringing us together.” In Trump’s post, he also shot back at the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board — which published an article on Friday about the president’s tariffs titled “The Dumbest Trade War in History” — saying that the outlet is “always wrong” and that it is “working hard to justify Countries like Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name, continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into AMERICA.” He went on, saying that America has “major deficits” with Canada, Mexico and China, and that the U.S. won’t be “the ‘stupid country’ any longer.” “MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS! Why should the United States lose TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIZING OTHER COUNTRIES, and why should these other countries pay a small fraction of the cost of what USA citizens pay for Drugs and Pharmaceuticals, as an example?” he said. Experts have predicted that the tariffs could make car parts, gasoline, alcohol and many other products more expensive for Americans.

    "title": "Trump DOJ Accused of Deleting Evidence In Jan. 6 Court Cases",
    "text": "Federal courts and judges have repeatedly ordered that any evidence or exhibits tied to Jan. 6 cases be placed in an online portal. But some of those records have “disappeared” over the last week, according to a motion filed Tuesday in federal court. At its peak, the portal contained tens of thousands of records including videos, images, testimony, audio recordings, text messages and more. The Press Coalition, a group of 14 media organizations, first sought to secure all Jan. 6 trial records in 2021, resulting in a standing order for the Justice Department to preserve video exhibits from the attack on the U.S. Capitol in a portal known as USAfx. Journalists and lawyers alike can access the portal once the government grants them authorization. But this week, the Press Coalition said video exhibits entered for at least one Capitol riot defendant, Glen Mitchell Simon, are missing. When the group asked the Justice Department about it, the department “offered no explanation for why these judicial records are no longer publicly accessible or whether any other Capitol riot records that were previously available on USAfx have disappeared as well,” according to the lawsuit. The motion asks the court to order the Justice Department to restore Simon’s file to USAfx within 48 hours, explain why the records are missing and disclose whether any other videos or records were removed in violation of the 2021 court order. The coalition also wants the court to order that no other records be removed unless there is a formal request made to the judge, the Press Coalition is notified and permission is granted. Simon pleaded guilty in 2022 to a number of charges, including disorderly conduct in a restricted building. Prosecutors said Simon, wearing a plated vest, helped whip up the crowd by screaming at police and cursing at them, calling them “spineless fucking oath-violating little fucking weasels.” They said he also urged fellow rioters to seek out members of Congress as he stalked the inside of the U.S. Capitol building for more than an hour on Jan. 6, 2021. He was sentenced to eight months in prison in August 2022. The judge overseeing his case pointed out that he could have faced additional charges for lying to the FBI on at least two occasions, NBC News reported at the time. Now Simon’s case file on USAfx is missing all nine videos that were entered into evidence. “The video exhibits are judicial records subject to the public rights of access under the First Amendment and common law, and judges have determined, case by case, that the public is entitled to access each of the Video Exhibits,” the Press Coalition wrote Tuesday. The coalition, which includes CNN, ABC, The Associated Press, CBS, NPR and The New York Times, notes that in the days since President Donald Trump first issued pardons and commutations for Jan. 6 rioters, federal judges have repeatedly hit back at Trump’s proclamation that his pardons were rectifying the “grave national injustice” that was investigating the attack on the Capitol and the subsequent 1,500-plus prosecutions that followed. The coalition reminded the court of something U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, who oversaw the case of former U.S. Marine Major Christopher Warnagiris, recently said about Jan. 6 charges. Warnagiris was convicted of assaulting police during the Capitol riot. The charges were “fully supported by evidence in the form of extensive videotapes and photographs, admissions by defendants in the course of plea hearings and in testimony at trials, and the testimony of law enforcement officers and congressional staff present at the Capitol on that day,” Friedman said last month. “This Court cannot let stand the revisionist myth relayed in this presidential pronouncement,” he added. The right to access such evidence does not “dissipate merely because all of the Capitol Case defendants have been pardoned,” the Press Coalition’s lawyer, Charles Tobin, said. “To the contrary, the public interest in ensuring that the video exhibits remain available in the future is all the greater, given that these videos ‘are immutable and represent the truth, no matter how the events of January 6 are described by those charged or their allies.’” The Justice Department under the Trump administration has been wiping evidence of rioters’ crimes from the internet since January.

    "title": "Trump Signs Trivial Executive Order To Oust Paper Straw Usage",
    "text": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday aimed at rolling back the federal push for the use of paper straws over plastic ones. “We’re going back to plastic straws,” Trump said when signing the order, claiming that paper straws simply “don’t work.” “On occasion, [paper straws] break. They explode. If something’s hot, they don’t last very long — like a matter of minutes, sometimes a matter of seconds. It’s a ridiculous situation so we’re going back to plastic straws,” he added. (Paper straws are not known to explode.) Trump has disliked what he refers to as “liberal paper straws” since at least 2019, when he launched his own brand of plastic straws. “I do think we have bigger problems than plastic straws,” Trump said in 2019. “You have a little straw, but what about the plates, the wrappers and everything else that are much bigger and they’re made of the same material?” Trump’s order reverses former President Joe Biden’s administration’s effort to completely phase out single-use plastic, including plastic straws, in federal operations by 2035. The move fell in line with Biden’s executive order on Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs through Federal Sustainability. The United Nations Environment Program estimates that humans produce 430 million metric tons of plastic per year — and just 9% of that is successfully recycled. What’s more is that plastic, unlike paper, can take centuries to decompose. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Trump Plans To Nullify New Federal Union Contracts",
    "text": "President Donald Trump said late Friday that he plans to nullify federal employee union contracts that agencies agreed to late in former President Joe Biden’s term. In a memo to agency heads, Trump said that Biden officials had negotiated new collective bargaining agreements meant “to harm my Administration,” in part by undermining his return-to-office mandate, and that he intended to scrap them and bargain his own. He referred specifically to a contract ratified with the Education Department days before he took office. “Such last-minute, lame-duck CBAs, which purport to bind a new President to his predecessor’s policies, run counter to America’s system of democratic self-government,” he claimed. The memo did not make clear his legal justification for nullifying existing union contracts. He referred to a 2010 Supreme Court decision that stated that a president “cannot choose to bind his successors by diminishing their powers.” “Therefore, it is the policy of the executive branch,” Trump proclaimed, that contracts negotiated within 30 days prior to a presidential inauguration “shall not be approved.” He said that contracts involving federal law enforcement would be exempted. “If our contracts are violated, we will aggressively defend them.” The American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing some 800,000 workers, said Trump would be breaching legally binding contracts. The union called it an attempt to “frighten and confuse career federal employees.” “Federal employees should know that approved union contracts are enforceable by law, and the president does not have the authority to make unilateral changes to those agreements,” Everett Kelley, the union’s president, said in a statement. “AFGE members will not be intimidated. If our contracts are violated, we will aggressively defend them.” Unions at many federal agencies made a point of negotiating new contracts last year before the Trump administration arrived, with an eye toward locking in contractual protections. Trump has promised to lay off workers en masse, weaken job protections and end the remote work arrangements that federal employees have had for years. HuffPost reported last week on negotiations at the Federal Trade Commission, where a group of attorneys, economists and statisticians secured a temporary contract the weekend before Trump appointed a new Republican chair. Such late agreements appear to be the sort Trump is looking to wipe out early in his tenure. Warring with the federal workforce was a hallmark of Trump’s first presidency, and he’s quickly picking up where he left off. On his first day in office he issued an executive order outlining his intention to reclassify tens of thousands of civil servants to make it easier to fire them. Meanwhile, the Office of Personnel Management is offering federal workers a deferred resignation program, suggesting they could resign now and still be paid through September. OPM sent out a follow-up email about that offer Thursday, answering some frequently asked questions and insulting workers in the process. “We encourage you to find a job in the private sector as soon as you would like to do so,” the email explained. “The way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from their lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Federal Judge Says Trump Administration Is Violating His Order To Halt Funding Freeze",
    "text": "The Trump administration is violating a court mandated restraining order prohibiting it from freezing federal funds in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget memo authorizing a broad freeze on Jan. 27, a federal judge said on Monday. Judge John McConnell, the chief judge of the District Court of Rhode Island, ordered the administration to “immediately restore frozen funding” in order to comply with the temporary restraining order he issued blocking the implementation of the OMB memo on Jan. 31. “The States have presented evidence in this motion that the Defendants in some cases have continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds,” McConnell wrote in an order released on Monday. McConnell’s order for the administration to follow the law and obey the court’s decisions comes as high-level officials from Vice President JD Vance to domestic policy advisor Stephen Miller publicly argued that courts have no authority to block policies implemented by the president. It is not immediately clear whether the administration’s failure to comply with McConnell’s order is an intentional effort to disobey the court or an attempt to circumvent its order by claiming authority to freeze funds from presidential directives other than the OMB memo. When OMB issued its funding freeze memo on Jan. 27 it caused a whirlwind of confusion and chaos as the vaguely worded memo seemingly applied to all federal grants, contracts and financial assistance. Payments portals for Medicaid, Head Start and housing, among others, went down. Health centers, day cares and support programs for the disabled were thrown into uncertainty. The administration rescinded the memo two days after its public release, but publicly stated that the orders laid out in the memo were still in effect. The memo was rescinded in order to get around another court restraining order blocking its implementation, administration spokespeople said. McConnell’s temporary restraining order soon followed suit. But funding remains frozen for numerous grantees and providers of federal financial assistance, according to the states who brought the suit. National Institutes of Health grant recipients reported that their funding was still frozen. Head Start providers and rural health centers similarly reported being unable to access their funds. Same with funding authorized by Congress through the Inflation Reduction Act and bipartisan infrastructure law. The National Head Start Association told HuffPost last week that dozens of providers across the country were unable to access the online portal they used to withdraw funds, leading some to begin ceasing operations. The Democratic attorneys general told the court last week that “many Head Start providers are considering layoffs, reduction of services, and even closure, because they do not have access to federal funds.” If the federal government doesn’t resume paying Head Start providers, the AGs said, states could wind up having to pay more for child care costs. On Monday, however, the National Head Start Association said it believed the holdup had been mostly resolved, and that only 10 providers had been having a problem as of Monday morning. The administration insisted in public statements and in a court filing that it wasn’t actively blocking the funds, and that the government’s payment management system “was continuing to work through a backlog of payment requests.” The administration also argued it should be able to pause other funds if the president said it should do so in an executive order that preceded the “pause” memo. McConnell ordered these funds be unfrozen immediately in order to comply with his original restraining order, while dismissing the administration’s “plea that they are just trying to root out fraud.” “[T]he freezes in effect now were a result of the broad categorical order, not a specific finding of possible fraud,” McConnell wrote. “The broad categorical and sweeping freeze of federal funds is, as the Court found, likely unconstitutional and has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to a vast portion of this country.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Judge Blocks Trump Attempt To Cap Medical Research",
    "text": "BOSTON (AP) — A U.S. district court judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s effort to cap medical research after attorneys general from 22 states filed a lawsuit Monday challenging the plan. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Boston challenges the Trump administration, the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health over efforts to reduce funding that goes to so-called indirect costs — including lab, faculty, infrastructure, and utility costs. The states argue that research into treating and curing human disease “will grind to a halt” and people would lose access to “modern gene editing, vaccines such as flu vaccines, and cures for diseases like cancer, infectious diseases, and addiction.” “We will not allow the Trump Administration to unlawfully undermine our economy, hamstring our competitiveness, or play politics with our public health,” Massachusetts Attorney Andrea Campbell said in a statement. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, whose state has several significant research institutions including Brown University and the University of Rhode Island, said the Trump administration seemed “hell-bent on upending advancement in this country.” “This reduction in funding would seriously threaten the future of this research,” Neronha said in a statement. “If you’ve ever wished for a cure, for better treatment options, for yourself or a loved one, this should feel personal.” Last week, the NIH announced it was cutting payments toward overhead costs for research institutions that receive its grants, a policy that could leave universities with major budget gaps. Currently, some universities receive 50% or more of the amount of a grant to put toward support staff and other needs, but that would be capped at 15%. The states want the court to declare that rate change unlawful. The lawsuit detailed how some research institutions would suffer. For example, the University of Michigan stands to lose $181 million in funding. which would impact “425 NIH-funded trials currently underway, including 161 trials aimed at saving lives,” according to the suit. And that, the suit said, would cost jobs. “Implementing this 15% cap will mean the abrupt loss of hundreds of millions of dollars that are already committed to employing tens of thousands of researchers and other workers, putting a halt to countless life-saving health research and cutting-edge technology initiatives,” the lawsuit said. Late Monday U.S. district court judge Angel Kelley granted the states’ request for a restraining order and scheduled a hearing for Feb. 21.

    "title": "Trump, Again, Complaining About China While Dismantling American ‘Soft Power’",
    "text": "WASHINGTON ― Eight years after sabotaging America’s efforts to combat China’s influence by pulling out of a long-negotiated trade deal, President Donald Trump is again taking steps likely to accrue to China’s benefit, this time by gutting the United States’ premier foreign aid agency. The U.S. Agency for International Development is taking the initial brunt of the assault against the federal government by Trump donor and quasi-White House aide Elon Musk, even while Trump and his White House bemoan China’s reach in the developing world. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday boasted of the success of Trump’s pressure on Panama to cut ties with China following Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s trip there. “Panama’s president said he will … no longer allow the participation in the Belt and Road Initiative,” she added, referring to China’s massive, decade-old international aid program. During that same press briefing, though, Leavitt continued her and the administration’s criticism of USAID. Leavitt did not respond to HuffPost queries for this story. Stuart Stevens, a Republican political consultant and Trump critic, said he learned firsthand about USAID’s value while working in 2006 on the first election campaign following the Democratic Republic of Congo’s long civil war, which had produced a generation of orphans who were being recruited by Al Qaeda and other violent groups on the one hand and mentored and given financial assistance by USAID workers on the other. “It was like a job fair for terrorist organization,” Stevens said, remembering American workers toiling in dangerous conditions for little pay. “It worked. Tens of thousands of these kids were steered in another direction.” Trump began his first term in a similar fashion, pulling the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the agreement crafted by former President Barack Obama to create a trading bloc of a dozen Pacific Rim countries, including those in Southeast Asia and South America. The arrangement was to encourage relations between countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia and the United States and its allies in the Americas, making it harder for China to make inroads. This use of so-called “soft power” is often considered more effective than shows of force using the military and is typically far less expensive. Ironically, one of the strategy’s strongest proponents in recent years has been Rubio himself, who through his entire Senate career defended humanitarian and development aid to poorer countries as a good investment for America. “Foreign aid is not charity. We must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security,” he wrote in a 2017 social media post. “I promise you it is going to be a lot harder to recruit someone to anti-Americanism and anti-American terrorism if the United States of America is the reason one is even alive today,” he said in a floor speech that same year. Now that he is Trump’s secretary of state, though, Rubio has modified his view of USAID. “In many cases, USAID is involved in programs that run counter to what we’re trying to do in our national strategy with that country or with that region,” he told reporters in El Salvador this week. Rubio also confirmed that he is now the acting director of the agency that Musk and Trump want to eliminate entirely or move into the State Department. Either option appears to require a new law, and it is unclear whether even a Republican-controlled Congress is interested in going along. Trump and his allies, meanwhile, are attacking another tool of soft power, the intelligence community. Trump’s CIA director, John Ratcliffe, has put out an early retirement offer to the workforce that could, if successful, replace experienced analysts with recruits chosen primarily because of their personally loyal to Trump. The net effect would be to damage the agency’s ability to provide accurate and nuanced information. “Elon and Trump are trying to buy out the CIA and [national security] agents that keep Americans safe,” Democratic Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), the ranking member of the Senate intelligence committee, wrote Thursday on social media. Separately, Musk appears to be plowing ahead in his continued attacks on USAID, which have included calling it a “criminal organization” and boasting that he spent the weekend “feeding USAID into the wood chipper.” On Wednesday, after an ally pointed out that former Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney once worked in USAID, Musk wrote: “Interesting.” Cheney, who won Trump’s ire with her service on the House select committee that investigated his Jan. 6, 2021, coup attempt, replied: “Damn right, @Elon. I’m proud of what America did to win the Cold War, defeat Soviet communism, and defend democracy. Our nation stood for freedom. You may be unfamiliar with that part of our history since you weren’t yet an American citizen.” To Stevens, the Trump administration’s attacks on USAID and other entities are yet more proof that they do not understand the government he was elected to run.

    "title": "Trump Administration Tries To Bring Back Fired Nuclear Weapons Workers In DOGE Reversal",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration has halted the firings of hundreds of federal employees who were tasked with working on the nation’s nuclear weapons programs, in an about-face that has left workers confused and experts cautioning that DOGE’s blind cost cutting will put communities at risk. Three U.S. officials who spoke to The Associated Press said up to 350 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration were abruptly laid off late Thursday, with some losing access to email before they’d learned they were fired, only to try to enter their offices on Friday morning to find they were locked out. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. One of the hardest hit offices was the Pantex Plant near Amarillo, Texas, which saw about 30% of the cuts. Those employees work on reassembling warheads, one of the most sensitive jobs across the nuclear weapons enterprise, with the highest levels of clearance. The hundreds let go at NNSA were part of a DOGE purge across the Department of Energy that targeted about 2,000 employees. “The DOGE people are coming in with absolutely no knowledge of what these departments are responsible for,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referencing Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team. “They don’t seem to realize that it’s actually the department of nuclear weapons more than it is the Department of Energy.” By late Friday night, the agency’s acting director, Teresa Robbins, issued a memo rescinding the firings for all but 28 of those hundreds of fired staff members. “This letter serves as formal notification that the termination decision issued to you on Feb. 13, 2025 has been rescinded, effective immediately,” said the memo, which was obtained by the AP. The accounts from the three officials contradict an official statement from the Department of Energy, which said fewer than 50 National Nuclear Security Administration staffers were let go, calling them “probationary employees” who “held primarily administrative and clerical roles.” But that wasn’t the case. The firings prompted one NNSA senior staffer to post a warning and call to action. “This is a pivotal moment. We must decide whether we are truly committed to leading on the world stage or if we are content with undermining the very systems that secure our nation’s future,” deputy division director Rob Plonski posted to LinkedIn. “Cutting the federal workforce responsible for these functions may be seen as reckless at best and adversarily opportunistic at worst.” While some of the Energy Department employees who were fired dealt with energy efficiency and the effects of climate change, issues not seen as priorities by the Trump administration, many others dealt with nuclear issues, even if they didn’t directly work on weapons programs. This included managing massive radioactive waste sites and ensuring the material there doesn’t further contaminate nearby communities. That incudes the Savannah River National Laboratory in Jackson, South Carolina; the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington state, where workers secure 177 high-level waste tanks from the site’s previous work producing plutonium for the atomic bomb; and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, a Superfund contamination site where much of the early work on the Manhattan Project was done, among others. U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio and U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, called the firings last week “utterly callous and dangerous.” The NNSA staff who had been reinstated could not all be reached after they were fired, and some were reconsidering whether to return to work, given the uncertainty created by DOGE. Many federal employees who had worked on the nation’s nuclear programs had spent their entire careers there, and there was a wave of retirements in recent years that cost the agency years of institutional knowledge.

But it’s now in the midst of a major $750 billion nuclear weapons modernization effort — including new land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, new stealth bombers and new submarine-launched warheads. In response, the labs have aggressively hired over the past few years: In 2023, 60% of the workforce had been there five years or less. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the firings could disrupt the day-to-day workings of the agency and create a sense of instability over the nuclear program both at home and abroad. “I think the signal to U.S. adversaries is pretty clear: throw a monkey wrench in the whole national security apparatus and cause disarray,” he said. “That can only benefit the adversaries of this country.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Trump Plans Tariffs On Mexico And Canada For Tuesday, While Doubling Existing 10% Tariffs On China",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump plans to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday, in addition to doubling the 10% universal tariff charged on imports from China. In a Truth Social post Thursday, Trump said illicit drugs such as fentanyl are being smuggled into the United States at “unacceptable levels” and that import taxes would force other countries to crack down on the trafficking. “We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,” the Republican president wrote. “China will likewise be charged an additional 10% Tariff on that date.” The prospect of escalating tariffs has already thrown the global economy into turmoil, with consumers expressing fears about inflation worsening and the auto sector and other domestic manufacturers suffering if Trump raises import taxes. But Trump has also at times engaged in aggressive posturing only to give last-minute reprieves, previously agreeing to a 30-day suspension of the Canada and Mexico tariffs that were initially supposed to start in February. The threat of tariffs frightened the stock market with the S&P 500 index falling 1.6% on Thursday. The S&P 500 is now just 1.4% higher than it was after Trump won the election in November, giving up almost all of the gains that the president once cited as evidence of an economic revival. Asked Thursday about the fact that tariffs are largely paid for consumers and importing companies, Trump dismissed any concerns by saying: “It’s a myth.” It’s possible for a stronger U.S. dollar to offset some of the costs of tariffs, but Trump’s statement goes against most economic modeling given the breadth of his planned taxes. Trump intends to put 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10% tax on Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity. The move, ostensibly about drug trafficking and immigration, led Mexico and Canada to respond by emphasizing their existing efforts to address these issues. Canada created a fentanyl czar, and Mexico sent 10,000 members of its National Guard to its border with the United States. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that she hoped to speak with Trump after the Cabinet-level meetings occurring in Washington this week. Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente was scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday afternoon. Trump, “as you know, has his way of communicating,” Sheinbaum said. But she said that her government would stay “cool-headed” and optimistic about an agreement coming together to avoid the tariffs. “I hope we are able to reach an agreement and on March 4 we can announce something else,” she said. She said Mexico’s security chiefs were discussing intelligence sharing with their American counterparts that would allow for important arrests in the U.S. On the economic front, she said Mexico’s goal is to protect the free trade pact that was negotiated during the first Trump administration between Mexico and the United States. That 2020 deal, which included Canada, was an update of the North American Free Trade Agreement from 1994. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country has invested more than 1 billion Canadian dollars to improve border security, adding that his government’s ministers and officials are also in Washington this week. “There is no emergency for the United States at the border with Canada when it comes to fentanyl, and that is exactly what we are demonstrating at this time,” Trudeau said in Montreal. “If the United States goes ahead and imposes tariffs, we already shared the details of our plan. We have $30 billion worth of U.S. products that will be subject to tariffs. And $125 billion of tariffs that will be applied three weeks later. But we don’t want to be in that position.” Trump did impose a 10% tariff on China for its role in the manufacturing of chemicals used to make fentanyl, and that tax would now be doubled, according to his social media post. On Thursday, China’s Commerce Minister Wang Wentao wrote to Jamieson Greer, the newly confirmed U.S. trade representative, that differences on trade should be resolved through dialogues and negotiations. The 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would amount to a total tax increase on the U.S. public of somewhere between $120 billion to $225 billion annually, according to Jacob Jensen, a trade policy analyst at the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. The additional China tariffs could cost consumers up to $25 billion. The potential for higher prices and slower growth could create political blowback for Trump, who promised voters in last year’s presidential election that he could quickly lower the inflation rate, which jumped during Democratic President Joe Biden’s term. But Trump also campaigned on imposing broad tariffs, which he plans to launch on April 2 by resetting them to match the taxes that he determines are charged by other countries on American goods. “The April Second Reciprocal Tariff date will remain in full force and effect,” Trump said as part of his new social media post. In an interview with News Nation, Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said progress by Mexico and Canada on fentanyl “was not as impressive as the president had hoped.” There are significant differences between Canada and Mexico on the scale of drug smuggling. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds (19.5 kilograms) of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last budget year, compared with 21,100 pounds (9,570 kilograms) at the Mexican border. Hassett stressed that the reciprocal tariffs would be in addition to the ones being placed on Canada and Mexico. Trump indicated Wednesday that European countries would also face a 25% tariff as part of his reciprocal tariffs. He also wants separate tariffs on autos, computer chips and pharmaceutical drugs that would be levied in addition to the reciprocal tariffs. The president already announced that he’s removing the exemptions on his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs, in addition to planning taxes on copper imports. The prospect of a broader trade conflict should other nations follow through with their own retaliatory tariffs is already spooking U.S. consumers, potentially undermining Trump’s promise to unleash stronger economic growth. The Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its consumer confidence index had dropped 7 points to a reading of 98.3. It was the largest monthly decline since August 2021, when inflationary pressures began to reverberate across the United States as the economy recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. Average 12-month inflation expectations jumped from 5.2% to 6% in February, the Conference Board noted. “There was a sharp increase in the mentions of trade and tariffs, back to a level unseen since 2019,” said Stephanie Guichard, a senior economist at the Conference Board. “Most notably, comments on the current administration and its policies dominated the responses.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday threw his support behind congressional efforts for a federal takeover of the nation’s capital, saying he approves putting the District of Columbia back under direct federal control. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump complained about crime and homelessness in the district, saying, “I think we should take over Washington, D.C. — make it safe.” He added, “I think that we should govern District of Columbia.” Under terms of the city’s Home Rule authority, Congress already vets all D.C. laws and can outright overturn them. Some congressional Republicans have sought to go further, eroding decades of the city’s limited autonomy and putting it back under direct federal control, as it was at its founding.

    "title": "Donald Trump Brings Big Entourage To Super Bowl — With 1 Key Person Seemingly MIA",
    "text": "President Donald Trump’s posse at Sunday’s Super Bowl game in New Orleans included Eric Trump, Lara Trump, Ivanka Trump and her son. But as the other members of the first family watched the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles vie for the championship, first lady Melania Trump was nowhere to be found. Melania Trump has made few public appearances since Trump lost to former President Joe Biden in 2020 and was rarely present during Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. In a statement Sunday, Trump said that the first lady “joins me in sending our best wishes for a great Super Bowl Sunday.” The president, who has indicated he believes the Chiefs will win, reportedly attended as a guest of Saints owner Gayle Benson. His appearance at the game marks the first time a sitting U.S. president has attended the annual NFL championship, leading to increased security measures, according to the Secret Service. “Extensive planning and coordination have been in place to ensure the safety of all attendees, players, and staff,” Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement Tuesday. Fox News’ Bret Baier interviewed Trump in a pre-recorded segment that aired before the start of the game. The interview, which is typically conducted by the channel hosting the game, has become somewhat of a standard practice for U.S. presidents, but Trump skipped the opportunity in 2018 during his first administration. Similarly, former President Joe Biden skipped the interview in 2023 and 2024. Trump has complimented Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes multiple times, including in his interview with Baier. “Obviously, it’s cool to hear that he’s seen me play football and respects the game that I play,” Mahomes told reporters Wednesday. Trump also received a warm welcome from Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who is dating Taylor Swift, the pop star Trump said he hates. “It’s a great honor,” Kelce told reporters on Wednesday. “No matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there — it’s the best country in the world — and that’s pretty cool.” Trump isn’t the only public figure with ties to politics who showed up to the game. Former first lady Jill Biden, a known Eagles fan, also joined with her grandson Hunter. Former President Joe Biden did not attend. Trump’s attendance at the big game follows his decision to attend the Army-Navy football game in December, accompanied by then-Vice President-elect JD Vance, now-Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Daniel Penny, who put a homeless Black man in a chokehold on the New York City subway in 2023. (Penny was acquitted of killing the man, Jordan Neely, in 2024.)

Use it to park your toothbrush, display your clear containers of cotton swabs or just to keep other small bottles from making rings around the sink. Promising review: \"OBSESSED with this item! I bought them for every sink in my house and for family and friends. It dries extremely fast and when it’s wet you can’t tell unless you look closely.

I love the additional labels to make your own as well. The make the bathroom look so clean.\" — Z 2,282 5-star ratings, 4.3 out of 5 stars If you like to grab a hat for sun protection before walking the dog or running errands, you may know the ever-expanding problem that is hat storage.

Promising review: \"I attached it on the end of my desk, the cables come from underneath and this just does a phenomenal job of keeping everything organized. I know where my charging cable is, and for me it works best with the apple watch charger. Always has the cable in the right orientation, you just slap the watch down on it and ding! it works. Solid buy, would recommend\" — Crest 2,218 5-star ratings, 4.3 out of 5 stars You'd be surprised at the difference thorough dusting can make.

    "text": "Check out a TikTok of the laundry spray in action. Promising review: \"For whatever reason, I am ALWAYS spilling things on my shirts and I cook every night (sometimes I remember the apron, sometimes I don't). My clothes are a mess by the end of the day. I'm not proud of it, but there it is. I have tried EVERYTHING there is to remove stains and this is the absolute BEST thing out there. (There is simply not a major stain remover that I have not tried.) The only thing close is a long pre-soak (I mean like six hours) in Oxyclean. With Puracy, you get the best result by doing it well in advance, but for me that is another plus because I would far rather spray them when I put them in the hamper than do it all at once just before I do the laundry. It seems to get everything out and I've never had any trouble with damaged fabric. I don't really review very much, but this is seriously outstanding.\" — NYC Buyer Promising review: \"Super easy to install and cut down all light from my TV’s LED indicator after two stickers — plus, I can still use the remote, no problem! This made my life so much better with just a sticker. Definitely recommend!\" — Em Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans even patients with \"great\" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines. Promising review: \"I normally don't feel compelled to write reviews for products. With that said, this is the best toothbrush I have ever used in my entire life. Using this toothbrush feels like I am rubbing velvet on my teeth. This toothbrush literally improved my quality of life.\" — Travis Haddock Dr. Tung's is a US-based small biz that specializes in oral care products. Promising review: \"I had a tool similar to this years ago but it was plastic and shaped a little differently and I just didn’t see much results so I didn’t stick with using it. But this tongue scraper is by far above and beyond anything I have used in the past. The immediate results were disgusting, which in this case is a good thing ;-). I’m very happy with the quality of product and the way in which this handy little tool performs. An added plus is the cute travel bag which comes with your purchase. Solid purchase!\" — Lyra18Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in multipacks). Promising review: \"Wonderful and has literally changed my life for the better!! I have some darker hair in the mustache area, and have been plucking and waxing those things for years!! Saw these on the Momfessionals blog and decided to go against everything that I had ever been told for 30-plus years. ... I decided to shave that mustache!!! It has made my life so much better! Have been doing this for about a month and only have to about once a week. If you’re on the fence, go for this. Don’t waste another second waxing or plucking. I do clean the blade after each use with a little rubbing alcohol!! Get this to make your life easier. Also, my hair is no thicker than it was before (when I waxed and plucked)...so go for it!!\" — Jonathan ChooMee is a small biz based in Northern California that specializes in innovative products to solve everyday feeding challenges.Promising review: \"It's made my life better. I can hand over a pouch to my screaming 1.5-year-old in the carseat while driving and not worry about puree getting everywhere!\" — Puking Kitty Gravy Boat Promising review: \"I have never reviewed an Amazon product before, but this product has made my life so much better. I had tried vitamins, different shampoos, increased water intake, and nothing gave me results for a healthier, less itchy scalp like this product has. I'm thankful to have it!\" — Megan It fits any phone up to seven inches diagonally, and you can also use it to keep your ID and money from getting wet! BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord says, \"It's also a great fix for keeping out sand and dirt (and a great option for runners, if you're caught in the rain but still want to be able to toggle through your music options).\"Promising review: \"I purchased this case in July for an upcoming canoe trip with a friend, and as luck would have it, we flipped our canoe. Being the rebel that I am, I chose not to wear my phone around my neck, and so it, my ID, and my debit card ended up at the bottom of the river and I just assumed it would be discovered a thousand years from now and placed in a museum as an ancient artifact. Fast-forward to this week. I was contacted via FB by an Alachua County Sheriff’s Office diver and guess what he found? Yup, my phone case with all of the contents intact and dry as a bone! He had to cut the case open, but there was not one single drop of water in it and he ended up purchasing a case for himself because he was just that impressed!\" — Julie McDonald It also can help tighten the appearance of eye wrinkles if you'd prefer for them not to be as noticeable. And here's a tip! It reduces puffiness faster if used after refrigeration.Promising review: \"Say goodbye to puffiness in seconds. I saw this on a BuzzFeed article and thought it was so cute. I've used Clinique and It Cosmetics eye creams and they are great but this is different. I like this more for morning/pre-makeup. It absorbs in literal seconds! And it gets rid of puffiness super quickly. This is perfect for mornings. This is my new holy grail eye cream. A few swipes on the eye lip and under the eye and I'm good to go. No tapping in.\" — ChrisTb Promising review: \"Where has this stuff been in all of my 46 years! Cleaned my stove like is wasn't even dirty! I simply put a small amount on my sponge and attacked the baked-on crud! It came off easily with just a small amount of elbow grease. 💪🏼 Nothing like I normally have to do with spraying stinky, fuming oven cleaner and letting it sit, scrub, and then repeating over and over until it's clean! This has made my life so much better! Now off to tackle the hard water spots and soap scum in the shower!!\" — Jenny Check out this TikTok of the Folex carpet spot remover to see it in action! Promising review: “There are products that you love and buy again. And then there are products that you love and can’t live without. And then above that, are a few select products that you revere and hold with the highest honor. Folex is that product. I have used Folex for years and it works wonders on everything from spilt coffee, wine, and dog messes, without any chemical smells or residue. But my love for Folex grew so much deeper when I dropped a 32-ounce jar of salsa down the stairs. My husband took one look and declared that the stairs were ruined and would need to be replaced. I took a look, grabbed the Folex and said, 'We’ve got this.' If you have children, pets or are very clumsy with your canned goods, you need this bulk-size jug in your arsenal of cleaning supplies.” — Carobnty Promising review: \"I love the variety of scents that linger long enough to work for the purpose intended. I love giving them as gifts!!!\" — AML Promising review: \"I keep chuckling about how much this simple, inexpensive device has improved my life. Instead of struggling to cut pills in half and sending tiny particles scattering all over the place — I press down one quick time and POOF! The pill is cut almost exactly in half with little or no stray particles. I LOVE this little thing. LOL.\" — J.Ro Promising review: \"Found it on TikTok and I’m so pleased with the results. My nails are getting stronger and growing. And the best of all, not chipping. Love it.\" — sidna saavedra Check out a TikTok of the key rock in action. Promising review: \"This fake rock was exactly what I had been hoping to find. It blends in extremely well with the rock from my landscaping, and the key fits inside perfectly. The slide on the bottom was very easy to close as well. I definitely recommend it!\" — P Gilroy Promising review: \"It does what it says: extends your bra fit for comfort and to reduce bra lines in back. It does not stretch (I found the stretchy ones didn't provide enough support). These are very soft and comfortable. I didn't realize how important that was until I ordered a different brand and they were torture — itchy and stiff and awful, even after washing. I ditched them and immediately reordered this brand so I'd always have enough on hand!\" — McNally16 Promising review: \"Since I started using these clips, I haven't had to pull up my straps a single time! I used to have to pull them back up a dozen times a day. No more. Now I can put on my bra and then just forget that it is there. I don't notice any change in the fit of my bra. I wear a large cup size and the last thing I wanted was to add to that. However, with the straps fully extended on my bra, I find the fit to be essentially the same as before. The only difference is that the straps stay in place. If you've ever struggled to keep your straps up, you owe it to yourself to try this product.\" — K. Howe Promising review: \"This stuff works like magic. I’m 33 and I’ve dealt with bad back acne since I was a teenager. After one week of using this, my back is night and day different. Just remember to not wash it off immediately. Let it sit on your skin for about two minutes for it to work. — Filburt_Turtle Promising review: \"Folks. Buy it. This is like head lice treatment. If you are looking at it and thinking about it, YOU NEED IT. And this stuff. Is. Awesome. Literally, chunks of ear wax came out of my ear holes the SIZE OF CORN KERNELS. Where was this coming from? Why is my body making so much wax? Where was it being stored because I did NOT think ear canals were that spacious, but apparently there are some storage closets in there or something because HOLY MARY MOTHER OF GOD the ear nuggets are real. My ears feel so squeaky clean! And get this, my hair makes sounds. Like I put it up in a hair tie afterwards, and I could HEAR MY HAIR MOVING ON MY HEAD. What is that?! Seriously?! If you also did not know that moving hair creates a sound, you need to buy this product ASAP.\" — Samantha Promising review: \"I get a spray tan every week and removing it is my least favorite part of the process. Previously, I have used “exfoliate gloves” which result in scrubbing at my skin for 30 minutes, just to leave it patchy & still in tact. I used this product for the first time this evening… WOW. The entire process took 10 minutes, fully removed my tan, and left my skin feeling so soft. I wish I would have purchased this sooner and would recommend to anyone in the same situation!\" — Kristin De Stefano Promising review: \"This tape works wonders. I am trying to get a recent move paid off, so I really couldn't afford to replace screens at this point, even if I did them myself. This tape made all the difference in my house. I no longer had to leave the windows closed worrying about sitting on the couch with fly swatter in hand, or watching my cats zoom around the house trying to catch them, and knocking everything over in the process.\" — MsRich2U New parents, don't panic. Cradle cap — aka seborrheic dermatitis — is a very common dry scalp condition that affects infants.Promising review: \"The pictures posted here are legit. It makes removal so much easier and gives more consistent removal than my previous method of washcloths or just scratching the cradle cap off with my fingernails. It’s amazing and gross and wonderful. My babe doesn’t even flinch when I spend 10 minutes clearing his scalp of all the goo. It seems to be soothing to him. I just apply baby shampoo, then brush a little with the blue brush. Then I slowly start to comb in sections all in one direction. Then I go back and forth in different directions. It’s shocking the amount of dead skin that comes off. I’ve even used it successfully in his eyebrows (he gets some cradle cap there, too). This is a KEEPER!\" — ZMomUtah Promising reviews: \"My 3-year-old's favorite activity had become shutting our cats in rooms so they could not get out, leading us to have to stop what we were doing to come to the rescue and answer their cries for freedom dozens of times a day. These are sturdy, fit snugly, hold up to attempted slammings — they do the job! Maybe a little overpriced for some pieces of foam, but whatever — they’ve made my life so much better, I’d buy them all over again!\" — Mandy Promising review: \"Saw on TikTok (don’t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you’re left with a clean sink! I use with other drain cleaning products, but would 100% recommend for weekly maintenance.\" — Jessica House See it in action on TikTok here. Promising review: \"Mosquitoes love me. I have yet to find a topical that actually helps and as much as I hated to spend $10 on this thing, it might be the best $10 I've ever spent. This thing actually works and has already saved me much itchy misery. It's easy to use and you don't need to use it immediately after the bite in order to get some relief (better if it's soon I'd say, but I've also used it hours later and it helps!).\" — KrisinCO Promising review: \"New holy grail! These sponges are amazing! I've been buying the Beauty Blender for years, and as you all know, they are $20 for just one. An aunt of mine had ordered these, and I tried one and was amazed by the quality. These are my new go-to everyday sponge. I love them!! You get five for half the price of a Beauty Blender. These double in size when wet, and they apply foundation flawlessly...so if you are debating, just buy them! You won't be disappointed 😊\" — tsAileen S Promising review: \"My grill accumulated a lot of crud as a result of many cookouts. I tried to keep it as clean as possible with a wire brush and various cleaning pads and cleaners. I never could get the rack and grates to look like new. There was always a layer of permanent food residue, carbon, and other debris that defied removal. I decided to give the Magic Stone Grill Cleaner a shot. Surprise! Surprise! This is truly a magic stone. It removed everything from the grill parts that I worked on and left them looking like new. The cleaning process did put grooves in the bottom of the stone and that helped to get the sides cleaned off as well.\" — Duffer. Promising review: \"I bought it hoping my elderly cat would stop pestering me constantly to brush him. It was the best money ever spent. He took to it immediately and spent 10 minutes after I installed it just brushing himself. He loves it and is happy, so I’m happy.\" — allison For more info on how to use acupressure for nausea management, check out this guide from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Promising review: \"I have gotten car sickness for as long as I can remember, even as a child. I am 40 now. I was recently asked to go on a road trip which included day travel, busy city and mountains. (Sun, stop-and-go traffic, and winding roads are all triggers for sickness). I hesitated. It was then recommended by a family member to try these. With hesitation, I bought them and wore them the entire time. I did not feel nauseous ONE time. My boyfriend even pointed out on the way home that I was on my phone and not sick. (Reading anything while riding has ALWAYS been a no go!) I was able to look out the window and enjoy the scenery (typically I can only look at the road as looking outside the window makes me sick). These will literally change my life as I can now enjoy traveling by car!!\" — Sarah Martinez This personal makeup assistant comes in three different finishes — matte, dewy, and plump. Fun fact: The reviewer in the second photo said they worked a 12-hour shift bartending and thanks to this setting spray, their makeup still looked fabulous.Promising review: \"Such a great product at an awesome price point. My makeup stays on all day without slipping and this product has become a holy grail makeup essential for me. Especially in the hot summer months, I can really tell the difference in how well my makeup stays on with this product. Really impressed and would recommend it to all my friends and family..\" — Cathryn Scharfenberg Promising reviews: \"Got these, and my life has improved. Wires stay handy. Gave a few to my son, and he’s happy, too.\" — Kindle reader\"Love these! This solved the problem of unplugging something (iPad, phone, etc.) and having the cord fall off my nightstand.

    "title": "This Marshmallow-Soft Wearable Blanket Is Also Shockingly Practical",
    "text": "As a shopping reporter, I tried, sampled and tested my way through many products in the year 2024 — but none were as loved or used nearly as much as the UnHide Shleepy robe, a versatile and supremely cozy piece of loungewear that I haven’t stopped wearing since the day I got it. I will admit that I hemmed and hawed over the $100 that it would take to get this cozy garment in my possession; however, once I took the plunge, I quickly realized that the Shleepy was so much more than a bathrobe but something I could throw on for literally anything whether it’s lounging around the apartment, throwing on after the shower or running a quick errand. I even wear it to sleep on especially cold evenings. Part of its all-purpose capability comes from its clever design. The Shleepy is an intentionally oversized hoodie that feels as if you’re wearing a blanket but, without all the presumed clumsiness. Despite its enveloping feel, I can still manage to wash dishes, do my skin care routine and perform other tasks without any kind of impeded movement. This is largely thanks to the strong elasticized cuffs that will keep your sleeves exactly where you want them, without falling or cutting off your circulation. I adore the shawl-like neckline that goes into a hood, which feels almost as if I’m wearing a scarf, sans any suffocating sensations. I’m also obsessed with the billowy sleeves and generous deep pockets that can hold my phone, extra tissues, keys and even my wallet. Another key factor in UnHide’s cozy invention is the material it’s made out of — an incredibly plush faux shearling that feels fleecy, but softer and almost marshmallow-like. I’m very sensitive to certain fabrics and have a lot of issues with textures, so I was incredibly relieved to find that the Shleepy managed to not trigger any of my sensory problems, even after several cycles through the washing machine. And as someone who tends to run cold most of the time, I genuinely appreciate how warm this robe keeps me. It even makes waking up in the early hours easier because I can just wrap myself in the Shleepy and go about my morning routine. As I mentioned earlier, the robe, which comes in up to six colors and gender-neutral sizes S-XL, is intended to fit roomy. Based on this, I first tried my regular size, but because I was after even a cozier fit, I returned it for a size up and was much happier because I was really able to wrap myself in the robe and have that sensation of cuddling up inside a blanket. Many reviewers followed my lead with this concept, with some Shleepy owners even purchasing multiple sizes so they have one robe to wear at home, and the other to wear outside the house. Several others have echoed my adoration of the UnHide Schleepy robe in the review section of Amazon (which you can read for yourself down below). Otherwise, grab one for yourself from any of the retailers above. Promising Amazon reviews: “This is the softest, warmest, most snugglable thing you will ever own! I practically live in it. I tried a couple of other types of less expensive sweater/jacket/wrap-type things and was not satisfied. So I bit the bullet and purchased it. Loved it immediately. I wear an 18 in clothes. I got the XL, which is huge... and wonderful! Really long sleeves. When I’m too warm wearing it, I drape it over my shoulders. When I nap in the recliner, I’m snuggled up in it. It really relaxes me. When I couldn’t fall asleep in bed, I turned to my ‘Yeti’ coat, and it worked! Ended up getting several for family members at Christmas. You will not be disappointed!UPDATE Dec 2024: If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Washes beautifully. Absolutely no issues with it. So light and cozy and warm. I ordered a second one to keep in my bed. l can’t imagine anyone not loving it.” — Voracious Reader “I haven’t taken this off since it was delivered earlier. I’m in love with it. It’s so soft and cosy, much warmer than I expected, and looks fab. I ordered XL as I always err to the larger size and I’m thrilled at how large it is, letting me wrap myself up in it completely. Mine did come with a little bit of the stitching on the edge undone, but nothing fabric glue can’t put right.The pockets are more than big enough for my iPhone pro max or to fit my wallet if I need to nip out for an errand. This is going to be a game changer for autumn walks with my dog, and my cats already think I’ve bought this for their benefit when they snuggle up to me.” — Alex “Lightweight, washable and very warm shorter robe. I really enjoy wearing this particular robe as it’s warm and not bulky.” — MsMellie0488 “I love how snuggly this jacket is. It runs HUGE. I ordered a Large and it wraps about another half around me. I also love how LONG the sleeves are. I rarely find sleeves long enough to cover my wrists. They stay at your wrist with elastic like joggers. I’m back to order another, but in a Medium so I can wear this out of the house. Super cute with sherpa UGGs. I’m 5′9″ and about 180 lbs.” — J Kelley By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

    "title": "Unions Sue Treasury Department Over 'DOGE' Access To Sensitive Data",
    "text": "A pair of labor unions has sued the Treasury Department for granting the Trump administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency” access to the federal government’s payment systems. The American Federation of Government Employees and the Service Employees International Union filed their lawsuit on Monday, alleging Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent violated federal law meant to protect people’s sensitive personal and financial information. The New York Times reported Saturday that Bessent provided the data access to representatives of DOGE, which President Donald Trump has tasked with eliminating federal jobs and cutting government spending. DOGE, which is not a real government agency, is led by Trump ally Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. “DOGE’s access to the payment systems has raised concerns that it could provide Musk’s team with a way to block spending that’s been authorized by Congress.” The unions, which both represent federal employees, called the alleged privacy intrusion “massive and unprecedented.” “People who must share information with the federal government should not be forced to share information with Elon Musk or his ‘DOGE,’” the complaint states. “And federal law says they do not have to.” The unions were joined in the lawsuit by a labor-backed advocacy group called Alliance for Retired Americans, which said the Treasury Department had endangered the data of its members receiving Social Security benefits. DOGE’s access to the payment systems has raised concerns that it could provide Musk’s team with a way to block spending that’s been authorized by Congress. The Treasury payment systems handle Social Security and Medicare disbursements as well as payments to federal contractors, totaling trillions of dollars annually. The unions are asking that a federal judge issue an injunction to stop the “unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure” of the data. Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to Bessent on Friday saying he was “deeply concerned” that Musk sought access to the systems in order to “illegally withhold payments to any number of programs.” Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "Grim Memories Resurface After DNA Advances Lead To Arrest Of Suspect In Hawaii Teen's 1977 Murder",
    "text": "HONOLULU (AP) — Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz. She had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu’s McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building. “I don’t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,” Chun Oakland said. Chun Oakland didn’t know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home. The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, appeared in court via video on Friday from a hospital bed in the medical wing of a Utah jail. Castro told the judge he wanted to hire his own attorney and was ordered to return virtually to Salt Lake County District Court for an initial appearance on Wednesday. He remained in custody Friday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office records. Castro faces eventual extradition to Honolulu. His current court-appointed attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment. “I was just really sad,” Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. “I think for our student body, of course, there’s that concern that what if he’s still out there and he does it to somebody else.” On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said. Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school’s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found remains a core memory. Momohara’s sister — one of Okamura’s flute players — arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated. “The other students were trying to console her,” Okamura said. “At that point, I couldn’t have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.” She didn’t return to school for weeks afterward. He doesn’t remember the sister’s name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister. The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said. Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac LeMans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school’s English building, Thoemmes said. The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone. Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus. In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara’s underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects — two brothers who had been interviewed in 1977. Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance. In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They “surreptitiously” obtained DNA from one of the brother’s adult children, Thoemmes said. Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro’s adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said. He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder. Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro. Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara’s killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program providing services for sexual assault survivors. The former lawmaker said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years. “I think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,” she said.

    "title": "Attorney General Pam Bondi Rails Against New York Leaders As She Announces Immigration Lawsuit",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s newly installed attorney general, Pam Bondi, went after New York leaders Wednesday over the state’s immigration policies, announcing a lawsuit in the latest effort by the Republican administration to carry out the president’s hardline immigration campaign pledges. In her first press conference since taking office last week, Bondi accused New York leaders of prioritizing “illegal aliens over American citizens.” Standing in front of federal agents who have been tasked with helping in Trump’s immigration crackdown, she echoed the president’s rhetoric as she vowed the Justice Department would take on communities that thwart federal immigration efforts. The lawsuit against New York Attorney General Letitia James and Gov. Kathy Hochul targets a state law that allows people who might not be in the U.S. legally to get driver’s licenses. The so-called Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers. The lawsuit describes the law as “a frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.” It highlights a provision that requires the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information. The Justice Department is asking the court to strike down the law. “This is a new DOJ, and we are taking steps to protect Americans,” said Bondi, with agents from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Administration lined up behind her. “Millions of illegal aliens with violent records have flooded into our communities, bringing violence and deadly drugs with them.” Bondi’s politically charged rhetoric, unusual for an institution that has historically been wary of aligning itself so directly with the White House, and the selection of legal targets raise fresh concerns that she could seek to use the agency’s law enforcement powers to go after the president’s adversaries. James, the New York attorney general, has drawn Trump’s ire by suing him, leading to a civil fraud judgment that stands to cost Trump nearly $500 million. James said in a statement that she’s prepared to defend the state’s laws, which she said “protect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe.” Bondi appeared alongside Tammy Nobles, whose 20-year-old daughter Kayla was killed in Aberdeen, Maryland, in July 2022 by someone from El Salvador who entered the country illegally months earlier in Texas. The assailant, then 16, was released to a first cousin to pursue asylum, which is common practice under U.S. law and policy. He had been accused by authorities in El Salvador of affiliation with the violent MS-13 gang, according to a report by Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee. To trumpet his immigration policies, Trump has often highlighted “angel moms” like Nobles, who lost their loved ones to violent crimes by people in the country illegally. “Tammy represents not only herself and her family but all of the great angel moms around this country who have suffered because of what the Biden administration did,” Bondi said. “And it’s over.” The lawsuit comes days after the Justice Department sued the city of Chicago, alleging that its “ sanctuary” laws were thwarting federal efforts to enforce immigration laws. In 2020, the Trump administration sought to pressure New York into changing its law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports. New York’s governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn’t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn’t prove legal residency in the U.S. The Trump administration ultimately restored New Yorkers’ access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight. _____ AP journalist Elliot Spagat in San Diego, Eric Tucker in Washington and Michael R.

    "title": "Judge Blocks Trump’s Executive Order Ending Federal Support For DEI Programs",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Friday largely blocked sweeping executive orders from President Donald Trump that seek to end government support for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion. U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore granted a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from terminating or changing federal contracts they consider equity-related. Abelson found that the orders likely carry constitutional violations, including against free-speech rights. Trump signed an order his first day in office directing federal agencies to terminate all “equity-related” grants or contracts. He signed a follow-up order requiring federal contractors to certify that they don’t promote DEI. The White House didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment Friday evening. The plaintiffs — including the city of Baltimore and higher education groups — sued the Trump administration earlier this month, arguing the executive orders are unconstitutional and a blatant overreach of presidential authority. They also allege the directives have a chilling effect on free speech. “What’s happening is an overcorrection and pulling back on DEI statements,” attorney Aleshadye Getachew said during a nearly three-hour hearing Wednesday. The Trump administration has argued that the president was targeting only DEI programs that violate federal civil rights laws. Attorneys for the government said the administration should be able to align federal spending with the president’s priorities. “The government doesn’t have the obligation to subsidize plaintiffs’ exercise of speech,” said Justice Department attorney Pardis Gheibi. Abelson, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, agreed with the plaintiffs that the executive orders discourage businesses, organizations and public entities from openly supporting diversity, equity and inclusion. “The harm arises from the issuance of it as a public, vague, threatening executive order,” he said during the hearing. Abelson’s ruling does allow for the attorney general to investigate and prepare a report on DEI practices in accordance with one of the orders, but it blocks enforcement. In his written opinion, Abelson found reason to believe the orders are unconstitutionally vague, leaving federal contractors and grant recipients with “no reasonable way to know what, if anything, they can do to bring their grants into compliance.” He described a hypothetical scenario where an elementary school received Department of Education funding for technology access and a teacher used a computer to teach about Jim Crow laws. Or if a road construction grant covered the cost of filling potholes in a low-income neighborhood instead of a wealthy neighborhood, “does that render it ‘equity-related’?” the judge asked. Efforts to increase diversity have been under attack for years by Republicans who contend the measures threaten merit-based hiring, promotion and educational opportunities for white people. However, supporters say the programs help institutions meet the needs of increasingly diverse populations while addressing the lasting impacts of systemic racism. Their purpose was to foster equitable environments in businesses and schools, especially for historically marginalized communities. Although researchers say DEI initiatives date back to the 1960s, more were launched and expanded in 2020 during increased calls for racial justice. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued in their complaint that Trump’s efforts to abruptly end such programs will cause widespread harm, not least because of the vague language in his executive orders. “Ordinary citizens bear the brunt,” they wrote. “Plaintiffs and their members receive federal funds to support educators, academics, students, workers, and communities across the country. As federal agencies make arbitrary decisions about whether grants are ‘equity-related,’ Plaintiffs are left in limbo.” The plaintiffs include the city of Baltimore, which receives federal funds for public safety, housing, the environment, infrastructure and more, according to the complaint. Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, who won reelection last year, has championed efforts to increase opportunities for the city’s most vulnerable residents, including people of color. Scott became the subject of racist attacks online last year as some commenters labeled him a “DEI mayor,” and he recently coined the phrase “Definitely Earned It” to highlight the accomplishments of Black figures throughout history.

    "title": "6 Restaurant Red Flags To Avoid On Valentine’s Day",
    "text": "Valentine’s Day is notoriously one of the worst days to dine out — ask any chef, and they’ll confirm — overpriced prix fixe menus, rushed service from overworked kitchen and front-of-house staff, and every couple in the city fighting for that coveted 7:30 p.m. reservation. It’s the perfect storm for a less-than-stellar dining experience. But despite its reputation, if you’re partnered up, there’s often pressure to make a night of it. If you can’t avoid eating out this Valentine’s Day, at least don’t have the worst meal of the year. Watch out for these six red flags before booking that table. And it’s not all doom and gloom; we’ve left you with a few tips to find the perfect spot for a memorable dinner, no lukewarm entrees or food poisoning involved. Special occasions call for special dishes — Champagne on New Year’s Eve, birthday cake for a celebration. But let’s be real: Your local chain doesn’t usually serve fresh oysters, and that sushi spot isn’t known for its chocolate-covered strawberries. Chris Atwood, chef, cooking instructor and co-founder of the Food Society in Atlanta, Georgia, warns that not all “special” Valentine’s Day menus are worth the hype. He said, “I’d caution diners to think critically about whether a restaurant can live up to what they’re promising. Do they usually handle high volume? Does the menu align with their specialty? If they don’t normally serve fresh lobster, is this really the place to order it?” And it’s not just the food — keep an eye on those “included” extras, especially alcohol. “I’d also be wary of a bottle of Champagne included in the cost of the menu,” Atwood added. “Some restaurants upcharge quite a bit just to then serve you cava or prosecco.” If your favorite Italian spot suddenly offers sushi and steak tartare, take it as a warning sign. Stick to restaurants that stay in their lane. Atmosphere (or vibes) is a key part of any dining experience, whether you’re after a cozy, candlelit table or a lively, bustling bar. But Ivan Beacco, chef and owner of Red Inside Catering in New York City, urges caution when a restaurant leans too hard into aesthetics. “Avoid anywhere that’s trying too hard,” he said. “The over-decorated spots with balloons, confetti and a violinist at every table? It’s a no from me. And if a place cares more about its Instagram feed than the food on the plate, that’s another red flag. You want a restaurant that prioritizes flavor over follower count.” “And buffets — do I even have to say it? Just don’t,” Beacco said. Buffets already have a lackluster reputation for food safety violations (cross-contamination and poor temperature control, to name two big ones). On a high-traffic night like Valentine’s Day, those risks only increase. Overworked and understaffed kitchens may struggle to maintain the rigorous standards needed to keep food fresh, hot and properly handled. The last thing you want on the most romantic night of the year? Battling your sweetheart for the bathroom thanks to food poisoning. This one might require research before you book, but it’s worth it. “Avoid any place packing in extra tables or seats,” Atwood said. “In practice, this means they’re trying to make as much money off the evening, and you might end up in an overcrowded and noisy room — with stressed-out staff and fellow diners.” If you don’t want to feel like your elbows are in your soup, it’s time for a deep dive, like you’re creeping your ex’s social media. Instead of focusing on recent reviews, check how the restaurant handled last year’s V-Day to see whether reviewers complained about tight seating. Browse social media for an idea of the space, or call ahead and ask if they’re adding extra tables for the night. If a restaurant is known for being cozy on a regular night, expect it to feel even more cramped on Valentine’s Day. Before you come for me in the comments, I love a chain restaurant. They’re affordable, predictable and reliable, whether I’m traveling or just need a quick bite. I’ll never turn down a great sandwich from Panera or the never-ending bread basket at Cheesecake Factory. But on Valentine’s Day? You might want to rethink it. According to Adrian Mills, executive chef at the Chase Sapphire Lounge in Dulles and Founder of the Cooking Collective, chains struggle to keep up with the holiday rush. “Staff are stretched thin trying to serve as many tables as possible, so guests get less attention. The kitchen is overwhelmed, making timely plating difficult. With high guest expectations and intense pressure, mistakes happen — leading to lower food quality and overall poor satisfaction.” While chains can be a great choice most nights, Valentine’s Day service often suffers under the strain. If you’re hoping for a smooth, memorable evening, consider a spot that can handle the pressure. French for “fixed price,” prix fixe is a set multi-course menu — often with limited or no choices for each course. Restaurants love offering them on holidays like Valentine’s Day because they streamline service and maximize profits. But for diners, they can be hit or miss. “Prix fixe menus can go either way,” Beacco said. “A good one? It’s thoughtfully curated, with dishes that show off the chef’s passion — almost like a love letter to the diners. But if it feels rushed or generic, like they’re just trying to turn tables faster, it’s better to pass. Look for menus that balance indulgence with variety — not too heavy, not too safe. And if dessert is just a sad chocolate lava cake … no, grazie!” To avoid disappointment, scan the menu ahead of time. If it looks uninspired — or overpriced for what’s being offered — you’re better off booking elsewhere. Not all Valentine’s Day dining is doomed! If you’re set on eating out, here are three tips for picking a restaurant to make the night special. Smaller neighborhood restaurants tend to offer a more intimate setting — and, as Atwood points out, they’re also more likely to add extra special touches and flourishes to make the evening memorable. Rather than fighting for a reservation at a buzzy, overcrowded spot, opt for a place you know and love, where the food is consistently great, and the service feels personal. Bonus: If you’re a regular, they might even surprise you with something extra. We get it — you want to celebrate on the 14th to soak in the day’s romance. But if you must, consider lunch (often a more affordable version of the dinner menu!) or snag an early bird time slot. Better yet, celebrate on the 13th or 15th to avoid the crowds and enjoy a more relaxed dining experience. If all else fails and you find yourself in a jam-packed restaurant at 7:30 p.m. on Feb. 14, a little kindness goes a long way. Be patient and polite, and remember that your server is likely juggling a hectic night.

    "text": "The Real Deal: We use deal trackers and commerce experience to sift through “fake” hike-and-drop deals and other deceptive sales tactics. Products will usually be rated at least 4 stars with a minimum 15% discount. (And when there’s an exception, we’ll tell you why.) HuffPost and its publishing partners may receive a commission from some purchases made via links on this page. Prices and availability are subject to change. In skin care, vitamin C is a valuable player. In fact, New York City-based board-certified dermatologist Dr. Bradley Glodny previously told HuffPost that after sunscreen and retinol, it’s the most helpful ingredient in defense against premature skin aging. But serums containing this powerful antioxidant are not always affordable. Some of the most famed preparations, such as iS Clinical’s Super Serum Advance and SkinCeuticals’ C E Ferulic acid serum, can cost upwards of $180. Fortunately for our skin (and our wallets), one of Amazon’s top-selling vitamin C serums is an affordable alternative that reviewers claim is just as effective as higher-end options. And right now, the larger 2-ounce size is 45% off its typical price of $38.99, selling for just $21.41! TruSkin’s vitamin C serum, which has a list price of $48.99 for a 2-ounce bottle, has over 97,000 five-star ratings and enough positive buyer testimonials to make a believer out of any skeptic. The nourishing formula promises a reduction in fine lines and sun damage, improvement in the appearance of skin conditions like melasma and an overall increase in skin brightness and radiance. These purported results are possible since, according to Glodny, vitamin C works to not only protect skin from external toxins and free radicals that cause premature skin aging, but it’s also clinically proven to enhance collagen production when applied topically. In addition to sodium ascorbyl phosphate — a less irritating form of topical vitamin C — this fast-absorbing serum is supplemented with ingredients including antioxidant-rich vitamin E, jojoba oil and botanical hyaluronic acid to support hydration. This natural, vegan and paraben-free serum can be used morning or night. “I spend A LOT of money on medical grade skin care, and I have found this vitamin C serum to be equally effective and beneficial for my skin, meaning I get the same benefits as higher priced products at an affordable price. Having tried multiple different brands of vitamin C serum, I can say that this one not only works well but doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Yes, I would recommend using this product, without any hesitation.” — Jae Vee ″[I’m] always a bit of a skeptic, after reading 139k positive reviews, I figured it was worth a try! I have some sun/aging spots on my right cheek mostly, of which I’ve been fairly self conscious. I’m in my mid fifties and these dime size spots just popped up about four years ago and got more pronounced in the last two years. I started using TruSkin C serum about three months ago and the spots have faded significantly. Also, my skin just looks fresher and slightly brighter. I highly recommend this product to anyone who’s considering it.” — heather “The results are unbelievable. [I] was a bit skeptical because all the reviews were from Caucasian women. I was slightly worried that my skin would not respond as well but I was quite mistaken. With or without makeup, my skin is bright, smooth and my spots are disappearing. One other result I am sure a number of people have not noticed is that your palms get softer too. I guess the residue on the palms makes [them] soft and supple.” — Mayowa O. “I love my vitamin C serum! I have been using it for a month now and have already noticed an improvement in my skin tone and some of the fine lines on my face. The serum dries super quick and does not leave skin feeling slimy or greasy. I would highly recommend this product. The customer service is some of the best I have ever experienced.

    "title": "If You Notice This 1 Thing On Your Walls, Your Home Could Be In Immediate Danger",
    "text": "Homes are living, breathing structures that age like we do, and we all encounter cracks appearing inside of them over time. The trick is learning the difference between when you can relax and when you should worry about whether a wall crack is a warning sign of your home having structural damage ― and in worst cases, being on the brink of collapse. HuffPost talked with home experts who see wall cracks all the time for their job to share their tips on which types of crack you should take action upon ASAP. Drywall is a common construction material for walls, and if you have a hairline crack on one of these walls, “it’s usually nothing to worry about,” said Katie Whitaker, licensed home inspector and owner of Handyma’am Home Inspections. These cracks are usually no wider than a credit card, and they typically run in relatively clean lines that should look like they “followed a seam,” Whitaker said. “If you have what looks like a clean break or crack, then it’s probably just a bad tape and mud job” that happened from not enough mud being used or products not setting properly when the drywall was getting made, they explained. If you live in a New York City apartment where your landlord can suddenly blast the heat, for example, Whitaker said you’ll usually notice a hairline crack in your drywall after a drastic temperature change. And if you’re curious whether your wall is drywall, knock on it with your fist. If it has a hollow thunking sound, that is drywall. Whitaker advised: “When you knock on plaster, it’s going to sound more solid.” You can relax about some drywall cracks, but you should pay closer attention to a horizontal crack or a diagonal drywall crack that changes directions, Whitaker said. A big horizontal crack, in general, does not necessarily mean your home is going to collapse soon, but it does indicate “that something is not properly supported and pressure isn’t being distributed evenly,” Whitaker said. If horizontal cracks happen in drywall, “Those can indicate that there’s a structural problem, because that’s not how a drywall seam would be placed,” they said. “You should definitely have them assessed by a professional, especially if they’re getting larger, or if you’ve noticed other things like a sloping floor, or your doors and windows aren’t opening and closing.” If your doors and windows are suddenly harder to open in a room with a crack, that could be a sign that your foundation or the framing members that support your doors are moving, Whitaker said. What Whitaker stressed is to pay attention to other changing factors in your home in addition to the crack that can signal your issue is getting worse. They gave the timeline of noticing a crack, then noticing the crack is growing quickly, and then seeing a slope in a floor that was not there before, as an example. If “you have two or more factors, it’s time to get it looked at,” Whitaker said. When you want to check on a concerning wall crack, you can often first start with a home repair person or general contractor you trust. A handyperson can tell you, “‘We can repair that no problem,’ or ‘Hey, that crack is worrisome,’” Whitaker said. Be prepared to share the history of the crack and if you have had any leaks recently, or if this crack has appeared in other areas. From there, this home repair person can “point you in the right direction” of what you should do next, Whitaker said. Whether you have a concrete-slab foundation or a crawl-space foundation for your house, cracks that appear here can also be troubling signs of structural issues. Your foundation wall is “where they dig down into the earth and they pour the actual foundation, which is that wall, because when it’s down in the earth below the frost line...the earth around it is what holds that house and that foundation in place,” said Oklahoma City-based home inspector Melissa Coon. If you do see a crack in visible parts of your foundation wall such as in your basement, and that crack is horizontal, or V-shaped, or actively getting worse, that may be a time to do an emergency call. A V-shaped crack that is bigger on one side indicates there is uneven pressure, Whitaker said. Seeing horizontal cracks in your foundation wall is “usually a really good indication that you’re going to have some severe structural problems,” Coon said. “Go ahead and call a structural engineer at that point,” Whitaker said in these scenarios. It’s a structural engineer’s job to “go over the integrity of the home to make sure it’s not in a really compromised condition,” Coon explained.

    "title": "Wall Street Journal Warns Of Donald Trump’s ‘Sellout’ Of Ukraine With A Scathing Reality Check",
    "text": "The conservative Wall Street Journal continued taking swipes at Donald Trump this week with two editorials, published in as many days, that called out the U.S. president’s purported bid to end Russia’s war on Ukraine. On Tuesday, the newspaper’s editorial board called out what it described as “the looming rehabilitation” of Russian President Vladimir Putin, facilitated by Trump, as negotiations to end the conflict, which Putin began with the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, start between U.S. and Russian officials in Saudi Arabia. Ukrainian officials were notably not invited to participate in the meeting to decide their fate. The Journal reminded readers of just some of the horrors of Putin’s brutal campaign in Ukraine — such as the killing or maiming of hundreds of thousands of people, the targeting of civilian homes, and the kidnapping of Ukrainian-born children. It contrasted all that, and more, with Trump’s talk about inviting Putin to America. “We realize that the ruthless men who rule much of the world can’t be ignored. But usually, those men aren’t rewarded with a visit to the U.S., as Mr. Trump hinted last week before they’ve made any compromises,” said the board. “Any peace Mr. Putin strikes has to be made with all of his legacy of destruction in mind,” it concluded. Read the full essay here. On Wednesday, meanwhile, the newspaper’s board warned how Trump is tilting “toward a Ukraine sellout” with his “rhetorical assault” on the country and its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with the false claim that Ukraine started the war and that Zelenskyy is a “dictator.” “Last week Mr. Trump said Ukraine can’t join NATO and must give up much of its territory to Russia—concessions to Mr. Putin with nothing in return,” it wrote.

    "title": "Washington Post Columnist Slams Trump As ‘The Real Threat’ After Bezos’ Op-Ed Overhaul",
    "text": "In a blistering op-ed, President Donald Trump was slammed as “the real threat” to “personal liberties and free markets” by a Washington Post columnist after the paper’s owner, Jeff Bezos, said the publication would reject any content that opposes these two principles in its opinion section. “If we as a newspaper, and we as a country, are to defend his twin pillars, then we must redouble our fight against the single greatest threat to ‘personal liberties and free markets’ in the United States today: President Donald Trump,” wrote Dana Milbank in an op-ed published Friday. “The rapidly spreading authoritarianism coming from this administration threatens all of our freedoms.” Milbank elaborated by dissecting Trump’s trade wars, his challenges to legal immigration, his politicizing of law enforcement and the military, and his cherry-picking of which media outlets receive White House access as a few examples of the president’s violation of Bezos’ protected “pillars.” “The consequences of Trump’s illiberal actions can already be seen. Inflation has accelerated. Jobless claims jumped more than expected. Consumer confidence has slid. The stock market has been volatile. Trump’s approval numbers have inched downward,” wrote Milbank. Bezos, in announcing his overhaul of The Post’s opinion section in a letter to the paper’s staff, argued that the themes of personal liberties and free markets “are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion” and that a “broad-based opinion section” is no longer needed since diversifying viewpoints can be found elsewhere on the web. His directive led The Post’s opinion editor, David Shipley, to resign. Bezos and Trump reportedly had dinner together mere hours after Bezos announced the changes at The Post. Since purchasing the paper in 2013, the billionaire Trump donor and Amazon founder has drummed up controversy over his editorial decisions. Last October, Bezos ended The Post’s tradition of endorsing presidential candidates, and last month, opinion cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after one of her cartoons critical of Bezos was killed. Journalist Gene Weingarten, who spent two decades as a Post columnist, said in a Substack post Thursday that he’s heard of at least one Post writer having their work rejected in the wake of Bezo’s announcement this week. Post media critic Erik Wemple had told colleagues that he would write about Bezos’ order, which Weingarten said is part of his job. But according to some Post staffers, Wemple’s finished column was rejected for publication, Weingarten wrote. Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

    "title": "What's The Deal With Packaged, Store-Bought Guacamole?",
    "text": "No matter what your specific guacamole preferences are, this is a judgment-free zone. Though sometimes the internet freaks out about it (remember when The New York Times put peas in its guac? Or when Antoni Porowski made it with Greek yogurt on “Queer Eye”?), you have the right to feel however you want about guacamole. Your homemade recipe with that one secret ingredient (we know it’s Worcestershire, by the way) is absolutely perfect. The spice mix you buy to make it taste “real” is also just fine, so go you. And that packaged pouch of pre-made stuff from the grocery store is entirely acceptable, so hold your head high in the checkout line. Chances are, you’ve been doing guacamole “your way” for so long you’ve forgotten other options exist. Here’s an opportunity to learn from the pros, open your mind and find out exactly what’s going on in the big, wide world of your favorite dip. In a perfect world, everyone would be inclined and able to make their own guacamole and enjoy it right away. You’d have the right number of perfectly ripe avocados on hand. You’d have the time and space for a bit of cutting and mashing. And you’d be able to serve your creation immediately, before polyphenol oxidase causes browning. How, exactly, does “perfect” guacamole come to be? There are just a few things to keep in mind, according to experts. “The first step to great guac is choosing an avocado that gives to a gentle touch,” chef Andrew Hunter told HuffPost. He’s head of culinary R&D for Wolfgang Puck Worldwide, executive chef for Niman Ranch and global development chef for Kikkoman. His rule: “You want the fruit to be about as soft as the soft side of your thumb.” Next, there comes the matter of what to do with that perfectly ripe avocado. Most chefs will tell you this is a dish that doesn’t need to get overly complicated. “I love my guacamole chunky and I like to prepare it very simply,” Mexican chef Pati Jinich told HuffPost. Her new cookbook, “Treasures of the Mexican Table,” will be published this fall. “I use ripe Mexican avocados, a little bit of chopped white onion or scallion, fresh cilantro, chopped jalapeño or serrano chile, a squeeze of lime juice and salt. That’s it. Of course, that being said, I sometimes like to play with toppings such as chipotles in adobo, fresh corn, mango or chiles toreados.” (Here are her recipes for chunky guacamole and smoky guacamole.) With guacamole, as with most of life, timing is everything. Hunter is hard-core for the à la minute approach. “If you’re bringing guac to a picnic or party, bring whole avocados, a bowl and a potato masher with you. Your friends will appreciate your dedication,” he said. Even if you’re a die-hard “make it myself” type, you occasionally might want a boost from prepared, ready-to-go guacamole. There are pre-diced and pre-mashed products on the market, many of which position themselves as a way to reduce food waste. “Nearly 70% of avocado users throw away all or part of an avocado because it’s unusable,” Wholly Guacamole, which sells diced, halved and smashed avocados, notes on its website. As easy as chefs make the process seem, some folks like a product that promises to give a boost of confidence, especially when it comes with the imprimatur of a chef like Rick Bayless, who founded Frontera Foods. That’s true for Sandra Wright, a retired customer insights researcher who lives in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. “Here’s my true confession,” she told HuffPost. “I used to make guacamole from scratch, but one day when I was in a hurry, I tried the Frontera Foods guacamole mix. My family loved it and I haven’t looked back since.” (Editor’s note: It’s a seasoning mix that you mash with your own fresh avocados.) First, you should realize there’s a difference between the freshly packed containers of guacamole that you find at the prepared foods section of, say, Whole Foods, and the vacuum-sealed containers that you’ll find in the refrigerated aisle. First, let’s start with the more processed of the two options. High pressure technology (HPT) is the manufacturing process that allows those mass-produced green pouches and tubs of guacamole to find their way to grocery stores nationwide. Also known as high pressure processing (HPP), it’s an all-natural, U.S. Department of Agriculture-approved process that uses high water pressure to extend product life without added preservatives. “It applies pressure that makes microorganisms and enzymes inactive,” Hunter explained. “The idea dates back to our old friend Blaise Pascal, a 17th-century French scientist responsible for Pascal’s principle of pressure, but I think even Pascal would marvel at the technology we use today. The high pressure deactivates bad guys like listeria, salmonella and E. coli, and nutritional and sensory benefits remain intact.” Here’s a video from an HPP manufacturer, showing the process in action. Wholly Guacamole, processed with HPT, has been America’s top-selling branded guacamole for 10 consecutive years. It’s the brand of choice for Houston-based yoga teacher Myra Rucker, who is generally open to the idea of guacamole that’s been made for her. “It’s nice to have options,” she told HuffPost. “First, I like my guacamole with a certain level of spice, and I know I’ll get a consistent taste every time. Then there’s the fact that I don’t always have a ripe avocado on hand, and I might not be up for making a mess in the kitchen, either.” If you’re a ride-or-die proponent of freshly made guac, you might turn up your nose at the idea of pressure pounding away at your beloved avocados. But it’s a solution that works for many folks. Case in point: Sales of refrigerated guacamole dips totaled about $585 million in the United States in 2020. Your local market probably has several choices of pre-made guacamole that come from local vendors. In some areas, those products have become so popular that locals are happy to abandon their own homemade recipes. In Toronto, Mad Mexican, founded by chef Jose “Pepe” Hadad, has achieved legendary status in its 17-year history. Born in Mexico City, Hadad moved to Toronto for culinary school and never left. His empire began with a card table for guacamole sales outside a store in the St. Lawrence Market. Now, he owns a restaurant and has expanded his product lineup to include fresh guacamole, salsa, pico de gallo, artisan nacho chips and organic tortillas. “Every day we are making what we’re going to sell tomorrow,” Hadad told HuffPost. “I know we aren’t converting people who will always want to make it themselves, but we are converting people who might be buying another brand and convincing them to buy from us. It’s OK to buy a package of guacamole, because sometimes you just cannot deal with another thing in your life.” How does his product avoid browning? He says there are some secrets he won’t reveal, but did say this: “We use lots and lots of fresh lemon juice — not from bottles, but from lemons we squeeze ourselves. And our packaging seals out all the air, so it will stay fresh for about two weeks.” The message here: Relax. It’s a big green world, and there are plenty of ways to switch up your guacamole game.

    "title": "'Disgusting': Trump White House Slammed Over 'Extremely Psychopathic' Migrant Video",
    "text": "President Donald Trump’s White House social media team is coming under fire for a dehumanizing social media post that shows immigrants in chains being deported along with audio of the shackles and aircraft. The caption read: “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight.” ASMR, or autonomous sensory meridian response, are sounds designed to provoke a pleasing and tingly or goosebump-like skin sensation in some people. It’s not clear who at the White House is responsible for the account or tweeted the message, but critics said using audio of migrant deportees for ASMR was beyond the pale. They fired back on social media: This is not a joke. Unconscionable. https://t.co/IhWhCaD4Bh We are better than this... https://t.co/DgTx0Pn1uF This is disgusting and really disturbing. Coming from the official WH account. Again, this is where we are now. This is what some folks signed up for. https://t.co/llwUTgjbI3 I don’t care what side of the aisle you’re on or who you voted for - I think we can all agree this is *extremely* psychopathic shit. https://t.co/SyxnlrWpnK If anything about treating human beings like this appeals to you I’d ask that you never associate with me again in any way. I’ll defend your right to live freely and say what you want but I don’t want to know you. This is as grotesque a tweet as I’ve ever seen https://t.co/mqzgxRDs2N This feels really facist The chaining of undocumented migrants as they board deportation flights by the United States government is a blatant violation of human dignity and fundamental human rights. This degrading treatment, which likens migrants to violent criminals, is not only unnecessary but also… https://t.co/Dt37bmINW0 ASMR? Whomever decided to post this is truly a sick individual. Anyone know who signed off on this? This is not dignified. This might be the most disgusting thing I've seen tweeted so far by this administration, and that's saying a lot. https://t.co/vVWC5nr2hS What strikes me most about the Trump administration isn't just the abject cruelty of its policies, but the way the whole thing is treated as a meme. This is real life, not a comedy. These are real people they're making a spectacle of https://t.co/cofZVwDhV8 This is an affront to basic human dignity. All people deserve to be treated with respect, even in trying circumstances. This video is a disgrace to the American spirit. https://t.co/UOMZp8sp4X Why is treating human beings this way entertainment for you? It is beyond depressing that we live in a world where so many people find this funny and/or entertaining.This is heinous, disgusting, and vile… And worse, coming from the official White House account? It’s depraved and performative. This administration is a fucking joke. https://t.co/5pPBf4Y1ga This – from the literal White House account – is by far the most casually cruel piece of content I have seen in my life. Cursed beyond words. There is no way back. https://t.co/EYAnBWf5G3 This is the most dystopian, disgusting, deplorable and downright shameful post I could ever imagine coming from the OFFICIAL WHITE HOUSE ACCOUNT. We are going backwards with dangerous speed. Fuck everything about this, and fuck you if you’re cool with this. https://t.co/ODidmVQzqL We’ve seen a lot of vile and shocking stuff from the Trump administration over the years, but watching this video and seeing that it was tweeted out by the official White House account is a whole new level of depravity https://t.co/lJtS1KKpLZ Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

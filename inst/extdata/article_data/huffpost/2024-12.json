    "text": "Age disparities between generations can create the false sense that you don’t have anything in common, that your differences are too great and that gift-giving come holiday season is an impossible feat. In reality, the years between you don’t matter when you want to show someone important in your life that you care — and finding a meaningful gift can be great way to do it. If you’re on the hunt for such a gift, but need some nudging in the right direction, we’ve compiled some helpful suggestions for items and gestures that can help a grandparent, parent or older family friend stay connected with those they love, bridge the technology gap or just find a little everyday comfort.
